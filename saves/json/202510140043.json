However, due to the substantial cost and time\nrequired to construct fusion reactors and run physical experiments, numerical\nexperiments are indispensable for understanding plasma physics inside tokamaks,\nsupporting the design and engineering phase, and optimizing future reactor\ndesigns. Geometric multigrid methods are optimal solvers for many problems that\narise from the discretization of partial differential equations. It has been\nshown that the multigrid solver GMGPolar solves the 2D gyrokinetic Poisson\nequation in linear complexity and with only small memory requirements compared\nto other state-of-the-art solvers. In this paper, we present a completely\nrefactored and object-oriented version of GMGPolar which offers two different\nmatrix-free implementations. Among other things, we leverage the\nSherman-Morrison formula to solve cyclic tridiagonal systems from circular line\nsolvers without additional fill-in and we apply reordering to optimize cache\naccess of circular and radial smoothing operations. With the Give approach,\nmemory requirements are further reduced and speedups of four to seven are\nobtained for usual test cases. For the Take approach, speedups of 16 to 18 can\nbe attained. In an additionally experimental setup of using GMGPolar as a\npreconditioner for conjugate gradients, this speedup could even be increased to\nfactors between 25 and 37.",

However, due to the substantial cost and time\nrequired to construct fusion reactors and run physical experiments, numerical\nexperiments are indispensable for understanding plasma physics inside tokamaks,\nsupporting the design and engineering phase, and optimizing future reactor\ndesigns. Geometric multigrid methods are optimal solvers for many problems that\narise from the discretization of partial differential equations. It has been\nshown that the multigrid solver GMGPolar solves the 2D gyrokinetic Poisson\nequation in linear complexity and with only small memory requirements compared\nto other state-of-the-art solvers. In this paper, we present a completely\nrefactored and object-oriented version of GMGPolar which offers two different\nmatrix-free implementations. Among other things, we leverage the\nSherman-Morrison formula to solve cyclic tridiagonal systems from circular line\nsolvers without additional fill-in and we apply reordering to optimize cache\naccess of circular and radial smoothing operations. With the Give approach,\nmemory requirements are further reduced and speedups of four to seven are\nobtained for usual test cases. For the Take approach, speedups of 16 to 18 can\nbe attained. In an additionally experimental setup of using GMGPolar as a\npreconditioner for conjugate gradients, this speedup could even be increased to\nfactors between 25 and 37."

Specifically, the\ncache mechanism for bidirectional attention in dLLMs demands large memory\nfootprint, restricting their ability to handle long contexts under\nresource-limited settings. Existing cache eviction strategies are designed for\nARMs and ignore the unique characteristics of dLLMs, thus leading to\nunsatisfactory performance. To address these challenges, we introduce MaskKV, a\ntraining-free cache eviction framework tailored to dLLMs, focusing on the\neffect of mask tokens in dLLMs. MaskKV is built on two key innovations: (1) a\nmask-query guided scoring mechanism that leverages attention weights to\nidentify and evict less critical prompt tokens for each head; (2) an adaptive\ncache budgeting strategy that improves efficiency by reducing allocation in\nintermediate layers and concentrating resources on prompt-preferring heads. On\nLLaDA with MaskKV, compressing the KV cache to only 256 pairs (less than 5% of\ntokens) retains 94% of the full-cache performance on LongBench and achieves up\nto 31x acceleration at 32k prompt length.

Current context compression methods predominantly rely on\nautoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress\ncontextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to\nacquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a\nfundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge\nfrom actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial\nfor real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel\nmethod that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture\nthat is equipped with this compression capability \\textit{a priori}. Instead of\ntraining models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly\nselects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates\ncontextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving\nrepresentations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need\nfor autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly\nleveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor\nembeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2)\nbidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture\ninformation from the entire context. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC\nconsistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various\ncompression ratios.

For caching, PolicySmith discovers heuristics\nthat outperform established baselines on standard open-source traces. For\ncongestion control, we show that PolicySmith can generate safe policies that\nintegrate directly into the Linux kernel."

These interesting observations motivate us to propose\nFrequency-aware Caching (FreqCa)\n  which directly reuses features of low-frequency components based on their\nsimilarity, while using a second-order Hermite interpolator to predict the\nvolatile high-frequency ones based on its continuity.\n  Besides, we further propose to cache Cumulative Residual Feature (CRF)\ninstead of the features in all the layers, which reduces the memory footprint\nof feature caching by 99%.\n  Extensive experiments on FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, Qwen-Image, and\nQwen-Image-Edit demonstrate its effectiveness in both generation and editing.\nCodes are available in the supplementary materials and will be released on\nGitHub."

We propose FMCache, an in-switch\nfile-system metadata caching framework that leverages programmable switches to\nserve file-system metadata requests from multiple clients directly in the\nswitch data plane. Unlike prior in-switch key-value caching approaches, FMCache\naddresses file-system-specific path dependencies under stringent switch\nresource constraints. We implement FMCache atop Hadoop HDFS and evaluate it on\na Tofino-switch testbed using real-world file-system metadata workloads.\nFMCache achieves up to 181.6% higher throughput than vanilla HDFS and\ncomplements client-side caching with additional throughput gains of up to\n139.6%. It also incurs low latencies and limited switch resource usage.",

We propose FMCache, an in-switch\nfile-system metadata caching framework that leverages programmable switches to\nserve file-system metadata requests from multiple clients directly in the\nswitch data plane. Unlike prior in-switch key-value caching approaches, FMCache\naddresses file-system-specific path dependencies under stringent switch\nresource constraints. We implement FMCache atop Hadoop HDFS and evaluate it on\na Tofino-switch testbed using real-world file-system metadata workloads.\nFMCache achieves up to 181.6% higher throughput than vanilla HDFS and\ncomplements client-side caching with additional throughput gains of up to\n139.6%. It also incurs low latencies and limited switch resource usage."

In this paper, we propose Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache\nSelection (TokenSelect), a training-free method for efficient and accurate\nlong-context inference. TokenSelect builds upon the observation of\nnon-contiguous attention sparsity, using QK dot products to measure per-head KV\nCache criticality at token-level. By per-head soft voting mechanism,\nTokenSelect selectively involves a few critical KV cache tokens in attention\ncalculation without sacrificing accuracy. To further accelerate TokenSelect, we\ndesign the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query\nsimilarity and implemented the efficient Paged Dot Product Kernel,\nsignificantly reducing the selection overhead. A comprehensive evaluation of\nTokenSelect demonstrates up to $23.84\\times$ speedup in attention computation\nand up to $2.28\\times$ acceleration in end-to-end latency, while providing\nsuperior performance compared to state-of-the-art long-context inference\nmethods.",

We also developed a lightweight,\nstable training framework using a Bradley-Terry ranking-based loss, enabling\noptimization of the non-linear hashing module on GPUs with 16GB memory in 8\nhours. Experimental results show that Spotlight Attention drastically improves\nretrieval precision while shortening the length of the hash code at least\n5$\\times$ compared to traditional linear hashing. Finally, we exploit the\ncomputational advantages of bitwise operations by implementing specialized CUDA\nkernels, achieving hashing retrieval for 512K tokens in under 100$\\mu$s on a\nsingle A100 GPU, with end-to-end throughput up to 3$\\times$ higher than vanilla\ndecoding."

Through collaboration with the National Football League (NFL), we\ndemonstrate how a generative-AI based workflow enables media researchers and\nanalysts to query relevant historical plays using natural language rather than\ntraditional filter-and-click interfaces. The agentic workflow takes a user\nquery as input, breaks it into elements, and translates them into the\nunderlying database query language. Accuracy and latency are further improved\nthrough carefully designed semantic caching. The solution achieves over 95\npercent accuracy and reduces the average time to find relevant videos from 10\nminutes to 30 seconds, significantly increasing the NFL's operational\nefficiency and allowing users to focus on producing creative content and\nengaging storylines.",

Through collaboration with the National Football League (NFL), we\ndemonstrate how a generative-AI based workflow enables media researchers and\nanalysts to query relevant historical plays using natural language rather than\ntraditional filter-and-click interfaces. The agentic workflow takes a user\nquery as input, breaks it into elements, and translates them into the\nunderlying database query language. Accuracy and latency are further improved\nthrough carefully designed semantic caching. The solution achieves over 95\npercent accuracy and reduces the average time to find relevant videos from 10\nminutes to 30 seconds, significantly increasing the NFL's operational\nefficiency and allowing users to focus on producing creative content and\nengaging storylines."

Devices irradiated with 1 MeV\nneutrons at a high fluence of 1E15 n/cm^2 exhibited substantial degradation,\nincluding a drastic reduction in on-current and an increase in on-resistance.\nElectrothermal testing, conducted through simultaneous current-voltage (J-V)\nmeasurements and thermal annealing, resulted in significant recovery. After\nfour cycles of electro-thermal testing, the devices demonstrated significant\nimprovements in performance, with a substantial recovery of on-current and a\nreduction in on-resistance compared to the post-radiation condition,\napproaching pre-radiation levels. Most recovery occurred during the first two\ncycles, with diminishing improvements in later cycles, indicating that most\nthermally recoverable traps were mitigated early. Capacitance-voltage (C-V)\nmeasurements revealed a substantial reduction in carrier concentration,\ndecreasing from 3.2E16 cm^-3 pre-radiation to 5.5E15 cm^-3 after the first\nelectro-thermal testing cycle, indicating an over 82% reduction. Following the\nthird cycle, the carrier concentration partially recovered to 9.9E15 cm^-3,\nreflecting a carrier removal rate of ~22 cm^-1. The breakdown voltage exhibited\na remarkable enhancement, increasing from approximately 300 V to 1.28 kV (a\n~325% improvement) after the first electro-thermal testing, attributed to the\nreduction in carrier concentration by compensating radiation-induced traps.\nSubsequent testing reduced breakdown voltage slightly to 940 V due to partial\nrecovery of carrier concentration, but it remained significantly higher than\npre-radiation levels, highlighting the promise of $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ power\ndevices for high-power applications in radiation-intense environments.",

However, one major limitation of\nattention score as a token-wise importance metrics is that it lacks the\ninformation about contribution of tokens to the attention output. In this\npaper, we propose a simple eviction criterion based on the contribution of\ncached tokens to attention outputs. Our method, CAOTE, optimizes for eviction\nerror due to token eviction, by seamlessly integrating attention scores and\nvalue vectors. This is the first method which uses value tokens on top of\nattention-based eviction scores in closed-form. Additionally, CAOTE can act as\na meta-heuristic method with flexible usage with any token eviction method.

Any time an AI model\nis invoked to interact with a human, interface with another algorithm, or act\nindependently, a MedLog record is created. This record consists of nine core\nfields: header, model, user, target, inputs, artifacts, outputs, outcomes, and\nfeedback, providing a structured and consistent record of model activity. To\nencourage early adoption, especially in low-resource settings, and minimize the\ndata footprint, MedLog supports risk-based sampling, lifecycle-aware retention\npolicies, and write-behind caching; detailed traces for complex, agentic, or\nmulti-stage workflows can also be captured under MedLog. MedLog can catalyze\nthe development of new databases and software to store and analyze MedLog\nrecords. Realizing this vision would enable continuous surveillance, auditing,\nand iterative improvement of medical AI, laying the foundation for a new form\nof digital epidemiology."

It further outperforms the text\ncommunication paradigm by approximately 3.0-5.0%, while delivering an average\n2.0x speedup in latency. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/thu-nics/C2C."

We\nformulate adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem, where final predictions\nare generated by fusing the initial VLM output with a cache-based prediction.\nThis cache-based prediction combines a dynamically updated likelihood\n(measuring feature and scale similarity) and a prior (reflecting the evolving\nclass distribution). This dual-adaptation mechanism, coupled with\nuncertainty-guided fusion, enables BCA+ to correct both the model's semantic\nunderstanding and its contextual confidence. As a training-free method\nrequiring no backpropagation, BCA+ is highly efficient. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition\nand detection benchmarks."

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) require significant GPU memory when processing\nlong texts, with the key value (KV) cache consuming up to 70\\% of total memory\nduring inference. Although existing compression methods reduce memory by\nevaluating the importance of individual tokens, they overlook critical semantic\nrelationships between tokens, resulting in fragmented context and degraded\nperformance. We introduce ChunkKV, which fundamentally reimagines KV cache\ncompression by treating semantic chunks - rather than isolated tokens - as\nbasic compression units. This approach preserves complete linguistic structures\nand contextual integrity, ensuring that essential meaning is retained even\nunder aggressive compression. Our innovation includes a novel layer-wise index\nreuse technique that exploits the higher cross-layer similarity of preserved\nindices in ChunkKV, reducing computational overhead and improving throughput by\n26.5\\%. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks: LongBench,\nNeedle-In-A-HayStack, GSM8K, and JailbreakV demonstrate that ChunkKV\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 8.7\\% in precision while\nmaintaining the same compression ratio. These results confirm that\nsemantic-aware compression significantly enhances both efficiency and\nperformance for long-context LLM inference, providing a simple yet effective\nsolution to the memory bottleneck problem.

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) require significant GPU memory when processing\nlong texts, with the key value (KV) cache consuming up to 70\\% of total memory\nduring inference. Although existing compression methods reduce memory by\nevaluating the importance of individual tokens, they overlook critical semantic\nrelationships between tokens, resulting in fragmented context and degraded\nperformance. We introduce ChunkKV, which fundamentally reimagines KV cache\ncompression by treating semantic chunks - rather than isolated tokens - as\nbasic compression units. This approach preserves complete linguistic structures\nand contextual integrity, ensuring that essential meaning is retained even\nunder aggressive compression. Our innovation includes a novel layer-wise index\nreuse technique that exploits the higher cross-layer similarity of preserved\nindices in ChunkKV, reducing computational overhead and improving throughput by\n26.5\\%. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks: LongBench,\nNeedle-In-A-HayStack, GSM8K, and JailbreakV demonstrate that ChunkKV\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 8.7\\% in precision while\nmaintaining the same compression ratio. These results confirm that\nsemantic-aware compression significantly enhances both efficiency and\nperformance for long-context LLM inference, providing a simple yet effective\nsolution to the memory bottleneck problem.

                "summary": "Real-world videos often extend over thousands of frames. Existing video\nsuper-resolution (VSR) approaches, however, face two persistent challenges when\nprocessing long sequences: (1) inefficiency due to the heavy cost of multi-step\ndenoising for full-length sequences; and (2) poor scalability hindered by\ntemporal decomposition that causes artifacts and discontinuities. To break\nthese limits, we propose InfVSR, which novelly reformulates VSR as an\nautoregressive-one-step-diffusion paradigm. This enables streaming inference\nwhile fully leveraging pre-trained video diffusion priors. First, we adapt the\npre-trained DiT into a causal structure, maintaining both local and global\ncoherence via rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance. Second, we distill\nthe diffusion process into a single step efficiently, with patch-wise pixel\nsupervision and cross-chunk distribution matching.

                    "value": "Real-world videos often extend over thousands of frames. Existing video\nsuper-resolution (VSR) approaches, however, face two persistent challenges when\nprocessing long sequences: (1) inefficiency due to the heavy cost of multi-step\ndenoising for full-length sequences; and (2) poor scalability hindered by\ntemporal decomposition that causes artifacts and discontinuities. To break\nthese limits, we propose InfVSR, which novelly reformulates VSR as an\nautoregressive-one-step-diffusion paradigm. This enables streaming inference\nwhile fully leveraging pre-trained video diffusion priors. First, we adapt the\npre-trained DiT into a causal structure, maintaining both local and global\ncoherence via rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance. Second, we distill\nthe diffusion process into a single step efficiently, with patch-wise pixel\nsupervision and cross-chunk distribution matching.

Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill,\nGPT-OSS, and NVIDIA AceReason across mathematics and coding benchmarks show\nthat ThinKV achieves near-lossless accuracy with less than 5% of the original\nKV cache, while improving performance with up to 5.8x higher inference\nthroughput over state-of-the-art baselines."

We report integration of our\nclinical assistant into a large-scale national interhospital platform, with\nmore than 55,000 content-rich user dialogues completed within the two months of\ndeployment, 2,500 of which were expert-annotated for subsequent validation. The\nvalidation results show that CLARITY surpasses human-level performance in terms\nof the first-attempt routing precision, naturally requiring up to 3 times\nshorter duration of the consultation than with a human."

In this work, we\nintroduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective\ninference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through\nfinetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples,\nP-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances\nand systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction\nprompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory\ncontexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data.\nAcross a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and\nGPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive\nbaselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of\n+26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B);\nP-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and\n+3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better\nperformance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond.

Given a task, the\ntypical AI-driven approach is (i) to generate a set of diverse solutions, and\nthen (ii) to verify these solutions and select one that solves the problem.\nCrucially, this approach assumes the existence of a reliable verifier, i.e.,\none that can accurately determine whether a solution solves the given problem.\nWe argue that systems research, long focused on designing and evaluating new\nperformance-oriented algorithms, is particularly well-suited for AI-driven\nsolution discovery. This is because system performance problems naturally admit\nreliable verifiers: solutions are typically implemented in real systems or\nsimulators, and verification reduces to running these software artifacts\nagainst predefined workloads and measuring performance. We term this approach\nas AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS), which iteratively generates,\nevaluates, and refines solutions. Using penEvolve, an existing open-source ADRS\ninstance, we present case studies across diverse domains, including load\nbalancing for multi-region cloud scheduling, Mixture-of-Experts inference,\nLLM-based SQL queries, and transaction scheduling. In multiple instances, ADRS\ndiscovers algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art human designs (e.g.,\nachieving up to 5.0x runtime improvements or 50% cost reductions). We distill\nbest practices for guiding algorithm evolution, from prompt design to evaluator\nconstruction, for existing frameworks. We then discuss the broader implications\nfor the systems community: as AI assumes a central role in algorithm design, we\nargue that human researchers will increasingly focus on problem formulation and\nstrategic guidance. Our results highlight both the disruptive potential and the\nurgent need to adapt systems research practices in the age of AI.",

Given a task, the\ntypical AI-driven approach is (i) to generate a set of diverse solutions, and\nthen (ii) to verify these solutions and select one that solves the problem.\nCrucially, this approach assumes the existence of a reliable verifier, i.e.,\none that can accurately determine whether a solution solves the given problem.\nWe argue that systems research, long focused on designing and evaluating new\nperformance-oriented algorithms, is particularly well-suited for AI-driven\nsolution discovery. This is because system performance problems naturally admit\nreliable verifiers: solutions are typically implemented in real systems or\nsimulators, and verification reduces to running these software artifacts\nagainst predefined workloads and measuring performance. We term this approach\nas AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS), which iteratively generates,\nevaluates, and refines solutions. Using penEvolve, an existing open-source ADRS\ninstance, we present case studies across diverse domains, including load\nbalancing for multi-region cloud scheduling, Mixture-of-Experts inference,\nLLM-based SQL queries, and transaction scheduling. In multiple instances, ADRS\ndiscovers algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art human designs (e.g.,\nachieving up to 5.0x runtime improvements or 50% cost reductions). We distill\nbest practices for guiding algorithm evolution, from prompt design to evaluator\nconstruction, for existing frameworks. We then discuss the broader implications\nfor the systems community: as AI assumes a central role in algorithm design, we\nargue that human researchers will increasingly focus on problem formulation and\nstrategic guidance. Our results highlight both the disruptive potential and the\nurgent need to adapt systems research practices in the age of AI."

We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables\nrobust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen\nbiomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR\nbackbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images\nand learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight\ntransformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an\nalignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve\ndiscriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision.\nUnlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables\ninference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background\nrejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining.

                    "value": "Object detection in biomedical settings is fundamentally constrained by the\nscarcity of labeled data and the frequent emergence of novel or rare\ncategories. We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables\nrobust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen\nbiomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR\nbackbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images\nand learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight\ntransformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an\nalignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve\ndiscriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision.\nUnlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables\ninference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background\nrejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining.

In this work, we propose COMPACT, which jointly (i) prunes rare\nvocabulary to shrink embedding/LM head layers and (ii) prunes FFN intermediate\nchannels using common-token-weighted activations, aligning importance with the\npost-pruning token distribution. COMPACT inherits strengths of both depth and\nwidth pruning, such as: deployment-friendliness (keeps a standard transformer\narchitecture), scale-adaptivity (trade off vocab. vs. FFN pruning), competitive\npruning times, and strong memory savings alongside throughput gains.\nExperiments across Qwen, LLaMA, and Gemma families (0.5B-70B) show\nstate-of-the-art downstream performance, with substantial reductions in\nparameters, GPU memory, and latency."

Inherently, such multimodal experimental\nprotocols necessitate multiple tissue samples and extensive sample\nmanipulations. Intrinsic inter-sample variability and manipulation-induced\ntissue damage might have an adverse effect on the inversely identified tissue\nbehavior. In this work, we aim to overcome this gap by focusing our attention\nto the use of heterogeneous deformation profiles in a parameter estimation\nproblem. More specifically, we adapt EUCLID, an unsupervised method for the\nautomated discovery of constitutive models, towards the purpose of parameter\nidentification for highly nonlinear, orthotropic constitutive models using a\nBayesian inference approach and three-dimensional continuum elements. We\nshowcase its strength to quantitatively infer, with varying noise levels, the\nmaterial model parameters of synthetic myocardial tissue slabs from a single\nheterogeneous biaxial stretch test. This method shows good agreement with the\nground-truth simulations and with corresponding credibility intervals. Our work\nhighlights the potential for characterizing highly nonlinear and orthotropic\nmaterial models from a single biaxial stretch test with uncertainty\nquantification.",

                    "value": "Fully capturing this behavior in traditional homogenized tissue testing\nrequires the excitation of multiple deformation modes, i.e. combined triaxial\nshear tests and biaxial stretch tests. Inherently, such multimodal experimental\nprotocols necessitate multiple tissue samples and extensive sample\nmanipulations. Intrinsic inter-sample variability and manipulation-induced\ntissue damage might have an adverse effect on the inversely identified tissue\nbehavior. In this work, we aim to overcome this gap by focusing our attention\nto the use of heterogeneous deformation profiles in a parameter estimation\nproblem. More specifically, we adapt EUCLID, an unsupervised method for the\nautomated discovery of constitutive models, towards the purpose of parameter\nidentification for highly nonlinear, orthotropic constitutive models using a\nBayesian inference approach and three-dimensional continuum elements. We\nshowcase its strength to quantitatively infer, with varying noise levels, the\nmaterial model parameters of synthetic myocardial tissue slabs from a single\nheterogeneous biaxial stretch test. This method shows good agreement with the\nground-truth simulations and with corresponding credibility intervals. Our work\nhighlights the potential for characterizing highly nonlinear and orthotropic\nmaterial models from a single biaxial stretch test with uncertainty\nquantification."

Our findings reveal a significant disparity: while LLMs demonstrate\nreasonable proficiency in recursiveness, they struggle with compositionality.\nTo overcome these limitations and establish a reliable logical prover, we\npropose a hybrid architecture integrating symbolic reasoning with neural\ncomputation. This synergistic interaction enables robust and efficient\ninference, neural components accelerate processing, while symbolic reasoning\nensures completeness. Our experiments show that high efficiency is preserved\neven with relatively small neural components. As part of our proposed\nmethodology, this analysis gives a rationale and highlights the potential of\nhybrid models to effectively address key generalization barriers in neural\nreasoning systems."

However, it remains\nchallenging due to limited annotated data, heterogeneous enhancement protocols,\nand significant domain shifts across scanners and institutions. Traditional\nimage-to-image translation frameworks have made great progress in domain\ngeneralization, but their application is not straightforward. For example,\nPix2Pix requires image registration, and cycle-GAN cannot be integrated\nseamlessly into segmentation pipelines. Meanwhile, these methods are originally\nused to deal with cross-modality scenarios, and often introduce structural\ndistortions and suffer from unstable training, which may pose drawbacks in our\nsingle-modality scenario. To address these challenges, we propose CoSSeg-TTA, a\ncompact segmentation framework for the GED4 (Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced hepatobiliary\nphase MRI) modality built upon nnU-Netv2 and enhanced with a semi-supervised\nmean teacher scheme to exploit large amounts of unlabeled volumes. A domain\nadaptation module, incorporating a randomized histogram-based style appearance\ntransfer function and a trainable contrast-aware network, enriches domain\ndiversity and mitigates cross-center variability. Furthermore, a continual\ntest-time adaptation strategy is employed to improve robustness during\ninference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently\noutperforms the nnU-Netv2 baseline, achieving superior Dice score and Hausdorff\nDistance while exhibiting strong generalization to unseen domains under\nlow-annotation conditions.",

Furthermore,\nthe model achieves performance comparable to that of contemporary open-weight\nmultilingual baselines across a wide range of reasoning, knowledge, and\ninstruction-following benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)\nsynthetic data can reliably sustain long-horizon pretraining without model\ncollapse, and (2) bilingual instruction tuning enables near-native reasoning\nand discourse coherence in Korean.

However, mainstream LLM-based code translation methods suffer from two\ncritical limitations. First, they are highly sensitive to language-specific\nfeatures, which often introduce source-language syntax or lexicon into the\noutput, leading to syntactic confusion. Second, they lack fine-grained semantic\nalignment due to an over-reliance on function-level parallel datasets,\nresulting in semantic misalignment between the translated code and the original\nsource. To overcome these limitations, we propose TIT, a Tree-structured\nInstruction Tuning paradigm for LLM-based code translation. Specifically, TIT\nconsists of three modules. First, to mitigate syntactic confusion, the\nsyntactic information representation module integrates language-agnostic\nsyntactic features via structured parsing. Then, to generate high-quality\nfine-grained parallel data, the fine-grained parallel dataset augmentation\nmodule aligns nodes with code segments through statement-level segmentation and\ncontrastive matching. Finally, we leverage the dual-stage tree instruction\ntuning module to alleviate the contextual processing burden on the LLM caused\nby the introduction of syntactic information. The first stage employs\nsyntax-aware fine-tuning to enable the LLM to autonomously comprehend\nstructured syntactic information, while the second stage utilizes code\ngeneration fine-tuning to guide the model in generating accurate target code\nbased on function-level syntactic dependencies. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing\napproaches in multiple LLMs, achieving a success rate 1.22x-1.75x higher in\ncode translation while markedly reducing syntactic confusion.",

To probe this question, we establish a\npractical upper bound on iteration complexity by applying full Gauss-Newton\n(GN) preconditioning to transformer models of up to 150M parameters. Our\nexperiments show that full GN updates yield substantial gains over existing\noptimizers, achieving a 5.4x reduction in training iterations compared to\nstrong baselines like SOAP and Muon. Furthermore, we find that a precise\nlayerwise GN preconditioner, which ignores cross-layer information, nearly\nmatches the performance of the full GN method. Collectively, our results\nsuggest: (1) the GN approximation is highly effective for preconditioning,\nimplying higher-order loss terms may not be critical for convergence speed; (2)\nthe layerwise Hessian structure contains sufficient information to achieve most\nof these potential gains; and (3) a significant performance gap exists between\ncurrent approximate methods and an idealized layerwise oracle.",

We introduce\n\\textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system\nthat can augment any VLN backbone.

At each step, STM retrieval sharply\nprunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are\ndecoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and\nMap2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based\nLLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13\npp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW\nimprovement.

However, most of them are based on static\nregression models, which suffer from poor generalization performance and fail\nto capture market dynamics (e.g., the price of a used iPhone decreases over\ntime). Inspired by recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), we\nintroduce LLP, the first LLM-based generative framework for second-hand product\npricing.

In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process\n(GP) framework for lithium plating detection by directly modeling the\ncharge-voltage relationship Q(V) as a stochastic process with calibrated\nuncertainty.

The framework provides three key\nbenefits: (i) noise-aware inference with hyperparameters learned from data,\n(ii) closed-form derivatives with credible intervals for uncertainty\nquantification, and (iii) scalability to online variants suitable for embedded\nBMS. Experimental validation on Li-ion coin cells across a range of C-rates\n(0.2C-1C) and temperatures (0-40\\deg C) demonstrates that the GP-based method\nreliably detects plating peaks under low-temperature, high-rate charging, while\ncorrectly reporting no peaks in baseline cases.

Our PrivATE framework is model agnostic, doubly robust, and ensures\nvalid CIs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework using synthetic\nand real-world medical datasets.

In this work, we\nintroduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective\ninference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through\nfinetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples,\nP-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances\nand systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction\nprompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory\ncontexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data.\nAcross a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and\nGPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive\nbaselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of\n+26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B);\nP-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and\n+3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better\nperformance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances\nzero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of\nGaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our\nanalysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space\nof reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation\noverhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of\nLLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit\nLLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains.",

In multiple instances, ADRS\ndiscovers algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art human designs (e.g.,\nachieving up to 5.0x runtime improvements or 50% cost reductions). We distill\nbest practices for guiding algorithm evolution, from prompt design to evaluator\nconstruction, for existing frameworks. We then discuss the broader implications\nfor the systems community: as AI assumes a central role in algorithm design, we\nargue that human researchers will increasingly focus on problem formulation and\nstrategic guidance.

Using penEvolve, an existing open-source ADRS\ninstance, we present case studies across diverse domains, including load\nbalancing for multi-region cloud scheduling, Mixture-of-Experts inference,\nLLM-based SQL queries, and transaction scheduling. In multiple instances, ADRS\ndiscovers algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art human designs (e.g.,\nachieving up to 5.0x runtime improvements or 50% cost reductions). We distill\nbest practices for guiding algorithm evolution, from prompt design to evaluator\nconstruction, for existing frameworks. We then discuss the broader implications\nfor the systems community: as AI assumes a central role in algorithm design, we\nargue that human researchers will increasingly focus on problem formulation and\nstrategic guidance. Our results highlight both the disruptive potential and the\nurgent need to adapt systems research practices in the age of AI."

We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and\nvalidate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender,\nrace, and age. Experiments show that FiSCo more reliably identifies nuanced\nbiases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming\nvarious evaluation metrics."

However, parallel decoding, which\nenables simultaneous token updates, conflicts with the causal order often\nrequired for rigorous reasoning. We first identify this conflict as the core\nParallel-Sequential Contradiction (PSC). Behavioral analyses in both simple and\ncomplex reasoning tasks show that DLLMs exhibit genuine parallelism only for\ndirectly decidable outputs. As task difficulty increases, they revert to\nautoregressive-like behavior, a limitation exacerbated by autoregressive\nprompting, which nearly doubles the number of decoding steps with remasking\nwithout improving quality. Moreover, PSC restricts DLLMs' self-reflection,\nreasoning depth, and exploratory breadth. To further characterize PSC, we\nintroduce three scaling dimensions for DLLMs: parallel, diffusion, and\nsequential. Empirically, while parallel scaling yields consistent improvements,\ndiffusion and sequential scaling are constrained by PSC. Based on these\nfindings, we propose several practical mitigations, parallel-oriented\nprompting, diffusion early stopping, and parallel scaling, to reduce\nPSC-induced ineffectiveness and inefficiencies.",

However, parallel decoding, which\nenables simultaneous token updates, conflicts with the causal order often\nrequired for rigorous reasoning. We first identify this conflict as the core\nParallel-Sequential Contradiction (PSC). Behavioral analyses in both simple and\ncomplex reasoning tasks show that DLLMs exhibit genuine parallelism only for\ndirectly decidable outputs. As task difficulty increases, they revert to\nautoregressive-like behavior, a limitation exacerbated by autoregressive\nprompting, which nearly doubles the number of decoding steps with remasking\nwithout improving quality. Moreover, PSC restricts DLLMs' self-reflection,\nreasoning depth, and exploratory breadth. To further characterize PSC, we\nintroduce three scaling dimensions for DLLMs: parallel, diffusion, and\nsequential. Empirically, while parallel scaling yields consistent improvements,\ndiffusion and sequential scaling are constrained by PSC. Based on these\nfindings, we propose several practical mitigations, parallel-oriented\nprompting, diffusion early stopping, and parallel scaling, to reduce\nPSC-induced ineffectiveness and inefficiencies."

Pruning is a promising technique, but existing\npruning methods are limited: width pruning often breaks the standard\ntransformer layout, requiring custom inference code, while depth pruning can\ncause abrupt accuracy drops. Also, while many pruning approaches are effective\nagainst LLMs, they struggle to maintain performance on small language models\n(SLMs). In this work, we propose COMPACT, which jointly (i) prunes rare\nvocabulary to shrink embedding/LM head layers and (ii) prunes FFN intermediate\nchannels using common-token-weighted activations, aligning importance with the\npost-pruning token distribution. COMPACT inherits strengths of both depth and\nwidth pruning, such as: deployment-friendliness (keeps a standard transformer\narchitecture), scale-adaptivity (trade off vocab. vs. FFN pruning), competitive\npruning times, and strong memory savings alongside throughput gains.\nExperiments across Qwen, LLaMA, and Gemma families (0.5B-70B) show\nstate-of-the-art downstream performance, with substantial reductions in\nparameters, GPU memory, and latency.",

Pruning is a promising technique, but existing\npruning methods are limited: width pruning often breaks the standard\ntransformer layout, requiring custom inference code, while depth pruning can\ncause abrupt accuracy drops. Also, while many pruning approaches are effective\nagainst LLMs, they struggle to maintain performance on small language models\n(SLMs). In this work, we propose COMPACT, which jointly (i) prunes rare\nvocabulary to shrink embedding/LM head layers and (ii) prunes FFN intermediate\nchannels using common-token-weighted activations, aligning importance with the\npost-pruning token distribution. COMPACT inherits strengths of both depth and\nwidth pruning, such as: deployment-friendliness (keeps a standard transformer\narchitecture), scale-adaptivity (trade off vocab. vs. FFN pruning), competitive\npruning times, and strong memory savings alongside throughput gains.\nExperiments across Qwen, LLaMA, and Gemma families (0.5B-70B) show\nstate-of-the-art downstream performance, with substantial reductions in\nparameters, GPU memory, and latency."

Second, queries are\nreasoning-intensive, with images requiring deeper interpretation such as\ndiagnosing microscopic slides. We further introduce Contradiction Retrieval, a\nnovel task requiring models to identify conflicting concepts. Finally, queries\nand documents are constructed as image-text interleaved sequences. Unlike\nearlier benchmarks restricted to single images or unimodal documents, MRMR\noffers a realistic setting with multi-image queries and mixed-modality corpus\ndocuments. We conduct an extensive evaluation of 4 categories of multimodal\nretrieval systems and 14 frontier models on MRMR. The text embedding model\nQwen3-Embedding with LLM-generated image captions achieves the highest\nperformance, highlighting substantial room for improving multimodal retrieval\nmodels.

Simulations\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed frameworks over the conventional\nmethods involving the sub-discrete Fourier transform (DFT) pilot matrix and\niterative precoder algorithms enabling the deployment of systems characterized\nby fewer pilots or feedback bits."

As these\nLLM-based systems expand to support diverse business and user queries, such\npolicies, often implemented as in-context prompts, are becoming increasingly\ncomplex and lengthy, making faithful adherence difficult and imposing large\nfixed computational costs. With the rise of multimodal agents, policies that\ngovern visual and multimodal behaviors are critical but remain understudied.\nPrior prompt-compression work mainly shortens task templates and\ndemonstrations, while existing policy-alignment studies focus only on\ntext-based safety rules. We introduce Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI),\na new task that internalizes reasoning-intensive multimodal policies into model\nparameters, enabling stronger policy-following without including the policy\nduring inference.

                "summary": "Recent advances in generalist multi-agent systems (MAS) have largely followed\na context-engineering plus centralized paradigm, where a planner agent\ncoordinates multiple worker agents through unidirectional prompt passing. While\neffective under strong planner models, this design suffers from two critical\nlimitations: (1) strong dependency on the planner's capability, which leads to\ndegraded performance when a smaller LLM powers the planner; and (2) limited\ninter-agent communication, where collaboration relies on prompt concatenation\nrather than genuine refinement through structured discussions. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Anemoi, a semi-centralized MAS built on the\nAgent-to-Agent (A2A) communication MCP server from Coral Protocol. Unlike\ntraditional designs, Anemoi enables structured and direct inter-agent\ncollaboration, allowing all agents to monitor progress, assess results,\nidentify bottlenecks, and propose refinements in real time. This paradigm\nreduces reliance on a single planner, supports adaptive plan updates, and\nminimizes redundant context passing, resulting in more scalable execution.\nEvaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Anemoi achieved 52.73% accuracy with a small\nLLM (GPT-4.1-mini) as the planner, surpassing the strongest open-source\nbaseline OWL (43.63%) by +9.09% under identical LLM settings.

However, mainstream LLM-based code translation methods suffer from two\ncritical limitations. First, they are highly sensitive to language-specific\nfeatures, which often introduce source-language syntax or lexicon into the\noutput, leading to syntactic confusion. Second, they lack fine-grained semantic\nalignment due to an over-reliance on function-level parallel datasets,\nresulting in semantic misalignment between the translated code and the original\nsource. To overcome these limitations, we propose TIT, a Tree-structured\nInstruction Tuning paradigm for LLM-based code translation. Specifically, TIT\nconsists of three modules. First, to mitigate syntactic confusion, the\nsyntactic information representation module integrates language-agnostic\nsyntactic features via structured parsing. Then, to generate high-quality\nfine-grained parallel data, the fine-grained parallel dataset augmentation\nmodule aligns nodes with code segments through statement-level segmentation and\ncontrastive matching. Finally, we leverage the dual-stage tree instruction\ntuning module to alleviate the contextual processing burden on the LLM caused\nby the introduction of syntactic information. The first stage employs\nsyntax-aware fine-tuning to enable the LLM to autonomously comprehend\nstructured syntactic information, while the second stage utilizes code\ngeneration fine-tuning to guide the model in generating accurate target code\nbased on function-level syntactic dependencies. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing\napproaches in multiple LLMs, achieving a success rate 1.22x-1.75x higher in\ncode translation while markedly reducing syntactic confusion.",

Evaluated on Touchdown and\nMap2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based\nLLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13\npp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW\nimprovement.

                "summary": "The operational efficiency of railway networks, a cornerstone of modern\neconomies, is persistently undermined by the cascading effects of train delays.\nAccurately forecasting this delay propagation is a critical challenge for\nreal-time traffic management. While recent research has leveraged Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) to model the network structure of railways, a significant gap\nremains in developing frameworks that provide multi-step autoregressive\nforecasts at a network-wide scale, while simultaneously offering the live,\ninterpretable explanations needed for decision support. This paper addresses\nthis gap by developing and evaluating a novel XGeoAI framework for live,\nexplainable, multi-step train delay forecasting. The core of this work is a\ntwo-stage, autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, trained on a\nreal-world dataset covering over 40% of the Dutch railway network.

                    "value": "The operational efficiency of railway networks, a cornerstone of modern\neconomies, is persistently undermined by the cascading effects of train delays.\nAccurately forecasting this delay propagation is a critical challenge for\nreal-time traffic management. While recent research has leveraged Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) to model the network structure of railways, a significant gap\nremains in developing frameworks that provide multi-step autoregressive\nforecasts at a network-wide scale, while simultaneously offering the live,\ninterpretable explanations needed for decision support. This paper addresses\nthis gap by developing and evaluating a novel XGeoAI framework for live,\nexplainable, multi-step train delay forecasting. The core of this work is a\ntwo-stage, autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, trained on a\nreal-world dataset covering over 40% of the Dutch railway network. The model\nrepresents the system as a spatio-temporal graph of operational events\n(arrivals and departures) and is enriched with granular features, including\nplatform and station congestion. To test its viability for live deployment, the\nmodel is rigorously evaluated using a sequential, k-step-ahead forecasting\nprotocol that simulates real-world conditions where prediction errors can\ncompound.

A subsequent\nuser study (N=10) showed that rehearsing with GestureCoach encouraged speakers\nto gesture and significantly increased gesture diversity, resulting in more\nengaging talks.

Issue localization forms the\nbasis for accurate issue solving. Recently, LLM-based issue localization\nmethods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods\neither search from files mentioned in issue descriptions or in the whole\nrepository and struggle to balance the breadth and depth of the search space to\nconverge on the target efficiently. Moreover, they allow LLM to explore whole\nrepositories freely, making it challenging to control the search direction to\nprevent the LLM from searching for incorrect targets. This paper introduces\nCoSIL, an LLM-driven, powerful function-level issue localization method without\ntraining or indexing. CoSIL employs a two-phase code graph search strategy. It\nfirst conducts broad exploration at the file level using dynamically\nconstructed module call graphs, and then performs in-depth analysis at the\nfunction level by expanding the module call graph into a function call graph\nand executing iterative searches. To precisely control the search direction,\nCoSIL designs a pruner to filter unrelated directions and irrelevant contexts.\nTo avoid incorrect interaction formats in long contexts, CoSIL introduces a\nreflection mechanism that uses additional independent queries in short contexts\nto enhance formatted abilities. Experiment results demonstrate that CoSIL\nachieves a Top-1 localization accuracy of 43.3\\% and 44.6\\% on SWE-bench Lite\nand SWE-bench Verified, respectively, with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, average\noutperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 96.04\\%.

In this paper, we propose LightMamba that\nco-designs the quantization algorithm and FPGA accelerator architecture for\nefficient Mamba inference.

AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and MuZero have\ndefeated top human players in Go and Chess, garnering widespread societal\nattention towards artificial intelligence. Concurrently, large language models\n(LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various tasks, raising the\nquestion of whether LLMs can achieve similar success in complex games. In this\npaper, we explore the potential of LLMs in mastering complex card games. We\nsystematically assess the learning capabilities of LLMs across eight diverse\ncard games, evaluating the impact of fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data,\nand examining the models' ability to retain general capabilities while\nmastering these games. Our findings indicate that: (1) LLMs can approach the\nperformance of strong game AIs through supervised fine-tuning on high-quality\ndata, (2) LLMs can achieve a certain level of proficiency in multiple complex\ncard games simultaneously, with performance augmentation for games with similar\nrules and conflicts for dissimilar ones, and (3) LLMs experience a decline in\ngeneral capabilities when mastering complex games, but this decline can be\nmitigated by integrating a certain amount of general instruction data.

To this end, we conducted a series of experiments comparing\nsupervised fine-tuning setups with preference alignment, zero-shot, and\nfew-shot approaches. We further assessed model performance in\nout-of-distribution scenarios and evaluated the effectiveness of an automatic\npost-editor."

Although robust\nevaluation frameworks are essential for the safe development of medical LLMs,\nresources in Japanese are scarce and often consist of translated\nmultiple-choice questions. Our research addresses this issue in two ways.\nFirst, we establish a performance baseline by applying a machine-translated\nversion of HealthBench's 5,000 scenarios to evaluate two models: a\nhigh-performing multilingual model (GPT-4.1) and a Japanese-native open-source\nmodel (LLM-jp-3.1).

Although robust\nevaluation frameworks are essential for the safe development of medical LLMs,\nresources in Japanese are scarce and often consist of translated\nmultiple-choice questions. Our research addresses this issue in two ways.\nFirst, we establish a performance baseline by applying a machine-translated\nversion of HealthBench's 5,000 scenarios to evaluate two models: a\nhigh-performing multilingual model (GPT-4.1) and a Japanese-native open-source\nmodel (LLM-jp-3.1).
