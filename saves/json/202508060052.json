However, their low inference speed limits their\ndeployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches\nexploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past\nrepresentations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer\ninstead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.\nHowever, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g.,\nattention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate\nfeatures, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it\nadopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of\npredictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when\nprediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to\nbetter leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor\nprediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly\nreducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong\nsequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error\nbetween the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an\nindicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor\nprediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation,\nthereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our\nmethod achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x\nacceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible\nquality drop.

Existing KV cache compression methods often discard less\nrelevant tokens, which can lead to significant performance degradation when\ncritical information is lost. In this paper, we propose \\textsc{PoD}~(Proximal\ntokens over Distant tokens), a novel KV cache compression framework that\nallocates memory according to token importance, retaining less important tokens\nin a more compact, shared form rather than discarding them entirely. Our\napproach is motivated by two key observations: (1) proximal tokens -- those at\nthe beginning and end of the context -- are significantly more important for\nnext-token prediction, and (2) attention scores for distant tokens are highly\nredundant across consecutive layers. Leveraging these insights, \\textsc{PoD}\npreserves the full KV cache for proximal tokens, while for distant tokens, it\nshares key states across layers. Since attention scores are determined by both\nqueries and keys, sharing key states enables multiple layers to reuse a single\nset of keys for distant tokens, substantially reducing KV cache memory without\ndiscarding essential context. We further introduce a lightweight post-training\nadaptation to enable the model to adjust to this new attention-sharing\nstructure. Extensive experiments on both synthetic~(Needle in a Haystack) and\nreal-world long-context benchmarks demonstrate that \\textsc{PoD} reduces KV\ncache memory usage by up to 35\\% without compromising performance.

To enable efficient inference, we design a\nstreaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory\nstructure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic\nretrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional\nKV-cache.

In scientific visualization,\nvolume rendering plays a crucial role in helping researchers analyze and\ninterpret complex 3D data. Recently, photorealistic rendering techniques have\ngained popularity in scientific visualization, yet they face significant\nchallenges. One of the most prominent issues is slow rendering performance and\nhigh pixel variance caused by Monte Carlo integration. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel radiance caching approach for path-traced volume rendering.\nOur method leverages advances in volumetric scene representation and adapts 3D\nGaussian splatting to function as a multi-level, path-space radiance cache.\nThis cache is designed to be trainable on the fly, dynamically adapting to\nchanges in scene parameters such as lighting configurations and transfer\nfunctions. By incorporating our cache, we achieve less noisy, higher-quality\nimages without increasing rendering costs. To evaluate our approach, we compare\nit against a baseline path tracer that supports uniform sampling and next-event\nestimation and the state-of-the-art for neural radiance caching. Through both\nquantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that our path-space\nradiance cache is a robust solution that is easy to integrate and significantly\nenhances the rendering quality of volumetric visualization applications while\nmaintaining comparable computational efficiency.",

One of the most prominent issues is slow rendering performance and\nhigh pixel variance caused by Monte Carlo integration. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel radiance caching approach for path-traced volume rendering.\nOur method leverages advances in volumetric scene representation and adapts 3D\nGaussian splatting to function as a multi-level, path-space radiance cache.\nThis cache is designed to be trainable on the fly, dynamically adapting to\nchanges in scene parameters such as lighting configurations and transfer\nfunctions. By incorporating our cache, we achieve less noisy, higher-quality\nimages without increasing rendering costs. To evaluate our approach, we compare\nit against a baseline path tracer that supports uniform sampling and next-event\nestimation and the state-of-the-art for neural radiance caching. Through both\nquantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that our path-space\nradiance cache is a robust solution that is easy to integrate and significantly\nenhances the rendering quality of volumetric visualization applications while\nmaintaining comparable computational efficiency."

The Compton polarimeter of the CUSP payload performs coincidence\nmeasurements between plastic scintilaltors and GaGG(Ce) crystals to derive the\npolarization of X-rays. These sensors are readout by Multi Anode\nPhotomultiplier Tubes (MAPMTs) and Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs) respectively.\nBoth sensors need an HV power supply up to -1~kV (for the MAPMT) and +500~V\n(for the APD).

                    "value": "The CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) project is a CubeSat mission orbiting\nthe Earth aimed to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard\nX-ray band by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP will allow to\nstudy the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring\nmagnetic structures of our star. CUSP is a project in the framework of the\nAlcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed to develop new CubeSat\nmissions. CUSP undergoing the Phase B started in December 2024 that will last\nfor 12 month. The Compton polarimeter of the CUSP payload performs coincidence\nmeasurements between plastic scintilaltors and GaGG(Ce) crystals to derive the\npolarization of X-rays. These sensors are readout by Multi Anode\nPhotomultiplier Tubes (MAPMTs) and Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs) respectively.\nBoth sensors need an HV power supply up to -1~kV (for the MAPMT) and +500~V\n(for the APD). We tested precision regulated High Voltage DC/DC Converters by\nHVM Technology Inc. with Sub-Miniature Case Size\n($0.85''\\times0.85''\\times0.60''$) of the SMHV series. These modules are\ncompact and suited for CubeSat missions."

While existing KV cache optimizations improve memory\nefficiency, they often fail to reduce time to first token (TTFT) and may\ndegrade performance through token pruning. Alternative sequence modeling\narchitectures address some of these limitations, but typically require full\nretraining and lack infrastructure support. EdgeInfinite offers an efficient\nsolution by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, maintaining quality\nwhile reducing both computational and memory costs, including improved TTFT.\nHowever, its instruction-following ability is limited, and it lacks\nmobile-specific optimizations. To address these issues, we propose\nEdgeInfinite-Instruct, which introduces a Segmented Supervised Fine-Tuning\n(S-SFT) strategy tailored to long-sequence tasks such as summarization and\nquestion answering. We further optimized EdgeInfinite-Instruct for efficient\ndeployment on edge NPUs by employing fine-grained post-training quantization\n(PTQ) to reduce computational demands while maintaining accuracy, and by\nimplementing a fixed-shape computation graph that balances memory usage and\non-device efficiency through scenario-specific customization of input token and\ncache sizes. Experiments on long-context benchmarks and real-world mobile tasks\nshow that our approach improves domain-specific performance while maintaining\nefficiency on NPU-accelerated edge devices.",

                    "value": "Deploying Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) on\nresource-constrained edge devices for long-sequence tasks remains challenging\ndue to the quadratic time complexity of self-attention and growing Key-Value\n(KV) cache demands. While existing KV cache optimizations improve memory\nefficiency, they often fail to reduce time to first token (TTFT) and may\ndegrade performance through token pruning. Alternative sequence modeling\narchitectures address some of these limitations, but typically require full\nretraining and lack infrastructure support. EdgeInfinite offers an efficient\nsolution by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, maintaining quality\nwhile reducing both computational and memory costs, including improved TTFT.\nHowever, its instruction-following ability is limited, and it lacks\nmobile-specific optimizations. To address these issues, we propose\nEdgeInfinite-Instruct, which introduces a Segmented Supervised Fine-Tuning\n(S-SFT) strategy tailored to long-sequence tasks such as summarization and\nquestion answering. We further optimized EdgeInfinite-Instruct for efficient\ndeployment on edge NPUs by employing fine-grained post-training quantization\n(PTQ) to reduce computational demands while maintaining accuracy, and by\nimplementing a fixed-shape computation graph that balances memory usage and\non-device efficiency through scenario-specific customization of input token and\ncache sizes. Experiments on long-context benchmarks and real-world mobile tasks\nshow that our approach improves domain-specific performance while maintaining\nefficiency on NPU-accelerated edge devices."

In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that\nenables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt\ndynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid\ndistillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft\nand target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive\ndrafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM\napplications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major\npoints of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above\nchallenges and motivates the \\textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We\nshowcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online\nlearning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks.

In our experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves\nstrong performance on video benchmarks, reaching 65.1% and 71.1% accuracy on\nVideoMME without and with subtitles, respectively, and consistently\noutperforming LongVILA-7B across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, LongVILA-R1-7B\nsupports processing up to 8,192 video frames per video, and configurable FPS\nsettings. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video\nRL training. In addition, we release our training system for public\navailability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and\naudio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video\ngeneration models.

With broad applications in network science and\ndistributed optimization, recent innovations like the self-repellent random\nwalk (SRRW) achieve near-zero variance by prioritizing under-sampled states\nthrough transition kernel modifications based on past visit frequencies.\nHowever, SRRW's reliance on explicit computation of transition probabilities\nfor all neighbors at each step introduces substantial computational overhead,\nwhile its strict dependence on time-reversible Markov chains excludes advanced\nnon-reversible MCMC methods. To overcome these limitations, instead of direct\nmodification of transition kernel, HDT introduces a history-dependent target\ndistribution $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}[\\mathbf{x}]$ to replace the original target\n$\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ in any graph sampler, where $\\mathbf{x}$ represents the\nempirical measure of past visits. This design preserves lightweight\nimplementation by requiring only local information between the current and\nproposed states and achieves compatibility with both reversible and\nnon-reversible MCMC samplers, while retaining unbiased samples with target\ndistribution $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ and near-zero variance performance. Extensive\nexperiments in graph sampling demonstrate consistent performance gains, and a\nmemory-efficient Least Recently Used (LRU) cache ensures scalability to large\ngeneral graphs.",

                    "value": "We propose a history-driven target (HDT) framework in Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo (MCMC) to improve any random walk algorithm on discrete state spaces,\nsuch as general undirected graphs, for efficient sampling from target\ndistribution $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$. With broad applications in network science and\ndistributed optimization, recent innovations like the self-repellent random\nwalk (SRRW) achieve near-zero variance by prioritizing under-sampled states\nthrough transition kernel modifications based on past visit frequencies.\nHowever, SRRW's reliance on explicit computation of transition probabilities\nfor all neighbors at each step introduces substantial computational overhead,\nwhile its strict dependence on time-reversible Markov chains excludes advanced\nnon-reversible MCMC methods. To overcome these limitations, instead of direct\nmodification of transition kernel, HDT introduces a history-dependent target\ndistribution $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}[\\mathbf{x}]$ to replace the original target\n$\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ in any graph sampler, where $\\mathbf{x}$ represents the\nempirical measure of past visits. This design preserves lightweight\nimplementation by requiring only local information between the current and\nproposed states and achieves compatibility with both reversible and\nnon-reversible MCMC samplers, while retaining unbiased samples with target\ndistribution $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ and near-zero variance performance. Extensive\nexperiments in graph sampling demonstrate consistent performance gains, and a\nmemory-efficient Least Recently Used (LRU) cache ensures scalability to large\ngeneral graphs."

Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel\nMulti-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces\nboth KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention\nexpressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed\ninference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers\ninto specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost\nefficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared\nwith models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at\nlonger context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per\ntoken (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that\nhardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are\ncritical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with\nDeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios. Our implementation on Hopper GPUs\nachieves a decoding throughput of up to 4,039 tokens per second per GPU under\n50ms TPOT SLA (4K context, FP8, no MTP). It is higher than DeepSeek-V3's 2,324\nin the same setup and sets a new Pareto frontier for LLM decoding.",

Unlike conventional speaker-tracing buffers, AOSC orders embeddings\nby speaker index corresponding to their arrival time order, and is dynamically\nupdated by selecting frames with the highest scores based on the model's past\npredictions. Notably, the number of stored embeddings per speaker is determined\ndynamically by the update mechanism, ensuring efficient cache utilization and\nprecise speaker tracking.

As a result, serverless is becoming\nincreasingly popular to support highly elastic and bursty workloads. However,\nexisting platforms are supported by bloated virtualization stacks, which,\ncombined with bursty and irregular invocations, lead to high memory and latency\noverheads.\n  To reduce the virtualization stack bloat, we propose Hydra, a virtualized\nmulti-language runtime and platform capable of hosting multiple sandboxes\nrunning concurrently. To fully leverage Hydra's virtualized runtime, we revisit\nthe existing serverless platform design to make it colocation-aware across\nowners and functions, and to feature a caching layer of pre-allocated Hydra\ninstances that can be used by different functions written in different\nlanguages to reduce cold starts. We also propose a snapshotting mechanism to\ncheckpoint and restore individual sandboxes.\n  By consolidating multiple serverless function invocations through Hydra, we\nimprove the overall function density (ops/GB-sec) by 2.41x on average compared\nto OpenWhisk runtimes, the state-of-the-art single-language runtimes used in\nmost serverless platforms, and by 1.43x on average compared to Knative runtimes\nsupporting invocation colocation within the same function. When reproducing the\nAzure Functions trace, our serverless platform operating Hydra instances\nreduces the overall memory footprint by 21.3-43.9% compared to operating\nOpenWhisk instances and by 14.5-30% compared to operating Knative instances.\nHydra eliminates cold starts thanks to the pool of pre-warmed runtime\ninstances, reducing p99 latency by 45.3-375.5x compared to OpenWhisk and by\n1.9-51.4x compared to Knative.",

Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic\nattention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while\npreserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are\noften limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating\nmechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent\nstate-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports\nconstant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more\nflexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global\ncontext compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory,\nforming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and\nfine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware\nalgorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive\nexperiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher\nmodel's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while\nsignificantly outperforming previous linearization methods.

A significant\ndevelopment is the diversification of custom hardware solely targeting the most\nexpensive parts of CNNs. DLAs (deep learning accelerators) and NPUs (neural\nprocessing units), among others, can overcome the approaching limits of\ntraditional silicon scaling and provide a solution to the power/performance\ntradeoff within embedded SoCs. Efficient DSA utilization requires proper system\nintegration and a compilation/execution model for balanced execution in these\nheterogeneous architectures. There is a critical need for proper system\nintegration and an efficient compilation/execution model for balanced execution\nin these heterogeneous architectures. This work highlights the hardware\nintegration challenges for efficiently placing these units within the memory\nhierarchy and correct proximity to other execution blocks. We experimentally\nverify performance bottlenecks in CNN execution and pre/post-processing at\nruntime, where previous attention has generally been given to accelerator\nspeedup alone. This work takes advantage of the ratification of the RISC-V\nVector 1.0 extension and demonstrates its potential as a flexible target within\na well-suited cache hierarchy scheme to reduce pre-processing bottlenecks and\nCPU fallback processes.

                    "value": "The emergence of heterogeneity and domain-specific architectures targeting\ndeep learning inference show great potential for enabling the deployment of\nmodern CNNs on resource-constrained embedded platforms. A significant\ndevelopment is the diversification of custom hardware solely targeting the most\nexpensive parts of CNNs. DLAs (deep learning accelerators) and NPUs (neural\nprocessing units), among others, can overcome the approaching limits of\ntraditional silicon scaling and provide a solution to the power/performance\ntradeoff within embedded SoCs. Efficient DSA utilization requires proper system\nintegration and a compilation/execution model for balanced execution in these\nheterogeneous architectures. There is a critical need for proper system\nintegration and an efficient compilation/execution model for balanced execution\nin these heterogeneous architectures. This work highlights the hardware\nintegration challenges for efficiently placing these units within the memory\nhierarchy and correct proximity to other execution blocks. We experimentally\nverify performance bottlenecks in CNN execution and pre/post-processing at\nruntime, where previous attention has generally been given to accelerator\nspeedup alone. This work takes advantage of the ratification of the RISC-V\nVector 1.0 extension and demonstrates its potential as a flexible target within\na well-suited cache hierarchy scheme to reduce pre-processing bottlenecks and\nCPU fallback processes. Our results show up to a 9x speedup of image\npre-processing and YOLOv3 fallback layer execution by up to 3x compared to CPU.\nWe demonstrate RVV-1.0 in exposing a flexible programming model that can enable\na balanced computation and memory footprint on accelerator-rich embedded SoCs\nsupporting modern deep-learning dataflows while consuming less power than\ntraditional parallel execution platforms."

                "summary": "Feature caching has emerged as an effective strategy to accelerate diffusion\ntransformer (DiT) sampling through temporal feature reuse. It is a challenging\nproblem since (1) Progressive error accumulation from cached blocks\nsignificantly degrades generation quality, particularly when over 50\\% of\nblocks are cached; (2) Current error compensation approaches neglect dynamic\nperturbation patterns during the caching process, leading to suboptimal error\ncorrection. To solve these problems, we propose the Gradient-Optimized Cache\n(GOC) with two key innovations: (1) Cached Gradient Propagation: A gradient\nqueue dynamically computes the gradient differences between cached and\nrecomputed features. These gradients are weighted and propagated to subsequent\nsteps, directly compensating for the approximation errors introduced by\ncaching. (2) Inflection-Aware Optimization: Through statistical analysis of\nfeature variation patterns, we identify critical inflection points where the\ndenoising trajectory changes direction. By aligning gradient updates with these\ndetected phases, we prevent conflicting gradient directions during error\ncorrection. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet demonstrate GOC's superior\ntrade-off between efficiency and quality. With 50\\% cached blocks, GOC achieves\nIS 216.28 (26.3\\% higher) and FID 3.907 (43\\% lower) compared to baseline DiT,\nwhile maintaining identical computational costs. These improvements persist\nacross various cache ratios, demonstrating robust adaptability to different\nacceleration requirements.

To support larger KV caches, prior work extends GPU memory\nwith CPU memory via CPU-offloading. This involves swapping KV cache between GPU\nand CPU memory. However, because the cache updates dynamically, such swapping\nincurs high CPU memory traffic. We make a key observation that model parameters\nremain constant during runtime, unlike the dynamically updated KV cache.\nBuilding on this, we introduce MIRAGE, which avoids KV cache swapping by\nremapping, and thereby repurposing, the memory allocated to model parameters\nfor KV cache. This parameter remapping is especially beneficial in multi-tenant\nenvironments, where the memory used for the parameters of the inactive models\ncan be more aggressively reclaimed.

                    "value": "KV cache accelerates LLM inference by avoiding redundant computation, at the\nexpense of memory. To support larger KV caches, prior work extends GPU memory\nwith CPU memory via CPU-offloading. This involves swapping KV cache between GPU\nand CPU memory. However, because the cache updates dynamically, such swapping\nincurs high CPU memory traffic. We make a key observation that model parameters\nremain constant during runtime, unlike the dynamically updated KV cache.\nBuilding on this, we introduce MIRAGE, which avoids KV cache swapping by\nremapping, and thereby repurposing, the memory allocated to model parameters\nfor KV cache. This parameter remapping is especially beneficial in multi-tenant\nenvironments, where the memory used for the parameters of the inactive models\ncan be more aggressively reclaimed.

We propose a multidisciplinary framework to explain how, under\ncertain conditions, users attribute intentionality, agency, and even\ninteriority to these systems - a process grounded not in physical resemblance,\nbut in linguistic performance, epistemic opacity, and emergent technological\ncomplexity. By linking an LLM declination of meaning holism to our technical\nnotion of the LLM Contextual Cognitive Field, we clarify how LLMs construct\nmeaning relationally and how coherence and a simulacrum of agency arise at the\nhuman-AI interface. The analysis situates noosemia alongside pareidolia,\nanimism, the intentional stance and the uncanny valley, distinguishing its\nunique characteristics. We also introduce a-noosemia to describe the\nphenomenological withdrawal of such projections. The paper concludes with\nreflections on the broader philosophical, epistemological, and social\nimplications of noosemic dynamics and directions for future research.",

While\nimage-language models (e.g., CLIP, SigLIP) show strong open-set recognition,\nthey lack temporal modeling needed for video understanding. We propose\nActAlign, a truly zero-shot, training-free method that formulates video\nclassification as a sequence alignment problem, preserving the generalization\nstrength of pretrained image-language models. For each class, a large language\nmodel (LLM) generates an ordered sequence of sub-actions, which we align with\nvideo frames using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in a shared embedding space.\nWithout any video-text supervision or fine-tuning, ActAlign achieves 30.5%\naccuracy on ActionAtlas--the most diverse benchmark of fine-grained actions\nacross multiple sports--where human performance is only 61.6%. ActAlign\noutperforms billion-parameter video-language models while using 8x fewer\nparameters. Our approach is model-agnostic and domain-general, demonstrating\nthat structured language priors combined with classical alignment methods can\nunlock the open-set recognition potential of image-language models for\nfine-grained video understanding.",

While\nimage-language models (e.g., CLIP, SigLIP) show strong open-set recognition,\nthey lack temporal modeling needed for video understanding. We propose\nActAlign, a truly zero-shot, training-free method that formulates video\nclassification as a sequence alignment problem, preserving the generalization\nstrength of pretrained image-language models. For each class, a large language\nmodel (LLM) generates an ordered sequence of sub-actions, which we align with\nvideo frames using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in a shared embedding space.\nWithout any video-text supervision or fine-tuning, ActAlign achieves 30.5%\naccuracy on ActionAtlas--the most diverse benchmark of fine-grained actions\nacross multiple sports--where human performance is only 61.6%. ActAlign\noutperforms billion-parameter video-language models while using 8x fewer\nparameters. Our approach is model-agnostic and domain-general, demonstrating\nthat structured language priors combined with classical alignment methods can\nunlock the open-set recognition potential of image-language models for\nfine-grained video understanding."

Robots that remain connected form a communication group and\ncollaboratively plan using partially centralized nonlinear optimization. Robots\nexperiencing permanent disconnection or failure continue to operate\nindependently through decentralized or individual optimization, allowing them\nto contribute to the task within their local context. We extensively evaluate\nour method across a range of benchmark variations and conduct a comprehensive\nassessment under diverse real-world failure scenarios. Results show that our\nframework consistently achieves robust performance in realistic environments\nwith unknown danger zones, offering a practical and generalizable solution for\nthe multi-robot systems community."

The primary objective is to capture the\nalternating sequences of dry and wet periods that characterize the local\nclimate, providing deeper insight into its temporal structure. Building on this\nfoundation, we extend the model to represent reservoir inflow patterns, which\nare then used to explain the observed water storage levels via a Moran model.\nThe dataset includes historical rainfall and inflow records, where the latter\nis influenced by latent conditions governed by the hidden states. Direct\nmodelling based solely on observed rainfall is insufficient due to the\ncomplexity of the system, hence the use of HMMs to infer these unobserved\ndynamics. This approach facilitates more accurate characterization of the\nunderlying climatic processes and enables forecasting of future inflows based\non historical data, supporting improved water resource management in the\nregion.",

Building on this\nfoundation, we extend the model to represent reservoir inflow patterns, which\nare then used to explain the observed water storage levels via a Moran model.\nThe dataset includes historical rainfall and inflow records, where the latter\nis influenced by latent conditions governed by the hidden states. Direct\nmodelling based solely on observed rainfall is insufficient due to the\ncomplexity of the system, hence the use of HMMs to infer these unobserved\ndynamics. This approach facilitates more accurate characterization of the\nunderlying climatic processes and enables forecasting of future inflows based\non historical data, supporting improved water resource management in the\nregion."

We first develop a comprehensive,\nmulti-faceted evaluation framework that includes: (i) a formal conformity\nscore, (ii) automated quality assessment using LLMs, (iii) human evaluation,\nand (iv) classification-based probing tasks. Using this framework, we evaluate\nthe generative performance of 18 LLMs, including 3 proprietary models and 15\nopen-source models across four families, under five prompting strategies:\nzero-shot, one-shot, completion-based, instruction-tuned, and chain-of-thought.\nFinally, we propose a Generate-Critic architecture in which the evaluation\nframework functions as an automated critic. Leveraging the critic's feedback as\na reward signal, we fine-tune three lightweight open-source LLMs via supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT), resulting in improvements of up to 5.88% in formal\nconformity. Our findings offer new insights into the generative strengths and\nlimitations of LLMs in producing culturally significant and formally\nconstrained literary texts.",

Furthermore, the Bayesian nature of this\napproach robustly quantifies uncertainties for inferred parameter values,\nincluding the free-energy profile, diffusion coefficients, and linker\nstiffness, without needing independent measurements of instrumental properties.\nThe inferred model is predictive, generating simulated trajectories that\nquantitatively reproduce the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the\nexperimental data. This work establishes SBI as a highly efficient and powerful\ntool for analyzing single-molecule experiments. The ability to derive\nstatistically robust models from minimal datasets is crucial for investigating\ncomplex biomolecular systems where extensive data collection is impractical or\nimpossible.

This paper tackles the task of Video Amodal\nCompletion (VAC), which aims to generate the complete object consistently\nthroughout the video given a visual prompt specifying the object of interest.\nLeveraging the rich, consistent manifolds learned by pre-trained video\ndiffusion models, we propose a conditional diffusion model, TACO, that\nrepurposes these manifolds for VAC. To enable its effective and robust\ngeneralization to challenging in-the-wild scenarios, we curate a large-scale\nsynthetic dataset with multiple difficulty levels by systematically imposing\nocclusions onto un-occluded videos. Building on this, we devise a progressive\nfine-tuning paradigm that starts with simpler recovery tasks and gradually\nadvances to more complex ones. We demonstrate TACO's versatility on a wide\nrange of in-the-wild videos from Internet, as well as on diverse, unseen\ndatasets commonly used in autonomous driving, robotic manipulation, and scene\nunderstanding. Moreover, we show that TACO can be effectively applied to\nvarious downstream tasks like object reconstruction and pose estimation,\nhighlighting its potential to facilitate physical world understanding and\nreasoning.

In the resulting framework, a signal's spectral content is\nsimultaneously inferred and assigned, or transported, to a small set of\nharmonic series defined by their corresponding fundamental frequencies. In\ncontrast to existing methods from the compressed sensing paradigm, the proposed\nframework decouples regularization and dictionary design and mitigates\ncoherency problems. As a direct consequence, this also introduces robustness to\nthe phenomenon of inharmonicity. From this framework, we derive two estimation\nmethods, one for stochastic and one for deterministic signals, and propose\nefficient numerical algorithms implementing them. In numerical studies on both\nsynthetic and real data, the proposed methods are shown to achieve better\nestimation performance as compared to other methods from statistical signal\nprocessing literature.

Multi-round RAG approaches achieve strong reasoning but incur\nexcessive LLM calls and token costs, while Graph RAG methods suffer from\ncomputationally expensive, error-prone graph construction and retrieval\nredundancy. To address these challenges, we propose T$^2$RAG, a novel framework\nthat operates on a simple, graph-free knowledge base of atomic triplets.\nT$^2$RAG leverages an LLM to decompose questions into searchable triplets with\nplaceholders, which it then iteratively resolves by retrieving evidence from\nthe triplet database. Empirical results show that T$^2$RAG significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art multi-round and Graph RAG methods, achieving an\naverage performance gain of up to 11\\% across six datasets while reducing\nretrieval costs by up to 45\\%.

                    "value": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is critical for reducing hallucinations\nand incorporating external knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs).\nHowever, advanced RAG systems face a trade-off between performance and\nefficiency. Multi-round RAG approaches achieve strong reasoning but incur\nexcessive LLM calls and token costs, while Graph RAG methods suffer from\ncomputationally expensive, error-prone graph construction and retrieval\nredundancy. To address these challenges, we propose T$^2$RAG, a novel framework\nthat operates on a simple, graph-free knowledge base of atomic triplets.\nT$^2$RAG leverages an LLM to decompose questions into searchable triplets with\nplaceholders, which it then iteratively resolves by retrieving evidence from\nthe triplet database. Empirical results show that T$^2$RAG significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art multi-round and Graph RAG methods, achieving an\naverage performance gain of up to 11\\% across six datasets while reducing\nretrieval costs by up to 45\\%.

SBI is often used when the likelihood is intractable and to\nconstruct confidence sets that do not rely on asymptotic methods or regularity\nconditions. Traditional SBI methods assume that the model is correct, but, as\nalways, this can lead to invalid inference when the model is misspecified. This\npaper introduces robust methods that allow for valid frequentist inference in\nthe presence of model misspecification. We propose a framework where the target\nof inference is a projection parameter that minimizes a discrepancy between the\ntrue distribution and the assumed model. The method guarantees valid inference,\neven when the model is incorrectly specified and even if the standard\nregularity conditions fail. Alternatively, we introduce model expansion through\nexponential tilting as another way to account for model misspecification. We\nalso develop an SBI based goodness-of-fit test to detect model\nmisspecification. Finally, we propose two ideas that are useful in the SBI\nframework beyond robust inference: an SBI based method to obtain closed form\napproximations of intractable models and an active learning approach to more\nefficiently sample the parameter space.",

SBI is often used when the likelihood is intractable and to\nconstruct confidence sets that do not rely on asymptotic methods or regularity\nconditions. Traditional SBI methods assume that the model is correct, but, as\nalways, this can lead to invalid inference when the model is misspecified. This\npaper introduces robust methods that allow for valid frequentist inference in\nthe presence of model misspecification. We propose a framework where the target\nof inference is a projection parameter that minimizes a discrepancy between the\ntrue distribution and the assumed model. The method guarantees valid inference,\neven when the model is incorrectly specified and even if the standard\nregularity conditions fail. Alternatively, we introduce model expansion through\nexponential tilting as another way to account for model misspecification. We\nalso develop an SBI based goodness-of-fit test to detect model\nmisspecification. Finally, we propose two ideas that are useful in the SBI\nframework beyond robust inference: an SBI based method to obtain closed form\napproximations of intractable models and an active learning approach to more\nefficiently sample the parameter space."

Recent advances in weight-activation quantization have primarily\nfocused on mapping both weights and activations to the INT4 format. Although\nthe new FP4 Tensor Cores in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture offer up to 4x\nspeedup over FP16, existing INT4-based kernels fail to fully exploit this\ncapability due to mismatched data formats. To bridge this gap, we propose\nMicroMix, a co-designed mixed-precision quantization algorithm and matrix\nmultiplication kernel based on Microscaling (MX) data formats. Tailored for the\nBlackwell architecture, the MicroMix kernel supports arbitrary combinations of\nMXFP4, MXFP6, and MXFP8 channels, and produces BFloat16 outputs. To achieve a\nfavorable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for each linear layer, we\nintroduce quantization thresholds that identify activation elements where\nlower-precision formats (MXFP4 or MXFP6) incur excessive quantization error.\nOur algorithm selectively allocates higher-precision channels to preserve\naccuracy while maintaining compute efficiency. MicroMix achieves competitive or\nsuperior performance across diverse downstream tasks, including zero-shot and\nfew-shot learning, language modeling, code generation, and mathematical\nreasoning. On both consumer-grade (RTX 5070Ti laptop) and server-grade (RTX\n5090) GPUs, our kernel delivers at least 20% faster execution than\nTensorRT-FP8. Furthermore, when applied to various Llama and Qwen models,\nMicroMix consistently improves prefill latency and memory efficiency across a\nrange of batch sizes compared to TensorRT baselines.

To achieve a\nfavorable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for each linear layer, we\nintroduce quantization thresholds that identify activation elements where\nlower-precision formats (MXFP4 or MXFP6) incur excessive quantization error.\nOur algorithm selectively allocates higher-precision channels to preserve\naccuracy while maintaining compute efficiency. MicroMix achieves competitive or\nsuperior performance across diverse downstream tasks, including zero-shot and\nfew-shot learning, language modeling, code generation, and mathematical\nreasoning. On both consumer-grade (RTX 5070Ti laptop) and server-grade (RTX\n5090) GPUs, our kernel delivers at least 20% faster execution than\nTensorRT-FP8. Furthermore, when applied to various Llama and Qwen models,\nMicroMix consistently improves prefill latency and memory efficiency across a\nrange of batch sizes compared to TensorRT baselines. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/lwy2020/MicroMix."

While some view this as an\nopportunity for model compression, we identify it as a training shortfall\nrooted in the widespread use of Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN). We\ndemonstrate that Pre-LN, commonly employed in models like GPT and LLaMA, leads\nto diminished gradient norms in its deeper layers, reducing their\neffectiveness.

To address this, we introduce Mix-LN, a novel normalization technique\nthat combines the strengths of Pre-LN and Post-LN within the same model. Mix-LN\napplies Post-LN to the earlier layers and Pre-LN to the deeper layers, ensuring\nmore uniform gradients across layers. This allows all parts of the\nnetwork--both shallow and deep layers--to contribute effectively to training.\nExtensive experiments with various model sizes from 70M to 7B demonstrate that\nMix-LN consistently outperforms both Pre-LN and Post-LN, promoting more\nbalanced, healthier gradient norms throughout the network, and enhancing the\noverall quality of LLM pre-training. Furthermore, we demonstrate that models\npre-trained with Mix-LN learn better compared to those using Pre-LN or Post-LN\nduring supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human\nfeedback (RLHF), highlighting the critical importance of high-quality deep\nlayers.

By linking an LLM declination of meaning holism to our technical\nnotion of the LLM Contextual Cognitive Field, we clarify how LLMs construct\nmeaning relationally and how coherence and a simulacrum of agency arise at the\nhuman-AI interface. The analysis situates noosemia alongside pareidolia,\nanimism, the intentional stance and the uncanny valley, distinguishing its\nunique characteristics.

However, mainstream preference\nmodeling in RM is inadequate in terms of token-level interaction, making its\njudgment signals vulnerable to being hacked by misallocated attention to\ncontext.

Yet existing approaches commonly rely solely on WHOIS or\nPeeringDB, missing important relationships (e.g., cross-regional aliases,\nparent-child ownership) and failing to unify organizations scattered across\ndifferent RIR identifiers. We introduce ASINT, an end-to-end pipeline that\nfuses bulk registry data with unstructured Web sources, then employs\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to guide large language model (LLM)\ninference. Through a multi-stage procedure, ASINT merges ASNs into\n\"organization families,\" capturing nuanced ties beyond the scope of simpler\nheuristics.\n  ASINT maps 111,470 ASNs to 81,233 organization families; compared to both\nAS2ORG+ and AS-Sibling, ASINT identifies more cross-regional groupings (e.g.,\noperator aliases, rebrands) that other datasets overlook. Moreover, our refined\nmappings enhance multiple security and measurement tasks: ASINT exposes 27.5%\nmore intra-organizational RPKI misconfigurations, cuts false-positive hijack\nalarms by 9.4%, and lowers erroneous IP leasing inferences by 5.9%.\n  Finally, ASINT supports periodic updates and cost-sensitive LLM selection,\ndemonstrating that broader Web evidence can provide a more accurate, evolving\nview of the Internet's organizational structure.",

Yet existing approaches commonly rely solely on WHOIS or\nPeeringDB, missing important relationships (e.g., cross-regional aliases,\nparent-child ownership) and failing to unify organizations scattered across\ndifferent RIR identifiers. We introduce ASINT, an end-to-end pipeline that\nfuses bulk registry data with unstructured Web sources, then employs\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to guide large language model (LLM)\ninference. Through a multi-stage procedure, ASINT merges ASNs into\n\"organization families,\" capturing nuanced ties beyond the scope of simpler\nheuristics.\n  ASINT maps 111,470 ASNs to 81,233 organization families; compared to both\nAS2ORG+ and AS-Sibling, ASINT identifies more cross-regional groupings (e.g.,\noperator aliases, rebrands) that other datasets overlook. Moreover, our refined\nmappings enhance multiple security and measurement tasks: ASINT exposes 27.5%\nmore intra-organizational RPKI misconfigurations, cuts false-positive hijack\nalarms by 9.4%, and lowers erroneous IP leasing inferences by 5.9%.\n  Finally, ASINT supports periodic updates and cost-sensitive LLM selection,\ndemonstrating that broader Web evidence can provide a more accurate, evolving\nview of the Internet's organizational structure."

These include both temporary and\npermanent disruptions in sensing and communication, which can significantly\ndegrade system robustness and performance if not explicitly modeled. Despite\nits practical importance, failure-aware coordination remains underexplored in\nthe literature. To bridge the gap between idealized conditions and the\ncomplexities of real-world environments, we propose a unified failure-aware\ncoordination framework designed to enable resilient and adaptive multi-robot\ntarget tracking under both temporary and permanent failure conditions.

Despite\nits practical importance, failure-aware coordination remains underexplored in\nthe literature. To bridge the gap between idealized conditions and the\ncomplexities of real-world environments, we propose a unified failure-aware\ncoordination framework designed to enable resilient and adaptive multi-robot\ntarget tracking under both temporary and permanent failure conditions.

Using this framework, we evaluate\nthe generative performance of 18 LLMs, including 3 proprietary models and 15\nopen-source models across four families, under five prompting strategies:\nzero-shot, one-shot, completion-based, instruction-tuned, and chain-of-thought.\nFinally, we propose a Generate-Critic architecture in which the evaluation\nframework functions as an automated critic. Leveraging the critic's feedback as\na reward signal, we fine-tune three lightweight open-source LLMs via supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT), resulting in improvements of up to 5.88% in formal\nconformity. Our findings offer new insights into the generative strengths and\nlimitations of LLMs in producing culturally significant and formally\nconstrained literary texts.",

These metrics align with typical PHM tasks,\nincluding condition monitoring, fault diagnosis, RUL prediction, and\nmaintenance decision-making. Utilizing both curated case sets and publicly\navailable industrial datasets, our study enables multi-dimensional evaluation\nof general-purpose and domain-specific models across diverse PHM tasks.\nPHM-Bench establishes a methodological foundation for large-scale assessment of\nLLMs in PHM and offers a critical benchmark to guide the transition from\ngeneral-purpose to PHM-specialized models."

Binarized neural networks (BNNs) are distinguished by their\nexceptional efficiency in model compression. However, the small size of\ninfrared targets introduces stringent precision requirements for the IRSTD\ntask, while the inherent precision loss during binarization presents a\nsignificant challenge.

A\ntotal of 67 Italian-language student essays, written as part of a university\npsychology course, were evaluated using a four-criterion rubric (Pertinence,\nCoherence, Originality, Feasibility). Each model scored all essays across three\nprompt replications to assess intra-model stability. Human-LLM agreement was\nconsistently low and non-significant (Quadratic Weighted Kappa), and\nwithin-model reliability across replications was similarly weak (median\nKendall's W < 0.30). Systematic scoring divergences emerged, including a\ntendency to inflate Coherence and inconsistent handling of context-dependent\ndimensions. Inter-model agreement analysis revealed moderate convergence for\nCoherence and Originality, but negligible concordance for Pertinence and\nFeasibility. Although limited in scope, these findings suggest that current\nLLMs may struggle to replicate human judgment in tasks requiring disciplinary\ninsight and contextual sensitivity. Human oversight remains critical when\nevaluating open-ended academic work, particularly in interpretive domains.",

However, existing\nnon-uniform methods rely heavily on manually designed pruning policies (e.g.,\nlayer importance and scaling factors), and therefore cannot efficiently adapt\nto scenarios with dynamic pruning ratio requirements. Additionly, a critical\nbottleneck -- the time-consuming evaluation of pruning policies -- further\nlimits the feasibility of iteratively and dynamically finding optimal pruning\npolicies. To address these limitations, we propose PPF (Predictive Pruning\nFramework), a novel pruning framework for LLMs that eliminates manual design\ndependencies via second-level performance prediction. PPF not only supports\nreal-time pruning decisions under dynamic pruning ratios but is also applicable\nto static pruning scenarios. It employs an agent for producing adaptive and\nreal-time pruning actions, while a lightweight performance predictor that can\nevaluate a pruning policy in seconds, significantly speeding up the iterative\noptimization process. Experiments on Llama2-7B and Llama3-8B show that PPF can\ngenerate dynamic/static pruning policies and it reduces perplexity by up to\n33.4% (dynamic pruning) and 84.78% (static pruning) over existing methods,\noutperforming manually designed pruning policies. The performance predictor\nachieves second-level performance prediction with high accuracy (prediction\nerror < 0.0011). It reduces the mean evaluation latency from minute-level (1\nminute and 38.02 seconds of test-set evaluation methods) to second-level (1.52\nsecond), achieving over 64 times speedup.

                "summary": "Quantization significantly accelerates inference in large language models\n(LLMs) by replacing original high-precision matrices with low-precision\ncounterparts. Recent advances in weight-activation quantization have primarily\nfocused on mapping both weights and activations to the INT4 format. Although\nthe new FP4 Tensor Cores in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture offer up to 4x\nspeedup over FP16, existing INT4-based kernels fail to fully exploit this\ncapability due to mismatched data formats. To bridge this gap, we propose\nMicroMix, a co-designed mixed-precision quantization algorithm and matrix\nmultiplication kernel based on Microscaling (MX) data formats. Tailored for the\nBlackwell architecture, the MicroMix kernel supports arbitrary combinations of\nMXFP4, MXFP6, and MXFP8 channels, and produces BFloat16 outputs. To achieve a\nfavorable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for each linear layer, we\nintroduce quantization thresholds that identify activation elements where\nlower-precision formats (MXFP4 or MXFP6) incur excessive quantization error.\nOur algorithm selectively allocates higher-precision channels to preserve\naccuracy while maintaining compute efficiency. MicroMix achieves competitive or\nsuperior performance across diverse downstream tasks, including zero-shot and\nfew-shot learning, language modeling, code generation, and mathematical\nreasoning. On both consumer-grade (RTX 5070Ti laptop) and server-grade (RTX\n5090) GPUs, our kernel delivers at least 20% faster execution than\nTensorRT-FP8. Furthermore, when applied to various Llama and Qwen models,\nMicroMix consistently improves prefill latency and memory efficiency across a\nrange of batch sizes compared to TensorRT baselines.

                    "value": "Quantization significantly accelerates inference in large language models\n(LLMs) by replacing original high-precision matrices with low-precision\ncounterparts. Recent advances in weight-activation quantization have primarily\nfocused on mapping both weights and activations to the INT4 format. Although\nthe new FP4 Tensor Cores in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture offer up to 4x\nspeedup over FP16, existing INT4-based kernels fail to fully exploit this\ncapability due to mismatched data formats. To bridge this gap, we propose\nMicroMix, a co-designed mixed-precision quantization algorithm and matrix\nmultiplication kernel based on Microscaling (MX) data formats. Tailored for the\nBlackwell architecture, the MicroMix kernel supports arbitrary combinations of\nMXFP4, MXFP6, and MXFP8 channels, and produces BFloat16 outputs. To achieve a\nfavorable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for each linear layer, we\nintroduce quantization thresholds that identify activation elements where\nlower-precision formats (MXFP4 or MXFP6) incur excessive quantization error.\nOur algorithm selectively allocates higher-precision channels to preserve\naccuracy while maintaining compute efficiency. MicroMix achieves competitive or\nsuperior performance across diverse downstream tasks, including zero-shot and\nfew-shot learning, language modeling, code generation, and mathematical\nreasoning. On both consumer-grade (RTX 5070Ti laptop) and server-grade (RTX\n5090) GPUs, our kernel delivers at least 20% faster execution than\nTensorRT-FP8. Furthermore, when applied to various Llama and Qwen models,\nMicroMix consistently improves prefill latency and memory efficiency across a\nrange of batch sizes compared to TensorRT baselines. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/lwy2020/MicroMix."

Notably, the performance gains of MoE\nmodels do not scale proportionally with the growth in expert parameters. While\nprior works attempt to reduce parameters via expert-level pruning, merging, or\ndecomposition, they still suffer from challenges in both performance and\ncomputational efficiency. In this paper, we address these challenges by\nintroducing micro-expert as a finer-grained compression unit that spans across\nmatrices. We first establish a more fundamental perspective, viewing MoE layers\nas mixtures of micro-experts, and present CAMERA, a lightweight and\ntraining-free framework for identifying micro-expert redundancy. Our analysis\nuncovers significant variance in micro-expert contributions during decoding.\nBased on this insight, we further propose CAMERA-P, a structured micro-expert\npruning framework, and CAMERA-Q, a mixed-precision quantization idea designed\nfor micro-experts. Extensive experiments on nine downstream tasks show that\nCAMERA-P consistently outperforms strong baselines under pruning ratios ranging\nfrom 20% to 60%. Furthermore, CAMERA-Q achieves superior results under\naggressive 2-bit quantization, surpassing existing matrix- and channel-level\nideas. Notably, our method enables complete micro-expert analysis of\nQwen2-57B-A14B in less than 5 minutes on a single NVIDIA A100-40GB GPU.",

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, yet recent\nfindings reveal that their deeper layers often contribute minimally and can be\npruned without affecting overall performance. While some view this as an\nopportunity for model compression, we identify it as a training shortfall\nrooted in the widespread use of Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN). We\ndemonstrate that Pre-LN, commonly employed in models like GPT and LLaMA, leads\nto diminished gradient norms in its deeper layers, reducing their\neffectiveness. In contrast, Post-Layer Normalization (Post-LN) preserves larger\ngradient norms in deeper layers but suffers from vanishing gradients in earlier\nlayers. To address this, we introduce Mix-LN, a novel normalization technique\nthat combines the strengths of Pre-LN and Post-LN within the same model. Mix-LN\napplies Post-LN to the earlier layers and Pre-LN to the deeper layers, ensuring\nmore uniform gradients across layers. This allows all parts of the\nnetwork--both shallow and deep layers--to contribute effectively to training.\nExtensive experiments with various model sizes from 70M to 7B demonstrate that\nMix-LN consistently outperforms both Pre-LN and Post-LN, promoting more\nbalanced, healthier gradient norms throughout the network, and enhancing the\noverall quality of LLM pre-training. Furthermore, we demonstrate that models\npre-trained with Mix-LN learn better compared to those using Pre-LN or Post-LN\nduring supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human\nfeedback (RLHF), highlighting the critical importance of high-quality deep\nlayers. By effectively addressing the inefficiencies of deep layers in current\nLLMs, Mix-LN unlocks their potential, enhancing model capacity without\nincreasing model size.

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, yet recent\nfindings reveal that their deeper layers often contribute minimally and can be\npruned without affecting overall performance. While some view this as an\nopportunity for model compression, we identify it as a training shortfall\nrooted in the widespread use of Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN). We\ndemonstrate that Pre-LN, commonly employed in models like GPT and LLaMA, leads\nto diminished gradient norms in its deeper layers, reducing their\neffectiveness. In contrast, Post-Layer Normalization (Post-LN) preserves larger\ngradient norms in deeper layers but suffers from vanishing gradients in earlier\nlayers. To address this, we introduce Mix-LN, a novel normalization technique\nthat combines the strengths of Pre-LN and Post-LN within the same model. Mix-LN\napplies Post-LN to the earlier layers and Pre-LN to the deeper layers, ensuring\nmore uniform gradients across layers. This allows all parts of the\nnetwork--both shallow and deep layers--to contribute effectively to training.\nExtensive experiments with various model sizes from 70M to 7B demonstrate that\nMix-LN consistently outperforms both Pre-LN and Post-LN, promoting more\nbalanced, healthier gradient norms throughout the network, and enhancing the\noverall quality of LLM pre-training. Furthermore, we demonstrate that models\npre-trained with Mix-LN learn better compared to those using Pre-LN or Post-LN\nduring supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human\nfeedback (RLHF), highlighting the critical importance of high-quality deep\nlayers. By effectively addressing the inefficiencies of deep layers in current\nLLMs, Mix-LN unlocks their potential, enhancing model capacity without\nincreasing model size.

                "summary": "The Transformer architecture has emerged as a landmark advancement within the\nbroad field of artificial intelligence, effectively catalyzing the advent of\nlarge language models (LLMs). However, despite its remarkable capabilities and\nthe substantial progress it has facilitated, the Transformer architecture still\nhas some limitations. One such intrinsic limitation is its inability to\neffectively capture the Chomsky hierarchy, such as regular expressions or\ndeterministic context-free grammars. Drawing inspiration from pushdown\nautomata, which efficiently resolve deterministic context-free grammars using\nstacks, we propose StackTrans to address the aforementioned issue within LLMs.\nUnlike previous approaches that modify the attention computation, StackTrans\nexplicitly incorporates hidden state stacks between Transformer layers.

                    "value": "The Transformer architecture has emerged as a landmark advancement within the\nbroad field of artificial intelligence, effectively catalyzing the advent of\nlarge language models (LLMs). However, despite its remarkable capabilities and\nthe substantial progress it has facilitated, the Transformer architecture still\nhas some limitations. One such intrinsic limitation is its inability to\neffectively capture the Chomsky hierarchy, such as regular expressions or\ndeterministic context-free grammars. Drawing inspiration from pushdown\nautomata, which efficiently resolve deterministic context-free grammars using\nstacks, we propose StackTrans to address the aforementioned issue within LLMs.\nUnlike previous approaches that modify the attention computation, StackTrans\nexplicitly incorporates hidden state stacks between Transformer layers.

However, their low inference speed limits their\ndeployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches\nexploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past\nrepresentations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer\ninstead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.\nHowever, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g.,\nattention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate\nfeatures, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it\nadopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of\npredictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when\nprediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to\nbetter leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor\nprediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly\nreducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong\nsequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error\nbetween the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an\nindicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor\nprediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation,\nthereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our\nmethod achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x\nacceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible\nquality drop.

However,\nexisting work mainly focuses on mitigating FL's computation and communication\noverhead of a single task while overlooking the computing resource wastage\nissue of heterogeneous devices across multiple tasks in FL under CPNs. To\ntackle this, we design FedAPTA, a federated multi-task learning framework in\nCPNs. FedAPTA alleviates computing resource wastage through the developed\nlayer-wise model pruning technique, which reduces local model size while\nconsidering both data and device heterogeneity. To aggregate structurally\nheterogeneous local models of different tasks, we introduce a heterogeneous\nmodel recovery strategy and a task-aware model aggregation method that enables\nthe aggregation through infilling local model architecture with the shared\nglobal model and clustering local models according to their specific tasks. We\ndeploy FedAPTA on a realistic FL platform and benchmark it against nine SOTA FL\nmethods. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that the proposed FedAPTA\nconsiderably outperforms the state-of-the-art FL methods by up to 4.23%.

FedAPTA alleviates computing resource wastage through the developed\nlayer-wise model pruning technique, which reduces local model size while\nconsidering both data and device heterogeneity. To aggregate structurally\nheterogeneous local models of different tasks, we introduce a heterogeneous\nmodel recovery strategy and a task-aware model aggregation method that enables\nthe aggregation through infilling local model architecture with the shared\nglobal model and clustering local models according to their specific tasks. We\ndeploy FedAPTA on a realistic FL platform and benchmark it against nine SOTA FL\nmethods. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that the proposed FedAPTA\nconsiderably outperforms the state-of-the-art FL methods by up to 4.23%.

However, existing methods\nstill face limitations in expressing cross-doc query needs and controlling\nannotation quality. To address these issues, this paper proposes a\nbidirectional generation pipeline, which aims to generate 3-level hierarchical\nqueries for both intra-doc and cross-doc scenarios and mine additional\nrelevance labels on top of direct mapping annotation. The pipeline introduces\ntwo query generation methods: bottom-up from single-doc text and top-down from\nmulti-doc titles. The bottom-up method uses LLMs to disassemble and generate\nstructured queries at both sentence-level and passage-level simultaneously from\nintra-doc passages. The top-down approach incorporates three key financial\nelements--industry, topic, and time--to divide report titles into clusters and\nprompts LLMs to generate topic-level queries from each cluster. For relevance\nannotation, our pipeline not only relies on direct mapping annotation from the\ngeneration relationship but also implements an indirect positives mining method\nto enrich the relevant query-passage pairs. Using this pipeline, we constructed\na Financial Passage Retrieval Generated dataset (FinCPRG) from almost 1.3k\nChinese financial research reports, which includes hierarchical queries and\nrich relevance labels. Through evaluations of mined relevance labels,\nbenchmarking and training experiments, we assessed the quality of FinCPRG and\nvalidated its effectiveness as a passage retrieval dataset for both training\nand benchmarking.",
