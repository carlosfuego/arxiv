While this is conceptually similar to\nEvolutionary Algorithms, their distinct objectives (selection for acceleration\nvs. iterative solution optimization) require a fundamental redefinition of\nevolutionary mechanisms for our context. In response, we design sparse fitness\nevaluation, frequency-guided crossover, and augmented unbiased mutation to\ncomprise EVOS. These components respectively guide sample selection with\nreduced computational cost, enhance performance through frequency-domain\nbalance, and mitigate selection bias from cached evaluation.

Current MoE models\nare mainly built with expert parallelism on distributed devices. However, it\nusually depends on homogeneous devices to deploy and suffers from heavy\ncommunication overhead and computation redundancy. In this paper, we explore\ndeveloping a \\texttt{H}eterogeneous-aware \\texttt{EX}pert \\texttt{A}llocation\nframework, \\textbf{\\texttt{HEXA-MoE}}, with significantly enhanced computing\nefficiency.

This\npaper focuses on cache management for applications where data objects can be\nstored in layered representations. In such representations, each additional\ndata layer enhances the \"quality\" of the object's version but comes with an\nincremental cost of memory space. This layered approach proves beneficial in\nvarious scenarios, including the delivery of zoomable maps, video coding,\nfuture Virtual Reality gaming, and layered neural network models where\nadditional data layers improve inference accuracy. In systems where users or\ndevices demand different versions of a data object, layered representations\noffer flexibility for caching policies to achieve improved hit rates.\n  In this paper, we explore the performance of various traditionally studied\ncaching policies, such as Belady, LRU, and LFU, both with and without layering.\nTo this end, we develop an asymptotically accurate analytical model for Layered\nLRU (LLRU). We study how the performance of LLRU is impacted by factors such as\nthe number of layers, the popularity of different objects and layers, and\noverheads associated with storing layered representations. For instance, we\nshow that, for LLRU, more layers are not always beneficial and indeed\nperformance depends in subtle ways on the popularity and size profiles of\nlayers.",

In such representations, each additional\ndata layer enhances the \"quality\" of the object's version but comes with an\nincremental cost of memory space. This layered approach proves beneficial in\nvarious scenarios, including the delivery of zoomable maps, video coding,\nfuture Virtual Reality gaming, and layered neural network models where\nadditional data layers improve inference accuracy. In systems where users or\ndevices demand different versions of a data object, layered representations\noffer flexibility for caching policies to achieve improved hit rates.\n  In this paper, we explore the performance of various traditionally studied\ncaching policies, such as Belady, LRU, and LFU, both with and without layering.\nTo this end, we develop an asymptotically accurate analytical model for Layered\nLRU (LLRU). We study how the performance of LLRU is impacted by factors such as\nthe number of layers, the popularity of different objects and layers, and\noverheads associated with storing layered representations. For instance, we\nshow that, for LLRU, more layers are not always beneficial and indeed\nperformance depends in subtle ways on the popularity and size profiles of\nlayers."

To address\nthis critical bottleneck, we propose AirCache, a novel KV cache compression\nmethod aimed at accelerating LVLMs inference. This work systematically\ninvestigates the correlations between visual and textual tokens within the\nattention mechanisms of LVLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals considerable\nredundancy in cached visual tokens, wherein strategically eliminating these\ntokens preserves model performance while significantly accelerating context\ngeneration. Inspired by these findings, we introduce an elite observation\nwindow for assessing the importance of visual components in the KV cache,\nfocusing on stable inter-modal relevancy modeling with enhanced\nmulti-perspective consistency. Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise\nbudget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of\ntoken importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to\nuniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the\nfull cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing\ndecoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of\ninputs.

To address these challenges, we introduce a comprehensive\nand reliable caching mechanism and propose a novel zero-shot TTA method called\n\"Cache, Residual, Gaussian\" (CRG).

This paper proposes a new\nhigh-performance B$^+$-tree variant called \\textbf{Feature B$^+$-tree\n(FB$^+$-tree)}. Similar to employing bit or byte for branch operation in tries,\nFB$^+$-tree progressively considers several bytes following the common prefix\non each level of its inner nodes\\textemdash referred to as features, which\nallows FB$^+$-tree to benefit from prefix skewness. FB$^+$-tree blurs the lines\nbetween B$^+$-trees and tries, while still retaining balance. In the best case,\nFB$^+$-tree almost becomes a trie, whereas in the worst case, it continues to\nfunction as a B$^+$-tree. Meanwhile, a crafted synchronization protocol that\ncombines the link technique and optimistic lock is designed to support\nefficient concurrent index access. Distinctively, FB$^+$-tree leverages subtle\natomic operations seamlessly coordinated with optimistic lock to facilitate\nlatch-free updates, which can be easily extended to other structures. Intensive\nexperiments on multiple workload-dataset combinations demonstrate that\nFB$^+$-tree shows comparable lookup performance to state-of-the-art trie-based\nindexes and outperforms popular B$^+$-trees by 2.3x$\\ \\sim\\ $3.7x under 96\nthreads.

Similar to employing bit or byte for branch operation in tries,\nFB$^+$-tree progressively considers several bytes following the common prefix\non each level of its inner nodes\\textemdash referred to as features, which\nallows FB$^+$-tree to benefit from prefix skewness. FB$^+$-tree blurs the lines\nbetween B$^+$-trees and tries, while still retaining balance. In the best case,\nFB$^+$-tree almost becomes a trie, whereas in the worst case, it continues to\nfunction as a B$^+$-tree. Meanwhile, a crafted synchronization protocol that\ncombines the link technique and optimistic lock is designed to support\nefficient concurrent index access. Distinctively, FB$^+$-tree leverages subtle\natomic operations seamlessly coordinated with optimistic lock to facilitate\nlatch-free updates, which can be easily extended to other structures. Intensive\nexperiments on multiple workload-dataset combinations demonstrate that\nFB$^+$-tree shows comparable lookup performance to state-of-the-art trie-based\nindexes and outperforms popular B$^+$-trees by 2.3x$\\ \\sim\\ $3.7x under 96\nthreads. FB$^+$-tree also exhibits significant potential on other workloads,\nespecially update workloads under contention and scan workloads."

To\naddress these challenges, we propose a general FSDMC framework called MVREC,\nwhich offers two primary advantages: (1) MVREC extracts general features for\ndefect instances by incorporating the pre-trained AlphaCLIP model. (2) It\nutilizes a region-context framework to enhance defect features by leveraging\nmask region input and multi-view context augmentation. Furthermore, Few-shot\nZip-Adapter(-F) classifiers within the model are introduced to cache the visual\nfeatures of the support set and perform few-shot classification. We also\nintroduce MVTec-FS, a new FSDMC benchmark based on MVTec AD, which includes\n1228 defect images with instance-level mask annotations and 46 defect types.\nExtensive experiments conducted on MVTec-FS and four additional datasets\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in general defect classification and its ability\nto incorporate contextual information to improve classification performance.\nCode: https://github.com/ShuaiLYU/MVREC",

Instead of relying on attention scores, we formulate token pruning\nas an optimization problem, accurately identifying important visual tokens\nwhile remaining compatible with FlashAttention. Additionally, since we only\nperform this pruning once during the prefilling stage, it effectively reduces\nKV cache size. Our optimization framework incorporates a visual-aware cost\nfunction considering factors such as Feature Similarity, Relative Spatial\nDistance, and Absolute Central Distance, to measure the importance of each\nsource visual token, enabling effective pruning of low-importance tokens.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous token\npruning methods, validating the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.",

To address\nthese issues, we introduce \\textbf{TopV}, a compatible \\textbf{TO}ken\n\\textbf{P}runing with inference Time Optimization for fast and low-memory\n\\textbf{V}LM, achieving efficient pruning without additional training or\nfine-tuning. Instead of relying on attention scores, we formulate token pruning\nas an optimization problem, accurately identifying important visual tokens\nwhile remaining compatible with FlashAttention. Additionally, since we only\nperform this pruning once during the prefilling stage, it effectively reduces\nKV cache size. Our optimization framework incorporates a visual-aware cost\nfunction considering factors such as Feature Similarity, Relative Spatial\nDistance, and Absolute Central Distance, to measure the importance of each\nsource visual token, enabling effective pruning of low-importance tokens.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous token\npruning methods, validating the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach."

We present\nEdgeInfinite, a memory-efficient solution for infinite contexts that integrates\ncompressed memory into Transformer-based LLMs through a trainable memory-gating\nmodule. This approach maintains full compatibility with standard Transformer\narchitectures, requiring fine-tuning only a small part of parameters, and\nenables selective activation of the memory-gating module for long and short\ncontext task routing. The experimental result shows that EdgeInfinite achieves\ncomparable performance to baseline Transformer-based LLM on long context\nbenchmarks while optimizing memory consumption and time to first token.",

                    "value": "Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) encounter challenges in\nprocessing long sequences on edge devices due to the quadratic complexity of\nattention mechanisms and growing memory demands from Key-Value (KV) cache.\nExisting KV cache optimizations struggle with irreversible token eviction in\nlong-output tasks, while alternative sequence modeling architectures prove\ncostly to adopt within established Transformer infrastructure. We present\nEdgeInfinite, a memory-efficient solution for infinite contexts that integrates\ncompressed memory into Transformer-based LLMs through a trainable memory-gating\nmodule. This approach maintains full compatibility with standard Transformer\narchitectures, requiring fine-tuning only a small part of parameters, and\nenables selective activation of the memory-gating module for long and short\ncontext task routing. The experimental result shows that EdgeInfinite achieves\ncomparable performance to baseline Transformer-based LLM on long context\nbenchmarks while optimizing memory consumption and time to first token."

                "summary": "With the advancements in long-context inference capabilities of large\nlanguage models (LLMs), the KV cache has become one of the foundational\ncomponents. However, its substantial GPU memory consumption makes KV cache\ncompression a key technique for enabling efficient LLM inference in industrial\nscenarios. While recent studies have focused on optimizing the memory occupied\nby the KV cache, they overlook two critical factors: preserving semantic\ncoherence and considering task-specific characteristic during compression. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel task-adaptive KV cache window\nselection method, WindowKV.

                    "value": "With the advancements in long-context inference capabilities of large\nlanguage models (LLMs), the KV cache has become one of the foundational\ncomponents. However, its substantial GPU memory consumption makes KV cache\ncompression a key technique for enabling efficient LLM inference in industrial\nscenarios. While recent studies have focused on optimizing the memory occupied\nby the KV cache, they overlook two critical factors: preserving semantic\ncoherence and considering task-specific characteristic during compression. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel task-adaptive KV cache window\nselection method, WindowKV.

At the transport level, non-blocking transactions\nare supported for latency tolerance. Additionally, a novel end-to-end ordering\napproach for AXI4, enabled by a multi-stream capable Direct Memory Access (DMA)\nengine simplifies network interfaces and eliminates inter-stream dependencies.\nFurthermore, dedicated physical links are instantiated for short,\nlatency-critical messages. A complete end-to-end reference implementation in\n12nm FinFET technology demonstrates the physical feasibility and power\nperformance area (PPA) benefits of our approach. Utilizing wide links on high\nlevels of metal, we achieve a bandwidth of 645 Gbps per link and a total\naggregate bandwidth of 103 Tbps for an 8x4 mesh of processors cluster tiles,\nwith a total of 288 RISC-V cores. The NoC imposes a minimal area overhead of\nonly 3.5% per compute tile and achieves a leading-edge energy efficiency of\n0.15 pJ/B/hop at 0.8 V. Compared to state-of-the-art NoCs, our system offers\nthree times the energy efficiency and more than double the link bandwidth.\nFurthermore, compared to a traditional AXI4-based multi-layer interconnect, our\nNoC achieves a 30% reduction in area, corresponding to a 47% increase in\nGFLOPSDP within the same floorplan.",

While recent advancements have shown promising results in\ngenerating high-resolution 3D shapes, VDM still struggles with high-speed\ngeneration. Challenges exist because of difficulties not only in accelerating\ndiffusion sampling but also VAE decoding in VDM, areas under-explored in\nprevious works. To address these challenges, we present FlashVDM, a systematic\nframework for accelerating both VAE and DiT in VDM. For DiT, FlashVDM enables\nflexible diffusion sampling with as few as 5 inference steps and comparable\nquality, which is made possible by stabilizing consistency distillation with\nour newly introduced Progressive Flow Distillation. For VAE, we introduce a\nlightning vecset decoder equipped with Adaptive KV Selection, Hierarchical\nVolume Decoding, and Efficient Network Design. By exploiting the locality of\nthe vecset and the sparsity of shape surface in the volume, our decoder\ndrastically lowers FLOPs, minimizing the overall decoding overhead. We apply\nFlashVDM to Hunyuan3D-2 to obtain Hunyuan3D-2 Turbo. Through systematic\nevaluation, we show that our model significantly outperforms existing fast 3D\ngeneration methods, achieving comparable performance to the state-of-the-art\nwhile reducing inference time by over 45x for reconstruction and 32x for\ngeneration.

The Gemma 3\nmodels are trained with distillation and achieve superior performance to Gemma\n2 for both pre-trained and instruction finetuned versions. In particular, our\nnovel post-training recipe significantly improves the math, chat,\ninstruction-following and multilingual abilities, making Gemma3-4B-IT\ncompetitive with Gemma2-27B-IT and Gemma3-27B-IT comparable to Gemini-1.5-Pro\nacross benchmarks.

The complexity of applications results in a wide variety of memory\naccess patterns, prompting the development of numerous cache-prefetching\nalgorithms. Consequently, commercial processors often employ a hybrid of these\nalgorithms to enhance the overall prefetching performance. Nonetheless, since\nthese prefetchers share hardware resources, conflicts arising from competing\nprefetching requests can negate the benefits of hardware prefetching. Under\nsuch circumstances, several prefetcher selection algorithms have been proposed\nto mitigate conflicts between prefetchers. However, these prior solutions\nsuffer from two limitations. First, the input demand request allocation is\ninaccurate. Second, the prefetcher selection criteria are coarse-grained.\n  In this paper, we address both limitations by introducing an efficient and\nwidely applicable prefetcher selection algorithm--Alecto, which tailors the\ndemand requests for each prefetcher. Every demand request is first sent to\nAlecto to identify suitable prefetchers before being routed to prefetchers for\ntraining and prefetching. Our analysis shows that Alecto is adept at not only\nharmonizing prefetching accuracy, coverage, and timeliness but also\nsignificantly enhancing the utilization of the prefetcher table, which is vital\nfor temporal prefetching. Alecto outperforms the state-of-the-art RL-based\nprefetcher selection algorithm--Bandit by 2.76% in single-core, and 7.56% in\neight-core. For memory-intensive benchmarks, Alecto outperforms Bandit by\n5.25%. Alecto consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance in scheduling\nvarious types of cache prefetchers. In addition to the performance improvement,\nAlecto can reduce the energy consumption associated with accessing the\nprefetchers' table by 48%, while only adding less than 1 KB of storage\noverhead.",

                "summary": "Attribute detection is crucial for many computer vision tasks, as it enables\nsystems to describe properties such as color, texture, and material. Current\napproaches often rely on labor-intensive annotation processes which are\ninherently limited: objects can be described at an arbitrary level of detail\n(e.g., color vs. color shades), leading to ambiguities when the annotators are\nnot instructed carefully. Furthermore, they operate within a predefined set of\nattributes, reducing scalability and adaptability to unforeseen downstream\napplications. We present Compositional Caching (ComCa), a training-free method\nfor open-vocabulary attribute detection that overcomes these constraints. ComCa\nrequires only the list of target attributes and objects as input, using them to\npopulate an auxiliary cache of images by leveraging web-scale databases and\nLarge Language Models to determine attribute-object compatibility.

                    "value": "Attribute detection is crucial for many computer vision tasks, as it enables\nsystems to describe properties such as color, texture, and material. Current\napproaches often rely on labor-intensive annotation processes which are\ninherently limited: objects can be described at an arbitrary level of detail\n(e.g., color vs. color shades), leading to ambiguities when the annotators are\nnot instructed carefully. Furthermore, they operate within a predefined set of\nattributes, reducing scalability and adaptability to unforeseen downstream\napplications. We present Compositional Caching (ComCa), a training-free method\nfor open-vocabulary attribute detection that overcomes these constraints. ComCa\nrequires only the list of target attributes and objects as input, using them to\npopulate an auxiliary cache of images by leveraging web-scale databases and\nLarge Language Models to determine attribute-object compatibility.

We find\nthat the dominant singular vectors are remarkably well-aligned across multiple\nlayers of the KV-Cache. Exploiting this insight, we propose xKV, a simple\npost-training method that applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the\nKV-Cache of grouped layers. xKV consolidates the KV-Cache of multiple layers\ninto a shared low-rank subspace, significantly reducing KV-Cache sizes. Through\nextensive evaluations on the RULER long-context benchmark with widely-used LLMs\n(e.g., Llama-3.1 and Qwen2.5), xKV achieves up to 6.8x higher compression rates\nthan state-of-the-art inter-layer technique while improving accuracy by 2.7%.\nMoreover, xKV is compatible with the emerging Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)\n(e.g., DeepSeek-Coder-V2), yielding a notable 3x compression rates on coding\ntasks without performance degradation.

                "summary": "Modern Large Language Model serving system batches multiple requests to\nachieve high throughput, while batching attention operations is challenging,\nrendering memory bandwidth a critical bottleneck. The community relies on\nhigh-end GPUs with multiple high-bandwidth memory channels. Unfortunately,\nHBM's high bandwidth often comes at the expense of limited memory capacity,\nwhich reduces core utilization and increases costs. Recent advancements\nenabling longer contexts for LLMs have substantially increased the key-value\ncache size, further intensifying the pressures on memory capacity. The\nliterature has explored KV cache quantization techniques, which commonly use\nlow bitwidth for most values, selectively using higher bitwidth for outlier\nvalues. While this approach helps achieve high accuracy and low bitwidth\nsimultaneously, it comes with the limitation that cost for online outlier\ndetection is excessively high, negating the advantages. We propose Oaken, an\nacceleration solution that achieves high accuracy and high performance\nsimultaneously through co-designing algorithm and hardware. To effectively find\na sweet spot in the accuracy-performance trade-off space of KV cache\nquantization, Oaken employs an online-offline hybrid approach, setting outlier\nthresholds offline, which are then used to determine the quantization scale\nonline. To translate the proposed algorithmic technique into tangible\nperformance gains, Oaken also comes with custom quantization engines and memory\nmanagement units that can be integrated with any LLM accelerators. We built an\nOaken accelerator on top of an LLM accelerator, LPU, and conducted a\ncomprehensive evaluation. Our experiments show that for a batch size of 256,\nOaken achieves up to 1.58x throughput improvement over NVIDIA A100 GPU,\nincurring a minimal accuracy loss of only 0.54\\% on average, compared to\nstate-of-the-art KV cache quantization techniques.",

                    "value": "Modern Large Language Model serving system batches multiple requests to\nachieve high throughput, while batching attention operations is challenging,\nrendering memory bandwidth a critical bottleneck. The community relies on\nhigh-end GPUs with multiple high-bandwidth memory channels. Unfortunately,\nHBM's high bandwidth often comes at the expense of limited memory capacity,\nwhich reduces core utilization and increases costs. Recent advancements\nenabling longer contexts for LLMs have substantially increased the key-value\ncache size, further intensifying the pressures on memory capacity. The\nliterature has explored KV cache quantization techniques, which commonly use\nlow bitwidth for most values, selectively using higher bitwidth for outlier\nvalues. While this approach helps achieve high accuracy and low bitwidth\nsimultaneously, it comes with the limitation that cost for online outlier\ndetection is excessively high, negating the advantages. We propose Oaken, an\nacceleration solution that achieves high accuracy and high performance\nsimultaneously through co-designing algorithm and hardware. To effectively find\na sweet spot in the accuracy-performance trade-off space of KV cache\nquantization, Oaken employs an online-offline hybrid approach, setting outlier\nthresholds offline, which are then used to determine the quantization scale\nonline. To translate the proposed algorithmic technique into tangible\nperformance gains, Oaken also comes with custom quantization engines and memory\nmanagement units that can be integrated with any LLM accelerators. We built an\nOaken accelerator on top of an LLM accelerator, LPU, and conducted a\ncomprehensive evaluation. Our experiments show that for a batch size of 256,\nOaken achieves up to 1.58x throughput improvement over NVIDIA A100 GPU,\nincurring a minimal accuracy loss of only 0.54\\% on average, compared to\nstate-of-the-art KV cache quantization techniques."

However,\ndue to the thousands of visual tokens from the video frames, key-value (KV)\ncache can significantly increase memory requirements, becoming a bottleneck for\ninference speed and memory usage. KV cache quantization is a widely used\napproach to address this problem. In this paper, we find that 2-bit KV\nquantization of VideoLLMs can hardly hurt the model performance, while the\nlimit of KV cache quantization in even lower bits has not been investigated. To\nbridge this gap, we introduce VidKV, a plug-and-play KV cache quantization\nmethod to compress the KV cache to lower than 2 bits. Specifically, (1) for\nkey, we propose a mixed-precision quantization strategy in the channel\ndimension, where we perform 2-bit quantization for anomalous channels and 1-bit\nquantization combined with FFT for normal channels; (2) for value, we implement\n1.58-bit quantization while selectively filtering semantically salient visual\ntokens for targeted preservation, for a better trade-off between precision and\nmodel performance. Importantly, our findings suggest that the value cache of\nVideoLLMs should be quantized in a per-channel fashion instead of the per-token\nfashion proposed by prior KV cache quantization works for LLMs. Empirically,\nextensive results with LLaVA-OV-7B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B on six benchmarks show\nthat VidKV effectively compresses the KV cache to 1.5-bit and 1.58-bit\nprecision with almost no performance drop compared to the FP16 counterparts.",

Conventional methods have developed specialized\nsolutions (e.g., geometry regularization or feed-forward deterministic model)\nto mitigate the issue. However, they still suffer from performance degradation\nby minimal overlap across input views with insufficient visual information.\nFortunately, recent video generative models show promise in addressing this\nchallenge as they are capable of generating video clips with plausible 3D\nstructures. Powered by large pretrained video diffusion models, some pioneering\nresearch start to explore the potential of video generative prior and create 3D\nscenes from sparse views. Despite impressive improvements, they are limited by\nslow inference time and the lack of 3D constraint, leading to inefficiencies\nand reconstruction artifacts that do not align with real-world geometry\nstructure. In this paper, we propose VideoScene to distill the video diffusion\nmodel to generate 3D scenes in one step, aiming to build an efficient and\neffective tool to bridge the gap from video to 3D. Specifically, we design a\n3D-aware leap flow distillation strategy to leap over time-consuming redundant\ninformation and train a dynamic denoising policy network to adaptively\ndetermine the optimal leap timestep during inference. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our VideoScene achieves faster and superior 3D scene\ngeneration results than previous video diffusion models, highlighting its\npotential as an efficient tool for future video to 3D applications.

Our exploration leads to a model design based\non JEPA (Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture) that for the first time\nbreaks the Reversal Curse without side-stepping it with specialized data\naugmentation or non-causal masking, and moreover, generalization could be\nfurther improved by incorporating special memory layers that support\ndisentangled concept representations.

Built\non three core principles -- diversity, deliberative reasoning, and rigorous\nfiltering -- STAR-1 aims to address the critical needs for safety alignment in\nLRMs. Specifically, we begin by integrating existing open-source safety\ndatasets from diverse sources. Then, we curate safety policies to generate\npolicy-grounded deliberative reasoning samples. Lastly, we apply a GPT-4o-based\nsafety scoring system to select training examples aligned with best practices.\nExperimental results show that fine-tuning LRMs with STAR-1 leads to an average\n40% improvement in safety performance across four benchmarks, while only\nincurring a marginal decrease (e.g., an average of 1.1%) in reasoning ability\nmeasured across five reasoning tasks. Extensive ablation studies further\nvalidate the importance of our design principles in constructing STAR-1 and\nanalyze its efficacy across both LRMs and traditional LLMs. Our project page is\nhttps://ucsc-vlaa.github.io/STAR-1.",

Yet the\nquestions of how pervasive this is, and with what impact on results, have not\nto our knowledge been systematically investigated. We investigate\nnon-determinism in five LLMs configured to be deterministic when applied to\neight common tasks in across 10 runs, in both zero-shot and few-shot settings.\nWe see accuracy variations up to 15% across naturally occurring runs with a gap\nof best possible performance to worst possible performance up to 70%. In fact,\nnone of the LLMs consistently delivers repeatable accuracy across all tasks,\nmuch less identical output strings. Sharing preliminary results with insiders\nhas revealed that non-determinism perhaps essential to the efficient use of\ncompute resources via co-mingled data in input buffers so this issue is not\ngoing away anytime soon. To better quantify our observations, we introduce\nmetrics focused on quantifying determinism, TARr@N for the total agreement rate\nat N runs over raw output, and TARa@N for total agreement rate of parsed-out\nanswers.

Benchmark evaluations demonstrate superior performance across Thai\nlanguage tasks, achieving competitive results against larger-scale open-source\nThai LLMs. This paper details the proposed models, training processes,\nbenchmarks, and results, highlighting improvements over previous models and\nestablishing new performance standards for Thai-centric LLMs."

We comprehensively evaluate\nOpen-FinLLMs across 14 financial tasks, 30 datasets, and 4 multimodal tasks in\nzero-shot, few-shot, and supervised fine-tuning settings, introducing two new\nmultimodal evaluation datasets. Our results show that Open-FinLLMs outperforms\nafvanced financial and general LLMs such as GPT-4, across financial NLP,\ndecision-making, and multi-modal tasks, highlighting their potential to tackle\nreal-world challenges.

To address this gap, we present\nTeleAntiFraud-28k, the first open-source audio-text slow-thinking dataset\nspecifically designed for automated telecom fraud analysis. Our dataset is\nconstructed through three strategies: (1) Privacy-preserved text-truth sample\ngeneration using automatically speech recognition (ASR)-transcribed call\nrecordings (with anonymized original audio), ensuring real-world consistency\nthrough text-to-speech (TTS) model regeneration; (2) Semantic enhancement via\nlarge language model (LLM)-based self-instruction sampling on authentic ASR\noutputs to expand scenario coverage; (3) Multi-agent adversarial synthesis that\nsimulates emerging fraud tactics through predefined communication scenarios and\nfraud typologies. The generated dataset contains 28,511 rigorously processed\nspeech-text pairs, complete with detailed annotations for fraud reasoning. The\ndataset is divided into three tasks: scenario classification, fraud detection,\nfraud type classification. Furthermore, we construct TeleAntiFraud-Bench, a\nstandardized evaluation benchmark comprising proportionally sampled instances\nfrom the dataset, to facilitate systematic testing of model performance on\ntelecom fraud detection tasks. We also contribute a production-optimized\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) model trained on hybrid real/synthetic data, while\nopen-sourcing the data processing framework to enable community-driven dataset\nexpansion.

To overcome this, we introduce InfiniteICL, a framework\nthat parallels context and parameters in LLMs with short- and long-term memory\nin human cognitive systems, focusing on transforming temporary context\nknowledge into permanent parameter updates. This approach significantly reduces\nmemory usage, maintains robust performance across varying input lengths, and\ntheoretically enables infinite context integration through the principles of\ncontext knowledge elicitation, selection, and consolidation. Evaluations\ndemonstrate that our method reduces context length by 90% while achieving 103%\naverage performance of full-context prompting across fact recall, grounded\nreasoning, and skill acquisition tasks. When conducting sequential multi-turn\ntransformations on complex, real-world contexts (with length up to 2M tokens),\nour approach surpasses full-context prompting while using only 0.4% of the\noriginal contexts. These findings highlight InfiniteICL's potential to enhance\nthe scalability and efficiency of LLMs by breaking the limitations of\nconventional context window sizes.",

                    "value": "In-context learning (ICL) is critical for large language models (LLMs), but\nits effectiveness is constrained by finite context windows, particularly in\nultra-long contexts. To overcome this, we introduce InfiniteICL, a framework\nthat parallels context and parameters in LLMs with short- and long-term memory\nin human cognitive systems, focusing on transforming temporary context\nknowledge into permanent parameter updates. This approach significantly reduces\nmemory usage, maintains robust performance across varying input lengths, and\ntheoretically enables infinite context integration through the principles of\ncontext knowledge elicitation, selection, and consolidation. Evaluations\ndemonstrate that our method reduces context length by 90% while achieving 103%\naverage performance of full-context prompting across fact recall, grounded\nreasoning, and skill acquisition tasks. When conducting sequential multi-turn\ntransformations on complex, real-world contexts (with length up to 2M tokens),\nour approach surpasses full-context prompting while using only 0.4% of the\noriginal contexts. These findings highlight InfiniteICL's potential to enhance\nthe scalability and efficiency of LLMs by breaking the limitations of\nconventional context window sizes."

The Open-Qwen2VL pre-training is conducted on academic level\n8xA100-40G GPUs at UCSB on 5B packed multimodal tokens, which is 0.36% of 1.4T\nmultimodal pre-training tokens of Qwen2-VL. The final instruction-tuned\nOpen-Qwen2VL outperforms partially-open state-of-the-art MLLM Qwen2-VL-2B on\nvarious multimodal benchmarks of MMBench, SEEDBench, MMstar, and MathVista,\nindicating the remarkable training efficiency of Open-Qwen2VL. We open-source\nall aspects of our work, including compute-efficient and data-efficient\ntraining details, data filtering methods, sequence packing scripts,\npre-training data in WebDataset format, FSDP-based training codebase, and both\nbase and instruction-tuned model checkpoints. We redefine \"fully open\" for\nmultimodal LLMs as the complete release of: 1) the training codebase, 2)\ndetailed data filtering techniques, and 3) all pre-training and supervised\nfine-tuning data used to develop the model."

Our model considers a dynamic\nsystem comprising public and private states, where an observation set of the\npublic state is released. An adversary utilizes the observed public state to\ninfer an uncertainty set of the private state, referred to as the inference\nattack. We define the evolution dynamics of these inference attacks and\nquantify the privacy level of the private state using the volume of its\nuncertainty sets. We then develop an approximate computation method leveraging\ninterval analysis to compute the private state set. We investigate the\nproperties of the proposed volumetric privacy measure and demonstrate that it\nis bounded by the information gain derived from the observation set.\nFurthermore, we propose an optimization approach to designing privacy filter\nusing randomization and linear programming based on the proposed privacy\nmeasure. The effectiveness of the optimal privacy filter design is evaluated\nthrough a production-inventory case study, illustrating its robustness against\ninference attacks and its superiority compared to a truncated Gaussian\nmechanism.",

Our model considers a dynamic\nsystem comprising public and private states, where an observation set of the\npublic state is released. An adversary utilizes the observed public state to\ninfer an uncertainty set of the private state, referred to as the inference\nattack. We define the evolution dynamics of these inference attacks and\nquantify the privacy level of the private state using the volume of its\nuncertainty sets. We then develop an approximate computation method leveraging\ninterval analysis to compute the private state set. We investigate the\nproperties of the proposed volumetric privacy measure and demonstrate that it\nis bounded by the information gain derived from the observation set.\nFurthermore, we propose an optimization approach to designing privacy filter\nusing randomization and linear programming based on the proposed privacy\nmeasure. The effectiveness of the optimal privacy filter design is evaluated\nthrough a production-inventory case study, illustrating its robustness against\ninference attacks and its superiority compared to a truncated Gaussian\nmechanism."

However, these\napproaches often overlook linguistic principles, such as morphological\nsegmentation, which we believe is fundamental for understanding\nlanguage-specific word structure. In this study, we leverage an annotated\nDanish morphological dataset to train a semisupervised model for morphological\nsegmentation, enabling the development of tokenizers optimized for Danish\nmorphology. We evaluate four distinct tokenizers, including two custom\nmorphological tokenizers, by analyzing their performance in morphologically\nsegmenting Danish words. Additionally, we train two generative transformer\nmodels, \\textit{CerebrasGPT-111M} and \\textit{LLaMA-3.2 1B}, using these\ntokenizers and evaluate their downstream performance. Our findings reveal that\nour custom-developed tokenizers substantially enhance morphological\nsegmentation, achieving an F1 score of 58.84, compared to 39.28 achieved by a\nDanish BPE tokenizer. In downstream tasks, models trained with our\nmorphological tokenizers outperform those using BPE tokenizers across different\nevaluation metrics. These results highlight that incorporating Danish\nmorphological segmentation strategies into tokenizers leads to improved\nperformance in generative transformer models on Danish language",

Images from these observations can be difficult to\nreconstruct due to the rapid intra-observational motion and variability of\ntransient jets. We have developed a time-dependent visibility model fitting and\nself-calibration procedure and applied it to a single four-hour VLBA\nobservation of the low-mass X-ray binary Swift J1727.8-1613 during the bright\nflaring period of its 2023 outburst. This allowed us to detect and model a\nslightly resolved self-absorbed compact core, as well as three downstream\ntransient jet knots. We were able to precisely measure the proper motion and\nflux density variability of these three jet knots, as well as (for the first\ntime) their intra-observational expansion. Using simultaneous multi-frequency\ndata, we were also able to measure the spectral index of the furthest\ndownstream jet knot, and the core, as well as the frequency-dependent core\nshift between 2.3 and 8.3 GHz. Using these measurements, we inferred the\nejection dates of the three jet knots, including one to within $\\pm40$ minutes,\nwhich is one of the most precise ever measured. The ejection of the transient\njet knots coincided with a bright X-ray flare and a drastic change in the X-ray\nspectral and timing properties as seen by HXMT, which is the clearest\nassociation ever seen between the launching of transient relativistic jets in\nan X-ray binary and a sudden change in the X-ray properties of the accretion\ninflow.",

Our evaluation results demonstrate that prompt tuning with knowledge\ngenerally outperforms fine-tuning under various experimental settings,\nachieving an average improvement of 87.33% over fine-tuning in data scarcity\nscenarios."

Moreover, traditional evaluation metrics are insufficient for\ncomprehensively evaluating the performance of merging in dense traffic. In\nresponse, we proposed a closed-loop evaluation benchmark for assessing motion\nplanning capabilities in merging scenarios. Our approach involves other\nvehicles trained in large scale datasets with micro-behavioral characteristics\nthat significantly enhance the complexity and diversity. Additionally, we have\nrestructured the evaluation mechanism by leveraging Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to assess each autonomous vehicle merging onto the main lane. Extensive\nexperiments and test-vehicle deployment have demonstrated the progressiveness\nof this benchmark. Through this benchmark, we have obtained an evaluation of\nexisting methods and identified common issues.

                    "value": "While the capabilities of autonomous driving have advanced rapidly, merging\ninto dense traffic remains a significant challenge, many motion planning\nmethods for this scenario have been proposed but it is hard to evaluate them.\nMost existing closed-loop simulators rely on rule-based controls for other\nvehicles, which results in a lack of diversity and randomness, thus failing to\naccurately assess the motion planning capabilities in highly interactive\nscenarios. Moreover, traditional evaluation metrics are insufficient for\ncomprehensively evaluating the performance of merging in dense traffic. In\nresponse, we proposed a closed-loop evaluation benchmark for assessing motion\nplanning capabilities in merging scenarios. Our approach involves other\nvehicles trained in large scale datasets with micro-behavioral characteristics\nthat significantly enhance the complexity and diversity. Additionally, we have\nrestructured the evaluation mechanism by leveraging Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to assess each autonomous vehicle merging onto the main lane. Extensive\nexperiments and test-vehicle deployment have demonstrated the progressiveness\nof this benchmark. Through this benchmark, we have obtained an evaluation of\nexisting methods and identified common issues.

We show that LLMs possess linear representations of political\nperspectives within activation space, wherein more similar perspectives are\nrepresented closer together. To do so, we probe the attention heads across the\nlayers of three open transformer-based LLMs (Llama-2-7b-chat,\nMistral-7b-instruct, Vicuna-7b). We first prompt models to generate text from\nthe perspectives of different U.S. lawmakers. We then identify sets of\nattention heads whose activations linearly predict those lawmakers' DW-NOMINATE\nscores, a widely-used and validated measure of political ideology. We find that\nhighly predictive heads are primarily located in the middle layers, often\nspeculated to encode high-level concepts and tasks. Using probes only trained\nto predict lawmakers' ideology, we then show that the same probes can predict\nmeasures of news outlets' slant from the activations of models prompted to\nsimulate text from those news outlets. These linear probes allow us to\nvisualize, interpret, and monitor ideological stances implicitly adopted by an\nLLM as it generates open-ended responses. Finally, we demonstrate that by\napplying linear interventions to these attention heads, we can steer the model\noutputs toward a more liberal or conservative stance. Overall, our research\nsuggests that LLMs possess a high-level linear representation of American\npolitical ideology and that by leveraging recent advances in mechanistic\ninterpretability, we can identify, monitor, and steer the subjective\nperspective underlying generated text.",

We find that\nhighly predictive heads are primarily located in the middle layers, often\nspeculated to encode high-level concepts and tasks. Using probes only trained\nto predict lawmakers' ideology, we then show that the same probes can predict\nmeasures of news outlets' slant from the activations of models prompted to\nsimulate text from those news outlets. These linear probes allow us to\nvisualize, interpret, and monitor ideological stances implicitly adopted by an\nLLM as it generates open-ended responses. Finally, we demonstrate that by\napplying linear interventions to these attention heads, we can steer the model\noutputs toward a more liberal or conservative stance. Overall, our research\nsuggests that LLMs possess a high-level linear representation of American\npolitical ideology and that by leveraging recent advances in mechanistic\ninterpretability, we can identify, monitor, and steer the subjective\nperspective underlying generated text."

We perform a series of experiments\nthat support these conjectures. Our exploration leads to a model design based\non JEPA (Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture) that for the first time\nbreaks the Reversal Curse without side-stepping it with specialized data\naugmentation or non-causal masking, and moreover, generalization could be\nfurther improved by incorporating special memory layers that support\ndisentangled concept representations.

Built\non three core principles -- diversity, deliberative reasoning, and rigorous\nfiltering -- STAR-1 aims to address the critical needs for safety alignment in\nLRMs. Specifically, we begin by integrating existing open-source safety\ndatasets from diverse sources. Then, we curate safety policies to generate\npolicy-grounded deliberative reasoning samples. Lastly, we apply a GPT-4o-based\nsafety scoring system to select training examples aligned with best practices.\nExperimental results show that fine-tuning LRMs with STAR-1 leads to an average\n40% improvement in safety performance across four benchmarks, while only\nincurring a marginal decrease (e.g., an average of 1.1%) in reasoning ability\nmeasured across five reasoning tasks. Extensive ablation studies further\nvalidate the importance of our design principles in constructing STAR-1 and\nanalyze its efficacy across both LRMs and traditional LLMs. Our project page is\nhttps://ucsc-vlaa.github.io/STAR-1.",

However, the overall\nperformance of RAG system depends on many components: (1) retrieval corpora,\n(2) retrieval algorithms, (3) rerankers, (4) LLM backbones, and (5) evaluation\nmetrics. Here we propose LRAGE, an open-source tool for holistic evaluation of\nRAG systems focusing on the legal domain. LRAGE provides GUI and CLI interfaces\nto facilitate seamless experiments and investigate how changes in the\naforementioned five components affect the overall accuracy. We validated LRAGE\nusing multilingual legal benches including Korean (KBL), English (LegalBench),\nand Chinese (LawBench) by demonstrating how the overall accuracy changes when\nvarying the five components mentioned above.

                    "value": "Recently, building retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to enhance\nthe capability of large language models (LLMs) has become a common practice.\nEspecially in the legal domain, previous judicial decisions play a significant\nrole under the doctrine of stare decisis which emphasizes the importance of\nmaking decisions based on (retrieved) prior documents. However, the overall\nperformance of RAG system depends on many components: (1) retrieval corpora,\n(2) retrieval algorithms, (3) rerankers, (4) LLM backbones, and (5) evaluation\nmetrics. Here we propose LRAGE, an open-source tool for holistic evaluation of\nRAG systems focusing on the legal domain. LRAGE provides GUI and CLI interfaces\nto facilitate seamless experiments and investigate how changes in the\naforementioned five components affect the overall accuracy. We validated LRAGE\nusing multilingual legal benches including Korean (KBL), English (LegalBench),\nand Chinese (LawBench) by demonstrating how the overall accuracy changes when\nvarying the five components mentioned above. The source code is available at\nhttps://github.com/hoorangyee/LRAGE."

We evaluate closed- and open-source VLM systems and\nobserve that even the state-of-the-art VLM system struggles with tasks\nrelatively easy for human Blender users. Enabled by BlenderGym, we study how\ninference scaling techniques impact VLM's performance on graphics editing\ntasks. Notably, our findings reveal that the verifier used to guide the scaling\nof generation can itself be improved through inference scaling, complementing\nrecent insights on inference scaling of LLM generation in coding and math\ntasks. We further show that inference compute is not uniformly effective and\ncan be optimized by strategically distributing it between generation and\nverification.",

Traditional clinical\nassessments often face limitations in accessibility, objectivity, and\nconsistency. This paper investigates the potential of multimodal machine\nlearning to address these challenges, leveraging the complementary information\navailable in text, audio, and video data. Our approach involves a comprehensive\nanalysis of various data preprocessing techniques, including novel chunking and\nutterance-based formatting strategies. We systematically evaluate a range of\nstate-of-the-art embedding models for each modality and employ Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs) and Bidirectional LSTM Networks (BiLSTMs) for feature\nextraction. We explore data-level, feature-level, and decision-level fusion\ntechniques, including a novel integration of Large Language Model (LLM)\npredictions. We also investigate the impact of replacing Multilayer Perceptron\nclassifiers with Support Vector Machines. We extend our analysis to severity\nprediction using PHQ-8 and PCL-C scores and multi-class classification\n(considering co-occurring conditions). Our results demonstrate that\nutterance-based chunking significantly improves performance, particularly for\ntext and audio modalities. Decision-level fusion, incorporating LLM\npredictions, achieves the highest accuracy, with a balanced accuracy of 94.8%\nfor depression and 96.2% for PTSD detection. The combination of CNN-BiLSTM\narchitectures with utterance-level chunking, coupled with the integration of\nexternal LLM, provides a powerful and nuanced approach to the detection and\nassessment of mental health conditions. Our findings highlight the potential of\nMMML for developing more accurate, accessible, and personalized mental\nhealthcare tools.",

Our dataset is\nconstructed through three strategies: (1) Privacy-preserved text-truth sample\ngeneration using automatically speech recognition (ASR)-transcribed call\nrecordings (with anonymized original audio), ensuring real-world consistency\nthrough text-to-speech (TTS) model regeneration; (2) Semantic enhancement via\nlarge language model (LLM)-based self-instruction sampling on authentic ASR\noutputs to expand scenario coverage; (3) Multi-agent adversarial synthesis that\nsimulates emerging fraud tactics through predefined communication scenarios and\nfraud typologies. The generated dataset contains 28,511 rigorously processed\nspeech-text pairs, complete with detailed annotations for fraud reasoning. The\ndataset is divided into three tasks: scenario classification, fraud detection,\nfraud type classification. Furthermore, we construct TeleAntiFraud-Bench, a\nstandardized evaluation benchmark comprising proportionally sampled instances\nfrom the dataset, to facilitate systematic testing of model performance on\ntelecom fraud detection tasks. We also contribute a production-optimized\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) model trained on hybrid real/synthetic data, while\nopen-sourcing the data processing framework to enable community-driven dataset\nexpansion. This work establishes a foundational framework for multimodal\nanti-fraud research while addressing critical challenges in data privacy and\nscenario diversity.

Our findings reveal that\nour custom-developed tokenizers substantially enhance morphological\nsegmentation, achieving an F1 score of 58.84, compared to 39.28 achieved by a\nDanish BPE tokenizer.

To mitigate these challenges, this\npaper proposes the Chain of Correction (CoC) for full-text error correction\nwith LLMs, which corrects errors segment by segment using pre-recognized text\nas guidance within a regular multi-turn chat format. The CoC also uses\npre-recognized full text for context, allowing the model to better grasp global\nsemantics and maintain a comprehensive overview of the entire content.\nUtilizing the open-sourced full-text error correction dataset ChFT, we\nfine-tune a pre-trained LLM to evaluate the performance of the CoC framework.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the CoC effectively corrects errors in\nfull-text ASR outputs, significantly outperforming baseline and benchmark\nsystems. We further analyze how to set the correction threshold to balance\nunder-correction and over-rephrasing, extrapolate the CoC model on extremely\nlong ASR outputs, and investigate whether other types of information can be\nemployed to guide the error correction process.",

                    "value": "Full-text error correction with Large Language Models (LLMs) for Automatic\nSpeech Recognition (ASR) has gained increased attention due to its potential to\ncorrect errors across long contexts and address a broader spectrum of error\ntypes, including punctuation restoration and inverse text normalization.\nNevertheless, many challenges persist, including issues related to stability,\ncontrollability, completeness, and fluency. To mitigate these challenges, this\npaper proposes the Chain of Correction (CoC) for full-text error correction\nwith LLMs, which corrects errors segment by segment using pre-recognized text\nas guidance within a regular multi-turn chat format. The CoC also uses\npre-recognized full text for context, allowing the model to better grasp global\nsemantics and maintain a comprehensive overview of the entire content.\nUtilizing the open-sourced full-text error correction dataset ChFT, we\nfine-tune a pre-trained LLM to evaluate the performance of the CoC framework.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the CoC effectively corrects errors in\nfull-text ASR outputs, significantly outperforming baseline and benchmark\nsystems. We further analyze how to set the correction threshold to balance\nunder-correction and over-rephrasing, extrapolate the CoC model on extremely\nlong ASR outputs, and investigate whether other types of information can be\nemployed to guide the error correction process."

                "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate text\nthat realistically reflects a range of different subjective human perspectives.\nThis paper studies how LLMs are seemingly able to reflect more liberal versus\nmore conservative viewpoints among other political perspectives in American\npolitics. We show that LLMs possess linear representations of political\nperspectives within activation space, wherein more similar perspectives are\nrepresented closer together. To do so, we probe the attention heads across the\nlayers of three open transformer-based LLMs (Llama-2-7b-chat,\nMistral-7b-instruct, Vicuna-7b). We first prompt models to generate text from\nthe perspectives of different U.S. lawmakers. We then identify sets of\nattention heads whose activations linearly predict those lawmakers' DW-NOMINATE\nscores, a widely-used and validated measure of political ideology. We find that\nhighly predictive heads are primarily located in the middle layers, often\nspeculated to encode high-level concepts and tasks. Using probes only trained\nto predict lawmakers' ideology, we then show that the same probes can predict\nmeasures of news outlets' slant from the activations of models prompted to\nsimulate text from those news outlets.

We show that LLMs possess linear representations of political\nperspectives within activation space, wherein more similar perspectives are\nrepresented closer together. To do so, we probe the attention heads across the\nlayers of three open transformer-based LLMs (Llama-2-7b-chat,\nMistral-7b-instruct, Vicuna-7b). We first prompt models to generate text from\nthe perspectives of different U.S. lawmakers. We then identify sets of\nattention heads whose activations linearly predict those lawmakers' DW-NOMINATE\nscores, a widely-used and validated measure of political ideology. We find that\nhighly predictive heads are primarily located in the middle layers, often\nspeculated to encode high-level concepts and tasks. Using probes only trained\nto predict lawmakers' ideology, we then show that the same probes can predict\nmeasures of news outlets' slant from the activations of models prompted to\nsimulate text from those news outlets. These linear probes allow us to\nvisualize, interpret, and monitor ideological stances implicitly adopted by an\nLLM as it generates open-ended responses. Finally, we demonstrate that by\napplying linear interventions to these attention heads, we can steer the model\noutputs toward a more liberal or conservative stance.

The conventional approaches extended from optimization\nperspectives are usually quite involved, especially when jointly considering\nfactors in different scales such as deployment and transmission in UAV-related\nscenarios. In this paper, we address the UAV-enabled multi-user secure\ncommunications by proposing a deep graph reinforcement learning framework.\nSpecifically, we reinterpret the security beamforming as a graph neural network\n(GNN) learning task, where mutual interference among users is managed through\nthe message-passing mechanism. Then, the UAV deployment is obtained through\nsoft actor-critic reinforcement learning, where the GNN-based security\nbeamforming is exploited to guide the deployment strategy update. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves near-optimal security\nperformance and significantly enhances the efficiency of strategy\ndetermination. Moreover, the deep graph reinforcement learning framework offers\na scalable solution, adaptable to various network scenarios and configurations,\nestablishing a robust basis for information security in UAV-enabled\ncommunications.",

                    "value": "While unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with flexible mobility are envisioned\nto enhance physical layer security in wireless communications, the efficient\nsecurity design that adapts to such high network dynamics is rather\nchallenging. The conventional approaches extended from optimization\nperspectives are usually quite involved, especially when jointly considering\nfactors in different scales such as deployment and transmission in UAV-related\nscenarios. In this paper, we address the UAV-enabled multi-user secure\ncommunications by proposing a deep graph reinforcement learning framework.\nSpecifically, we reinterpret the security beamforming as a graph neural network\n(GNN) learning task, where mutual interference among users is managed through\nthe message-passing mechanism. Then, the UAV deployment is obtained through\nsoft actor-critic reinforcement learning, where the GNN-based security\nbeamforming is exploited to guide the deployment strategy update. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves near-optimal security\nperformance and significantly enhances the efficiency of strategy\ndetermination. Moreover, the deep graph reinforcement learning framework offers\na scalable solution, adaptable to various network scenarios and configurations,\nestablishing a robust basis for information security in UAV-enabled\ncommunications."

To explore\nthese issues, we introduce a benchmark, FAIRE (Fairness Assessment In Resume\nEvaluation), to test for racial and gender bias in large language models (LLMs)\nused to evaluate resumes across different industries. We use two methods-direct\nscoring and ranking-to measure how model performance changes when resumes are\nslightly altered to reflect different racial or gender identities. Our findings\nreveal that while every model exhibits some degree of bias, the magnitude and\ndirection vary considerably. This benchmark provides a clear way to examine\nthese differences and offers valuable insights into the fairness of AI-based\nhiring tools. It highlights the urgent need for strategies to reduce bias in\nAI-driven recruitment.

                    "value": "In an era where AI-driven hiring is transforming recruitment practices,\nconcerns about fairness and bias have become increasingly important. To explore\nthese issues, we introduce a benchmark, FAIRE (Fairness Assessment In Resume\nEvaluation), to test for racial and gender bias in large language models (LLMs)\nused to evaluate resumes across different industries. We use two methods-direct\nscoring and ranking-to measure how model performance changes when resumes are\nslightly altered to reflect different racial or gender identities. Our findings\nreveal that while every model exhibits some degree of bias, the magnitude and\ndirection vary considerably. This benchmark provides a clear way to examine\nthese differences and offers valuable insights into the fairness of AI-based\nhiring tools. It highlights the urgent need for strategies to reduce bias in\nAI-driven recruitment.

With the advent of large language models (LLMs), industrial search\nsystems have started to employ LLMs to generate identifiers for product\nretrieval. Commonly used identifiers include (1) static/semantic IDs and (2)\nproduct term sets. The first approach requires creating a product ID system\nfrom scratch, missing out on the world knowledge embedded within LLMs. While\nthe second approach leverages this general knowledge, the significant\ndifference in word distribution between queries and products means that\nproduct-based identifiers often do not align well with user search queries,\nleading to missed product recalls. Furthermore, when queries contain numerous\nattributes, these algorithms generate a large number of identifiers, making it\ndifficult to assess their quality, which results in low overall recall\nefficiency.\n  To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel e-commerce\nretrieval paradigm: the Generative Retrieval and Alignment Model (GRAM). GRAM\nemploys joint training on text information from both queries and products to\ngenerate shared text identifier codes, effectively bridging the gap between\nqueries and products. This approach not only enhances the connection between\nqueries and products but also improves inference efficiency. The model uses a\nco-alignment strategy to generate codes optimized for maximizing retrieval\nefficiency. Additionally, it introduces a query-product scoring mechanism to\ncompare product values across different codes, further boosting retrieval\nefficiency. Extensive offline and online A/B testing demonstrates that GRAM\nsignificantly outperforms traditional models and the latest generative\nretrieval models, confirming its effectiveness and practicality.",

                "summary": "The advent of edge intelligence and escalating concerns for data privacy\nprotection have sparked a surge of interest in device-cloud collaborative\ncomputing. Large-scale device deployments to validate prototype solutions are\noften prohibitively expensive and practically challenging, resulting in a\npronounced demand for simulation tools that can emulate realworld scenarios.\nHowever, existing simulators predominantly rely solely on high-performance\nservers to emulate edge computing devices, overlooking (1) the discrepancies\nbetween virtual computing units and actual heterogeneous computing devices and\n(2) the simulation of device behaviors in real-world environments. In this\npaper, we propose a high-fidelity device simulation platform, called SimDC,\nwhich uses a hybrid heterogeneous resource and integrates high-performance\nservers and physical mobile phones. Utilizing this platform, developers can\nsimulate numerous devices for functional testing cost-effectively and capture\nprecise operational responses from varied real devices. To simulate real\nbehaviors of heterogeneous devices, we offer a configurable device behavior\ntraffic controller that dispatches results on devices to the cloud using a\nuser-defined operation strategy. Comprehensive experiments on the public\ndataset show the effectiveness of our simulation platform and its great\npotential for application.

                    "value": "The advent of edge intelligence and escalating concerns for data privacy\nprotection have sparked a surge of interest in device-cloud collaborative\ncomputing. Large-scale device deployments to validate prototype solutions are\noften prohibitively expensive and practically challenging, resulting in a\npronounced demand for simulation tools that can emulate realworld scenarios.\nHowever, existing simulators predominantly rely solely on high-performance\nservers to emulate edge computing devices, overlooking (1) the discrepancies\nbetween virtual computing units and actual heterogeneous computing devices and\n(2) the simulation of device behaviors in real-world environments. In this\npaper, we propose a high-fidelity device simulation platform, called SimDC,\nwhich uses a hybrid heterogeneous resource and integrates high-performance\nservers and physical mobile phones. Utilizing this platform, developers can\nsimulate numerous devices for functional testing cost-effectively and capture\nprecise operational responses from varied real devices. To simulate real\nbehaviors of heterogeneous devices, we offer a configurable device behavior\ntraffic controller that dispatches results on devices to the cloud using a\nuser-defined operation strategy. Comprehensive experiments on the public\ndataset show the effectiveness of our simulation platform and its great\npotential for application.

To address these questions, our study\nintroduces a granular meta-evaluation testbed, APPLS, designed to evaluate\nmetrics for PLS. We identify four PLS criteria from previous work --\ninformativeness, simplification, coherence, and faithfulness -- and define a\nset of perturbations corresponding to these criteria that sensitive metrics\nshould be able to detect. We apply these perturbations to extractive hypotheses\nfor two PLS datasets to form our testbed. Using APPLS, we assess performance of\n14 metrics, including automated scores, lexical features, and LLM prompt-based\nevaluations. Our analysis reveals that while some current metrics show\nsensitivity to specific criteria, no single method captures all four criteria\nsimultaneously. We therefore recommend a suite of automated metrics be used to\ncapture PLS quality along all relevant criteria.
