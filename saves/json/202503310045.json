                "summary": "Latency is a major concern for web rendering engines like those in Chrome,\nSafari, and Firefox. These engines reduce latency by using an incremental\nlayout algorithm to redraw the page when the user interacts with it. In such an\nalgorithm, elements that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty; only the dirty\nelements need be processed to draw the next frame, dramatically reducing\nlatency. However, the standard incremental layout algorithm must search the\npage for dirty elements, accessing a number of auxiliary elements in the\nprocess. These auxiliary elements add cache misses and stalled cycles, and are\nresponsible for a sizable fraction of all layout latency. We introduce a new,\nfaster incremental layout algorithm called Spineless Traversal. Spineless\nTraversal uses a more computationally demanding priority queue algorithm to\navoid the need to access auxiliary nodes and thus reduces cache traffic and\nstalls. This leads to dramatic speedups on the most latency-critical\ninteractions such as hovering, typing, or animations. Moreover, thanks to\nnumerous low-level optimizations, we are able to make Spineless Traversal\ncompetitive across the whole spectrum of incremental layout workloads.

                    "value": "Latency is a major concern for web rendering engines like those in Chrome,\nSafari, and Firefox. These engines reduce latency by using an incremental\nlayout algorithm to redraw the page when the user interacts with it. In such an\nalgorithm, elements that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty; only the dirty\nelements need be processed to draw the next frame, dramatically reducing\nlatency. However, the standard incremental layout algorithm must search the\npage for dirty elements, accessing a number of auxiliary elements in the\nprocess. These auxiliary elements add cache misses and stalled cycles, and are\nresponsible for a sizable fraction of all layout latency. We introduce a new,\nfaster incremental layout algorithm called Spineless Traversal. Spineless\nTraversal uses a more computationally demanding priority queue algorithm to\navoid the need to access auxiliary nodes and thus reduces cache traffic and\nstalls. This leads to dramatic speedups on the most latency-critical\ninteractions such as hovering, typing, or animations. Moreover, thanks to\nnumerous low-level optimizations, we are able to make Spineless Traversal\ncompetitive across the whole spectrum of incremental layout workloads. As a\nresult, across 2216 benchmarks, Spineless Traversal is faster on 78.2% of the\nbenchmark, with a mean speedup of 3.23x concentrated in the most\nlatency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, and animations."

Among these tricks, the most challenging is the precise\ntuning of adversarial training with additional Generative Adversarial Networks\n(GANs) in the final stage, which can hinder stable convergence. In contrast to\nGANs, diffusion models offer more stable training processes and can generate\nhigher-quality results.

The encoder compresses\nspatio-temporal information into compact latents, while the decoder\nreconstructs videos through a reverse diffusion process conditioned on these\nlatents. During inference, we incorporate a feature cache mechanism to generate\nvideos of arbitrary length while maintaining temporal continuity and adopt\nsampling acceleration technique to enhance efficiency. Trained using only a\nbasic MSE diffusion loss for reconstruction, along with KL term and LPIPS\nperceptual loss from scratch, extensive experiments demonstrate that CDT\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in video reconstruction tasks with just a\nsingle-step sampling.

Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used\ntechnique to reduce latency losslessly, but the conventional wisdom suggests\nthat its efficacy is limited to small batch sizes. In MagicDec, we show that\nsurprisingly SD can achieve speedup even for a high throughput inference regime\nfor moderate to long sequences.

MagicDec first identifies the bottleneck shifts with\nincreasing batch size and sequence length, and uses these insights to deploy SD\nmore effectively for high throughput inference. We leverage draft model with\nsparse KV cache to address the KV bottleneck, which scales with both sequence\nlength and batch size. Additionally, we propose a theoretical model to select\nthe optimal drafting strategy for maximum speedup. Our work highlights the\nbroad applicability of speculative decoding in long-context serving, as it can\nenhance throughput and reduce latency without compromising accuracy.

While existing techniques are effective for\ntraining, they fail to address the unique challenges of inference, such as\nvarying prefill and decode phases and their associated latency constraints --\nlike Time to First Token (TTFT) and Time per Output Token (TPOT). Furthermore,\nno long-context inference solutions address head-of-line blocking today.\n  We present Medha, a system for efficient long-context LLM inference that\nintroduces three key innovations: adaptive chunking with slack-aware scheduling\nto prevent head-ofline blocking, Sequence Pipeline Parallelism (SPP) to reduce\nTTFT, and KV Cache Parallelism (KVP) to minimize TPOT. By combining these into\na novel 3D parallelism serving engine, Medha achieves unprecedented scale --\nsupporting contexts up to 10M tokens with production-grade latency. Our\nevaluation shows Medha reduces median latency by up to 30x compared to\nstate-of-the-art systems when serving a mix of short and long requests, while\nimproving throughput by upwards of 5x. This enables, for the first time,\nefficient long-context LLM inference at scale without compromising on shorter\nrequest latencies or system efficiency.",

                    "value": "As large language models (LLMs) handle increasingly longer contexts, serving\ninference requests for context lengths in the range of millions of tokens\npresents unique challenges. While existing techniques are effective for\ntraining, they fail to address the unique challenges of inference, such as\nvarying prefill and decode phases and their associated latency constraints --\nlike Time to First Token (TTFT) and Time per Output Token (TPOT). Furthermore,\nno long-context inference solutions address head-of-line blocking today.\n  We present Medha, a system for efficient long-context LLM inference that\nintroduces three key innovations: adaptive chunking with slack-aware scheduling\nto prevent head-ofline blocking, Sequence Pipeline Parallelism (SPP) to reduce\nTTFT, and KV Cache Parallelism (KVP) to minimize TPOT. By combining these into\na novel 3D parallelism serving engine, Medha achieves unprecedented scale --\nsupporting contexts up to 10M tokens with production-grade latency. Our\nevaluation shows Medha reduces median latency by up to 30x compared to\nstate-of-the-art systems when serving a mix of short and long requests, while\nimproving throughput by upwards of 5x. This enables, for the first time,\nefficient long-context LLM inference at scale without compromising on shorter\nrequest latencies or system efficiency."

This\nversion introduces vision understanding abilities, a wider coverage of\nlanguages and longer context - at least 128K tokens. We also change the\narchitecture of the model to reduce the KV-cache memory that tends to explode\nwith long context. This is achieved by increasing the ratio of local to global\nattention layers, and keeping the span on local attention short. The Gemma 3\nmodels are trained with distillation and achieve superior performance to Gemma\n2 for both pre-trained and instruction finetuned versions. In particular, our\nnovel post-training recipe significantly improves the math, chat,\ninstruction-following and multilingual abilities, making Gemma3-4B-IT\ncompetitive with Gemma2-27B-IT and Gemma3-27B-IT comparable to Gemini-1.5-Pro\nacross benchmarks. We release all our models to the community.",

The complexity of applications results in a wide variety of memory\naccess patterns, prompting the development of numerous cache-prefetching\nalgorithms. Consequently, commercial processors often employ a hybrid of these\nalgorithms to enhance the overall prefetching performance. Nonetheless, since\nthese prefetchers share hardware resources, conflicts arising from competing\nprefetching requests can negate the benefits of hardware prefetching. Under\nsuch circumstances, several prefetcher selection algorithms have been proposed\nto mitigate conflicts between prefetchers. However, these prior solutions\nsuffer from two limitations. First, the input demand request allocation is\ninaccurate. Second, the prefetcher selection criteria are coarse-grained.\n  In this paper, we address both limitations by introducing an efficient and\nwidely applicable prefetcher selection algorithm--Alecto, which tailors the\ndemand requests for each prefetcher. Every demand request is first sent to\nAlecto to identify suitable prefetchers before being routed to prefetchers for\ntraining and prefetching. Our analysis shows that Alecto is adept at not only\nharmonizing prefetching accuracy, coverage, and timeliness but also\nsignificantly enhancing the utilization of the prefetcher table, which is vital\nfor temporal prefetching. Alecto outperforms the state-of-the-art RL-based\nprefetcher selection algorithm--Bandit by 2.76% in single-core, and 7.56% in\neight-core. For memory-intensive benchmarks, Alecto outperforms Bandit by\n5.25%. Alecto consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance in scheduling\nvarious types of cache prefetchers. In addition to the performance improvement,\nAlecto can reduce the energy consumption associated with accessing the\nprefetchers' table by 48%, while only adding less than 1 KB of storage\noverhead.",

                "summary": "The growing adoption of long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) has\nintroduced significant memory and computational challenges in autoregressive\ndecoding due to the expanding Key-Value (KV) cache. KV cache quantization has\nemerged as a promising solution, with prior work showing that 4-bit or even\n2-bit quantization can maintain model accuracy while reducing memory costs.\nHowever, despite these benefits, preliminary implementations for the low-bit KV\ncache struggle to deliver the expected speedup due to quantization and\ndequantization overheads and the lack of Tensor Cores utilization. In this\nwork, we propose BitDecoding, a GPU-optimized framework that unlocks Tensor\nCores for efficient decoding with low-bit KV cache. Efficiently leveraging\nTensor Cores for low-bit KV cache is challenging due to the dynamic nature of\nKV cache generation at each decoding step. BitDecoding addresses these\nchallenges with a Tensor Cores-Centric BitFusion Scheme that ensures data\nlayout compatibility to enable high utilization of Tensor Cores. Additionally,\nBitDecoding incorporates a warp-efficient parallel decoding kernel and a\nfine-grained asynchronous pipeline, minimizing dequantization overhead and\nimproving computational efficiency. Experiments show that BitDecoding achieves\nup to 7.5x speedup on RTX 4090, 4.8x on A100, and 8.9x on H100, compared to\nFP16 FlashDecoding-v2.

                    "value": "The growing adoption of long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) has\nintroduced significant memory and computational challenges in autoregressive\ndecoding due to the expanding Key-Value (KV) cache. KV cache quantization has\nemerged as a promising solution, with prior work showing that 4-bit or even\n2-bit quantization can maintain model accuracy while reducing memory costs.\nHowever, despite these benefits, preliminary implementations for the low-bit KV\ncache struggle to deliver the expected speedup due to quantization and\ndequantization overheads and the lack of Tensor Cores utilization. In this\nwork, we propose BitDecoding, a GPU-optimized framework that unlocks Tensor\nCores for efficient decoding with low-bit KV cache. Efficiently leveraging\nTensor Cores for low-bit KV cache is challenging due to the dynamic nature of\nKV cache generation at each decoding step. BitDecoding addresses these\nchallenges with a Tensor Cores-Centric BitFusion Scheme that ensures data\nlayout compatibility to enable high utilization of Tensor Cores. Additionally,\nBitDecoding incorporates a warp-efficient parallel decoding kernel and a\nfine-grained asynchronous pipeline, minimizing dequantization overhead and\nimproving computational efficiency. Experiments show that BitDecoding achieves\nup to 7.5x speedup on RTX 4090, 4.8x on A100, and 8.9x on H100, compared to\nFP16 FlashDecoding-v2. It also outperforms the state-of-the-art low-bit KV\ncache implementation (QServe) by up to 4.3x.

Cache-aided STNs\nare acknowledged as a promising paradigm for accelerating content delivery to\nusers and alleviating the load of backhaul links. However, the dynamic nature\nof low earth orbit (LEO) satellites and the complex interference among\nsatellite beams and terrestrial base stations pose challenges in effectively\nmanaging limited edge resources. To address these issues, this paper proposes a\nmethod for dynamically scheduling caching and communication resources, aiming\nto reduce network costs in terms of transmission power consumption and backhaul\ntraffic, while meeting user QoS demands and resource constraints.

                    "value": "With the burgeoning demand for data-intensive services, satellite-terrestrial\nnetworks (STNs) face increasing backhaul link congestion, deteriorating user\nquality of service (QoS), and escalating power consumption. Cache-aided STNs\nare acknowledged as a promising paradigm for accelerating content delivery to\nusers and alleviating the load of backhaul links. However, the dynamic nature\nof low earth orbit (LEO) satellites and the complex interference among\nsatellite beams and terrestrial base stations pose challenges in effectively\nmanaging limited edge resources. To address these issues, this paper proposes a\nmethod for dynamically scheduling caching and communication resources, aiming\nto reduce network costs in terms of transmission power consumption and backhaul\ntraffic, while meeting user QoS demands and resource constraints.

Specifically, we\npropose (1) a two-stage efficient generation framework to reduce computational\ncost by 8.1x, (2) a fine-grained inter-frame caching to reduce redundant\ncomputations by 16.6\\%, (3) system-level optimizations to further enhance\nefficiency. The evaluations demonstrate that compared with the original\nPromptus, PromptMobile achieves a 13.6x increase in image generation speed.\nCompared with other streaming methods, PromptMobile achives an average LPIPS\nimprovement of 0.016 (compared with H.265), reducing 60\\% of severely distorted\nframes (compared to VQGAN)."

                "summary": "Sparse triangular solve (SpTRSV) is widely used in various domains. Numerous\nstudies have been conducted using CPUs, GPUs, and specific hardware\naccelerators, where dataflows can be categorized into coarse and fine\ngranularity. Coarse dataflows offer good spatial locality but suffer from low\nparallelism, while fine dataflows provide high parallelism but disrupt the\nspatial structure, leading to increased nodes and poor data reuse. This paper\nproposes a novel hardware accelerator for SpTRSV or SpTRSV-like DAGs.

Rather than optimising memory\npatterns with high overhead and poor portability, NVR adapts runahead execution\nto the unique architecture of NPUs. NVR provides a general micro-architectural\nsolution for sparse DNN workloads without requiring compiler or algorithmic\nsupport, operating as a decoupled, speculative, lightweight hardware sub-thread\nalongside the NPU, with minimal hardware overhead (under 5%). NVR achieves an\naverage 90% reduction in cache misses compared to SOTA prefetching in\ngeneral-purpose processors, delivering 4x average speedup on sparse workloads\nversus NPUs without prefetching.

CAKE also\nemploys a new eviction indicator that considers the shifting importance of\ntokens over time, addressing limitations in existing methods that overlook\ntemporal dynamics. Comprehensive experiments on LongBench and NeedleBench show\nthat CAKE maintains model performance with only 3.2% of the KV cache and\nconsistently outperforms current baselines across various models and memory\nconstraints, particularly in low-memory settings. Additionally, CAKE achieves\nover 10x speedup in decoding latency compared to full cache when processing\ncontexts of 128K tokens with FlashAttention-2.

During generation, temporary representations -stored in the\nso-called KV cache-account for a large portion of GPU memory usage and scale\nlinearly with context length. We introduce KV-Distill, a Transformer\ncompression framework that distills long context KV caches into significantly\nshorter representations in a question-independent fashion. KV-Distill can be\ntrained as a parameter-efficient adaptor for pretrained models, and enables the\ncompression of arbitrary spans of a context while preserving pre-trained model\ncapabilities. We treat a compressed-uncompressed cache as a student-teacher\npairing and apply a KL-type divergence to match the generated outputs.\nKV-Distill outperforms other compression techniques in worst-case extractive\ntasks and approaches uncompressed performance in long context question\nanswering and summarization, and it can be fine-tuned on domain-specific\ncontexts to reduce lengths by up to 99% while preserving downstream\nperformance.

During generation, temporary representations -stored in the\nso-called KV cache-account for a large portion of GPU memory usage and scale\nlinearly with context length. We introduce KV-Distill, a Transformer\ncompression framework that distills long context KV caches into significantly\nshorter representations in a question-independent fashion. KV-Distill can be\ntrained as a parameter-efficient adaptor for pretrained models, and enables the\ncompression of arbitrary spans of a context while preserving pre-trained model\ncapabilities. We treat a compressed-uncompressed cache as a student-teacher\npairing and apply a KL-type divergence to match the generated outputs.\nKV-Distill outperforms other compression techniques in worst-case extractive\ntasks and approaches uncompressed performance in long context question\nanswering and summarization, and it can be fine-tuned on domain-specific\ncontexts to reduce lengths by up to 99% while preserving downstream\nperformance. We demonstrate the generalizability of KV-Distill across various\nmodel sizes and architectures."

In this paper, we investigate Intel's recently introduced\ncldemote extension, which promotes efficient data sharing by transferring cache\nlines from upper-level caches to the Last Level Cache (LLC). Despite its\nperformance benefits, we uncover critical properties-unprivileged access,\ninter-cache state transition, and fault suppression-that render cldemote\nexploitable for microarchitectural attacks. We propose two new attack\nprimitives, Flush+Demote and Demote+Time, built on our analysis. Flush+Demote\nconstructs a covert channel with a bandwidth of 2.84 Mbps and a bit error rate\nof 0.018%, while Demote+Time derandomizes the kernel base address in 2.49 ms on\nLinux. Furthermore, we show that leveraging cldemote accelerates eviction set\nconstruction in non-inclusive LLC designs by obviating the need for helper\nthreads or extensive cache conflicts, thereby reducing construction time by 36%\nyet retaining comparable success rates. Finally, we examine how ISA extensions\ncontribute to broader microarchitectural attacks, identifying five key\nexploitable characteristics and categorizing four distinct attack types. We\nalso discuss potential countermeasures, highlighting the far-reaching security\nimplications of emerging ISA extensions.",

Then, using the same LLM, the second forward pass processes the\nlanguage instruction(s) alongside the summary tokens, used as a direct\nreplacement for the image ones. The training signal is provided by two losses:\nan autoregressive one applied after the second pass that provides a direct\noptimization objective for compression, and a contrastive loss, applied after\nthe first pass, that further boosts the representation strength, especially for\ndiscriminative tasks. The training is further enhanced by stage-specific\nadapters.

Understanding the mechanisms behind their abilities and\nimplementing controls over them is becoming increasingly important for\ndeveloping better models. In this paper, we focus on skill unlearning in LLMs,\nspecifically unlearning a particular skill while retaining their overall\ncapabilities. We introduce two lightweight, training-free machine skill\nunlearning techniques for LLMs. First, we observe that the pre-activation\ndistribution of neurons in each Feed-Forward Layer (FFL) differs when the model\ndemonstrates different skills. Additionally, we find that queries triggering\nthe same skill cluster within the FFL key space and can be separated from other\nqueries using a hypercube. Based on these observations, we propose two\nlightweight, training-free skill unlearning methods via \\textit{intervention}\nand \\textit{abstention} respectively: \\texttt{Neuron Adjust} and \\texttt{Key\nSpace Detection}. We evaluate our methods on unlearning math-solving,\nPython-coding, and comprehension skills across seven different languages. The\nresults demonstrate their strong unlearning capabilities for the designated\nskills. Specifically, \\texttt{Key Space Detection} achieves over 80\\% relative\nperformance drop on the forgetting skill and less than 10\\% relative\nperformance drop on other skills and the model's general knowledge (MMLU) for\nmost unlearning tasks.

Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)\nhas emerged as an effective technique to align LLMs to human preferences and\nbroader utilities, but it requires updating billions of model parameters, which\nis computationally expensive. Controlled Decoding, by contrast, provides a\nmechanism for aligning a model at inference time without retraining. However,\nsingle-agent decoding approaches often struggle to adapt to diverse tasks due\nto the complexity and variability inherent in these tasks. To strengthen the\ntest-time performance w.r.t the target task, we propose a mixture of\nagent-based decoding strategies leveraging the existing off-the-shelf aligned\nLLM policies. Treating each prior policy as an agent in the spirit of mixture\nof agent collaboration, we develop a decoding method that allows for\ninference-time alignment through a token-level selection strategy among\nmultiple agents. For each token, the most suitable LLM is dynamically chosen\nfrom a pool of models based on a long-term utility metric. This\npolicy-switching mechanism ensures optimal model selection at each step,\nenabling efficient collaboration and alignment among LLMs during decoding.\nTheoretical analysis of our proposed algorithm establishes optimal performance\nwith respect to the target task represented via a target reward for the given\noff-the-shelf models. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations with\nopen-source aligned models on diverse tasks and preferences, which demonstrates\nthe merits of this approach over single-agent decoding baselines. Notably,\nCollab surpasses the current SoTA decoding strategy, achieving an improvement\nof up to 1.56x in average reward and 71.89% in GPT-4 based win-tie rate.",

                    "value": "Alignment of Large Language models (LLMs) is crucial for safe and trustworthy\ndeployment in applications. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)\nhas emerged as an effective technique to align LLMs to human preferences and\nbroader utilities, but it requires updating billions of model parameters, which\nis computationally expensive. Controlled Decoding, by contrast, provides a\nmechanism for aligning a model at inference time without retraining. However,\nsingle-agent decoding approaches often struggle to adapt to diverse tasks due\nto the complexity and variability inherent in these tasks. To strengthen the\ntest-time performance w.r.t the target task, we propose a mixture of\nagent-based decoding strategies leveraging the existing off-the-shelf aligned\nLLM policies. Treating each prior policy as an agent in the spirit of mixture\nof agent collaboration, we develop a decoding method that allows for\ninference-time alignment through a token-level selection strategy among\nmultiple agents. For each token, the most suitable LLM is dynamically chosen\nfrom a pool of models based on a long-term utility metric. This\npolicy-switching mechanism ensures optimal model selection at each step,\nenabling efficient collaboration and alignment among LLMs during decoding.\nTheoretical analysis of our proposed algorithm establishes optimal performance\nwith respect to the target task represented via a target reward for the given\noff-the-shelf models. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations with\nopen-source aligned models on diverse tasks and preferences, which demonstrates\nthe merits of this approach over single-agent decoding baselines. Notably,\nCollab surpasses the current SoTA decoding strategy, achieving an improvement\nof up to 1.56x in average reward and 71.89% in GPT-4 based win-tie rate."

While recent attempts have adapted\npre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), into\ngenerators of 3D representations (e.g., Triplane), they often suffer from poor\nquality due to the lack of sufficient high-quality 3D training data. Aiming at\novercoming the data shortage, we propose a novel training scheme, termed as\nProgressive Rendering Distillation (PRD), eliminating the need for 3D\nground-truths by distilling multi-view diffusion models and adapting SD into a\nnative 3D generator. In each iteration of training, PRD uses the U-Net to\nprogressively denoise the latent from random noise for a few steps, and in each\nstep it decodes the denoised latent into 3D output. Multi-view diffusion\nmodels, including MVDream and RichDreamer, are used in joint with SD to distill\ntext-consistent textures and geometries into the 3D outputs through score\ndistillation. Since PRD supports training without 3D ground-truths, we can\neasily scale up the training data and improve generation quality for\nchallenging text prompts with creative concepts. Meanwhile, PRD can accelerate\nthe inference speed of the generation model in just a few steps. With PRD, we\ntrain a Triplane generator, namely TriplaneTurbo, which adds only $2.5\\%$\ntrainable parameters to adapt SD for Triplane generation. TriplaneTurbo\noutperforms previous text-to-3D generators in both efficiency and quality.\nSpecifically, it can produce high-quality 3D meshes in 1.2 seconds and\ngeneralize well for challenging text input.

Most approaches to this challenge employ probabilistic\nrepresentations of uncertainty. In complicated systems accessible only via data\nor black-box models, however, these representations are rarely known. We\ndiscuss how to characterize and manipulate such representations using\ntriangular transport maps, which approximate any complex probability\ndistribution as a transformation of a simple, well-understood distribution. The\nparticular structure of triangular transport guarantees many desirable\nmathematical and computational properties that translate well into solving\npractical problems. Triangular maps are actively used for density estimation,\n(conditional) generative modelling, Bayesian inference, data assimilation,\noptimal experimental design, and related tasks.

                    "value": "Decision making under uncertainty is a cross-cutting challenge in science and\nengineering. Most approaches to this challenge employ probabilistic\nrepresentations of uncertainty. In complicated systems accessible only via data\nor black-box models, however, these representations are rarely known. We\ndiscuss how to characterize and manipulate such representations using\ntriangular transport maps, which approximate any complex probability\ndistribution as a transformation of a simple, well-understood distribution. The\nparticular structure of triangular transport guarantees many desirable\nmathematical and computational properties that translate well into solving\npractical problems. Triangular maps are actively used for density estimation,\n(conditional) generative modelling, Bayesian inference, data assimilation,\noptimal experimental design, and related tasks.

We aim to construct an\nalternative catalog of atmospheric parameters from Gaia Bp/Rp spectra by\nfitting them with synthetic spectra based on model atmospheres, and provide\ncorrections to the Bp/Rp fluxes according to stellar colors, magnitudes, and\nextinction. We use GaiaXPy to obtain calibrated spectra and apply FERRE to\nmatch the corrected Bp/Rp spectra with models and infer atmospheric parameters.\nWe train a neural network using stars in APOGEE to predict flux corrections as\na function of wavelength for each target. Based on the comparison with APOGEE\nparameters, we conclude that our estimated parameters have systematic errors\nand uncertainties in $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, $\\log g$, and [M/H] about $-38 \\pm\n167$ K, $0.05 \\pm 0.40$ dex, and $-0.12 \\pm 0.19$ dex, respectively, for stars\nin the range $4000 \\le T_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\le 7000$ K. The corrected Bp/Rp\nspectra show better agreement with both models and Hubble Space Telescope\nCALSPEC data. Our correction increases the precision of the relative\nspectrophotometry of the Bp/Rp data from $3.2\\% - 3.7\\%$ to $1.2\\% - 2.4\\%$.\nFinally, we have built a catalog of atmospheric parameters for stars within\n$4000 \\le T_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\le 7000$ K, comprising $68,394,431$ sources, along\nwith a subset of $124,188$ stars with $\\mathrm{[M/H]} \\le -2.5$. Our results\nconfirm that the Gaia Bp/Rp flux calibrated spectra show systematic patterns as\na function of wavelength that are tightly related to colors, magnitudes, and\nextinction.

However, the data\nused to train or fine-tune these LLMs is often undisclosed, allowing an\nattacker to compromise the data and inject backdoors into the models. In this\npaper, we develop a novel inference time defense, named CLEANGEN, to mitigate\nbackdoor attacks for generation tasks in LLMs. CLEANGEN is a lightweight and\neffective decoding strategy that is compatible with the state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nLLMs. Our insight behind CLEANGEN is that compared to other LLMs, backdoored\nLLMs assign significantly higher probabilities to tokens representing the\nattacker-desired contents. These discrepancies in token probabilities enable\nCLEANGEN to identify suspicious tokens favored by the attacker and replace them\nwith tokens generated by another LLM that is not compromised by the same\nattacker, thereby avoiding generation of attacker-desired content. We evaluate\nCLEANGEN against five SOTA backdoor attacks. Our results show that CLEANGEN\nachieves lower attack success rates (ASR) compared to five SOTA baseline\ndefenses for all five backdoor attacks. Moreover, LLMs deploying CLEANGEN\nmaintain helpfulness in their responses when serving benign user queries with\nminimal added computational overhead.",

This paper introduces the concept\nof Speaking with Intent (SWI) in large language models (LLMs), where the\nexplicitly generated intent encapsulates the model's underlying intention and\nprovides high-level planning to guide subsequent analysis and communication. By\nemulating deliberate and purposeful thoughts in the human mind, SWI is\nhypothesized to enhance the reasoning capabilities and generation quality of\nLLMs. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks consistently\ndemonstrate the superiority of Speaking with Intent over Baseline (i.e.,\ngeneration without explicit intent). Moreover, SWI outperforms answer-trigger\nprompting methods Chain-of-Thought and Plan-and-Solve and maintains competitive\nperformance with the strong method ARR (Analyzing, Retrieving, and Reasoning).\nAdditionally, the effectiveness and generalizability of SWI are solidified on\nreasoning-intensive question answering (QA) and text summarization benchmarks,\nwhere SWI brings consistent improvement to the Baseline generation. In text\nsummarization, SWI-generated summaries exhibit greater accuracy, conciseness,\nand factual correctness, with fewer hallucinations. Furthermore, human\nevaluations verify the coherence, effectiveness, and interpretability of the\nintent produced by SWI. This proof-of-concept study creates a novel avenue for\nenhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities with cognitive notions.",

Given an MDP path $\\tau$, this\nkind of inference allows us to derive counterfactual paths $\\tau'$ describing\nwhat-if versions of $\\tau$ obtained under different action sequences than those\nobserved in $\\tau$. However, as the counterfactual states and actions deviate\nfrom the observed ones over time, the observation $\\tau$ may no longer\ninfluence the counterfactual world, meaning that the analysis is no longer\ntailored to the individual observation, resulting in interventional outcomes\nrather than counterfactual ones. Even though this issue specifically affects\nthe popular Gumbel-max structural causal model used for MDP counterfactuals, it\nhas remained overlooked until now. In this work, we introduce a formal\ncharacterisation of influence based on comparing counterfactual and\ninterventional distributions. We devise an algorithm to construct\ncounterfactual models that automatically satisfy influence constraints.\nLeveraging such models, we derive counterfactual policies that are not just\noptimal for a given reward structure but also remain tailored to the observed\npath. Even though there is an unavoidable trade-off between policy optimality\nand strength of influence constraints, our experiments demonstrate that it is\npossible to derive (near-)optimal policies while remaining under the influence\nof the observation.",

Given an MDP path $\\tau$, this\nkind of inference allows us to derive counterfactual paths $\\tau'$ describing\nwhat-if versions of $\\tau$ obtained under different action sequences than those\nobserved in $\\tau$. However, as the counterfactual states and actions deviate\nfrom the observed ones over time, the observation $\\tau$ may no longer\ninfluence the counterfactual world, meaning that the analysis is no longer\ntailored to the individual observation, resulting in interventional outcomes\nrather than counterfactual ones. Even though this issue specifically affects\nthe popular Gumbel-max structural causal model used for MDP counterfactuals, it\nhas remained overlooked until now. In this work, we introduce a formal\ncharacterisation of influence based on comparing counterfactual and\ninterventional distributions. We devise an algorithm to construct\ncounterfactual models that automatically satisfy influence constraints.\nLeveraging such models, we derive counterfactual policies that are not just\noptimal for a given reward structure but also remain tailored to the observed\npath. Even though there is an unavoidable trade-off between policy optimality\nand strength of influence constraints, our experiments demonstrate that it is\npossible to derive (near-)optimal policies while remaining under the influence\nof the observation."

As a concrete example, we parameterize\nnormalizing-flow-based simulations in configurations of the material upstream\nof a toy calorimeter.

We study ParaFlow's performance in terms of photon shower shapes that\nare directly influenced by the properties of the upstream material, in which\nphotons can convert to an electron-positron pair.

Our scalable semi-automatic annotation framework leverages Text LLMs\nand Video LLMs to generate comprehensive question-answer pairs across 12\nchallenging QA tasks, pushing the boundaries of road event understanding.\nRoadSocial is derived from social media videos spanning 14M frames and 414K\nsocial comments, resulting in a dataset with 13.2K videos, 674 tags and 260K\nhigh-quality QA pairs. We evaluate 18 Video LLMs (open-source and proprietary,\ndriving-specific and general-purpose) on our road event understanding\nbenchmark. We also demonstrate RoadSocial's utility in improving road event\nunderstanding capabilities of general-purpose Video LLMs."

In this light, we explore how neurogenesis,\nneuroapoptosis, and neuroplasticity can inspire future AI advances.\nSpecifically, we examine analogous activities in artificial NNs, introducing\nthe concepts of ``dropin'' for neurogenesis and revisiting ``dropout'' and\nstructural pruning for neuroapoptosis. We additionally suggest neuroplasticity\ncombining the two for future large NNs in ``life-long learning'' settings\nfollowing the biological inspiration. We conclude by advocating for greater\nresearch efforts in this interdisciplinary domain and identifying promising\ndirections for future exploration."

                "summary": "Ontology matching (OM) plays a key role in enabling data interoperability and\nknowledge sharing, but it remains challenging due to the need for large\ntraining datasets and limited vocabulary processing in machine learning\napproaches. Recently, methods based on Large Language Model (LLMs) have shown\ngreat promise in OM, particularly through the use of a retrieve-then-prompt\npipeline. In this approach, relevant target entities are first retrieved and\nthen used to prompt the LLM to predict the final matches.

As the studies progress, more is known about the\nexpected breast positioning errors, which are taken into account in the\nPlanning Target Volume (PTV) in the form of the margin around the clinical\ntarget volume. However, little is known about the non-rigid deformations of the\nbreast in the course of radiotherapy, which is a non-negligible factor to the\ntreatment. Purpose: Taking into account such inter-fractional breast\ndeformations would help develop a promising future direction, such as\npatient-specific adjustable irradiation plannings. Methods: In this study, we\ndevelop a geometric approach to analyze inter-fractional breast deformation\nthroughout the radiotherapy treatment. Our data consists of 3D surface scans of\npatients acquired during radiotherapy sessions using a handheld scanner. We\nadapt functional map framework to compute inter-and intra-patient non-rigid\ncorrespondences, which are then used to analyze intra-patient changes and\ninter-patient variability. Results: The qualitative shape collection analysis\nhighlight deformations in the contralateral breast and armpit areas, along with\npositioning shifts on the head or abdominal regions. We also perform extrinsic\nanalysis, where we align surface acquisitions of the treated breast with the\nCT-derived skin surface to assess displacements and volume changes in the\ntreated area. On average, displacements within the treated breast exhibit\namplitudes of 1-2 mm across sessions, with higher values observed at the time\nof the 25 th irradiation session. Volume changes, inferred from surface\nvariations, reached up to 10%, with values ranging between 2% and 5% over the\ncourse of treatment. Conclusions: We propose a comprehensive workflow for\nanalyzing and modeling breast deformations during radiotherapy using surface\nacquisitions, incorporating a novel inter-collection shape matching approach to\nmodel shape variability within a i shared space across multiple patient shape\ncollections. We validate our method using 3D surface data acquired from\npatients during External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT) sessions, demonstrating its\neffectiveness.

Most existing approaches rely on\nimplicit 3D representations, which produce overly smooth reconstructions and\nare time-consuming to generate explicit 3D shapes. While more recent methods\ndirectly reconstruct point clouds with diffusion models, the multi-step\ndenoising makes high-resolution reconstruction inefficient. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a transformer-based model to efficiently reconstruct\ndense 3D point clouds of hand-held objects. Our method follows a coarse-to-fine\nstrategy, first generating a sparse point cloud from the image and\nprogressively refining it into a dense representation using pixel-aligned image\nfeatures. To enhance reconstruction accuracy, we integrate image features with\n3D hand geometry to jointly predict the object point cloud and its pose\nrelative to the hand. Our model is trained end-to-end for optimal performance.\nExperimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with much faster inference speed,\nwhile generalizing well to in-the-wild images.",

                    "value": "Reconstructing hand-held objects in 3D from monocular images remains a\nsignificant challenge in computer vision. Most existing approaches rely on\nimplicit 3D representations, which produce overly smooth reconstructions and\nare time-consuming to generate explicit 3D shapes. While more recent methods\ndirectly reconstruct point clouds with diffusion models, the multi-step\ndenoising makes high-resolution reconstruction inefficient. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a transformer-based model to efficiently reconstruct\ndense 3D point clouds of hand-held objects. Our method follows a coarse-to-fine\nstrategy, first generating a sparse point cloud from the image and\nprogressively refining it into a dense representation using pixel-aligned image\nfeatures. To enhance reconstruction accuracy, we integrate image features with\n3D hand geometry to jointly predict the object point cloud and its pose\nrelative to the hand. Our model is trained end-to-end for optimal performance.\nExperimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with much faster inference speed,\nwhile generalizing well to in-the-wild images."

We propose a novel compression approach, called Fwd2Bot,\nthat uses the LVLM itself to compress the visual information in a task-agnostic\nmanner. At the core of Fwd2bot there exists a \"double-forward pass\" training\nstrategy, whereby, during the first forward pass, the LLM (of the LVLM) creates\na bottleneck by condensing the visual information into a small number of\nsummary tokens. Then, using the same LLM, the second forward pass processes the\nlanguage instruction(s) alongside the summary tokens, used as a direct\nreplacement for the image ones. The training signal is provided by two losses:\nan autoregressive one applied after the second pass that provides a direct\noptimization objective for compression, and a contrastive loss, applied after\nthe first pass, that further boosts the representation strength, especially for\ndiscriminative tasks. The training is further enhanced by stage-specific\nadapters. We accompany the proposed method by an in-depth ablation study.\nOverall, Fwd2Bot results in highly-informative compressed representations\nsuitable for both generative and discriminative tasks. For generative tasks, we\noffer a 2x higher compression rate without compromising the generative\ncapabilities, setting a new state-of-the-art result.

Understanding the mechanisms behind their abilities and\nimplementing controls over them is becoming increasingly important for\ndeveloping better models. In this paper, we focus on skill unlearning in LLMs,\nspecifically unlearning a particular skill while retaining their overall\ncapabilities. We introduce two lightweight, training-free machine skill\nunlearning techniques for LLMs. First, we observe that the pre-activation\ndistribution of neurons in each Feed-Forward Layer (FFL) differs when the model\ndemonstrates different skills. Additionally, we find that queries triggering\nthe same skill cluster within the FFL key space and can be separated from other\nqueries using a hypercube. Based on these observations, we propose two\nlightweight, training-free skill unlearning methods via \\textit{intervention}\nand \\textit{abstention} respectively: \\texttt{Neuron Adjust} and \\texttt{Key\nSpace Detection}. We evaluate our methods on unlearning math-solving,\nPython-coding, and comprehension skills across seven different languages. The\nresults demonstrate their strong unlearning capabilities for the designated\nskills. Specifically, \\texttt{Key Space Detection} achieves over 80\\% relative\nperformance drop on the forgetting skill and less than 10\\% relative\nperformance drop on other skills and the model's general knowledge (MMLU) for\nmost unlearning tasks.

                    "value": "Large language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable skills across\nvarious domains. Understanding the mechanisms behind their abilities and\nimplementing controls over them is becoming increasingly important for\ndeveloping better models. In this paper, we focus on skill unlearning in LLMs,\nspecifically unlearning a particular skill while retaining their overall\ncapabilities. We introduce two lightweight, training-free machine skill\nunlearning techniques for LLMs. First, we observe that the pre-activation\ndistribution of neurons in each Feed-Forward Layer (FFL) differs when the model\ndemonstrates different skills. Additionally, we find that queries triggering\nthe same skill cluster within the FFL key space and can be separated from other\nqueries using a hypercube. Based on these observations, we propose two\nlightweight, training-free skill unlearning methods via \\textit{intervention}\nand \\textit{abstention} respectively: \\texttt{Neuron Adjust} and \\texttt{Key\nSpace Detection}. We evaluate our methods on unlearning math-solving,\nPython-coding, and comprehension skills across seven different languages. The\nresults demonstrate their strong unlearning capabilities for the designated\nskills. Specifically, \\texttt{Key Space Detection} achieves over 80\\% relative\nperformance drop on the forgetting skill and less than 10\\% relative\nperformance drop on other skills and the model's general knowledge (MMLU) for\nmost unlearning tasks.

Through comprehensive experiments, we have validated the effectiveness\nof each component in our new framework. The seamless integration of these parts\nhas enabled TripoSG to achieve state-of-the-art performance in 3D shape\ngeneration. The resulting 3D shapes exhibit enhanced detail due to\nhigh-resolution capabilities and demonstrate exceptional fidelity to input\nimages.

In addition, the chatbot demonstrated promising capabilities in\ndelivering behavioral activation and maintaining safety.

Ultimately,\nOpenHuEval encompasses eight Hungarian-specific dimensions, featuring five\ntasks and 3953 questions. Consequently, OpenHuEval provides the comprehensive,\nin-depth, and scientifically accurate assessment of LLM performance in the\ncontext of the Hungarian language and its specifics. We evaluated current\nmainstream LLMs, including both traditional LLMs and recently developed Large\nReasoning Models. The results demonstrate the significant necessity for\nevaluation and model optimization tailored to the Hungarian language and\nspecifics. We also established the framework for analyzing the thinking\nprocesses of LRMs with OpenHuEval, revealing intrinsic patterns and mechanisms\nof these models in non-English languages, with Hungarian serving as a\nrepresentative example.

We evaluate 18 Video LLMs (open-source and proprietary,\ndriving-specific and general-purpose) on our road event understanding\nbenchmark. We also demonstrate RoadSocial's utility in improving road event\nunderstanding capabilities of general-purpose Video LLMs."

To recover from retriever failures, domain knowledge is injected by\nfine-tuning the model to generate the correct response, even in the case of\nretrieval errors. However, we observe that without systematic knowledge\naugmentation, fine-tuned LLMs may memorize new information but still fail to\nextract relevant domain knowledge, leading to poor performance. In this work,\nwe present a novel framework that significantly enhances the fine-tuning\nprocess by augmenting the training data in two ways -- context augmentation and\nknowledge paraphrasing. In context augmentation, we create multiple training\nsamples for a given QA pair by varying the relevance of the retrieved\ninformation, teaching the model when to ignore and when to rely on retrieved\ncontent. In knowledge paraphrasing, we fine-tune with multiple answers to the\nsame question, enabling LLMs to better internalize specialized knowledge. To\nmitigate catastrophic forgetting due to fine-tuning, we add a domain-specific\nidentifier to a question and also utilize a replay buffer containing general QA\npairs.

While\nthese protocols have proven effective in wired networks, their adaptation to\nwireless environments presents significant challenges. Asynchronous BFT\nconsensus, characterized by its N parallel consensus components (e.g.,\nasynchronous Byzantine agreement, reliable broadcast), suffers from high\nmessage complexity, leading to network congestion and inefficiency, especially\nin resource-constrained wireless networks.

Additionally, the absence of dedicated\ntestbeds for asynchronous wireless BFT consensus protocols hinders development\nand performance evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose a consensus\nbatching protocol (ConsensusBatcher), which supports both vertical and\nhorizontal batching of multiple parallel consensus components.

However, they often prioritize language knowledge\nover image information on visual reasoning tasks, incurring performance\ndegradation. To tackle this issue, we first identify the drawbacks of existing\nsolutions (i.e., insufficient and irrelevant visual descriptions, and limited\nmulti-modal capacities). We then decompose visual reasoning process into two\nstages: visual perception (i.e., eyesight) and textual reasoning (i.e.,\nwisdom), and introduce a novel visual reasoning framework named ProReason. This\nframework features multi-run proactive perception and decoupled\nvision-reasoning capabilities. Briefly, given a multi-modal question, ProReason\niterates proactive information collection and reasoning until the answer can be\nconcluded with necessary and sufficient visual descriptions. Notably, the\ndisassociation of capabilities allows seamless integration of existing large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to compensate for the reasoning deficits of LVLMs. Our\nextensive experiments demonstrate that ProReason outperforms both existing\nmulti-step reasoning frameworks and passive peer methods on a wide range of\nbenchmarks for both open-source and closed-source models. In addition, with the\nassistance of LLMs, ProReason achieves a performance improvement of up to 15%\non MMMU benchmark. Our insights into existing solutions and the decoupled\nperspective for feasible integration of LLMs illuminate future research on\nvisual reasoning techniques, especially LLM-assisted ones.",

However, existing\nframeworks are often rigid, struggling to adapt to KG or task changes. They\nalso rely heavily on powerful LLMs for reliable (i.e., trustworthy) reasoning.\nTo address this, We introduce R2-KG, a plug-and-play, dual-agent framework that\nseparates reasoning into two roles: an Operator (a low-capacity LLM) that\ngathers evidence and a Supervisor (a high-capacity LLM) that makes final\njudgments. This design is cost-efficient for LLM inference while still\nmaintaining strong reasoning accuracy. Additionally, R2-KG employs an\nAbstention mechanism, generating answers only when sufficient evidence is\ncollected from KG, which significantly enhances reliability. Experiments across\nmultiple KG-based reasoning tasks show that R2-KG consistently outperforms\nbaselines in both accuracy and reliability, regardless of the inherent\ncapability of LLMs used as the Operator. Further experiments reveal that the\nsingle-agent version of R2-KG, equipped with a strict self-consistency\nstrategy, achieves significantly higher-than-baseline reliability while\nreducing inference cost. However, it also leads to a higher abstention rate in\ncomplex KGs. Our findings establish R2-KG as a flexible and cost-effective\nsolution for KG-based reasoning.

However, the performance of LLMs\nin repository-level context code translation remains suboptimal due to complex\ndependencies and context, hindering their adoption in industrial settings. In\nthis work, we propose a novel LLM-based code translation technique K-Trans,\nwhich leverages triple knowledge augmentation to enhance LLM's translation\nquality under repository context in real-world software development. First,\nK-Trans constructs a translation knowledge base by extracting relevant\ninformation from target-language codebases, the repository being translated,\nand prior translation results. Second, for each function to be translated,\nK-Trans retrieves relevant triple knowledge, including target-language code\nsamples, dependency usage examples, and successful translation function pairs,\nserving as references to enhance LLM for translation. Third, K-Trans constructs\na knowledge-augmented translation prompt using the retrieved triple knowledge\nand employs LLMs to generate the translated code while preserving repository\ncontext. It further leverages LLMs for self-debugging, enhancing translation\ncorrectness.\n  The experiments show that K-Trans substantially outperforms the baseline\nadapted from previous work by 19.4%/40.2% relative improvement in pass@1 and\n0.138 in CodeBLEU. It is important to note that the results also demonstrate\nthat each knowledge significantly contributes to K-Trans's effectiveness in\nhandling repository-level context code translation, with dependency usage\nexamples making the most notable contribution.

Addressing this challenge, this work presents a\ncarrier-grade QKDN architecture, which combines the functional QKDN\narchitecture with the operational perspective of a network operator, ultimately\nenhancing the economic viability of QKDN.

However, despite producing high-quality graphics and adequately\nreceiving player input, existing models often fail to maintain fundamental game\nproperties such as numerical and spatial consistency. Numerical consistency\nensures gameplay mechanics correctly reflect score changes and other\nquantitative elements, while spatial consistency prevents jarring scene\ntransitions, providing seamless player experiences.

Most existing methods for crafting\nphysical-world adversarial examples are ad-hoc, relying on temporary\nmodifications like shadows, laser beams, or stickers that are tailored to\nspecific scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a new class of physical-world\nadversarial examples, AdvWT, which draws inspiration from the naturally\noccurring phenomenon of `wear and tear', an inherent property of physical\nobjects. Unlike manually crafted perturbations, `wear and tear' emerges\norganically over time due to environmental degradation, as seen in the gradual\ndeterioration of outdoor signboards. To achieve this, AdvWT follows a two-step\napproach. First, a GAN-based, unsupervised image-to-image translation network\nis employed to model these naturally occurring damages, particularly in the\ncontext of outdoor signboards. The translation network encodes the\ncharacteristics of damaged signs into a latent `damage style code'. In the\nsecond step, we introduce adversarial perturbations into the style code,\nstrategically optimizing its transformation process. This manipulation subtly\nalters the damage style representation, guiding the network to generate\nadversarial images where the appearance of damages remains perceptually\nrealistic, while simultaneously ensuring their effectiveness in misleading\nneural networks. Through comprehensive experiments on two traffic sign\ndatasets, we show that AdvWT effectively misleads DNNs in both digital and\nphysical domains. AdvWT achieves an effective attack success rate, greater\nrobustness, and a more natural appearance compared to existing physical-world\nadversarial examples. Additionally, integrating AdvWT into training enhances a\nmodel's generalizability to real-world damaged signs.",
