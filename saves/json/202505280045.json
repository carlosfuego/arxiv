DynamicKV\nestablishes global and per-layer maximum KV cache budgets, temporarily\nretaining the maximum budget for the current layer, and periodically updating\nthe KV cache sizes of all preceding layers during inference. Our method retains\nonly 1.7% of the KV cache size while achieving ~85% of the Full KV cache\nperformance on LongBench.

To handle complex queries\nmore effectively, researchers developed Adaptive-RAG (A-RAG) to enhance the\ngenerated quality through multiple interactions with external knowledge bases.\nDespite its effectiveness, A-RAG exacerbates the pre-existing efficiency\nchallenges inherent in RAG, which are attributable to its reliance on multiple\niterations of generation. Existing A-RAG approaches process all retrieved\ncontents from scratch. However, they ignore the situation where there is a\nsignificant overlap in the content of the retrieval results across rounds. The\noverlapping content is redundantly represented, which leads to a large\nproportion of repeated computations, thus affecting the overall efficiency. To\naddress this issue, this paper introduces a model-agnostic approach that can be\ngenerally applied to A-RAG methods, which is dedicated to reducing the\nredundant representation process caused by the overlapping of retrieval\nresults. Specifically, we use cache access and parallel generation to speed up\nthe prefilling and decoding stages respectively.

Post-training KV Cache\nquantization has emerged as a promising compression technique and has been\nextensively studied in short-context scenarios. However, directly applying\nexisting methods to long-CoT LLMs causes significant performance degradation\ndue to the following two reasons: (1) Large cumulative error: Existing methods\nfail to adequately leverage available memory, and they directly quantize the KV\nCache during each decoding step, leading to large cumulative quantization\nerror. (2) Short-context calibration: Due to Rotary Positional Embedding\n(RoPE), the use of short-context data during calibration fails to account for\nthe distribution of less frequent channels in the Key Cache, resulting in\nperformance loss. We propose Progressive Mixed-Precision KV Cache Quantization\n(PM-KVQ) for long-CoT LLMs to address the above issues in two folds: (1) To\nreduce cumulative error, we design a progressive quantization strategy to\ngradually lower the bit-width of KV Cache in each block. Then, we propose\nblock-wise memory allocation to assign a higher bit-width to more sensitive\ntransformer blocks. (2) To increase the calibration length without additional\noverhead, we propose a new calibration strategy with positional interpolation\nthat leverages short calibration data with positional interpolation to\napproximate the data distribution of long-context data. Extensive experiments\non 7B-70B long-CoT LLMs show that PM-KVQ improves reasoning benchmark\nperformance by up to 8% over SOTA baselines under the same memory budget.

However, directly applying\nexisting methods to long-CoT LLMs causes significant performance degradation\ndue to the following two reasons: (1) Large cumulative error: Existing methods\nfail to adequately leverage available memory, and they directly quantize the KV\nCache during each decoding step, leading to large cumulative quantization\nerror. (2) Short-context calibration: Due to Rotary Positional Embedding\n(RoPE), the use of short-context data during calibration fails to account for\nthe distribution of less frequent channels in the Key Cache, resulting in\nperformance loss. We propose Progressive Mixed-Precision KV Cache Quantization\n(PM-KVQ) for long-CoT LLMs to address the above issues in two folds: (1) To\nreduce cumulative error, we design a progressive quantization strategy to\ngradually lower the bit-width of KV Cache in each block. Then, we propose\nblock-wise memory allocation to assign a higher bit-width to more sensitive\ntransformer blocks. (2) To increase the calibration length without additional\noverhead, we propose a new calibration strategy with positional interpolation\nthat leverages short calibration data with positional interpolation to\napproximate the data distribution of long-context data. Extensive experiments\non 7B-70B long-CoT LLMs show that PM-KVQ improves reasoning benchmark\nperformance by up to 8% over SOTA baselines under the same memory budget.

Typically, these profiles are constructed by leveraging LLMs\nfor user profile modeling (LLM-UM). However, this process faces several\nchallenges: (1) LLMs struggle with long user behaviors due to context length\nlimitations and performance degradation. (2) Existing methods often extract\nonly partial segments from full historical behavior sequence, inevitably\ndiscarding diverse user interests embedded in the omitted content, leading to\nincomplete modeling and suboptimal profiling. (3) User profiling is often\ntightly coupled with the inference context, requiring online processing, which\nintroduces significant latency overhead. In this paper, we propose PersonaX, an\nagent-agnostic LLM-UM framework to address these challenges. It augments\ndownstream recommendation agents to achieve better recommendation performance\nand inference efficiency. PersonaX (a) segments complete historical behaviors\ninto clustered groups, (b) selects multiple sub behavior sequences (SBS) with a\nbalance of prototypicality and diversity to form a high quality core set, (c)\nperforms offline multi-persona profiling to capture diverse user interests and\ngenerate fine grained, cached textual personas, and (d) decouples user\nprofiling from online inference, enabling profile retrieval instead of real\ntime generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness: using\nonly 30 to 50% of behavioral data (sequence length 480), PersonaX enhances\nAgentCF by 3 to 11% and Agent4Rec by 10 to 50%.

We introduce the\nconcept of Chain-of-Representation (CoR), which formulates the hidden states at\neach layer as a combination of multiple sub-representations (i.e., chains) at\nthe hidden dimension level. In each layer, each chain from the output\nrepresentations can only view all of its preceding chains in the input\nrepresentations. Consequently, the model built upon CoM framework can\nprogressively scale up the model size by increasing the chains based on the\nprevious models (i.e., chains), and offer multiple sub-models at varying sizes\nfor elastic inference by using different chain numbers. Based on this\nprinciple, we devise Chain-of-Language-Model (CoLM), which incorporates the\nidea of CoM into each layer of Transformer architecture. Based on CoLM, we\nfurther introduce CoLM-Air by introducing a KV sharing mechanism, that computes\nall keys and values within the first chain and then shares across all chains.\nThis design demonstrates additional extensibility, such as enabling seamless LM\nswitching, prefilling acceleration and so on. Experimental results demonstrate\nour CoLM family can achieve comparable performance to the standard Transformer,\nwhile simultaneously enabling greater flexiblity, such as progressive scaling\nto improve training efficiency and offer multiple varying model sizes for\nelastic inference, paving a a new way toward building language models.

We prove using IB theory that\ndecoder-only Transformers are inherently constrained in their ability to form\ntask-optimal sequence representations. We then use this result to demonstrate\nthat periodic global transformation of the internal sequence-level\nrepresentations (KV cache) is a necessary computational step for improving\nTransformer generalisation in reasoning tasks. Based on these theoretical\ninsights, we propose a modification to the Transformer architecture, in the\nform of an additional module that globally rewrites the KV cache at periodic\nintervals, shifting its capacity away from memorising input prefixes and toward\nencoding features most useful for predicting future tokens. Our model delivers\nsubstantial gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, outperforming both\nvanilla Transformers with up to 3.5x more parameters, as well as\nheuristic-driven pruning mechanisms for cache compression. Our approach can be\nseen as a principled generalisation of existing KV-cache compression methods;\nwhereas such methods focus solely on compressing input representations, they\noften do so at the expense of retaining predictive information, and thus their\ncapabilities are inherently bounded by those of an unconstrained model.

However, its scattered distribution\nacross data silos and the high computational demands of LLMs limit their\ndeployment in federated environments. To address this, the transformer-based\nsplit learning model has emerged, offloading most model parameters to the\nserver while retaining only the embedding and output layers on clients to\nensure privacy. However, it still faces significant challenges in security,\nefficiency, and adaptability: 1) embedding gradients are vulnerable to attacks,\nleading to reverse engineering of private data; 2) the autoregressive nature of\nLLMs means that federated split learning can only train and infer sequentially,\ncausing high communication overhead; 3) fixed partition points lack\nadaptability to downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce FL-LLaMA, a\nsecure, efficient, and adaptive federated split framework based on LLaMA2.\nFirst, we place some input and output blocks on the local client and inject\nGaussian noise into forward-pass hidden states, enabling secure end-to-end\npropagation. Second, we employ client-batch and server-hierarchical strategies\nto achieve parallel training, along with attention-mask compression and KV\ncache mechanisms to accelerate inference, reducing communication costs\neffectively. Third, we allow users to dynamically adjust the partition points\nfor input/output blocks based on specific task requirements and hardware\nlimitations. Experiments on NLU, summarization and conversational QA tasks show\nthat FL-LLaMA maintains performance comparable to centralized LLaMA2, and\nachieves up to 2x train speedups and 8x inference speedups. Further analysis of\nprivacy attacks and different partition points also demonstrates the\neffectiveness of FL-LLaMA in security and adaptability.",

This work presents BurstGPT, an\nLLM serving workload with 10.31 million traces from regional Azure OpenAI GPT\nservices over 213 days.

(2) User\nconversation patterns: counts and intervals within conversations for service\noptimizations. (3) Model response lengths: auto-regressive serving processes of\nGPT models, showing statistical relations between requests and their responses.\n(4) System response failures: failures of conversation and API services,\nshowing intensive resource needs and limited availability of LLM services in\nAzure.

Although existing methods achieve impressive compression ratios\non long-context benchmarks, their effects on core model capabilities remain\nunderstudied.

Multi-head latent attention was recently developed to\ncompress the KV cache into a low-rank latent space. This paper proposes\nMulti-head Temporal Latent Attention (MTLA), which further reduces the KV cache\nsize along the temporal dimension, greatly lowering the memory footprint of\nself-attention inference. MTLA employs a hyper-network to dynamically merge\ntemporally adjacent KV cache vectors. To address the mismatch between the\ncompressed KV cache and processed sequence lengths, a stride-aware causal mask\nis proposed to ensure efficient parallel training and consistency with\ninference behaviour. Experiments across tasks, including speech translation,\nspeech recognition, speech understanding and text summarisation, demonstrate\nthat MTLA achieves competitive performance compared to standard Multi-Head\nAttention (MHA), while greatly improving inference speed and GPU memory usage.\nFor example, on a English-German speech translation task, MTLA achieves a 5.3x\nspeedup and a reduction in GPU memory usage by a factor of 8.3 compared to MHA,\nwhile maintaining translation quality.",

This paper proposes\nMulti-head Temporal Latent Attention (MTLA), which further reduces the KV cache\nsize along the temporal dimension, greatly lowering the memory footprint of\nself-attention inference. MTLA employs a hyper-network to dynamically merge\ntemporally adjacent KV cache vectors. To address the mismatch between the\ncompressed KV cache and processed sequence lengths, a stride-aware causal mask\nis proposed to ensure efficient parallel training and consistency with\ninference behaviour. Experiments across tasks, including speech translation,\nspeech recognition, speech understanding and text summarisation, demonstrate\nthat MTLA achieves competitive performance compared to standard Multi-Head\nAttention (MHA), while greatly improving inference speed and GPU memory usage.\nFor example, on a English-German speech translation task, MTLA achieves a 5.3x\nspeedup and a reduction in GPU memory usage by a factor of 8.3 compared to MHA,\nwhile maintaining translation quality."

This approach significantly improves large language models on\nknowledge-intensive tasks, including opendomain question answering and complex\nreasoning. Our framework integrates two complementary techniques:\nPolicy-Optimized RetrievalAugmented Generation (PORAG), which optimizes the use\nof retrieved information, and Adaptive Token-Layer Attention Scoring (ATLAS),\nwhich dynamically determines retrieval timing and content based on contextual\nneeds. Together, these techniques enhance both the utilization and relevance of\nretrieved content, improving factual accuracy and response quality. Designed as\na lightweight solution compatible with any Transformer-based LLM without\nrequiring additional training, our framework excels in knowledge-intensive\ntasks, boosting output accuracy in RAG settings. We further propose CRITIC, a\nnovel method to selectively compress key-value caches by token importance,\nmitigating memory bottlenecks in long-context applications. The framework also\nincorporates test-time scaling techniques to dynamically balance reasoning\ndepth and computational resources, alongside optimized decoding strategies for\nfaster inference. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our framework\nreduces hallucinations, strengthens domain-specific reasoning, and achieves\nsignificant efficiency and scalability gains over traditional RAG systems. This\nintegrated approach advances the development of robust, efficient, and scalable\nRAG systems across diverse applications.",

Our framework integrates two complementary techniques:\nPolicy-Optimized RetrievalAugmented Generation (PORAG), which optimizes the use\nof retrieved information, and Adaptive Token-Layer Attention Scoring (ATLAS),\nwhich dynamically determines retrieval timing and content based on contextual\nneeds. Together, these techniques enhance both the utilization and relevance of\nretrieved content, improving factual accuracy and response quality. Designed as\na lightweight solution compatible with any Transformer-based LLM without\nrequiring additional training, our framework excels in knowledge-intensive\ntasks, boosting output accuracy in RAG settings. We further propose CRITIC, a\nnovel method to selectively compress key-value caches by token importance,\nmitigating memory bottlenecks in long-context applications. The framework also\nincorporates test-time scaling techniques to dynamically balance reasoning\ndepth and computational resources, alongside optimized decoding strategies for\nfaster inference. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our framework\nreduces hallucinations, strengthens domain-specific reasoning, and achieves\nsignificant efficiency and scalability gains over traditional RAG systems. This\nintegrated approach advances the development of robust, efficient, and scalable\nRAG systems across diverse applications."

Therefore, 6G is\nenvisioned to provide green and efficient all-day operations, strong\ninformation security, fully automatic driving, and low-cost intelligent\nmaintenance. To achieve these requirements, we propose an integrated network\narchitecture leveraging communications, computing, edge intelligence, and\ncaching in railway systems. We have conducted in-depth investigations on key\nenabling technologies for reliable transmissions and wireless coverage. For\nhigh-speed mobile scenarios, we propose an AI-enabled cross-domain channel\nmodeling and orthogonal time-frequency space-time spread multiple access\nmechanism to alleviate the conflict between limited spectrum availability and\nmassive user access. The roles of blockchain, edge intelligence, and privacy\ntechnologies in endogenously secure rail communications are also evaluated. We\nfurther explore the application of emerging paradigms such as integrated\nsensing and communications, AI-assisted Internet of Things, semantic\ncommunications, and digital twin networks for railway maintenance, monitoring,\nprediction, and accident warning.

Unlike image generation, video generation requires a\nsubstantially larger number of tokens to produce coherent temporal frames,\nresulting in significant overhead during the decoding phase. Our key\nobservations are: (i) MLP modules in the decode phase dominate the inference\nlatency, and (ii) there exists high temporal redundancy in MLP outputs of\nadjacent frames. In this paper, we propose the \\textbf{FastCar} framework to\naccelerate the decode phase for the AR video generation by exploring the\ntemporal redundancy. The Temporal Attention Score (TAS) is proposed to\ndetermine whether to apply the replay strategy (\\textit{i.e.}, reusing cached\nMLP outputs from the previous frame to reduce redundant computations) with\ndetailed theoretical analysis and justification. Also, we develop a hardware\naccelerator on FPGA with Dynamic Resource Scheduling (DRS) based on TAS to\nenable better resource utilization and faster inference. Experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms traditional\nsparse attention approaches with more than 2.1x decoding speedup and higher\nenergy efficiency on the edge. Furthermore, by combining FastCar and sparse\nattention, FastCar can boost the performance of sparse attention with\nalleviated drifting, demonstrating our unique advantages for high-resolution\nand long-duration video generation.

Historical reasoning poses unique challenges for\nAI, involving multimodal source interpretation, temporal inference, and\ncross-linguistic analysis. While general-purpose agents perform well on many\nexisting benchmarks, they lack the domain-specific expertise required to engage\nwith historical materials and questions. To address this gap, we introduce\nHistBench, a new benchmark of 414 high-quality questions designed to evaluate\nAI's capacity for historical reasoning and authored by more than 40 expert\ncontributors. The tasks span a wide range of historical problems-from factual\nretrieval based on primary sources to interpretive analysis of manuscripts and\nimages, to interdisciplinary challenges involving archaeology, linguistics, or\ncultural history. Furthermore, the benchmark dataset spans 29 ancient and\nmodern languages and covers a wide range of historical periods and world\nregions. Finding the poor performance of LLMs and other agents on HistBench, we\nfurther present HistAgent, a history-specific agent equipped with carefully\ndesigned tools for OCR, translation, archival search, and image understanding\nin History. On HistBench, HistAgent based on GPT-4o achieves an accuracy of\n27.54% pass@1 and 36.47% pass@2, significantly outperforming LLMs with online\nsearch and generalist agents, including GPT-4o (18.60%), DeepSeek-R1(14.49%)\nand Open Deep Research-smolagents(20.29% pass@1 and 25.12% pass@2). These\nresults highlight the limitations of existing LLMs and generalist agents and\ndemonstrate the advantages of HistAgent for historical reasoning.",

                    "value": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable\nprogress across domains, yet their capabilities in the humanities, particularly\nhistory, remain underexplored. Historical reasoning poses unique challenges for\nAI, involving multimodal source interpretation, temporal inference, and\ncross-linguistic analysis. While general-purpose agents perform well on many\nexisting benchmarks, they lack the domain-specific expertise required to engage\nwith historical materials and questions. To address this gap, we introduce\nHistBench, a new benchmark of 414 high-quality questions designed to evaluate\nAI's capacity for historical reasoning and authored by more than 40 expert\ncontributors. The tasks span a wide range of historical problems-from factual\nretrieval based on primary sources to interpretive analysis of manuscripts and\nimages, to interdisciplinary challenges involving archaeology, linguistics, or\ncultural history. Furthermore, the benchmark dataset spans 29 ancient and\nmodern languages and covers a wide range of historical periods and world\nregions. Finding the poor performance of LLMs and other agents on HistBench, we\nfurther present HistAgent, a history-specific agent equipped with carefully\ndesigned tools for OCR, translation, archival search, and image understanding\nin History. On HistBench, HistAgent based on GPT-4o achieves an accuracy of\n27.54% pass@1 and 36.47% pass@2, significantly outperforming LLMs with online\nsearch and generalist agents, including GPT-4o (18.60%), DeepSeek-R1(14.49%)\nand Open Deep Research-smolagents(20.29% pass@1 and 25.12% pass@2). These\nresults highlight the limitations of existing LLMs and generalist agents and\ndemonstrate the advantages of HistAgent for historical reasoning."

                "summary": "Reasoning has substantially improved the performance of large language models\n(LLMs) on complicated tasks. Central to the current reasoning studies, Process\nReward Models (PRMs) offer a fine-grained evaluation of intermediate reasoning\nsteps and guide the reasoning process. However, extending PRMs to multimodal\nlarge language models (MLLMs) introduces challenges. Since multimodal reasoning\ncovers a wider range of tasks compared to text-only scenarios, the resulting\ndistribution shift from the training to testing sets is more severe, leading to\ngreater generalization difficulty. Training a reliable multimodal PRM,\ntherefore, demands large and diverse datasets to ensure sufficient coverage.\nHowever, current multimodal reasoning datasets suffer from a marked quality\nimbalance, which degrades PRM performance and highlights the need for an\neffective data selection strategy. To address the issues, we introduce\nDreamPRM, a domain-reweighted training framework for multimodal PRMs which\nemploys bi-level optimization. In the lower-level optimization, DreamPRM\nperforms fine-tuning on multiple datasets with domain weights, allowing the PRM\nto prioritize high-quality reasoning signals and alleviating the impact of\ndataset quality imbalance. In the upper-level optimization, the PRM is\nevaluated on a separate meta-learning dataset; this feedback updates the domain\nweights through an aggregation loss function, thereby improving the\ngeneralization capability of trained PRM. Extensive experiments on multiple\nmultimodal reasoning benchmarks covering both mathematical and general\nreasoning show that test-time scaling with DreamPRM consistently improves the\nperformance of state-of-the-art MLLMs. Further comparisons reveal that\nDreamPRM's domain-reweighting strategy surpasses other data selection methods\nand yields higher accuracy gains than existing test-time scaling approaches.",

                    "value": "Reasoning has substantially improved the performance of large language models\n(LLMs) on complicated tasks. Central to the current reasoning studies, Process\nReward Models (PRMs) offer a fine-grained evaluation of intermediate reasoning\nsteps and guide the reasoning process. However, extending PRMs to multimodal\nlarge language models (MLLMs) introduces challenges. Since multimodal reasoning\ncovers a wider range of tasks compared to text-only scenarios, the resulting\ndistribution shift from the training to testing sets is more severe, leading to\ngreater generalization difficulty. Training a reliable multimodal PRM,\ntherefore, demands large and diverse datasets to ensure sufficient coverage.\nHowever, current multimodal reasoning datasets suffer from a marked quality\nimbalance, which degrades PRM performance and highlights the need for an\neffective data selection strategy.

Method: We tested GPT4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash on 492 AI generated\ncode blocks of varying correctness, along with 164 canonical code blocks from\nthe HumanEval benchmark. To simulate the code review task objectively, we\nexpected LLMs to assess code correctness and improve the code if needed.

Prior work has shown an asymptotic \"free lunch\" for PPI++, an\nadaptive form of PPI, showing that the *asymptotic* variance of PPI++ is always\nless than or equal to the variance obtained from using gold-standard labels\nalone. Notably, this result holds *regardless of the quality of the\npseudo-labels*. In this work, we demystify this result by conducting an exact\nfinite-sample analysis of the estimation error of PPI++ on the mean estimation\nproblem. We give a \"no free lunch\" result, characterizing the settings (and\nsample sizes) where PPI++ has provably worse estimation error than using\ngold-standard labels alone.

                    "value": "Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) is a popular strategy for combining\ngold-standard and possibly noisy pseudo-labels to perform statistical\nestimation. Prior work has shown an asymptotic \"free lunch\" for PPI++, an\nadaptive form of PPI, showing that the *asymptotic* variance of PPI++ is always\nless than or equal to the variance obtained from using gold-standard labels\nalone. Notably, this result holds *regardless of the quality of the\npseudo-labels*. In this work, we demystify this result by conducting an exact\nfinite-sample analysis of the estimation error of PPI++ on the mean estimation\nproblem. We give a \"no free lunch\" result, characterizing the settings (and\nsample sizes) where PPI++ has provably worse estimation error than using\ngold-standard labels alone. Specifically, PPI++ will outperform if and only if\nthe correlation between pseudo- and gold-standard is above a certain level that\ndepends on the number of labeled samples ($n$).

We\nfurther extend BALSa to multi-audio scenarios, where the model either explains\nthe differences between audio inputs or produces a unified caption that\ndescribes them all, thereby enhancing audio-language alignment. Experimental\nresults indicate that our method effectively mitigates audio hallucinations\nwhile reliably maintaining strong performance in audio understanding,\nreasoning, and instruction-following skills. Moreover, incorporating\nmulti-audio training further enhances the model's comprehension and reasoning\ncapabilities.

Building on BALSa, we introduce LISTEN (Learning to Identify Sounds\nThrough Extended Negative Samples), a contrastive-like training method designed\nto improve ALLMs' ability to distinguish between present and absent sounds. We\nfurther extend BALSa to multi-audio scenarios, where the model either explains\nthe differences between audio inputs or produces a unified caption that\ndescribes them all, thereby enhancing audio-language alignment. Experimental\nresults indicate that our method effectively mitigates audio hallucinations\nwhile reliably maintaining strong performance in audio understanding,\nreasoning, and instruction-following skills. Moreover, incorporating\nmulti-audio training further enhances the model's comprehension and reasoning\ncapabilities. Overall, BALSa offers an efficient and scalable approach to the\ndevelopment of ALLMs."

This motivates us to ask: What kind of diversity in training\ndata actually drives generalization in language models -- and how can we\nmeasure and amplify it? Through large-scale empirical analyses spanning over\n300 training runs, carefully controlled for data scale and quality, we show\nthat data diversity can be a strong predictor of generalization in LLM\nreasoning -- as measured by average model performance on unseen\nout-of-distribution benchmarks. We introduce G-Vendi, a metric that quantifies\ndiversity via the entropy of model-induced gradients. Despite using a small\noff-the-shelf proxy model for gradients, G-Vendi consistently outperforms\nalternative measures, achieving strong correlation (Spearman's $\\rho \\approx\n0.9$) with out-of-distribution (OOD) performance on both natural language\ninference (NLI) and math reasoning tasks. Building on this insight, we present\nPrismatic Synthesis, a framework for generating diverse synthetic data by\ntargeting underrepresented regions in gradient space. Experimental results show\nthat Prismatic Synthesis consistently improves model performance as we scale\nsynthetic data -- not just on in-distribution test but across unseen,\nout-of-distribution benchmarks -- significantly outperforming state-of-the-art\nmodels that rely on 20 times larger data generator than ours.

(3) We train the CoderInverter Models\n(CIMs) on CID, generating two lightweight LLMs (with 1.3B and 6.7B parameters)\nintended for efficient inference in privacy-sensitive or resource-constrained\nenvironments. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that the CIW\nsubstantially enhances the performance of various LLMs across multiple metrics.\nOur CIM-6.7B can achieve state-of-the-art decompilation performance,\noutperforming existing LLMs even with over 100x more parameters in\ndecompilation tasks, an average improvement of 11.03% in re-executability,\n6.27% in edit similarity."

While structured pruning\noffers a promising avenue for model compression, existing methods often\nstruggle with the detrimental effects of aggressive, simultaneous width and\ndepth reductions, leading to substantial performance degradation. This paper\nargues that a critical, often overlooked, aspect in making such aggressive\njoint pruning viable is the strategic re-initialization and adjustment of\nremaining weights to improve the model post-pruning training accuracies. We\nintroduce Pangu Light, a framework for LLM acceleration centered around\nstructured pruning coupled with novel weight re-initialization techniques\ndesigned to address this ``missing piece''. Our framework systematically\ntargets multiple axes, including model width, depth, attention heads, and\nRMSNorm, with its effectiveness rooted in novel re-initialization methods like\nCross-Layer Attention Pruning (CLAP) and Stabilized LayerNorm Pruning (SLNP)\nthat mitigate performance drops by providing the network a better training\nstarting point. Further enhancing efficiency, Pangu Light incorporates\nspecialized optimizations such as absorbing Post-RMSNorm computations and\ntailors its strategies to Ascend NPU characteristics. The Pangu Light models\nconsistently exhibit a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off, outperforming\nprominent baseline pruning methods like Nemotron and established LLMs like\nQwen3 series.

However, existing RL approaches typically bias the model's\noutput distribution toward reward-maximizing paths without introducing external\nknowledge. This limits their exploration capacity and results in a narrower\nreasoning capability boundary compared to base models. To address this\nlimitation, we propose TAPO (Thought-Augmented Policy Optimization), a novel\nframework that augments RL by incorporating external high-level guidance\n(\"thought patterns\"). By adaptively integrating structured thoughts during\ntraining, TAPO effectively balances model-internal exploration and external\nguidance exploitation. Extensive experiments show that our approach\nsignificantly outperforms GRPO by 99% on AIME, 41% on AMC, and 17% on Minerva\nMath. Notably, these high-level thought patterns, abstracted from only 500\nprior samples, generalize effectively across various tasks and models. This\nhighlights TAPO's potential for broader applications across multiple tasks and\ndomains. Our further analysis reveals that introducing external guidance\nproduces powerful reasoning models with superior explainability of inference\nbehavior and enhanced output readability.",

                    "value": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective method for training\nreasoning models. However, existing RL approaches typically bias the model's\noutput distribution toward reward-maximizing paths without introducing external\nknowledge. This limits their exploration capacity and results in a narrower\nreasoning capability boundary compared to base models. To address this\nlimitation, we propose TAPO (Thought-Augmented Policy Optimization), a novel\nframework that augments RL by incorporating external high-level guidance\n(\"thought patterns\"). By adaptively integrating structured thoughts during\ntraining, TAPO effectively balances model-internal exploration and external\nguidance exploitation. Extensive experiments show that our approach\nsignificantly outperforms GRPO by 99% on AIME, 41% on AMC, and 17% on Minerva\nMath. Notably, these high-level thought patterns, abstracted from only 500\nprior samples, generalize effectively across various tasks and models. This\nhighlights TAPO's potential for broader applications across multiple tasks and\ndomains. Our further analysis reveals that introducing external guidance\nproduces powerful reasoning models with superior explainability of inference\nbehavior and enhanced output readability."

One sticking point is\nthat outcome-based reinforcement learning for forecasting must learn from\nbinary, delayed, and noisy rewards, a regime where standard fine-tuning is\nbrittle. We show that outcome-only online RL on a 14B model can match\nfrontier-scale accuracy and surpass it in calibration and hypothetical\nprediction market betting by adapting two leading algorithms, Group-Relative\nPolicy Optimisation (GRPO) and ReMax, to the forecasting setting. Our\nadaptations remove per-question variance scaling in GRPO, apply\nbaseline-subtracted advantages in ReMax, hydrate training with 100k temporally\nconsistent synthetic questions, and introduce lightweight guard-rails that\npenalise gibberish, non-English responses and missing rationales, enabling a\nsingle stable pass over 110k events. Scaling ReMax to 110k questions and\nensembling seven predictions yields a 14B model that matches frontier baseline\no1 on accuracy on our holdout set (Brier = 0.193, p = 0.23) while beating it in\ncalibration (ECE = 0.042, p < 0.001). A simple trading rule turns this\ncalibration edge into \\$127 of hypothetical profit versus \\$92 for o1 (p =\n0.037).

To address this challenge, we introduce\nthe likelihood ratio regularized quantile regression (LR-QR) algorithm, which\ncombines the pinball loss with a novel choice of regularization in order to\nconstruct a threshold function without directly estimating the unknown\nlikelihood ratio. We show that the LR-QR method has coverage at the desired\nlevel in the target domain, up to a small error term that we can control. Our\nproofs draw on a novel analysis of coverage via stability bounds from learning\ntheory. Our experiments demonstrate that the LR-QR algorithm outperforms\nexisting methods on high-dimensional prediction tasks, including a regression\ntask for the Communities and Crime dataset, an image classification task from\nthe WILDS repository, and an LLM question-answering task on the MMLU benchmark.",

Moreover, under a fixed overall\ncompression ratio, we selectively compress the last few layers of the model,\nwhich mitigates error propagation and significantly improves the performance of\ncompressed models.Comprehensive evaluations of ResSVD on diverse LLM families\nand multiple benchmark datasets indicate that ResSVD consistently achieves\nsuperior performance over existing counterpart methods, demonstrating its\npractical effectiveness."

To address this, we propose a novel reinforcement learning\n(RL) finetuning framework tailored for few-step T2MV diffusion models to\njointly optimize per-view fidelity and cross-view consistency. Specifically, we\nfirst reformulate T2MV denoising across all views as a single unified Markov\ndecision process, enabling multiview-aware policy optimization driven by a\njoint-view reward objective.

To internalize its performance gains into the base\nsampling policy, we develop MV-ZigAL, a novel policy optimization strategy that\nuses reward advantages of ZMV-Sampling over standard sampling as learning\nsignals for policy updates. Finally, noting that the joint-view reward\nobjective under-optimizes per-view fidelity but naively optimizing single-view\nmetrics neglects cross-view alignment, we reframe RL finetuning for T2MV\ndiffusion models as a constrained optimization problem that maximizes per-view\nfidelity subject to an explicit joint-view constraint, thereby enabling more\nefficient and balanced policy updates.

However, the extensive reasoning\nsteps involved can significantly increase computational costs, posing\nchallenges for real-world deployment. Recent efforts have focused on optimizing\nreasoning efficiency by shortening the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning\nprocesses through various approaches, such as length-aware prompt engineering,\nsupervised fine-tuning on CoT data with variable lengths, and reinforcement\nlearning with length penalties. Although these methods effectively reduce\nreasoning length, they still necessitate an initial reasoning phase. More\nrecent approaches have attempted to integrate long-chain and short-chain\nreasoning abilities into a single model, yet they still rely on manual control\nto toggle between short and long CoT.In this work, we propose a novel approach\nthat autonomously switches between short and long reasoning chains based on\nproblem complexity. Our method begins with supervised fine-tuning of the base\nmodel to equip both long-chain and short-chain reasoning abilities. We then\nemploy reinforcement learning to further balance short and long CoT generation\nwhile maintaining accuracy through two key strategies: first, integrating\nreinforcement learning with a long-short adaptive group-wise reward strategy to\nassess prompt complexity and provide corresponding rewards; second,\nimplementing a logit-based reasoning mode switching loss to optimize the\nmodel's initial token choice, thereby guiding the selection of the reasoning\ntype.Evaluations on mathematical datasets demonstrate that our model can\ndynamically switch between long-chain and short-chain reasoning modes without\nsubstantially sacrificing performance.

The negative or positive impact of using LLM-powered tools\nfor writing will depend on how students use them; however, how students use\nChatGPT remains largely unknown, resulting in a limited understanding of its\nimpact on learning. To better understand how students use these tools, we\nconducted an online study $(n=70)$ where students were given an essay-writing\ntask using a custom platform we developed to capture the queries they made to\nChatGPT. To characterize their ChatGPT usage, we categorized each of the\nqueries students made to ChatGPT. We then analyzed the relationship between\nChatGPT usage and a variety of other metrics, including students'\nself-perception, attitudes towards AI, and the resulting essay itself. We found\nthat factors such as gender, race, and perceived self-efficacy can help predict\ndifferent AI usage patterns. Additionally, we found that different usage\npatterns were associated with varying levels of enjoyment and perceived\nownership over the essay.

In this paper, we study a novel\nproblem of incentivizing the reasoning capacity of LLMs without expensive\nhigh-quality demonstrations and reinforcement learning.

Our findings show that supervision from significantly weaker reasoners\ncan substantially improve student reasoning performance, recovering close to\n94% of the gains of expensive RL at a fraction of the cost. Experiments across\ndiverse benchmarks and model architectures demonstrate that weak reasoners can\neffectively incentivize reasoning in stronger student models, consistently\nimproving performance across a wide range of reasoning tasks.

The benefit of this is that the dependency sets of\nsuch conditioned extension variables can be made smaller to allow easier\nrefutations. This simple modification instantly solves many challenges in\np-simulating the QBF expansion rule, which cannot be p-simulated in proof\nsystems that have strategy extraction. Simulating expansion is even more\ncrucial in DQBF, where other methods are incomplete. In this paper we provide\nan overview of the strength of this new independent extension rule. We find\nthat a new version of Extended Frege called IndExtFrege+Red can p-simulate a\nmultitude of difficult QBF and DQBF techniques, even techniques that are\ndifficult to approach with ExtFrege+Red.

                    "value": "We show that extension variables in (D)QBF can be generalised by conditioning\non universal assignments. The benefit of this is that the dependency sets of\nsuch conditioned extension variables can be made smaller to allow easier\nrefutations. This simple modification instantly solves many challenges in\np-simulating the QBF expansion rule, which cannot be p-simulated in proof\nsystems that have strategy extraction. Simulating expansion is even more\ncrucial in DQBF, where other methods are incomplete. In this paper we provide\nan overview of the strength of this new independent extension rule. We find\nthat a new version of Extended Frege called IndExtFrege+Red can p-simulate a\nmultitude of difficult QBF and DQBF techniques, even techniques that are\ndifficult to approach with ExtFrege+Red.

REARANK explicitly reasons before reranking, significantly\nimproving both performance and interpretability. Leveraging reinforcement\nlearning and data augmentation, REARANK achieves substantial improvements over\nbaseline models across popular information retrieval benchmarks, notably\nrequiring only 179 annotated samples. Built on top of Qwen2.5-7B, our\nREARANK-7B demonstrates performance comparable to GPT-4 on both in-domain and\nout-of-domain benchmarks and even surpasses GPT-4 on reasoning-intensive BRIGHT\nbenchmarks. These results underscore the effectiveness of our approach and\nhighlight how reinforcement learning can enhance LLM reasoning capabilities in\nreranking."

                "summary": "Autonomous agents, which perceive environments and take actions to achieve\ngoals, have become increasingly feasible with the advancements in large\nlanguage models (LLMs). However, current powerful agents often depend on\nsophisticated prompt engineering combined with closed-source LLMs like GPT-4.\nAlthough training open-source LLMs using expert trajectories from teacher\nmodels has yielded some improvements in agent capabilities, this approach still\nfaces limitations such as performance plateauing and error propagation. To\nmitigate these challenges, we propose STeP, a novel method for improving\nLLM-based agent training. We synthesize self-reflected trajectories that\ninclude reflections and corrections of error steps, which enhance the\neffectiveness of LLM agents in learning from teacher models, enabling them to\nbecome agents capable of self-reflecting and correcting.

                    "value": "Autonomous agents, which perceive environments and take actions to achieve\ngoals, have become increasingly feasible with the advancements in large\nlanguage models (LLMs). However, current powerful agents often depend on\nsophisticated prompt engineering combined with closed-source LLMs like GPT-4.\nAlthough training open-source LLMs using expert trajectories from teacher\nmodels has yielded some improvements in agent capabilities, this approach still\nfaces limitations such as performance plateauing and error propagation. To\nmitigate these challenges, we propose STeP, a novel method for improving\nLLM-based agent training. We synthesize self-reflected trajectories that\ninclude reflections and corrections of error steps, which enhance the\neffectiveness of LLM agents in learning from teacher models, enabling them to\nbecome agents capable of self-reflecting and correcting.

To address biases in scoring, we\nintroduce the Error-oriented Scoring Mechanism (ESM), which quantifies\ntool-call errors and can be used as a training signal.

By doing so,\nwe inherit all the usual benefits of e-values -- such as anytime-validity,\npost-hoc validity and versatile sequential inference -- as well as greatly\nexpand the set of inferences achievable in a prediction-powered manner. In\nparticular, we show that every inference procedure that can be framed in terms\nof e-values has a prediction-powered counterpart, given by our method. We\nshowcase the effectiveness of our framework across a wide range of inference\ntasks, from simple hypothesis testing and confidence intervals to more involved\nprocedures for change-point detection and causal discovery, which were out of\nreach of previous techniques. Our approach is modular and easily integrable\ninto existing algorithms, making it a compelling choice for practical\napplications."

These methods typically alternate between\nLLM reasoning and retrieval to accumulate external information into the LLM's\ncontext. However, the ever-growing context inherently imposes an increasing\nburden on the LLM to perceive connections among critical information pieces,\nwith futile reasoning steps further exacerbating this overload issue. In this\npaper, we present KnowTrace, an elegant RAG framework to (1) mitigate the\ncontext overload and (2) bootstrap higher-quality multi-step reasoning. Instead\nof simply piling the retrieved contents, KnowTrace autonomously traces out\ndesired knowledge triplets to organize a specific knowledge graph relevant to\nthe input question. Such a structured workflow not only empowers the LLM with\nan intelligible context for inference, but also naturally inspires a reflective\nmechanism of knowledge backtracing to identify contributive LLM generations as\nprocess supervision data for self-bootstrapping. Extensive experiments show\nthat KnowTrace consistently surpasses existing methods across three multi-hop\nquestion answering benchmarks, and the bootstrapped version further amplifies\nthe gains.",

Objective: This study compares\ndifferent LLMs' performance in detecting code correctness and suggesting\nimprovements. Method: We tested GPT4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash on 492 AI generated\ncode blocks of varying correctness, along with 164 canonical code blocks from\nthe HumanEval benchmark. To simulate the code review task objectively, we\nexpected LLMs to assess code correctness and improve the code if needed. We ran\nexperiments with different configurations and reported on the results. Results:\nWith problem descriptions, GPT4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash correctly classified code\ncorrectness 68.50% and 63.89% of the time, respectively, and corrected the code\n67.83% and 54.26% of the time for the 492 code blocks of varying correctness.\nWithout problem descriptions, performance declined. The results for the 164\ncanonical code blocks differed, suggesting that performance depends on the type\nof code. Conclusion: LLM code reviews can help suggest improvements and assess\ncorrectness, but there is a risk of faulty outputs. We propose a process that\ninvolves humans, called the \"Human in the loop LLM Code Review\" to promote\nknowledge sharing while mitigating the risk of faulty outputs.",

Unfortunately, since developers frequently\nreuse code from their own or external code resources, some nearly identical\nvulnerabilities exist across many open-source projects.\n  We conducted a study to examine the prevalence of a particular vulnerable\ncode pattern that enables path traversal attacks (CWE-22) across open-source\nGitHub projects. To handle this study at the GitHub scale, we developed an\nautomated pipeline that scans GitHub for the targeted vulnerable pattern,\nconfirms the vulnerability by first running a static analysis and then\nexploiting the vulnerability in the context of the studied project, assesses\nits impact by calculating the CVSS score, generates a patch using GPT-4, and\nreports the vulnerability to the maintainers.\n  Using our pipeline, we identified 1,756 vulnerable open-source projects, some\nof which are very influential. For many of the affected projects, the\nvulnerability is critical (CVSS score higher than 9.0), as it can be exploited\nremotely without any privileges and critically impact the confidentiality and\navailability of the system. We have responsibly disclosed the vulnerability to\nthe maintainers, and 14\\% of the reported vulnerabilities have been remediated.\n  We also investigated the root causes of the vulnerable code pattern and\nassessed the side effects of the large number of copies of this vulnerable\npattern that seem to have poisoned several popular LLMs. Our study highlights\nthe urgent need to help secure the open-source ecosystem by leveraging scalable\nautomated vulnerability management solutions and raising awareness among\ndevelopers.",

Unfortunately, since developers frequently\nreuse code from their own or external code resources, some nearly identical\nvulnerabilities exist across many open-source projects.\n  We conducted a study to examine the prevalence of a particular vulnerable\ncode pattern that enables path traversal attacks (CWE-22) across open-source\nGitHub projects. To handle this study at the GitHub scale, we developed an\nautomated pipeline that scans GitHub for the targeted vulnerable pattern,\nconfirms the vulnerability by first running a static analysis and then\nexploiting the vulnerability in the context of the studied project, assesses\nits impact by calculating the CVSS score, generates a patch using GPT-4, and\nreports the vulnerability to the maintainers.\n  Using our pipeline, we identified 1,756 vulnerable open-source projects, some\nof which are very influential. For many of the affected projects, the\nvulnerability is critical (CVSS score higher than 9.0), as it can be exploited\nremotely without any privileges and critically impact the confidentiality and\navailability of the system. We have responsibly disclosed the vulnerability to\nthe maintainers, and 14\\% of the reported vulnerabilities have been remediated.\n  We also investigated the root causes of the vulnerable code pattern and\nassessed the side effects of the large number of copies of this vulnerable\npattern that seem to have poisoned several popular LLMs. Our study highlights\nthe urgent need to help secure the open-source ecosystem by leveraging scalable\nautomated vulnerability management solutions and raising awareness among\ndevelopers."

Although recent advancements at the\nintersection of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and robotics have highlighted\nits potential to handle versatile robotic tasks, current DRL-based\ncollision-free motion planners for manipulators are highly costly, hindering\ntheir deployment and application. This is due to an overreliance on the minimum\ndistance between the manipulator and obstacles, inadequate exploration and\ndecision-making by DRL, and inefficient data acquisition and utilization. In\nthis article, we propose URPlanner, a universal paradigm for collision-free\nrobotic motion planning based on DRL. URPlanner offers several advantages over\nexisting approaches: it is platform-agnostic, cost-effective in both training\nand deployment, and applicable to arbitrary manipulators without solving\ninverse kinematics. To achieve this, we first develop a parameterized task\nspace and a universal obstacle avoidance reward that is independent of minimum\ndistance. Second, we introduce an augmented policy exploration and evaluation\nalgorithm that can be applied to various DRL algorithms to enhance their\nperformance. Third, we propose an expert data diffusion strategy for efficient\npolicy learning, which can produce a large-scale trajectory dataset from only a\nfew expert demonstrations.

While structured pruning\noffers a promising avenue for model compression, existing methods often\nstruggle with the detrimental effects of aggressive, simultaneous width and\ndepth reductions, leading to substantial performance degradation. This paper\nargues that a critical, often overlooked, aspect in making such aggressive\njoint pruning viable is the strategic re-initialization and adjustment of\nremaining weights to improve the model post-pruning training accuracies. We\nintroduce Pangu Light, a framework for LLM acceleration centered around\nstructured pruning coupled with novel weight re-initialization techniques\ndesigned to address this ``missing piece''. Our framework systematically\ntargets multiple axes, including model width, depth, attention heads, and\nRMSNorm, with its effectiveness rooted in novel re-initialization methods like\nCross-Layer Attention Pruning (CLAP) and Stabilized LayerNorm Pruning (SLNP)\nthat mitigate performance drops by providing the network a better training\nstarting point. Further enhancing efficiency, Pangu Light incorporates\nspecialized optimizations such as absorbing Post-RMSNorm computations and\ntailors its strategies to Ascend NPU characteristics. The Pangu Light models\nconsistently exhibit a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off, outperforming\nprominent baseline pruning methods like Nemotron and established LLMs like\nQwen3 series. For instance, on Ascend NPUs, Pangu Light-32B's 81.6 average\nscore and 2585 tokens/s throughput exceed Qwen3-32B's 80.9 average score and\n2225 tokens/s.",

We show that outcome-only online RL on a 14B model can match\nfrontier-scale accuracy and surpass it in calibration and hypothetical\nprediction market betting by adapting two leading algorithms, Group-Relative\nPolicy Optimisation (GRPO) and ReMax, to the forecasting setting. Our\nadaptations remove per-question variance scaling in GRPO, apply\nbaseline-subtracted advantages in ReMax, hydrate training with 100k temporally\nconsistent synthetic questions, and introduce lightweight guard-rails that\npenalise gibberish, non-English responses and missing rationales, enabling a\nsingle stable pass over 110k events. Scaling ReMax to 110k questions and\nensembling seven predictions yields a 14B model that matches frontier baseline\no1 on accuracy on our holdout set (Brier = 0.193, p = 0.23) while beating it in\ncalibration (ECE = 0.042, p < 0.001). A simple trading rule turns this\ncalibration edge into \\$127 of hypothetical profit versus \\$92 for o1 (p =\n0.037).

To address this challenge, we introduce\nthe likelihood ratio regularized quantile regression (LR-QR) algorithm, which\ncombines the pinball loss with a novel choice of regularization in order to\nconstruct a threshold function without directly estimating the unknown\nlikelihood ratio. We show that the LR-QR method has coverage at the desired\nlevel in the target domain, up to a small error term that we can control. Our\nproofs draw on a novel analysis of coverage via stability bounds from learning\ntheory.

                "summary": "We present OvSGTR, a novel transformer-based framework for fully\nopen-vocabulary scene graph generation that overcomes the limitations of\ntraditional closed-set models. Conventional methods restrict both object and\nrelationship recognition to a fixed vocabulary, hindering their applicability\nto real-world scenarios where novel concepts frequently emerge. In contrast,\nour approach jointly predicts objects (nodes) and their inter-relationships\n(edges) beyond predefined categories. OvSGTR leverages a DETR-like architecture\nfeaturing a frozen image backbone and text encoder to extract high-quality\nvisual and semantic features, which are then fused via a transformer decoder\nfor end-to-end scene graph prediction. To enrich the model's understanding of\ncomplex visual relations, we propose a relation-aware pre-training strategy\nthat synthesizes scene graph annotations in a weakly supervised manner.\nSpecifically, we investigate three pipelines--scene parser-based, LLM-based,\nand multimodal LLM-based--to generate transferable supervision signals with\nminimal manual annotation. Furthermore, we address the common issue of\ncatastrophic forgetting in open-vocabulary settings by incorporating a\nvisual-concept retention mechanism coupled with a knowledge distillation\nstrategy, ensuring that the model retains rich semantic cues during\nfine-tuning. Extensive experiments on the VG150 benchmark demonstrate that\nOvSGTR achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple settings,\nincluding closed-set, open-vocabulary object detection-based, relation-based,\nand fully open-vocabulary scenarios. Our results highlight the promise of\nlarge-scale relation-aware pre-training and transformer architectures for\nadvancing scene graph generation towards more generalized and reliable visual\nunderstanding.",

                    "value": "We present OvSGTR, a novel transformer-based framework for fully\nopen-vocabulary scene graph generation that overcomes the limitations of\ntraditional closed-set models. Conventional methods restrict both object and\nrelationship recognition to a fixed vocabulary, hindering their applicability\nto real-world scenarios where novel concepts frequently emerge. In contrast,\nour approach jointly predicts objects (nodes) and their inter-relationships\n(edges) beyond predefined categories. OvSGTR leverages a DETR-like architecture\nfeaturing a frozen image backbone and text encoder to extract high-quality\nvisual and semantic features, which are then fused via a transformer decoder\nfor end-to-end scene graph prediction. To enrich the model's understanding of\ncomplex visual relations, we propose a relation-aware pre-training strategy\nthat synthesizes scene graph annotations in a weakly supervised manner.\nSpecifically, we investigate three pipelines--scene parser-based, LLM-based,\nand multimodal LLM-based--to generate transferable supervision signals with\nminimal manual annotation. Furthermore, we address the common issue of\ncatastrophic forgetting in open-vocabulary settings by incorporating a\nvisual-concept retention mechanism coupled with a knowledge distillation\nstrategy, ensuring that the model retains rich semantic cues during\nfine-tuning. Extensive experiments on the VG150 benchmark demonstrate that\nOvSGTR achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple settings,\nincluding closed-set, open-vocabulary object detection-based, relation-based,\nand fully open-vocabulary scenarios. Our results highlight the promise of\nlarge-scale relation-aware pre-training and transformer architectures for\nadvancing scene graph generation towards more generalized and reliable visual\nunderstanding."

However, these scores exhibit inherent\nbiases: global bias reflects a tendency to focus on the two ends of the visual\ntoken sequence, while local bias leads to an over-concentration on the same\nspatial positions across different frames. To address the issue of attention\nbias, we propose $\\textbf{A}$ttention-$\\textbf{D}$ebi$\\textbf{a}$sed\n$\\textbf{T}$oken $\\textbf{P}$runing for Video Large Language Models\n($\\textbf{AdaTP}$), a novel token pruning pipeline for Video LLMs. AdaTP\nintegrates two dedicated debiasing modules into the pipeline, targeting global\nattention bias and local attention bias, respectively. Without the need for\nadditional training, our method significantly reduces the computational\noverhead of Video LLMs while retaining the performance of vanilla models.\nExtensive evaluation shows that AdaTP achieves state-of-the-art performance in\nvarious commonly used video understanding benchmarks.

To address safety concerns, recent studies have proposed\nintegrating safety constraints into Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback\n(RLHF). However, these approaches tend to be complex, as they encompass\ncomplicated procedures in RLHF along with additional steps required by the\nsafety constraints. Inspired by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), we\nintroduce a new algorithm called SafeDPO, which is designed to directly\noptimize the safety alignment objective in a single stage of policy learning,\nwithout requiring relaxation. SafeDPO introduces only one additional\nhyperparameter to further enhance safety and requires only minor modifications\nto standard DPO.

                    "value": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance and find applications\nacross a growing number of fields, ensuring the safety of LLMs has become\nincreasingly critical. To address safety concerns, recent studies have proposed\nintegrating safety constraints into Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback\n(RLHF). However, these approaches tend to be complex, as they encompass\ncomplicated procedures in RLHF along with additional steps required by the\nsafety constraints. Inspired by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), we\nintroduce a new algorithm called SafeDPO, which is designed to directly\noptimize the safety alignment objective in a single stage of policy learning,\nwithout requiring relaxation. SafeDPO introduces only one additional\nhyperparameter to further enhance safety and requires only minor modifications\nto standard DPO. As a result, it eliminates the need to fit separate reward and\ncost models or to sample from the language model during fine-tuning, while\nstill enhancing the safety of LLMs. Finally, we demonstrate that SafeDPO\nachieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art safety alignment\nalgorithms, both in terms of aligning with human preferences and improving\nsafety."

Uncertainty quantification (UQ)\nmethods are a promising tool for coping with this fundamental shortcoming. Yet,\nexisting UQ methods face challenges such as high computational overhead or\nreliance on supervised learning. Here, we aim to bridge this gap.

As a result, they\nstruggle to simulate students with diverse cognitive abilities, as they often\nproduce overly advanced answers, missing the natural imperfections that\ncharacterize student learning and resulting in unrealistic simulations. To\naddress this issue, we propose a training-free framework for student\nsimulation. We begin by constructing a cognitive prototype for each student\nusing a knowledge graph, which captures their understanding of concepts from\npast learning records. This prototype is then mapped to new tasks to predict\nstudent performance. Next, we simulate student solutions based on these\npredictions and iteratively refine them using a beam search method to better\nreplicate realistic mistakes. To validate our approach, we construct the\n\\texttt{Student\\_100} dataset, consisting of $100$ students working on Python\nprogramming and $5,000$ learning records. Experimental results show that our\nmethod consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving $100\\%$ improvement\nin simulation accuracy.",

To systematically investigate this bias, we\ndevelop an automated pipeline to construct the dataset, incorporating 6\ndistinct coding task categories and 30 real-world application scenarios.\nLeveraging this dataset, we conduct the first comprehensive empirical study of\nprovider bias in LLM code generation across seven state-of-the-art LLMs,\nutilizing approximately 500 million tokens (equivalent to $5,000+ in\ncomputational costs). Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit significant\nprovider preferences, predominantly favoring services from Google and Amazon,\nand can autonomously modify input code to incorporate their preferred providers\nwithout users' requests. Such a bias holds far-reaching implications for market\ndynamics and societal equilibrium, potentially contributing to digital\nmonopolies.

One major challenge of RLHF is the inaccuracy of the\nintermediate reward model, especially in the tasks that requires complex\nreasoning for the reward model to score a response. We find that the\nreliability of the reward model varies across responses assigned with different\nrewards. This motivates us to filter the samples whose rewards may be\nunreliable to improve the signal-to-noise ratio during policy learning,\nresulting in Policy Filtration for Proximal Policy Optimization (PF-PPO). To\nchoose a proper policy filtering strategy, we use the coefficient of\ndetermination (R2) between the rewards and actual scores on filtered samples as\nthe metrics to help us find promising strategies since it measures how well the\nrewards filtered by PF-PPO indicate real performance. We provide extensive\nexperiments to validate the effectiveness of PF-PPO in code generation and math\nreasoning tasks. In code generation, PF-PPO achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance of 7-billion-parameter models on HumanEval (+7.9%), MBPP (+0.7%),\nand LeetCode Contest (+10.0%) which is a more challenging benchmark created by\nus. In math reasoning, PF-PPO yields performance increase using different\nreward models and benchmarks (Ape210K and CMATH). Code is available on\nhttps://github.com/swtheing/PF-PPO-RLHF.",
