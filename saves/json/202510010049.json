Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video\ngeneration: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation,\nwhich is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens\nprocessed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear\nAttention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video\ngeneration by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative\nproperties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with\nglobal context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional\nKV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we\nexplore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the\ntraining cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of\nMovieGen.

Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video\ngeneration: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation,\nwhich is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens\nprocessed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear\nAttention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video\ngeneration by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative\nproperties of linear attention.

However,\ndue to the thousands of visual tokens from the video frames, the key-value (KV)\ncache can significantly increase memory requirements, becoming a bottleneck for\ninference speed and memory usage. KV cache quantization is a widely used\napproach to address this problem. In this paper, we find that 2-bit KV\nquantization of VideoLLMs can hardly hurt the model performance, while the\nlimit of KV cache quantization in even lower bits has not been investigated. To\nbridge this gap, we introduce VidKV, a plug-and-play KV cache quantization\nmethod to compress the KV cache to lower than 2 bits. Specifically, (1) for\nkey, we propose a mixed-precision quantization strategy in the channel\ndimension, where we perform 2-bit quantization for anomalous channels and 1-bit\nquantization combined with FFT for normal channels; (2) for value, we implement\n1.58-bit quantization while selectively filtering semantically salient visual\ntokens for targeted preservation, for a better trade-off between precision and\nmodel performance. Importantly, our findings suggest that the value cache of\nVideoLLMs should be quantized in a per-channel fashion instead of the per-token\nfashion proposed by prior KV cache quantization works for LLMs. Empirically,\nextensive results with LLaVA-OV-7B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B on six benchmarks show\nthat VidKV effectively compresses the KV cache to 1.5-bit and 1.58-bit\nprecision with almost no performance drop compared to the FP16 counterparts.",

To overcome these\nlimitations, we\n  propose VAMamba, a Visual Adaptive Mamba framework with two key innovations.\nFirst,\n  QCLAM(Queue-basedCacheLow-rankAdaptiveMemory)enhancesfeaturelearningthrougha\n  FIFO cache that stores historical representations. Similarity between current\nLoRA-adapted and\n  cached features guides intelligent fusion, enabling dynamic reuse while\neffectively controlling\n  memorygrowth.Second, GPS-SS2D(GreedyPathScanSS2D)introducesadaptive scanning.\nA\n  Vision Transformer generates score maps to estimate pixel importance, and a\ngreedy strategy de termines optimal forward and backward scanning paths. These\nlearned trajectories replace rigid\n  patterns, enabling SS2D to perform targeted feature extraction. The\nintegration of QCLAM and\n  GPS-SS2D allows VAMamba to adaptively focus on degraded regions while\nmaintaining high\n  computational efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration\ntasks demonstrate\n  that VAMamba consistently outperforms existing approaches in both restoration\nquality and\n  efficiency, establishing new benchmarks for adaptive image restoration.

To overcome these\nlimitations, we\n  propose VAMamba, a Visual Adaptive Mamba framework with two key innovations.\nFirst,\n  QCLAM(Queue-basedCacheLow-rankAdaptiveMemory)enhancesfeaturelearningthrougha\n  FIFO cache that stores historical representations. Similarity between current\nLoRA-adapted and\n  cached features guides intelligent fusion, enabling dynamic reuse while\neffectively controlling\n  memorygrowth.Second, GPS-SS2D(GreedyPathScanSS2D)introducesadaptive scanning.\nA\n  Vision Transformer generates score maps to estimate pixel importance, and a\ngreedy strategy de termines optimal forward and backward scanning paths. These\nlearned trajectories replace rigid\n  patterns, enabling SS2D to perform targeted feature extraction. The\nintegration of QCLAM and\n  GPS-SS2D allows VAMamba to adaptively focus on degraded regions while\nmaintaining high\n  computational efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration\ntasks demonstrate\n  that VAMamba consistently outperforms existing approaches in both restoration\nquality and\n  efficiency, establishing new benchmarks for adaptive image restoration. Our\ncode is available\n  at https://github.com/WaterHQH/VAMamba."

To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level\nAR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states\nwith new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable\nlong video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);\nand short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as\nframe sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.\nWith these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model\nto minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days.

We used a nanolaminate dielectric\ncomprising a stack of multiple thin TiO2 and Al2O3 layers as RESURF dielectric\nand for field plate edge termination. Both Wfin of 200 nm and 500 nm\ndemonstrate excellent on-state performance with specific on-resistance (Ron,sp)\nof 9.8-12 mohmcm2, and 10^10 rectification ratio. A self-aligned photoresist\nplanarization and etch-back process was employed to expose the top of the fins\nfor Schottky contact formation, eliminating critical lithographic alignment\nchallenges in sub-micron scale processing. We achieved a breakdown of 2.34 kV\nwith very low leakage currents before catastrophic breakdown. The measured\nbreakdown voltage is limited by dielectric breakdown at the trench bottom\ncorner as verified by metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) test structure. TCAD\nsimulation shows a reduced electric field at the surface of the\nmetal-semiconductor junction due to the RESURF effect, resulting in very low\nreverse leakage before breakdown. The parallel plane electric field in the\n\\b{eta} -Ga2O3 is extracted to be 3.8 MV/cm from TCAD simulations using\naccurately extracted drift layer doping profile from high voltage CV\nmeasurements. A power figure of merit of 0.867 GW/cm2(0.56 GW/cm2 with current\nspreading) was calculated. Enhanced RESURF by integration of high-k dielectrics\nwith self-aligned photoresist planarization, offers a promising pathway towards\nhigh figure of merit, low leakage high-performance vertical devices.",

Finally, we propose the reply\naugmented reinforcement learning method that enables TP agent to periodically\nreplay from a failures experience buffer, emerging notable agentic capacity.

While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising\ndirection, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that\nperforms poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations,\nwe introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid\nstorage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that\nnot all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial\nfirst and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors\nfor attention. Second, for the vast majority of intermediate tokens, it applies\nlow-rank compression by incrementally adapting the projection basis using Oja's\nalgorithm for online principal component analysis. This adaptation involves a\ncomprehensive update during prompt prefilling and lightweight periodic updates\nduring decoding, ensuring the subspace remains aligned with the evolving\ncontext. Crucially, our framework is fully compatible with modern attention\nmodules like FlashAttention.

To\nthis end, we propose a novel decoupled decoding framework that decouples\npositional guidance from content representation, encoding them separately as\nqueries and key-value pairs.

Consequently,\nARPG readily generalizes to zero-shot inference tasks such as image inpainting,\noutpainting, and resolution expansion.

In this\nwork, we explore the role of uncertainty as a potential indicator of sparsity\nwithin LLMs. We propose UNComp, an uncertainty-aware framework that leverages\ntruncated matrix entropy to identify areas of low information content, thereby\nrevealing sparsity patterns that can be used for adaptive compression.

To ensure correctness, we introduce an energy-based residual norm that\nbalances velocity and pressure contributions, and validate all implementations\nusing a high-contrast sinker benchmark representative of realistic geodynamic\nnumerical models. Our performance study on NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper nodes of\nthe ALPS supercomputer demonstrates that all smoothers scale well within a\nsingle NUMA domain, but the RAS-Jacobi smoother consistently achieves the best\nperformance at higher core counts. It sustains over 90% weak-scaling efficiency\nup to 64 cores and delivers up to a threefold speedup compared to the C++\nJacobi baseline, owing to improved cache reuse and reduced memory traffic.\nThese results show that temporal blocking, already employed in\ndistributed-memory solvers to reduce communication, can also provide\nsubstantial benefits at the socket and NUMA level.

Although model compression and parameter\noffloading are common strategies to address memory limitations, compression can\ndegrade quality, and offloading maintains quality but suffers from slow\ninference. Speculative decoding presents a promising avenue to accelerate\nparameter offloading, utilizing a fast draft model to propose multiple draft\ntokens, which are then verified by the target LLM in parallel with a single\nforward pass. This method reduces the time-consuming data transfers in forward\npasses that involve offloaded weight transfers. Existing methods often rely on\npretrained weights of the same family, but require additional training to align\nwith custom-trained models. Moreover, approaches that involve draft model\ntraining usually yield only modest speedups. This limitation arises from\ninsufficient alignment with the target model, preventing higher token\nacceptance lengths. To address these challenges and achieve greater speedups,\nwe propose SubSpec, a plug-and-play method to accelerate parameter offloading\nthat is lossless and training-free. SubSpec constructs a highly aligned draft\nmodel by generating low-bit quantized substitute layers from offloaded target\nLLM portions. Additionally, our method shares the remaining GPU-resident layers\nand the KV-Cache, further reducing memory overhead and enhance alignment.\nSubSpec achieves a high average acceptance length, delivering 9.1x speedup for\nQwen2.5 7B on MT-Bench (8GB VRAM limit) and an average of 12.5x speedup for\nQwen2.5 32B on popular generation benchmarks (24GB VRAM limit).",

Spiffy proposes\ndraft states by leveraging the dLLM's distribution itself in an\nauto-speculative manner. This approach is efficient and effective, and\neliminates the overheads of training and running an independent draft model. To\nstructure the candidate draft states, we propose a novel directed draft graph\nwhich is uniquely designed to take advantage of the bidirectional, block-wise\nnature of dLLM generation and can be verified in parallel by the dLLM. To\nfurther optimize the structure of these draft graphs, we introduce an\nefficient, offline calibration algorithm that procedurally determines\nhigh-quality graph configurations.

Crucially, Spiffy is also complementary to other recent\ninnovations in improving dLLM generation speeds such as KV-caching and\nmulti-token unmasking.

Our\nprimary objective is to assess the impact of a multi-level prefetching engine\non overall system performance. Additionally, we analyze the individual\ncontribution of each prefetching level to system efficiency. To achieve this,\nthe study evaluates two key prefetching approaches: HMC (Hybrid Memory\nController) and HMC+L1, both of which employ prefetching mechanisms commonly\nused by processor vendors. The HMC approach integrates a prefetcher within the\noff-chip hybrid memory controller, while the HMC+L1 approach combines this with\nadditional L1 on-chip prefetchers.\n  Experimental results on an out-of-order execution processor show that on-chip\ncache prefetchers are crucial for maximizing the benefits of off-chip\nprefetching, which in turn further enhances performance. Specifically, the\noff-chip HMC prefetcher achieves coverage and accuracy rates exceeding 60% and\nup to 80%, while the combined HMC+L1 approach boosts off-chip prefetcher\ncoverage to as much as 92%. Consequently, overall performance increases from 9%\nwith the HMC approach to 12% when L1 prefetching is also employed.",

Additionally, we analyze the individual\ncontribution of each prefetching level to system efficiency. To achieve this,\nthe study evaluates two key prefetching approaches: HMC (Hybrid Memory\nController) and HMC+L1, both of which employ prefetching mechanisms commonly\nused by processor vendors. The HMC approach integrates a prefetcher within the\noff-chip hybrid memory controller, while the HMC+L1 approach combines this with\nadditional L1 on-chip prefetchers.\n  Experimental results on an out-of-order execution processor show that on-chip\ncache prefetchers are crucial for maximizing the benefits of off-chip\nprefetching, which in turn further enhances performance. Specifically, the\noff-chip HMC prefetcher achieves coverage and accuracy rates exceeding 60% and\nup to 80%, while the combined HMC+L1 approach boosts off-chip prefetcher\ncoverage to as much as 92%. Consequently, overall performance increases from 9%\nwith the HMC approach to 12% when L1 prefetching is also employed."

                "summary": "Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is the premier method for characterizing\nthe nanoscale surface pores in ultrafiltration (UF) membranes and the support\nlayers of reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Based on SEM, the conventional\nunderstanding is that membranes typically have low surface porosities of <10%.\nWe hypothesized that high acceleration voltage during SEM imaging and sputter\nmetal coatings required for SEM have led to systematic underestimations of\nporosity and pore size. We showed that imaging a commercial UF membrane at 1,\n5, and 10 kV reduced measured porosity from 10.3% (1 kV) to 6.3% (10 kV), while\nincreasing Pt coating thickness from 1.5 to 5 nm lowered porosity by 54% for\nthe UF membrane (12.9% to 5.8%) and 46% for an RO support (13.1% to 7.0%). To\naccount for coating thickness, we developed a digital correction method that\nsimulates pore dilation, enabling the pore structure to be estimated for\nuncoated membranes. Dilation yielded uncoated porosity values of 23% for the UF\nmembrane and 20% for the RO support, about 3-fold greater than values observed\nwith a 4 nm coating. Mean pore diameters were 2-fold greater for the UF\nmembrane and 1.5-fold greater for the RO support. Critically, dilation-derived\npore-size distributions agreed with low-flux dextran-retention data fitted with\nthe Bungay-Brenner model. Our results suggest that surface porosities and pore\nsizes of nanoporous membranes are much larger than previously understood, with\nmajor implications for structure/transport relationships. For future nanoscale\npore analysis of membranes (and other nanoporous materials), we recommend low\nacceleration voltage (1 kV), minimal coatings (1-2 nm), and digital dilation to\naccount for coating artifacts",

Additionally, we report on first\npreclinical in vitro cell and in vivo mouse brain irradiations conducted with\nthe LFXT prototype. The LFXT was high voltage conditioned up to 300 kV.The\nfocal spot characterization resulted in a strongly eccentric electron\ndistribution with a width of 72.3 $\\mu$m. Dosimetry showed sharp microbeam dose\nprofiles with steep lateral penumbras and a peak-to-valley dose ratio above 10\nthroughout a 70 mm thick PMMA phantom. An open-field dose rate of 4.3 Gy/s was\nmeasured at an acceleration voltage of 150 kV and a beam current of 17.4 mA at\n150 mm distance from the focal spot. In vitro and in vivo experiments\ndemonstrated the feasibility of the LFXT for minibeam and microbeam\napplications with field sizes of 1.5-2 cm.

We successfully\nconstructed and commissioned the first proof-of-concept LFXT prototype.\nDosimetric characterizations of the achieved microbeam field showed the\nsuperiority of the LFXT compared to conventional X-ray tubes in terms of beam\nquality.

We find that data-efficient\nlanguage model pre-training on fewer than 100B tokens utilizing meta-tokens and\nour meta-attention mechanism achieves strong performance on these tasks after\nfine-tuning. We suggest that these gains arise due to the meta-tokens\nsharpening the positional encoding. This enables them to operate as trainable,\ncontent-based landmarks, implicitly compressing preceding context and \"caching\"\nit in the meta-token. At inference-time, the meta-token points to relevant\ncontext, facilitating length generalization up to 2$\\times$ its context window,\neven after extension with YaRN. We provide further evidence of these behaviors\nby visualizing model internals to study the residual stream, and assessing the\ncompression quality by information-theoretic analysis on the rate-distortion\ntradeoff. Our findings suggest that pre-training LMs with meta-tokens offers a\nsimple, data-efficient method to enhance long-context language modeling\nperformance, while introducing new insights into the nature of their behavior\ntowards length generalization."

Unlike cascaded pipelines that\nisolate speech synthesis, MGM-Omni adopts a \"brain-mouth\" design with a\ndual-track, token-based architecture that cleanly decouples multimodal\nreasoning from real-time speech generation. This design enables efficient\ncross-modal interaction and low-latency, streaming speech generation. For\nunderstanding, a unified training strategy coupled with a dual audio encoder\ndesign enables long-form audio perception across diverse acoustic conditions.\nFor generation, a chunk-based parallel decoding scheme narrows the text speech\ntoken-rate gap, accelerating inference and supporting streaming zero-shot voice\ncloning with stable timbre over extended durations. Compared to concurrent\nwork, MGM-Omni achieves these capabilities with markedly data-efficient\ntraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGM-Omni outperforms existing\nopen source models in preserving timbre identity across extended sequences,\nproducing natural and context-aware speech, and achieving superior long-form\naudio and omnimodal understanding. MGM-Omni establishes an efficient,\nend-to-end paradigm for omnimodal understanding and controllable, personalised\nlong-horizon speech generation.",

                    "value": "We present MGM-Omni, a unified Omni LLM for omni-modal understanding and\nexpressive, long-horizon speech generation. Unlike cascaded pipelines that\nisolate speech synthesis, MGM-Omni adopts a \"brain-mouth\" design with a\ndual-track, token-based architecture that cleanly decouples multimodal\nreasoning from real-time speech generation. This design enables efficient\ncross-modal interaction and low-latency, streaming speech generation. For\nunderstanding, a unified training strategy coupled with a dual audio encoder\ndesign enables long-form audio perception across diverse acoustic conditions.\nFor generation, a chunk-based parallel decoding scheme narrows the text speech\ntoken-rate gap, accelerating inference and supporting streaming zero-shot voice\ncloning with stable timbre over extended durations. Compared to concurrent\nwork, MGM-Omni achieves these capabilities with markedly data-efficient\ntraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGM-Omni outperforms existing\nopen source models in preserving timbre identity across extended sequences,\nproducing natural and context-aware speech, and achieving superior long-form\naudio and omnimodal understanding. MGM-Omni establishes an efficient,\nend-to-end paradigm for omnimodal understanding and controllable, personalised\nlong-horizon speech generation."

For each environment, we\nformalize the state and action spaces, the sensory encoding and motor decoding\nmechanisms, and the feedback protocols based on predictable (reward) and\nunpredictable (punishment) stimulation, which serve to drive model refinement.\nIn a significant methodological advance, we propose a meta-learning approach\nwhere a Large Language Model automates the generative design and optimization\nof experimental protocols, thereby scaling the process of environment and\ncurriculum design. Finally, we outline a multi-modal evaluation strategy that\nmoves beyond task performance to directly measure the physical correlates of\nthe learned world model by quantifying synaptic plasticity at\nelectrophysiological, cellular, and molecular levels.

It employs an Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization\nobjective that contrasts teacher and student traces for more effective\nlearning, and adopts a mixed-policy strategy for utilizing student-generated\noutputs, outperforming both off- and on-policy alternatives. Experiments on\nfive datasets and multiple student models show consistent improvements over\nconventional black-box KD baselines."

When only\nbiased convenience samples are available, fine-tuning small (3B to 8B)\nopen-source LLMs can recover both individual-level predictions and\npopulation-level distributions more accurately than zero-shot and often better\nthan tabular methods. This suggests fine-tuned LLMs offer a promising strategy\nfor researchers working with non-probability samples or systematic missingness,\nand may enable new survey designs requiring only easily accessible\nsubpopulations."

Specifically,\nwe use AlphaEvolve (an LLM coding agent) to study two settings:\n  a) Average-case hardness for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set: We improve a\nrecent result of Kunisky and Yu to obtain near-optimal upper and (conditional)\nlower bounds on certification algorithms for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set on\nrandom 3- and 4-regular graphs. Our improved lower bounds are obtained by\nconstructing nearly extremal Ramanujan graphs on as many as $163$ nodes, using\nAlphaEvolve. Additionally, via analytical arguments we strengthen the upper\nbounds to settle the computational hardness of these questions up to an error\nin the third decimal place.\n  b) Worst-case Hardness of Approximation for MAX-k-CUT: We obtain new\ninapproximability results, proving that it is NP-hard to approximate MAX-4-CUT\nand MAX-3-CUT within factors of $0.987$ and $0.9649$ respectively, using\nAlphaEvolve to discover new gadget reductions. Our MAX-4-CUT result improves\nupon the SOTA of $0.9883$, and our MAX-3-CUT result improves on the current\nbest gadget-based inapproximability result of $0.9853$, but falls short of\nimproving the SOTA of $16/17$ that relies on a custom PCP, rather than a gadget\nreduction from \"standard\" H{\\aa}stad-style PCPs.\n  A key technical challenge we faced: verifying a candidate construction\nproduced by AlphaEvolve is costly (often requiring exponential time).

                    "value": "We explore whether techniques from AI can help discover new combinatorial\nstructures that improve on known limits on efficient algorithms. Specifically,\nwe use AlphaEvolve (an LLM coding agent) to study two settings:\n  a) Average-case hardness for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set: We improve a\nrecent result of Kunisky and Yu to obtain near-optimal upper and (conditional)\nlower bounds on certification algorithms for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set on\nrandom 3- and 4-regular graphs. Our improved lower bounds are obtained by\nconstructing nearly extremal Ramanujan graphs on as many as $163$ nodes, using\nAlphaEvolve. Additionally, via analytical arguments we strengthen the upper\nbounds to settle the computational hardness of these questions up to an error\nin the third decimal place.\n  b) Worst-case Hardness of Approximation for MAX-k-CUT: We obtain new\ninapproximability results, proving that it is NP-hard to approximate MAX-4-CUT\nand MAX-3-CUT within factors of $0.987$ and $0.9649$ respectively, using\nAlphaEvolve to discover new gadget reductions. Our MAX-4-CUT result improves\nupon the SOTA of $0.9883$, and our MAX-3-CUT result improves on the current\nbest gadget-based inapproximability result of $0.9853$, but falls short of\nimproving the SOTA of $16/17$ that relies on a custom PCP, rather than a gadget\nreduction from \"standard\" H{\\aa}stad-style PCPs.\n  A key technical challenge we faced: verifying a candidate construction\nproduced by AlphaEvolve is costly (often requiring exponential time). In both\nsettings above, our results were enabled by using AlphaEvolve itself to evolve\nthe verification procedure to be faster (sometimes by $10,000\\times$).

In this work, we introduced Discrete Diffusion Divergence Instruct\n(DiDi-Instruct), a training-based method that leads to fast language generation\nmodels by initializing from a pre-trained (masked) discrete diffusion language\nmodel (dLLM). The resulting DiDi-Instruct model outperforms the dLLM\ncounterparts and the GPT-2 baseline with 64x acceleration. In the theoretical\npart of the paper, we build the foundation of DiDi-Instruct in a framework of\nintegral KL-divergence minimization, with practical training algorithms. We\nalso introduce techniques like grouped reward normalization, intermediate-state\nmatching, and the reward-guided ancestral sampler (RGAS) that significantly\nimprove the training stability, the model coverage, and the inference\nperformances. On OpenWebText, DiDi-Instruct outperforms all accelerated\nlanguage generation models as well as the GPT-2 baseline and the standard\ndLLMs, achieving sample perplexities ranging from 62.2 (8 NFEs) to 18.4 (128\nNFEs). These performance gains are accomplished with a negligible entropy loss\nof about 1% and 20x less additional training wall-clock time. We further\nvalidate the robustness and effectiveness of DiDi-Instruct through extensive\nablation studies, model scaling, and the generation of discrete protein\nsequences. In conclusion, DiDi-Instruct is an efficient yet effective\ndistillation method, enabling language generation in the blink of an eye.

Recent studies enhance support features by\nincorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic\nfusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that\ncontradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual\ninstances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for\nFew-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts\nconditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly\nintegrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of\nCross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment\n(CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support\nimages to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single\nstructured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic\nunderstanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of\nsemantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act\nrespectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level\nclass semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited\nsupport data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support,\nand synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the\n3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear\nrelationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent\nmultimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new\nstate-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard,\ncross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios.

This uniform training strategy\nleads to inefficient exploration of problems the model has already mastered,\nwhile concurrently lacking effective guidance on problems that are challenging\nits abilities the most, limiting both learning efficiency and upper-bound\nperformance. To address this, we propose CLPO (Curriculum-guided Learning for\nPolicy Optimization), a novel algorithm that creates a dynamic pedagogical\nfeedback loop within the policy optimization process. The core of CLPO\nleverages the model's own rollout performance to conduct real-time difficulty\nassessment, thereby constructing an Online Curriculum. This curriculum then\nguides an Adaptive Problem Restructuring mechanism, where the model acts as its\nown teacher: it diversifies medium-difficulty problems to promote\ngeneralization and simplifies challenging problems to make them more\nattainable. Our approach transforms the static training procedure into a\ndynamic process that co-evolves with the model's capabilities.

We then use\nCMs as a lens for studying the source of correctness prediction ability and its\ngeneralization, systematically controlling their training data and finding that\nanswer phrasing is a strong predictor for correctness. We further explore\nalternative methods of injecting history without training an LLM, finding that\nincluding history as in-context examples can help improve correctness\nprediction, and post-hoc calibration can provide complementary reductions in\ncalibration error. We evaluate GCMs based on Qwen3-8B across 5 model families\nand the MMLU and TriviaQA datasets, as well as on a downstream selective\nprediction task, finding that reliable LLM confidence estimation is a\ngeneralizable and model-agnostic skill learned by systematically encoding\ncorrectness history rather than a model-specific skill reliant on\nself-introspection.",

We then use\nCMs as a lens for studying the source of correctness prediction ability and its\ngeneralization, systematically controlling their training data and finding that\nanswer phrasing is a strong predictor for correctness. We further explore\nalternative methods of injecting history without training an LLM, finding that\nincluding history as in-context examples can help improve correctness\nprediction, and post-hoc calibration can provide complementary reductions in\ncalibration error. We evaluate GCMs based on Qwen3-8B across 5 model families\nand the MMLU and TriviaQA datasets, as well as on a downstream selective\nprediction task, finding that reliable LLM confidence estimation is a\ngeneralizable and model-agnostic skill learned by systematically encoding\ncorrectness history rather than a model-specific skill reliant on\nself-introspection."

This\nprogress is bottlenecked by a critical evaluation gap: established benchmarks\nfocus on algorithmic correctness and are blind to the visual fidelity and\ninteractive integrity that define modern user experiences. To bridge this gap,\nwe introduce ArtifactsBench, a new benchmark and paradigm for the automated,\nmultimodal evaluation of visual code generation. Our framework programmatically\nrenders each generated artifact and captures its dynamic behavior through\ntemporal screenshots. This visual evidence, alongside the source code, is then\nassessed by a Multimodal LLM (MLLM)-as-Judge, which is rigorously guided by a\nfine-grained, per-task checklist to ensure holistic and reproducible scoring.\nWe construct a new benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks and evaluate over 30\nleading LLMs. Our automated evaluation achieves a striking 94.4% ranking\nconsistency with WebDev Arena, the gold-standard for human preference in web\ndevelopment, and over 90% pairwise agreement with human experts. This\nestablishes ArtifactsBench as the first framework to reliably automate the\nassessment of human-perceived quality at scale.

                    "value": "The generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly\nexpanding from static code to dynamic, interactive visual artifacts. This\nprogress is bottlenecked by a critical evaluation gap: established benchmarks\nfocus on algorithmic correctness and are blind to the visual fidelity and\ninteractive integrity that define modern user experiences. To bridge this gap,\nwe introduce ArtifactsBench, a new benchmark and paradigm for the automated,\nmultimodal evaluation of visual code generation. Our framework programmatically\nrenders each generated artifact and captures its dynamic behavior through\ntemporal screenshots. This visual evidence, alongside the source code, is then\nassessed by a Multimodal LLM (MLLM)-as-Judge, which is rigorously guided by a\nfine-grained, per-task checklist to ensure holistic and reproducible scoring.\nWe construct a new benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks and evaluate over 30\nleading LLMs. Our automated evaluation achieves a striking 94.4% ranking\nconsistency with WebDev Arena, the gold-standard for human preference in web\ndevelopment, and over 90% pairwise agreement with human experts. This\nestablishes ArtifactsBench as the first framework to reliably automate the\nassessment of human-perceived quality at scale.

                "summary": "Diffusion Transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video\ngeneration, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive\nquadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference\nbottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have\nshown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining\nthese approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration\nyields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after\nstep distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To\novercome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint\ntraining framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention\n(ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to\nfocus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware\nstep distillation paradigm, built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM),\ndirectly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than\ntreating it as a separate compression step and features fast convergence. We\nvalidate BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B, and\nour framework demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales.\nOn Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over\na 50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video\nsequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the\nacceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the\nVBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from\n0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further\ncorroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations.

                    "value": "Diffusion Transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video\ngeneration, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive\nquadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference\nbottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have\nshown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining\nthese approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration\nyields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after\nstep distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To\novercome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint\ntraining framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention\n(ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to\nfocus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware\nstep distillation paradigm, built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM),\ndirectly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than\ntreating it as a separate compression step and features fast convergence. We\nvalidate BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B, and\nour framework demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales.\nOn Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over\na 50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video\nsequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the\nacceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the\nVBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from\n0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further\ncorroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations.

While stitching is historically a strength of offline reinforcement\nlearning, recent generative behavioural cloning (BC) methods have also shown\nproficiency at stitching. However, the main factors behind this are poorly\nunderstood, hindering the development of new algorithms that can reliably\nstitch. Focusing on diffusion planners trained via BC, we find two properties\nare needed to compose: \\emph{positional equivariance} and \\emph{local\nreceptiveness}. We use these two properties to explain architecture, data, and\ninference choices in existing generative BC methods based on diffusion\nplanning, including replanning frequency, data augmentation, and data scaling.\nExperimental comparisions show that (1) while locality is more important than\npositional equivariance in creating a diffusion planner capable of composition,\nboth are crucial (2) enabling these properties through relatively simple\narchitecture choices can be competitive with more computationally expensive\nmethods such as replanning or scaling data, and (3) simple inpainting-based\nguidance can guide architecturally compositional models to enable\ngeneralization in goal-conditioned settings.",

                    "value": "In planning, stitching is an ability of algorithms to piece together\nsub-trajectories of data they are trained on to generate new and diverse\nbehaviours. While stitching is historically a strength of offline reinforcement\nlearning, recent generative behavioural cloning (BC) methods have also shown\nproficiency at stitching. However, the main factors behind this are poorly\nunderstood, hindering the development of new algorithms that can reliably\nstitch. Focusing on diffusion planners trained via BC, we find two properties\nare needed to compose: \\emph{positional equivariance} and \\emph{local\nreceptiveness}. We use these two properties to explain architecture, data, and\ninference choices in existing generative BC methods based on diffusion\nplanning, including replanning frequency, data augmentation, and data scaling.\nExperimental comparisions show that (1) while locality is more important than\npositional equivariance in creating a diffusion planner capable of composition,\nboth are crucial (2) enabling these properties through relatively simple\narchitecture choices can be competitive with more computationally expensive\nmethods such as replanning or scaling data, and (3) simple inpainting-based\nguidance can guide architecturally compositional models to enable\ngeneralization in goal-conditioned settings."

S1's initial solutions, often limited by constraint\nadherence issues, are improved through targeted feedback and examples from\nmetacognition, aligning S1 more closely with CSP requirements. If S1 fails to\nresolve the problem, metacognition strategically invokes S2, ensuring accurate\nand reliable solutions. Our empirical results demonstrate that SOFAI_v2\nachieves a 10.5% higher success rate and is up to 30% faster than a traditional\nsymbolic solver in solving graph coloring problems."

                "summary": "The widespread use of chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs) such\nas ChatGPT and Llama has fundamentally reshaped how people seek information and\nadvice across domains. Increasingly, these chatbots are being used in\nhigh-stakes contexts, including emotional support and mental health concerns.\nWhile LLMs can offer scalable support, their ability to safely detect and\nrespond to acute mental health crises remains poorly understood. Progress is\nhampered by the absence of unified crisis taxonomies, robust annotated\nbenchmarks, and empirical evaluations grounded in clinical best practices. In\nthis work, we address these gaps by introducing a unified taxonomy of six\nclinically-informed mental health crisis categories, curating a diverse\nevaluation dataset, and establishing an expert-designed protocol for assessing\nresponse appropriateness. We systematically benchmark three state-of-the-art\nLLMs for their ability to classify crisis types and generate safe, appropriate\nresponses. The results reveal that while LLMs are highly consistent and\ngenerally reliable in addressing explicit crisis disclosures, significant risks\nremain. A non-negligible proportion of responses are rated as inappropriate or\nharmful, with responses generated by an open-weight model exhibiting higher\nfailure rates than those generated by the commercial ones. We also identify\nsystemic weaknesses in handling indirect or ambiguous risk signals, a reliance\non formulaic and inauthentic default replies, and frequent misalignment with\nuser context. These findings underscore the urgent need for enhanced\nsafeguards, improved crisis detection, and context-aware interventions in LLM\ndeployments.

                    "value": "The widespread use of chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs) such\nas ChatGPT and Llama has fundamentally reshaped how people seek information and\nadvice across domains. Increasingly, these chatbots are being used in\nhigh-stakes contexts, including emotional support and mental health concerns.\nWhile LLMs can offer scalable support, their ability to safely detect and\nrespond to acute mental health crises remains poorly understood. Progress is\nhampered by the absence of unified crisis taxonomies, robust annotated\nbenchmarks, and empirical evaluations grounded in clinical best practices. In\nthis work, we address these gaps by introducing a unified taxonomy of six\nclinically-informed mental health crisis categories, curating a diverse\nevaluation dataset, and establishing an expert-designed protocol for assessing\nresponse appropriateness. We systematically benchmark three state-of-the-art\nLLMs for their ability to classify crisis types and generate safe, appropriate\nresponses. The results reveal that while LLMs are highly consistent and\ngenerally reliable in addressing explicit crisis disclosures, significant risks\nremain. A non-negligible proportion of responses are rated as inappropriate or\nharmful, with responses generated by an open-weight model exhibiting higher\nfailure rates than those generated by the commercial ones. We also identify\nsystemic weaknesses in handling indirect or ambiguous risk signals, a reliance\non formulaic and inauthentic default replies, and frequent misalignment with\nuser context. These findings underscore the urgent need for enhanced\nsafeguards, improved crisis detection, and context-aware interventions in LLM\ndeployments. Our taxonomy, datasets, and evaluation framework lay the\ngroundwork for ongoing research and responsible innovation in AI-driven mental\nhealth support, helping to minimize harm and better protect vulnerable users."

Subsequent RL then explores without direct access to the rich,\nground-truth knowledge in expert demonstrations, leading to inefficient,\nungrounded updates. This separation prevents mutual regularization between data\nsources.

Subsequent RL then explores without direct access to the rich,\nground-truth knowledge in expert demonstrations, leading to inefficient,\nungrounded updates. This separation prevents mutual regularization between data\nsources.

We present a curriculum of three scalable, closed-loop virtual\nenvironments designed to train these biological agents and probe the underlying\nsynaptic mechanisms of learning, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and\nlong-term depression (LTD). We detail the design of three distinct task\nenvironments that demand progressively more sophisticated world models for\nsuccessful decision-making: (1) a conditional avoidance task for learning\nstatic state-action contingencies, (2) a one-dimensional predator-prey scenario\nfor goal-directed interaction, and (3) a replication of the classic Pong game\nfor modeling dynamic, continuous-time systems. For each environment, we\nformalize the state and action spaces, the sensory encoding and motor decoding\nmechanisms, and the feedback protocols based on predictable (reward) and\nunpredictable (punishment) stimulation, which serve to drive model refinement.\nIn a significant methodological advance, we propose a meta-learning approach\nwhere a Large Language Model automates the generative design and optimization\nof experimental protocols, thereby scaling the process of environment and\ncurriculum design. Finally, we outline a multi-modal evaluation strategy that\nmoves beyond task performance to directly measure the physical correlates of\nthe learned world model by quantifying synaptic plasticity at\nelectrophysiological, cellular, and molecular levels.

                "summary": "Recent advances in agent development have focused on scaling model size and\nraw interaction data, mirroring the successes seen in large language models.\nHowever, for complex, long-horizon multi-agent tasks such as robotic soccer,\nthis end-to-end approach often fails due to intractable exploration spaces and\nsparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in developing\nembodied world models is not merely increasing the fidelity or size of\nenvironments, but scaling their structural complexity through explicit\nhierarchical scaffolding. We posit that an effective world model for\ndecision-making must model not only the world's physics but also its task\nsemantics. Drawing from a systematic review of 2024 research in low-resource\nmulti-agent soccer, we identify a clear trend towards integrating symbolic and\nhierarchical methods, such as Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs) and Bayesian\nStrategy Networks (BSNs), with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). These\nmethods decompose complex goals into manageable subgoals, creating an intrinsic\ncurriculum that shapes agent learning. We propose that such structured\nenvironments are essential for bridging the gap between simple, reactive\nbehaviors and sophisticated, strategic team play. We further extend this\nprinciple, proposing that this scaffolding can be generalized to other complex\ndomains and dynamically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), which act as\ngenerative world models of tasks. By building environments with explicit,\ncomposable task layers, we can guide agent exploration more efficiently,\ngenerate meaningful learning signals, and ultimately train more capable and\ngeneral-purpose agents with fewer resources than purely end-to-end approaches.",

We study a more practical setting where\npartial survey responses exist: we fine-tune LLMs on available data to impute\nself-reported vote choice under both random and systematic nonresponse, using\nthe German Longitudinal Election Study. We compare zero-shot prompting and\nsupervised fine-tuning against tabular classifiers (e.g., CatBoost) and test\nhow different convenience samples (e.g., students) used for fine-tuning affect\ngeneralization.\n  Our results show that when data are missing completely at random, fine-tuned\nLLMs match tabular classifiers but outperform zero-shot approaches. When only\nbiased convenience samples are available, fine-tuning small (3B to 8B)\nopen-source LLMs can recover both individual-level predictions and\npopulation-level distributions more accurately than zero-shot and often better\nthan tabular methods.

In twelve flax plots, a single\nrobotic spray pass reduced total weed populations (pigweed and Venice mallow)\nby 24- to 42-fold compared to manual weeding in four flax plots, while also\ncausing less crop damage. Mobility experiments conducted on concrete, asphalt,\ngravel, grass, and both wet and dry soil confirmed reliable traversal\nconsistent with torque sizing.

Specifically,\nwe use AlphaEvolve (an LLM coding agent) to study two settings:\n  a) Average-case hardness for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set: We improve a\nrecent result of Kunisky and Yu to obtain near-optimal upper and (conditional)\nlower bounds on certification algorithms for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set on\nrandom 3- and 4-regular graphs.

Recent studies enhance support features by\nincorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic\nfusion modules.

To address these\nissues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for\nFew-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts\nconditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly\nintegrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of\nCross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment\n(CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support\nimages to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single\nstructured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic\nunderstanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of\nsemantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act\nrespectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level\nclass semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited\nsupport data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support,\nand synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the\n3-dimensional parallelotope they span.

This approach, while effective, has several significant drawbacks.\nFirstly, inference requires autoregressive generation of often thousands of CoT\ntokens, which is slow and computationally expensive. Secondly, it constrains\nreasoning to the discrete space of tokens, creating an information bottleneck\nacross reasoning steps. Thirdly, it fundamentally entangles reasoning with\ntoken generation, forcing LLMs to \"think while speaking,\" which causes\npotentially short-sighted reasoning. In light of these limitations, we\nre-imagine reasoning in LLMs and present a new paradigm: MARCOS. In our\napproach, rather than autoregressively generating tokens, we model reasoning as\na hidden Markov chain of continuous, high-dimensional \"thoughts\". Each\nreasoning step involves a transition of the internal thoughts, where explicit\nreasoning steps (which may consist of hundreds of tokens) serve as observable\nvariables, which are windows to peek into the implicit thoughts. Since this\nlatent process is incompatible with the standard supervised learning, we\nfurther propose a two-phase variational training scheme. Our experiments on\nthree benchmarks demonstrate that MARCOS outperforms existing continuous\nreasoning methods and, for the first time, achieves performance comparable to\ntoken-based CoT, even surpassing it by 4.7% on GSM8K with up to 15.7x speedup\nin inference. Beyond this, MARCOS offers additional advantages, such as\nstep-level instead of token-level control over randomness, opening significant\nopportunities for reinforcement learning and reasoning in LLMs.",

While prior work has\nfocused on identifying AI text and effectively checkmating it, our study\ninvestigates a less-explored territory: portraying the nuanced distinctions\nbetween human and AI texts across text segments (introduction, body, and\nconclusion). Whether LLMs excel or falter in incorporating linguistic ingenuity\nacross text segments, the results will critically inform their viability and\nboundaries as effective creative assistants to humans. Through an analogy with\nthe structure of chess games, comprising opening, middle, and end games, we\nanalyze segment-specific patterns to reveal where the most striking differences\nlie. Although AI texts closely resemble human writing in the body segment due\nto its length, deeper analysis shows a higher divergence in features dependent\non the continuous flow of language, making it the most informative segment for\ndetection.

While prior work has\nfocused on identifying AI text and effectively checkmating it, our study\ninvestigates a less-explored territory: portraying the nuanced distinctions\nbetween human and AI texts across text segments (introduction, body, and\nconclusion). Whether LLMs excel or falter in incorporating linguistic ingenuity\nacross text segments, the results will critically inform their viability and\nboundaries as effective creative assistants to humans. Through an analogy with\nthe structure of chess games, comprising opening, middle, and end games, we\nanalyze segment-specific patterns to reveal where the most striking differences\nlie. Although AI texts closely resemble human writing in the body segment due\nto its length, deeper analysis shows a higher divergence in features dependent\non the continuous flow of language, making it the most informative segment for\ndetection.

In\nthis work, we address these gaps by introducing a unified taxonomy of six\nclinically-informed mental health crisis categories, curating a diverse\nevaluation dataset, and establishing an expert-designed protocol for assessing\nresponse appropriateness. We systematically benchmark three state-of-the-art\nLLMs for their ability to classify crisis types and generate safe, appropriate\nresponses. The results reveal that while LLMs are highly consistent and\ngenerally reliable in addressing explicit crisis disclosures, significant risks\nremain. A non-negligible proportion of responses are rated as inappropriate or\nharmful, with responses generated by an open-weight model exhibiting higher\nfailure rates than those generated by the commercial ones. We also identify\nsystemic weaknesses in handling indirect or ambiguous risk signals, a reliance\non formulaic and inauthentic default replies, and frequent misalignment with\nuser context. These findings underscore the urgent need for enhanced\nsafeguards, improved crisis detection, and context-aware interventions in LLM\ndeployments.

In SNNs, each\nsynapse is characterized not only by a weight but also by a transmission delay.\nWhile theoretical works have long suggested that trainable delays significantly\nenhance expressivity, practical methods for learning them have only recently\nemerged. Here, we introduce ''DelRec'', the first SGL-based method to train\naxonal or synaptic delays in recurrent spiking layers, compatible with any\nspiking neuron model.

Recently, single-cell foundation\nmodels have emerged as powerful tools for learning transferable representations\ndirectly from expression profiles, improving performance on classification and\nclustering tasks. However, these models are limited to discrete prediction\nheads, which collapse cellular complexity into predefined labels that fail to\ncapture the richer, contextual explanations biologists need. We introduce\nCell2Text, a multimodal generative framework that translates scRNA-seq profiles\ninto structured natural language descriptions. By integrating gene-level\nembeddings from single-cell foundation models with pretrained large language\nmodels, Cell2Text generates coherent summaries that capture cellular identity,\ntissue origin, disease associations, and pathway activity, generalizing to\nunseen cells.

                    "value": "Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed biology by enabling the\nmeasurement of gene expression at cellular resolution, providing information\nfor cell types, states, and disease contexts. Recently, single-cell foundation\nmodels have emerged as powerful tools for learning transferable representations\ndirectly from expression profiles, improving performance on classification and\nclustering tasks. However, these models are limited to discrete prediction\nheads, which collapse cellular complexity into predefined labels that fail to\ncapture the richer, contextual explanations biologists need. We introduce\nCell2Text, a multimodal generative framework that translates scRNA-seq profiles\ninto structured natural language descriptions. By integrating gene-level\nembeddings from single-cell foundation models with pretrained large language\nmodels, Cell2Text generates coherent summaries that capture cellular identity,\ntissue origin, disease associations, and pathway activity, generalizing to\nunseen cells. Empirically, Cell2Text outperforms baselines on classification\naccuracy, demonstrates strong ontological consistency using PageRank-based\nsimilarity metrics, and achieves high semantic fidelity in text generation.\nThese results demonstrate that coupling expression data with natural language\noffers both stronger predictive performance and inherently interpretable\noutputs, pointing to a scalable path for label-efficient characterization of\nunseen cells."

To address this, we introduce Confidence-Informed\nSelf-Consistency (CISC). CISC performs a weighted majority vote based on\nconfidence scores obtained directly from the model.

Moreover, by\nanalyzing the performance differential on training data when particular VFLs\nare ablated, VFL-select automatically classifies data by function, enabling\nhighly efficient data selection to directly bolster corresponding capabilities.\nConsequently, VFL-select surpasses human experts in data selection, and\nachieves 98% of full-data performance with only 20% of the original dataset.\nThis study delivers deeper comprehension of MLLM visual processing, fostering\nthe creation of more efficient, interpretable, and robust models."

Evaluations\nacross five capability dimensions and different model scales (1.5B to 14B)\ndemonstrate that the generated data significantly improved overall model\nperformance, particularly in terms of truthfulness, with improvements of 5-10\npercentage points observed. Further analysis reveals that task performance\nvaries depending on the error types introduced. Injecting the most common error\ntypes improves performance in related tasks, while a mix of error types leads\nto a broader performance enhancement: most tasks show stable improvements,\nwhile a few tasks exhibit significant gains."

Our solution employs a two-stage framework: (1) A\ncandidate generation mechanism that uses co-purchase market basket analysis and\nLLM-based approach to identify novel item-item associations; and (2) a\ntransformer-based ranker that leverages the real-time sequential cart context\nand optimizes for engagement signals such as add-to-carts. Offline analysis and\nonline A/B tests show an increase of 36\\% add-to-cart rate with LLM-based\nretrieval on the item page, and 15\\% lift in add-to-cart using cart\ncontext-based ranker on the cart page. Our work contributes practical\ntechniques for cross-category recommendations and broader insights for\ne-commerce systems."

Recently, methods that\ndynamically estimate block importance have enabled efficient block sparse\nattention, leading to significant acceleration in long-text pre-filling of\nLLMs. However, their coarse-grained estimation inevitably leads to performance\ndegradation at high sparsity rates. In this work, we propose ProxyAttn, a\ntraining-free sparse attention algorithm that achieves more precise block\nestimation by compressing the dimension of attention heads. Based on our\nobservation of the similarity among multiple attention heads, we use the scores\nof pooled representative heads to approximate the scores for all heads. To\naccount for the varying sparsity among heads, we also propose a block-aware\ndynamic budget estimation method. By combining the scores from representative\nproxy heads with multi-head dynamic budgets, we achieve a more fine-grained\nblock importance evaluation at low computational cost. Experiments on a variety\nof mainstream models and extensive benchmarks confirm the underlying similarity\namong attention heads. Leveraging a fine-grained estimation, the proposed\nmethod achieves substantial gains in performance and efficiency compared to\nexisting methods. More precisely, ProxyAttn can achieve up to 10.3x attention\nacceleration and 2.4x prefilling acceleration without significant performance\nloss.
