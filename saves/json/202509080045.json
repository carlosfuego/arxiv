Recurrent models offer high\nefficiency, but compressing the full sequence into a fixed-size and holistic\nrepresentation suffers from memory degradation in long contexts and limits\nfine-grained retrieval. To address this, we propose RAT, an intermediate design\nthat bridges the efficiency of RNNs and capacity of attention. RAT partitions\nthe input into chunks, applies recurrence within each chunk for local\ndependencies, and softmax-based attention across chunks for long-range\ninteractions. This design mitigates memory degradation and enables direct\naccess to distant tokens, while retaining computational efficiency.\nEmpirically, with a chunk size of 16, the RAT block achieves a 7x improvement\nin training speed with 100K token sequences and 9x in generation at the 4K\nposition, while maintaining similar performance compared to standard attention.\nWe demonstrate this by training 1.3B parameter models from scratch and\nperforming large-scale evaluations, including short- and long-context\nbenchmarks, as well as supervised fine-tuning~(SFT). We further propose a\nhybrid architecture that interleaves RAT with local attention. By combining\nefficient long-range modeling with strong local interactions, this hybrid\ndesign not only improves inference speed and reduces cache memory usage, but\nalso consistently enhances performance and shows the overall best results.

This design mitigates memory degradation and enables direct\naccess to distant tokens, while retaining computational efficiency.\nEmpirically, with a chunk size of 16, the RAT block achieves a 7x improvement\nin training speed with 100K token sequences and 9x in generation at the 4K\nposition, while maintaining similar performance compared to standard attention.\nWe demonstrate this by training 1.3B parameter models from scratch and\nperforming large-scale evaluations, including short- and long-context\nbenchmarks, as well as supervised fine-tuning~(SFT). We further propose a\nhybrid architecture that interleaves RAT with local attention. By combining\nefficient long-range modeling with strong local interactions, this hybrid\ndesign not only improves inference speed and reduces cache memory usage, but\nalso consistently enhances performance and shows the overall best results.

One of the main challenges towards the successful\ndeployment of LLMs is memory management, since they typically involve billions\nof parameters. To this end, architectures based on Mixture-of-Experts have been\nproposed, which aim to reduce the size of the parameters that are activated\nwhen producing a token. This raises the equally critical issue of efficiently\nmanaging the limited cache of the system, in that frequently used experts\nshould be stored in the fast cache rather than in the slower secondary memory.\n  In this work, we introduce and study a new paging problem that models expert\nmanagement optimization. Our formulation captures both the layered architecture\nof LLMs and the requirement that experts are cached efficiently. We first\npresent lower bounds on the competitive ratio of both deterministic and\nrandomized algorithms, which show that under mild assumptions, LRU-like\npolicies have good theoretical competitive performance.

One of the main challenges towards the successful\ndeployment of LLMs is memory management, since they typically involve billions\nof parameters. To this end, architectures based on Mixture-of-Experts have been\nproposed, which aim to reduce the size of the parameters that are activated\nwhen producing a token. This raises the equally critical issue of efficiently\nmanaging the limited cache of the system, in that frequently used experts\nshould be stored in the fast cache rather than in the slower secondary memory.\n  In this work, we introduce and study a new paging problem that models expert\nmanagement optimization. Our formulation captures both the layered architecture\nof LLMs and the requirement that experts are cached efficiently. We first\npresent lower bounds on the competitive ratio of both deterministic and\nrandomized algorithms, which show that under mild assumptions, LRU-like\npolicies have good theoretical competitive performance. We then propose a\nlayer-based extension of LRU that is tailored to the problem at hand.\n  Extensive simulations on both synthetic datasets and actual traces of MoE\nusage show that our algorithm outperforms policies for the classic paging\nproblem, such as the standard LRU."

In this work, we propose a Matrixed-Spectrum\nDecomposition accelerated LBTE solver (MSD-LBTE) that can be used to compute\nX-ray scatter distributions from CT acquisitions at two or more different\nspectra simultaneously, in a unified framework with no sacrifice in accuracy\nand nearly no increase in computation in theory. First, a matrixed-spectrum\nsolver of LBTE is obtained by introducing an additional label dimension to\nexpand the phase space. Then, we propose a ``spectrum basis'' for LBTE and a\nprinciple of selection of basis using the QR decomposition, along with the\nabove solver to construct the MSD-LBTE. Based on MSD-LBTE, a unified scatter\ncorrection method can be established for multi-spectral CT. We validate the\neffectiveness and accuracy of our method by comparing it with the Monte Carlo\nmethod, including the computational time. We also evaluate the scatter\ncorrection performance using two different phantoms for fast-kV switching based\ndual-energy CT, and using an elliptical phantom in a numerical simulation for\nkV-modulation enabled CT scans, validating that our proposed method can\nsignificantly reduce the computational cost at multiple spectra and effectively\nreduce scatter artifact in reconstructed CT images.",

To address these issues,\nwe propose a training-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value\nDecomposition (ASVD). Specifically, ASVD manages activation outliers by\ntransforming the weight matrix based on the activation distribution. This\ntransformation allows the outliers in the activation matrix to be absorbed into\nthe transformed weight matrix, thereby enhancing decomposition accuracy.\nAdditionally, we propose an efficient iterative calibration process to optimize\nlayer-specific decomposition by addressing the varying sensitivity of different\nLLM layers. In this way, ASVD can compress a network by 10%-30%. Based on the\nsuccess of the low-rank decomposition of projection matrices in the\nself-attention module, we further introduce ASVD to compress the KV cache. By\nreducing the channel dimension of KV activations, memory requirements for KV\ncache can be largely reduced.

Further, as these\nLLM applications scale, the total size of KV caches becomes excessively large\nand requires both DRAM and SSD for full storage.\n  However, prior work that stores KV caches in DRAM and SSD suffers from high\nloading delays, as most KV cache hits come from SSD, which is slow to load. To\nincrease the KV cache hit rate on DRAM, we identify lossy KV cache compression\nas a promising approach. We design a lossy compression system that decides the\ncompression algorithm, compression rate and device placement for each KV cache\nentry to maximise DRAM hits and minimise loading delay without significantly\ndegrading generation quality. Compared to various static compression baselines\nacross three tasks, our system AdaptCache achieves 1.43--2.4 x delay savings at\nthe same quality and 6--55% quality improvements at the same delay.",

Despite accounting for just approximately\n5% of total instructions, memory allocation can result in up to a 2.7x\nperformance variation depending on the allocator used. This effect arises from\nthe complexity of memory allocation in modern multi-threaded multi-core\nsystems, where allocator metadata becomes intertwined with user data, leading\nto cache pollution or increased cross-thread synchronization overhead.\nOffloading memory allocators to accelerators, e.g., Mallacc and Memento, is a\npotential direction to improve the allocator performance and mitigate cache\npollution. However, these accelerators currently have limited support for\nmulti-threaded applications, and synchronization between cores and accelerators\nremains a significant challenge.\n  We present SpeedMalloc, using a lightweight support-core to process memory\nallocation tasks in multi-threaded applications. The support-core is a\nlightweight programmable processor with efficient cross-core data\nsynchronization and houses all allocator metadata in its own caches. This\ndesign minimizes cache conflicts with user data and eliminates the need for\ncross-core metadata synchronization. In addition, using a general-purpose core\ninstead of domain-specific accelerators makes SpeedMalloc capable of adopting\nnew allocator designs.

In this\nwork, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and\ndecompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by\ninaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from\nerror propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we\npropose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both\nerror types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify\nreusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a\ntrajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates\ncache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.\nTogether, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under\naggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video\ngeneration benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup\nwhile consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the\nstate-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x\nacceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline\nfidelity while significantly improving efficiency.

                "summary": "Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language\nmodels (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of\nrecomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To\naddress this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers\nwith highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a\nfixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer\npairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention\ndynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern\nsimilarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable\naccuracy degradation.\n  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and\nefficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies\nbased on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a\nrecomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key\ninnovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical\ncontext for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the\nconversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to\nmitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model\ngeneration; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles\nbrought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV\ncaches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul\nachieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x\nreduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without\ncompromising generation quality.",

In particular, we propose a\nmulti-pooling kernels allocating strategy in the token recalling process to\nmaintain the completeness of semantics. Our approach not only reduces the\nprefilling complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L)$, but also achieves performance\ncomparable to or better than the full context in the long context scenarios.\nWithout additional post training or operator development, ILRe can process a\nsingle $1M$ tokens request in less than half a minute (speedup $\\approx\n180\\times$) and scores RULER-$1M$ benchmark of $\\approx 79.8$ with model\nLlama-3.1-UltraLong-8B-1M-Instruct on a Huawei Ascend 910B NPU.",

In this\npaper, we propose a task-specific framework addressing these inefficiencies\nthrough two key innovations. First, we introduce Lightning-fast Caching-based\nParallel denoising prediction (LightningCP), caching static features to bypass\nmost model layers in inference time. We also enable parallel prediction using\ncached features and estimated noisy latents as inputs, efficiently bypassing\nsequential sampling. Second, we propose Decoupled Foreground Attention (DFA) to\nfurther accelerate attention computations, exploiting the spatial decoupling in\ntalking head videos to restrict attention to dynamic foreground regions.\nAdditionally, we remove reference features in certain layers to bring extra\nspeedup. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly\nimproves inference speed while preserving video quality.",

                    "value": "Diffusion-based talking head models generate high-quality, photorealistic\nvideos but suffer from slow inference, limiting practical applications.\nExisting acceleration methods for general diffusion models fail to exploit the\ntemporal and spatial redundancies unique to talking head generation. In this\npaper, we propose a task-specific framework addressing these inefficiencies\nthrough two key innovations. First, we introduce Lightning-fast Caching-based\nParallel denoising prediction (LightningCP), caching static features to bypass\nmost model layers in inference time. We also enable parallel prediction using\ncached features and estimated noisy latents as inputs, efficiently bypassing\nsequential sampling. Second, we propose Decoupled Foreground Attention (DFA) to\nfurther accelerate attention computations, exploiting the spatial decoupling in\ntalking head videos to restrict attention to dynamic foreground regions.\nAdditionally, we remove reference features in certain layers to bring extra\nspeedup. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly\nimproves inference speed while preserving video quality."

Extending sequence length generally\nimproves accuracy, but directly modeling such sequences in production is\ninfeasible due to latency and memory constraints. Existing solutions fall into\ntwo categories: (1) top-k retrieval, which truncates the sequence and may\ndiscard most attention mass when L >> k; and (2) encoder-based compression,\nwhich preserves coverage but often over-compresses and fails to incorporate key\ncontext such as temporal gaps or target-aware signals. Neither class achieves a\ngood balance of low-loss compression, context awareness, and efficiency.\n  We propose VQL, a context-aware Vector Quantization Attention framework for\nultra-long behavior modeling, with three innovations. (1) Key-only\nquantization: only attention keys are quantized, while values remain intact; we\nprove that softmax normalization yields an error bound independent of sequence\nlength, and a codebook loss directly supervises quantization quality. This also\nenables L-free inference via offline caches. (2) Multi-scale quantization:\nattention heads are partitioned into groups, each with its own small codebook,\nwhich reduces quantization error while keeping cache size fixed. (3) Efficient\ncontext injection: static features (e.g., item category, modality) are directly\nintegrated, and relative position is modeled via a separable temporal kernel.\nAll context is injected without enlarging the codebook, so cached\nrepresentations remain query-independent.\n  Experiments on three large-scale datasets (KuaiRand-1K, KuaiRec, TMALL) show\nthat VQL consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving higher accuracy\nwhile reducing inference latency, establishing a new state of the art in\nbalancing accuracy and efficiency for ultra-long sequence recommendation.",

To reduce their substantial\ncomputational costs, feature caching techniques have been proposed to\naccelerate inference by reusing hidden representations from previous timesteps.\nHowever, current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high\nacceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the\ninherent instability of long-step forecasting. In this work, we adopt an\nordinary differential equation (ODE) perspective on the hidden-feature\nsequence, modeling layer representations along the trajectory as a feature-ODE.\nWe attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability\nto robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals. To\naddress this, we propose FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), which treats feature\ncaching as a feature-ODE solving problem. Extensive experiments on image\nsynthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the\neffectiveness of FoCa, especially under aggressive acceleration. Without\nadditional training, FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on\nFLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high\nquality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT.",

                    "value": "Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in\nhigh-fidelity image and video generation. To reduce their substantial\ncomputational costs, feature caching techniques have been proposed to\naccelerate inference by reusing hidden representations from previous timesteps.\nHowever, current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high\nacceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the\ninherent instability of long-step forecasting. In this work, we adopt an\nordinary differential equation (ODE) perspective on the hidden-feature\nsequence, modeling layer representations along the trajectory as a feature-ODE.\nWe attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability\nto robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals. To\naddress this, we propose FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), which treats feature\ncaching as a feature-ODE solving problem. Extensive experiments on image\nsynthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the\neffectiveness of FoCa, especially under aggressive acceleration. Without\nadditional training, FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on\nFLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high\nquality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT."

Across the DESI Early Data Release (EDR) redshift range ($2.0 \\leq\nz \\leq 3.8$), and a wide range of scales ($10^{-4}$ s km$^{-1} \\leq k \\leq 1.0$\ns km$^{-1}$), our mocks recover the mean flux evolution with redshift to\nsub-percent accuracy, and the P1D at the percent level. Additionally, we\ndiscuss potential extensions of this framework, such as the incorporation of\nastrophysical contaminants, continuum uncertainties, and instrumental effects.\nSuch improvements would expand its utility in ongoing and upcoming surveys and\nenable a broader range of validation efforts and systematics studies for P1D\ninference and precision cosmology."

                "summary": "This paper introduces MiniCPM4, a highly efficient large language model (LLM)\ndesigned explicitly for end-side devices. We achieve this efficiency through\nsystematic innovation in four key dimensions: model architecture, training\ndata, training algorithms, and inference systems. Specifically, in terms of\nmodel architecture, we propose InfLLM v2, a trainable sparse attention\nmechanism that accelerates both prefilling and decoding phases for long-context\nprocessing. Regarding training data, we propose UltraClean, an efficient and\naccurate pre-training data filtering and generation strategy, and UltraChat v2,\na comprehensive supervised fine-tuning dataset. These datasets enable\nsatisfactory model performance to be achieved using just 8 trillion training\ntokens. Regarding training algorithms, we propose ModelTunnel v2 for efficient\npre-training strategy search, and improve existing post-training methods by\nintroducing chunk-wise rollout for load-balanced reinforcement learning and\ndata-efficient tenary LLM, BitCPM. Regarding inference systems, we propose\nCPM.cu that integrates sparse attention, model quantization, and speculative\nsampling to achieve efficient prefilling and decoding. To meet diverse\non-device requirements, MiniCPM4 is available in two versions, with 0.5B and 8B\nparameters, respectively. Furthermore, we construct a hybrid reasoning model,\nMiniCPM4.1, which can be used in both deep reasoning mode and non-reasoning\nmode. Evaluation results demonstrate that MiniCPM4 and MiniCPM4.1 outperform\nsimilar-sized open-source models across benchmarks, with the 8B variants\nshowing significant speed improvements on long sequence understanding and\ngeneration.",

                    "value": "This paper introduces MiniCPM4, a highly efficient large language model (LLM)\ndesigned explicitly for end-side devices. We achieve this efficiency through\nsystematic innovation in four key dimensions: model architecture, training\ndata, training algorithms, and inference systems. Specifically, in terms of\nmodel architecture, we propose InfLLM v2, a trainable sparse attention\nmechanism that accelerates both prefilling and decoding phases for long-context\nprocessing. Regarding training data, we propose UltraClean, an efficient and\naccurate pre-training data filtering and generation strategy, and UltraChat v2,\na comprehensive supervised fine-tuning dataset. These datasets enable\nsatisfactory model performance to be achieved using just 8 trillion training\ntokens. Regarding training algorithms, we propose ModelTunnel v2 for efficient\npre-training strategy search, and improve existing post-training methods by\nintroducing chunk-wise rollout for load-balanced reinforcement learning and\ndata-efficient tenary LLM, BitCPM. Regarding inference systems, we propose\nCPM.cu that integrates sparse attention, model quantization, and speculative\nsampling to achieve efficient prefilling and decoding. To meet diverse\non-device requirements, MiniCPM4 is available in two versions, with 0.5B and 8B\nparameters, respectively. Furthermore, we construct a hybrid reasoning model,\nMiniCPM4.1, which can be used in both deep reasoning mode and non-reasoning\nmode. Evaluation results demonstrate that MiniCPM4 and MiniCPM4.1 outperform\nsimilar-sized open-source models across benchmarks, with the 8B variants\nshowing significant speed improvements on long sequence understanding and\ngeneration."

While PDE foundation models have shown much promise for simulating\nsuch complex spatio-temporal phenomena, existing models remain constrained by\nthe pretraining datasets and struggle with auto-regressive rollout performance,\nespecially in out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. Furthermore, they have\nsignificant compute and training data requirements which hamper their use in\nmany critical applications. Inspired by recent advances in ``thinking\"\nstrategies used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce the first\ntest-time computing (TTC) strategy for PDEs that utilizes computational\nresources during inference to achieve more accurate predictions with fewer\ntraining samples and smaller models. We accomplish this with two types of\nreward models that evaluate predictions of a stochastic based model for\nspatio-temporal consistency. We demonstrate this method on compressible\nEuler-equation simulations from the PDEGym benchmark and show that TTC captures\nimproved predictions relative to standard non-adaptive auto-regressive\ninference. This TTC framework marks a foundational step towards more advanced\nreasoning algorithms or PDE modeling, inluding building\nreinforcement-learning-based approaches, potentially transforming computational\nworkflows in physics and engineering.",

                    "value": "Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are the bedrock for modern\ncomputational sciences and engineering, and inherently computationally\nexpensive. While PDE foundation models have shown much promise for simulating\nsuch complex spatio-temporal phenomena, existing models remain constrained by\nthe pretraining datasets and struggle with auto-regressive rollout performance,\nespecially in out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. Furthermore, they have\nsignificant compute and training data requirements which hamper their use in\nmany critical applications. Inspired by recent advances in ``thinking\"\nstrategies used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce the first\ntest-time computing (TTC) strategy for PDEs that utilizes computational\nresources during inference to achieve more accurate predictions with fewer\ntraining samples and smaller models. We accomplish this with two types of\nreward models that evaluate predictions of a stochastic based model for\nspatio-temporal consistency. We demonstrate this method on compressible\nEuler-equation simulations from the PDEGym benchmark and show that TTC captures\nimproved predictions relative to standard non-adaptive auto-regressive\ninference. This TTC framework marks a foundational step towards more advanced\nreasoning algorithms or PDE modeling, inluding building\nreinforcement-learning-based approaches, potentially transforming computational\nworkflows in physics and engineering."

While empathy-driven approaches preserve client\nsatisfaction in benign cases, they fail catastrophically against dishonest\ndebtors--individuals who exploit conciliatory tactics to manipulate terms or\nevade repayment. Blindly prioritizing \"customer experience\" in such scenarios\nleads to creditor vulnerabilities: revenue leakage, moral hazard, and systemic\nexploitation. To address this, we propose EQ-Knight, an LLM agent that\ndynamically optimizes emotional strategy to defend creditor interests. Unlike\nnaive empathy-centric bots, EQ-Knight integrates emotion memory and\ngame-theoretic reasoning, powered by a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to track and\npredict debtor emotional states. By analyzing both real-time and historical\nemotional cues, EQ-Knight strategically counters negative emotions (e.g.,\naggression, feigned distress) while preserving productive debtor relationships.\nExperiments demonstrate EQ-Knight's superiority over conventional LLM\nnegotiators: it achieves a 32\\% reduction in concession losses without\ncompromising recovery rates, particularly in adversarial cases where debtors\nweaponize negative emotions (e.g., intimidation, guilt-tripping) to coerce\nconcessions.

Our\napproach shows potential for generalisable and scalable multi-agent systems\nwhile providing computational insights into ToM mechanisms."

In contrast, this paper presents KubeGuard, a novel runtime\nlog-driven recommender framework aimed at mitigating risks by addressing overly\npermissive configurations. KubeGuard is designed to harden K8s environments\nthrough two complementary tasks: Resource Creation and Resource Refinement. It\nleverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze manifests and runtime logs\nreflecting actual system behavior, using modular prompt-chaining workflows.\nThis approach enables KubeGuard to create least-privilege configurations for\nnew resources and refine existing manifests to reduce the attack surface.\nKubeGuard's output manifests are presented as recommendations that users (e.g.,\ndevelopers and operators) can review and adopt to enhance cluster security. Our\nevaluation demonstrates that KubeGuard effectively generates and refines K8s\nmanifests for Roles, NetworkPolicies, and Deployments, leveraging both\nproprietary and open-source LLMs. The high precision, recall, and F1-scores\naffirm KubeGuard's practicality as a framework that translates runtime\nobservability into actionable, least-privilege configuration guidance.",

As object detection models are often used in\nreal-world contexts, such as robotics, where inference time is paramount,\nsimply measuring models' accuracy is not enough to compare them. We thus\ncompare a large variety of object detection models' accuracy and inference\nspeed on multiple graphics cards. In addition to this large benchmarking\nattempt, we also reproduce the following models from scratch using PyTorch on\nthe MS COCO 2017 dataset: DETR, RTMDet, ViTDet and YOLOv7. More importantly, we\npropose a unified training and evaluation pipeline, based on MMDetection's\nfeatures, to better compare models. Our implementation of DETR and ViTDet could\nnot achieve accuracy or speed performances comparable to what is declared in\nthe original papers. On the other hand, reproduced RTMDet and YOLOv7 could\nmatch such performances. Studied papers are also found to be generally lacking\nfor reproducibility purposes.

As object detection models are often used in\nreal-world contexts, such as robotics, where inference time is paramount,\nsimply measuring models' accuracy is not enough to compare them. We thus\ncompare a large variety of object detection models' accuracy and inference\nspeed on multiple graphics cards. In addition to this large benchmarking\nattempt, we also reproduce the following models from scratch using PyTorch on\nthe MS COCO 2017 dataset: DETR, RTMDet, ViTDet and YOLOv7. More importantly, we\npropose a unified training and evaluation pipeline, based on MMDetection's\nfeatures, to better compare models. Our implementation of DETR and ViTDet could\nnot achieve accuracy or speed performances comparable to what is declared in\nthe original papers. On the other hand, reproduced RTMDet and YOLOv7 could\nmatch such performances. Studied papers are also found to be generally lacking\nfor reproducibility purposes. As for MMDetection pretrained models, speed\nperformances are severely reduced with limited computing resources (larger,\nmore accurate models even more so).

We further propose aBAE, an\nannealed variant of BAE drawing on methods from statistical inference, to\nenhance robustness. Our proposals are parallelizable in both quantum and\nclassical components, offer tools for fast noise model assessment, and can\nleverage preexisting information. Additionally, they accommodate experimental\nlimitations and preferred cost trade-offs. We propose a robust benchmark for\namplitude estimation algorithms and use it to test BAE against other\napproaches, demonstrating its competitive performance in both noisy and\nnoiseless scenarios. In both cases, it achieves lower error than any other\nalgorithm as a function of the cost. In the presence of decoherence, it is\ncapable of learning when other algorithms fail.",

State-of-the-art (SOTA)\nsystems differ significantly in many dimensions, such as training datasets,\nmodeling paradigms, and architectural choices. This diversity complicates\nefforts to evaluate models fairly and identify which design choices influence\nperformance the most.

We conduct a\nsystematic empirical analysis to isolate its effects, offering insights into\nassociated trade-offs and emergent behaviors that can guide future\ntext-to-music generation systems. Specifically, we compare the two arguably\nmost common modeling paradigms: auto-regressive decoding and conditional\nflow-matching. We conduct a controlled comparison by training all models from\nscratch using identical datasets, training configurations, and similar backbone\narchitectures. Performance is evaluated across multiple axes, including\ngeneration quality, robustness to inference configurations, scalability,\nadherence to both textual and temporally aligned conditioning, and editing\ncapabilities in the form of audio inpainting. This comparative study sheds\nlight on distinct strengths and limitations of each paradigm, providing\nactionable insights that can inform future architectural and training decisions\nin the evolving landscape of text-to-music generation.

Existing methods struggle\nwith character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate\ndialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling. In response, we\nintroduce TaleDiffusion, a novel framework for generating multi-character\nstories with an iterative process, maintaining character consistency, and\naccurate dialogue assignment via postprocessing. Given a story, we use a\npre-trained LLM to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and\ndialogues via in-context learning, followed by a bounded attention-based\nper-box mask technique to control character interactions and minimize\nartifacts. We then apply an identity-consistent self-attention mechanism to\nensure character consistency across frames and region-aware cross-attention for\nprecise object placement. Dialogues are also rendered as bubbles and assigned\nto characters via CLIPSeg. Experimental results demonstrate that TaleDiffusion\noutperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue\nrendering.",

                    "value": "Text-to-story visualization is challenging due to the need for consistent\ninteraction among multiple characters across frames. Existing methods struggle\nwith character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate\ndialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling. In response, we\nintroduce TaleDiffusion, a novel framework for generating multi-character\nstories with an iterative process, maintaining character consistency, and\naccurate dialogue assignment via postprocessing. Given a story, we use a\npre-trained LLM to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and\ndialogues via in-context learning, followed by a bounded attention-based\nper-box mask technique to control character interactions and minimize\nartifacts. We then apply an identity-consistent self-attention mechanism to\nensure character consistency across frames and region-aware cross-attention for\nprecise object placement. Dialogues are also rendered as bubbles and assigned\nto characters via CLIPSeg. Experimental results demonstrate that TaleDiffusion\noutperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue\nrendering."

Our analysis\nincorporates a range of multi-wavelength datasets including UV luminosity\nfunctions (UVLFs) from HST and JWST spanning $z=6-14.5$, the 21-cm global\nsignal and power spectrum limits from SARAS 3 and HERA respectively, as well as\npresent-day diffuse X-ray and radio backgrounds. We constrain a flexible\nhalo-mass and redshift dependent model of star-formation efficiency (SFE),\ndefined as the fraction of gas converted into stars, and find that it is best\ndescribed by minimal redshift evolution at $z\\approx 6-10$, followed by rapid\nevolution at $z\\approx10-15$. Using Bayesian inference, we derive functional\nposteriors of the SFE, inferring that halos of mass\n$M_h=10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ have efficiencies of $\\approx 1 - 2\\%$ at\n$z\\lesssim10$, $\\approx8\\%$ at $z=12$ and $\\approx21\\%$ at $z=15$.

In this paper, we\npresent the status of the SMP development and use it to assess the precision\nand accuracy of the ZTF SN Ia DR2 force photometry light curves.\n  We reach a repeatability of the star observations better than 1%. However, we\nhave identified a new sensor effect, dubbed \"pocket-effect\", which distorts the\nPoint Spread Function (PSF) in a flux-dependent manner leading to\nnon-linearities in the photometry of a few percent. Correcting for this effect\nrequires time- and sensor-dependent corrections to be applied at the pixel\nlevel, which is currently under development. This effects affects all light\ncurve releases to date -- both from forced photometry and scene modelling\npreventing ZTF SN Ia DR2 to be used for accurate cosmological inference.\n  Comparing the SMP and forced photometry measurements, we find that stretch\nand color estimated from both processings are consistent, aside from a 10 mmag\nshift in color.

Experiments on a signalized intersection demonstrate\nthat the discovered algorithms outperform Webster's baseline, reducing average\ndelay by 20.1% and average stops by 47.1%. Beyond performance, ablation and\nincremental analyses reveal that EvolveSignal modifications-such as adjusting\ncycle length bounds, incorporating right-turn demand, and rescaling green\nallocations-can offer practically meaningful insights for traffic engineers.\nThis work opens a new research direction by leveraging AI for algorithm design\nin traffic signal control, bridging program synthesis with transportation\nengineering."

Simulated AI\nbias approximates factual and counterfactual estimates of racial bias in\nreal-world AI systems. We investigate people's preferences for White, Black,\nHispanic, and Asian candidates (represented through names and affinity groups\non quality-controlled resumes) across 1,526 scenarios and measure their\nunconscious associations between race and status using implicit association\ntests (IATs), which predict discriminatory hiring decisions but have not been\ninvestigated in human-AI collaboration. When making decisions without AI or\nwith AI that exhibits no race-based preferences, people select all candidates\nat equal rates. However, when interacting with AI favoring a particular group,\npeople also favor those candidates up to 90% of the time, indicating a\nsignificant behavioral shift. The likelihood of selecting candidates whose\nidentities do not align with common race-status stereotypes can increase by 13%\nif people complete an IAT before conducting resume screening. Finally, even if\npeople think AI recommendations are low quality or not important, their\ndecisions are still vulnerable to AI bias under certain circumstances. This\nwork has implications for people's autonomy in AI-HITL scenarios, AI and work,\ndesign and evaluation of AI hiring systems, and strategies for mitigating bias\nin collaborative decision-making tasks. In particular, organizational and\nregulatory policy should acknowledge the complex nature of AI-HITL decision\nmaking when implementing these systems, educating people who use them, and\ndetermining which are subject to oversight.",

                    "value": "In this study, we conduct a resume-screening experiment (N=528) where people\ncollaborate with simulated AI models exhibiting race-based preferences (bias)\nto evaluate candidates for 16 high and low status occupations. Simulated AI\nbias approximates factual and counterfactual estimates of racial bias in\nreal-world AI systems. We investigate people's preferences for White, Black,\nHispanic, and Asian candidates (represented through names and affinity groups\non quality-controlled resumes) across 1,526 scenarios and measure their\nunconscious associations between race and status using implicit association\ntests (IATs), which predict discriminatory hiring decisions but have not been\ninvestigated in human-AI collaboration. When making decisions without AI or\nwith AI that exhibits no race-based preferences, people select all candidates\nat equal rates. However, when interacting with AI favoring a particular group,\npeople also favor those candidates up to 90% of the time, indicating a\nsignificant behavioral shift. The likelihood of selecting candidates whose\nidentities do not align with common race-status stereotypes can increase by 13%\nif people complete an IAT before conducting resume screening. Finally, even if\npeople think AI recommendations are low quality or not important, their\ndecisions are still vulnerable to AI bias under certain circumstances. This\nwork has implications for people's autonomy in AI-HITL scenarios, AI and work,\ndesign and evaluation of AI hiring systems, and strategies for mitigating bias\nin collaborative decision-making tasks. In particular, organizational and\nregulatory policy should acknowledge the complex nature of AI-HITL decision\nmaking when implementing these systems, educating people who use them, and\ndetermining which are subject to oversight."

While Large Multi-modal Models\n(LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained\nanomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between\ngenerative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of\nefficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose\nAnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person\nanomaly search.

While this approach is effective in closed,\nnarrowly scoped environments, it presents two major challenges for real-world,\nopen-ended scenarios: (1) it significantly restricts the planning and acting\ncapabilities of LLM agents, and (2) it requires substantial human effort to\nenumerate and implement all possible actions, which is impractical in complex\nenvironments with a vast number of potential actions. To address these\nlimitations, we propose an LLM agent framework that can dynamically create and\ncompose actions as needed. In this framework, the agent interacts with its\nenvironment by generating and executing programs written in a general-purpose\nprogramming language. Moreover, generated actions are accumulated over time for\nfuture reuse. Our extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that\nthis framework significantly improves flexibility and outperforms prior methods\nthat rely on a fixed action set. Notably, it enables LLM agents to adapt and\nrecover in scenarios where predefined actions are insufficient or fail due to\nunforeseen edge cases.

While this approach is effective in closed,\nnarrowly scoped environments, it presents two major challenges for real-world,\nopen-ended scenarios: (1) it significantly restricts the planning and acting\ncapabilities of LLM agents, and (2) it requires substantial human effort to\nenumerate and implement all possible actions, which is impractical in complex\nenvironments with a vast number of potential actions. To address these\nlimitations, we propose an LLM agent framework that can dynamically create and\ncompose actions as needed. In this framework, the agent interacts with its\nenvironment by generating and executing programs written in a general-purpose\nprogramming language. Moreover, generated actions are accumulated over time for\nfuture reuse. Our extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that\nthis framework significantly improves flexibility and outperforms prior methods\nthat rely on a fixed action set. Notably, it enables LLM agents to adapt and\nrecover in scenarios where predefined actions are insufficient or fail due to\nunforeseen edge cases. Our code can be found in\nhttps://github.com/adobe-research/dynasaur."

                "summary": "Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are the bedrock for modern\ncomputational sciences and engineering, and inherently computationally\nexpensive. While PDE foundation models have shown much promise for simulating\nsuch complex spatio-temporal phenomena, existing models remain constrained by\nthe pretraining datasets and struggle with auto-regressive rollout performance,\nespecially in out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. Furthermore, they have\nsignificant compute and training data requirements which hamper their use in\nmany critical applications. Inspired by recent advances in ``thinking\"\nstrategies used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce the first\ntest-time computing (TTC) strategy for PDEs that utilizes computational\nresources during inference to achieve more accurate predictions with fewer\ntraining samples and smaller models.

                    "value": "Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are the bedrock for modern\ncomputational sciences and engineering, and inherently computationally\nexpensive. While PDE foundation models have shown much promise for simulating\nsuch complex spatio-temporal phenomena, existing models remain constrained by\nthe pretraining datasets and struggle with auto-regressive rollout performance,\nespecially in out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. Furthermore, they have\nsignificant compute and training data requirements which hamper their use in\nmany critical applications. Inspired by recent advances in ``thinking\"\nstrategies used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce the first\ntest-time computing (TTC) strategy for PDEs that utilizes computational\nresources during inference to achieve more accurate predictions with fewer\ntraining samples and smaller models.

To address\nthis gap, we propose a fully unsupervised Natural Language Processing (NLP)\npipeline capable of extracting and evaluating referral reasons without relying\non labelled datasets.\n  Methods: Our pipeline leverages Transformer-based embeddings pre-trained on\nItalian medical texts to cluster referral reasons and assess their alignment\nwith appropriateness guidelines. It operates in an unsupervised setting and is\ndesigned to generalize across different examination types. We analyzed two\ncomplete regional datasets from the Lombardy Region (Italy), covering all\nreferrals between 2019 and 2021 for venous echocolordoppler of the lower limbs\n(ECD;n=496,971; development) and flexible endoscope colonoscopy (FEC;\nn=407,949; testing only). For both, a random sample of 1,000 referrals was\nmanually annotated to measure performance.\n  Results: The pipeline achieved high performance in identifying referral\nreasons (Prec=92.43% (ECD), 93.59% (FEC); Rec=83.28% (ECD), 92.70% (FEC)) and\nappropriateness (Prec=93.58% (ECD), 94.66% (FEC); Rec=91.52% (ECD), 93.96%\n(FEC)). At the regional level, the analysis identified relevant inappropriate\nreferral groups and variation across contexts, findings that informed a new\nLombardy Region resolution to reinforce guideline adherence.\n  Conclusions: This study presents a robust, scalable, unsupervised NLP\npipeline for assessing referral appropriateness in large, real-world datasets.\nIt demonstrates how such data can be effectively leveraged, providing public\nhealth authorities with a deployable AI tool to monitor practices and support\nevidence-based policy.",

To address this, we propose EQ-Knight, an LLM agent that\ndynamically optimizes emotional strategy to defend creditor interests.

Yet the abilities of\ncurrent language models for few-shot word learning, and methods for improving\nthese abilities, are underexplored. In this study, we introduce a novel method,\nMeta-training for IN-context learNing Of Words (Minnow). This method trains\nlanguage models to generate new examples of a word's usage given a few\nin-context examples, using a special placeholder token to represent the new\nword.

However, successful navigation still depends on two key\ncapabilities: mapping and planning (explicitly or implicitly). Classical\napproaches rely on explicit mapping pipelines to register egocentric\nobservations into a coherent map. In contrast, end-to-end learning often\nachieves this implicitly -- through recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that fuse\ncurrent and historical observations into a latent space for planning. While\nexisting architectures, such as LSTM and GRU, can capture temporal\ndependencies, our findings reveal a critical limitation: their inability to\neffectively perform spatial memorization. This capability is essential for\nintegrating sequential observations from varying perspectives to build spatial\nrepresentations that support planning. To address this, we propose\nSpatially-Enhanced Recurrent Units (SRUs) -- a simple yet effective\nmodification to existing RNNs -- that enhance spatial memorization. We further\nintroduce an attention-based network architecture integrated with SRUs,\nenabling long-range mapless navigation using a single forward-facing stereo\ncamera. We also employ regularization techniques to facilitate robust\nend-to-end recurrent training via RL. Experimental results show 23.5% overall\nimprovement in long-range navigation compared to existing RNNs. With SRU\nmemory, our method outperforms RL baselines -- one relying on explicit mapping\nand the other on stacked historical observations -- by 29.6% and 105.0%,\nrespectively, across diverse environments requiring long-horizon mapping and\nmemorization. Finally, we address the sim-to-real gap by leveraging large-scale\npretraining on synthetic depth data, enabling zero-shot transfer for deployment\nacross diverse and complex real-world environments.",

                "summary": "The widespread adoption of Kubernetes (K8s) for orchestrating cloud-native\napplications has introduced significant security challenges, such as\nmisconfigured resources and overly permissive configurations. Failing to\naddress these issues can result in unauthorized access, privilege escalation,\nand lateral movement within clusters. Most existing K8s security solutions\nfocus on detecting misconfigurations, typically through static analysis or\nanomaly detection. In contrast, this paper presents KubeGuard, a novel runtime\nlog-driven recommender framework aimed at mitigating risks by addressing overly\npermissive configurations. KubeGuard is designed to harden K8s environments\nthrough two complementary tasks: Resource Creation and Resource Refinement. It\nleverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze manifests and runtime logs\nreflecting actual system behavior, using modular prompt-chaining workflows.\nThis approach enables KubeGuard to create least-privilege configurations for\nnew resources and refine existing manifests to reduce the attack surface.\nKubeGuard's output manifests are presented as recommendations that users (e.g.,\ndevelopers and operators) can review and adopt to enhance cluster security. Our\nevaluation demonstrates that KubeGuard effectively generates and refines K8s\nmanifests for Roles, NetworkPolicies, and Deployments, leveraging both\nproprietary and open-source LLMs. The high precision, recall, and F1-scores\naffirm KubeGuard's practicality as a framework that translates runtime\nobservability into actionable, least-privilege configuration guidance.",

                    "value": "The widespread adoption of Kubernetes (K8s) for orchestrating cloud-native\napplications has introduced significant security challenges, such as\nmisconfigured resources and overly permissive configurations. Failing to\naddress these issues can result in unauthorized access, privilege escalation,\nand lateral movement within clusters. Most existing K8s security solutions\nfocus on detecting misconfigurations, typically through static analysis or\nanomaly detection. In contrast, this paper presents KubeGuard, a novel runtime\nlog-driven recommender framework aimed at mitigating risks by addressing overly\npermissive configurations. KubeGuard is designed to harden K8s environments\nthrough two complementary tasks: Resource Creation and Resource Refinement. It\nleverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze manifests and runtime logs\nreflecting actual system behavior, using modular prompt-chaining workflows.\nThis approach enables KubeGuard to create least-privilege configurations for\nnew resources and refine existing manifests to reduce the attack surface.\nKubeGuard's output manifests are presented as recommendations that users (e.g.,\ndevelopers and operators) can review and adopt to enhance cluster security. Our\nevaluation demonstrates that KubeGuard effectively generates and refines K8s\nmanifests for Roles, NetworkPolicies, and Deployments, leveraging both\nproprietary and open-source LLMs. The high precision, recall, and F1-scores\naffirm KubeGuard's practicality as a framework that translates runtime\nobservability into actionable, least-privilege configuration guidance."

This ability, however, diminishes as the complexity of the linguistic\nphenomena to be learned increases. Supervised fine-tuning on ad hoc chains of\nthought significantly enhances LLM performance but struggles to generalize to\ntypologically novel or more complex linguistic features. These findings point\nto the need for more diverse training sets and alternative fine-tuning\nstrategies to further improve explicit learning by LLMs, benefiting\nlow-resource languages typically described in grammar books but lacking\nextensive corpora."

To mitigate these biases, recent methods employ multiple LLMs as\njudges and aggregate their judgments to select the optimal assessment. Although\neffective, this multi-judge approach incurs significant computational overhead\nduring inference. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-turn dialogue\nevaluator that captures the collective wisdom of multiple LLM judges by\naggregating their preference knowledge into a single model. Our approach\npreserves the advantages of diverse multi-judge feedback while drastically\nreducing the evaluation cost, enabling fast and flexible dialogue quality\nassessment. Extensive experiments on seven single rating and pairwise\ncomparison dialogue evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that our method\noutperforms existing baselines across diverse scenarios, showcasing its\nefficiency and robustness.",

It was shown\nthat smaller and more compact profiles, created after 10 min of transcribed\nspeech containing 5 items for adjectives, 5 items for conjunctions, and 10\nitems for adverbs, nouns, pronouns, and verbs each, offered the best balance in\nboth performance and data efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers\npractical insights into constructing stable, personalised lexical profiles,\ntaking into account minimal data requirements, serving as a foundational step\ntoward lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents."

To address this, we\npropose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems grounded in music theory,\nwhich can serve both as evaluation benchmarks and as training data for\nreinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We introduce a data\nsynthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both\ntextual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning\nBenchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on\nSSMR-Bench show the importance of models' reasoning abilities in interpreting\nsheet music.

Further, we enhance the\ndensity of key tokens in the text achieving token compression. Subsequently, we\nuse an LLM to iterative rewrite the text to optimize its expression. 2) Model\nLevel: We use layer similarity scores to assess each layer's importance and\nremove those with lower importance. Then, we introduce a sparse merging\nparadigm to preserve as much of the original model's capability as possible.\nExtensive experiments on four datasets, medical Q&A, financial Q&A, general\nQ&A, and reading comprehension, show that we can select the optimal LLM while\nsaving approximately 20-fold in training time.",

Our method enables the robot to learn from\nvideos captured by daily mobile devices and to generalize the policies to\ndeployment environments with varying visual backgrounds, camera angles, spatial\nlayouts, and novel object instances. We systematically evaluate our method on\nboth short-horizon and long-horizon tasks, using RGB-D and RGB-only\ndemonstration videos.

By\nincorporating layer-wise representation probing analysis, NeuroBreak offers a\nnovel perspective on the model's decision-making process throughout its\ngeneration steps. Furthermore, the system supports the analysis of critical\nneurons from both semantic and functional perspectives, facilitating a deeper\nexploration of security mechanisms. We conduct quantitative evaluations and\ncase studies to verify the effectiveness of our system, offering mechanistic\ninsights for developing next-generation defense strategies against evolving\njailbreak attacks."

However, achieving high-quality, child-friendly\nspeech generation remains challenging, particularly for low-resource languages\nacross diverse languages and cultural contexts. In this paper, we propose\nMultiGen, a multilingual speech generation model with child-friendly\ninteraction, leveraging LLM architecture for speech generation tailored for\nlow-resource languages.

Large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have the potential to address these gaps, but their\ncapabilities in this area remain largely unexplored, particularly in cybercrime\ndetection. In this paper, we test this hypothesis by applying LLMs to\nreal-world cryptocurrency transaction graphs, with a focus on Bitcoin, one of\nthe most studied and widely adopted blockchain networks. We introduce a\nthree-tiered framework to assess LLM capabilities: foundational metrics,\ncharacteristic overview, and contextual interpretation.

Together, they significantly\nreduce token requirements, transforming the analysis of multiple moderately\nlarge-scale transaction graphs with LLMs from nearly impossible to feasible\nunder strict token limits. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs have\noutstanding performance on foundational metrics and characteristic overview,\nwhere the accuracy of recognizing most basic information at the node level\nexceeds 98.50% and the proportion of obtaining meaningful characteristics\nreaches 95.00%.
