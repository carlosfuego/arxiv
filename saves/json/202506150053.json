Previous search methods either do not perform\nsufficient exploration, or else explore diverse trajectories but have high\nlatency. We address this challenge by proposing Efficient Tree Search (ETS),\nwhich promotes KV sharing by pruning redundant trajectories while maintaining\nnecessary diverse trajectories. ETS incorporates a linear programming cost\nmodel to promote KV cache sharing by penalizing the number of nodes retained,\nwhile incorporating a semantic coverage term into the cost model to ensure that\nwe retain trajectories which are semantically different. We demonstrate how ETS\ncan achieve 1.8$\\times$ reduction in average KV cache size during the search\nprocess, leading to 1.4$\\times$ increased throughput relative to prior\nstate-of-the-art methods, with minimal accuracy degradation and without\nrequiring any custom kernel implementation.

We address this challenge by proposing Efficient Tree Search (ETS),\nwhich promotes KV sharing by pruning redundant trajectories while maintaining\nnecessary diverse trajectories. ETS incorporates a linear programming cost\nmodel to promote KV cache sharing by penalizing the number of nodes retained,\nwhile incorporating a semantic coverage term into the cost model to ensure that\nwe retain trajectories which are semantically different. We demonstrate how ETS\ncan achieve 1.8$\\times$ reduction in average KV cache size during the search\nprocess, leading to 1.4$\\times$ increased throughput relative to prior\nstate-of-the-art methods, with minimal accuracy degradation and without\nrequiring any custom kernel implementation.

We give an overview of the commissioning process\npreceding the first operation, present optical and radiological focal spot\ncharacterization methods, and dosimetric measurements. Additionally, we report\non first preclinical in vitro cell and in vivo mouse brain irradiations\nconducted with the LFXT prototype. The focal spot characterization resulted in\na strongly eccentric electron distribution with a width of 72.3 $\\mu$m.\nDosimetry showed sharp microbeam dose profiles with steep lateral penumbras and\na peak-to-valley dose ratio above 10 throughout a 70 mm thick PMMA phantom. An\nopen-field dose rate of 4.3 Gy/s was measured at an acceleration voltage of 150\nkV and a beam current of 17.4 mA at 150 mm distance from the focal spot. In\nvitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the feasibility of the LFXT for\nminibeam and microbeam applications with field sizes of 1.5-2 cm. The mice\ndisplayed no observable side effects throughout the follow-up period after\nwhole-brain 260 $\\mu$m-minibeam irradiation. We successfully constructed and\ncommissioned the first proof-of-concept LFXT prototype. Dosimetric\ncharacterizations of the achieved microbeam field showed the superiority of the\nLFXT compared to conventional X-ray tubes in terms of beam quality.

Despite their growing capabilities, today's agent\nframeworks remain fragile, lacking principled mechanisms for secure information\nflow, reliability, and multi-agent coordination. In this work, we introduce\nSAFEFLOW, a new protocol-level framework for building trustworthy LLM/VLM-based\nagents.

By constraining LLM\nreasoning to respect these security labels, SAFEFLOW prevents untrusted or\nadversarial inputs from contaminating high-integrity decisions. To ensure\nrobustness in concurrent multi-agent settings, SAFEFLOW introduces\ntransactional execution, conflict resolution, and secure scheduling over shared\nstate, preserving global consistency across agents. We further introduce\nmechanisms, including write-ahead logging, rollback, and secure caches, that\nfurther enhance resilience against runtime errors and policy violations. To\nvalidate the performances, we built SAFEFLOWBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark\nsuite designed to evaluate agent reliability under adversarial, noisy, and\nconcurrent operational conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nagents built with SAFEFLOW maintain impressive task performance and security\nguarantees even in hostile environments, substantially outperforming\nstate-of-the-art.

These techniques are often designed with a\npre-defined KV budget; however, as the optimal budget varies by different input\nlengths and task types, the existence of a fixed budget could result in\ninconsistent performance accepting inputs of diverse domains. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a new KV cache compression objective: to always ensure\nthe full-cache performance regardless of specific inputs, while maximizing KV\ncache pruning as much as possible. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel\nKV cache compression method dubbed DBudgetKV, which features an attention-based\nmetric to signal when the remaining KV cache is unlikely to match the\nfull-cache performance, then halting the pruning process. Empirical evaluation\nspanning diverse context lengths, task types, and model sizes suggests that our\nmethod achieves lossless KV pruning effectively and robustly, exceeding 25%\ncompression ratio on average.

                    "value": "To alleviate memory burden during inference of large language models (LLMs),\nnumerous studies have focused on compressing the KV cache by exploring aspects\nsuch as attention sparsity. These techniques are often designed with a\npre-defined KV budget; however, as the optimal budget varies by different input\nlengths and task types, the existence of a fixed budget could result in\ninconsistent performance accepting inputs of diverse domains. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a new KV cache compression objective: to always ensure\nthe full-cache performance regardless of specific inputs, while maximizing KV\ncache pruning as much as possible. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel\nKV cache compression method dubbed DBudgetKV, which features an attention-based\nmetric to signal when the remaining KV cache is unlikely to match the\nfull-cache performance, then halting the pruning process. Empirical evaluation\nspanning diverse context lengths, task types, and model sizes suggests that our\nmethod achieves lossless KV pruning effectively and robustly, exceeding 25%\ncompression ratio on average. Furthermore, our method is easy to integrate\nwithin LLM inference, not only optimizing memory space, but also showing\nreduced inference time compared to existing methods."

In this work, we propose ParallelComp, a parallel long-context\ncompression method that effectively overcomes the memory bottleneck, enabling\n8B-parameter LLMs to extrapolate from 8K to 128K tokens on a single A100 80GB\nGPU in a training-free setting. ParallelComp splits the input into chunks,\ndynamically evicting redundant chunks and irrelevant tokens, supported by a\nparallel KV cache eviction mechanism. Importantly, we present a systematic\ntheoretical and empirical analysis of attention biases in parallel\nattention-including the attention sink, recency bias, and middle bias-and\nreveal that these biases exhibit distinctive patterns under ultra-long context\nsettings. We further design a KV cache eviction technique to mitigate this\nphenomenon. Experimental results show that ParallelComp enables an 8B model\n(trained on 8K context) to achieve 91.17% of GPT-4's performance under\nultra-long contexts, outperforming closed-source models such as Claude-2 and\nKimi-Chat.

LoRa backbone of\nthe network handles the web page transmission from the requester and receiver\ndevices. LoRaWeb implements a synchronization procedure to address the\naforementioned challenges for effective message exchange between requesters and\nresponders. The system implements a caching mechanism to reduce latency and\ncontention. Additionally, it implements a message-slicing mechanism in the\napplication layer to overcome the hardware limitations on the message length.\nThe actual hardware-based implementation results indicate seamless deployment,\nand the results indicate an average access time of ~$0.95 S$ for a $1.5 KB$ and\n~$6 S$ for a $10 KB$ size web page.",

Specifically,\ntechnical challenges like payload size limitation, low data rate, and\ncontentions in multi-user setups limit the applicability of LoRa for web\napplications. Hence, we propose LoRaWeb, which enables web access over LoRa\nnetworks. The LoRaWeb hardware tethers a WiFi hotspot to which the client\ndevices connect and access the web pages using a web browser. LoRa backbone of\nthe network handles the web page transmission from the requester and receiver\ndevices. LoRaWeb implements a synchronization procedure to address the\naforementioned challenges for effective message exchange between requesters and\nresponders. The system implements a caching mechanism to reduce latency and\ncontention. Additionally, it implements a message-slicing mechanism in the\napplication layer to overcome the hardware limitations on the message length.\nThe actual hardware-based implementation results indicate seamless deployment,\nand the results indicate an average access time of ~$0.95 S$ for a $1.5 KB$ and\n~$6 S$ for a $10 KB$ size web page."

We show for a variety of workloads, on a state-of-the-art\nM3D-based system, that the performance and energy bottlenecks shift from main\nmemory to the processor core and cache hierarchy. Therefore, there is a need to\nrevisit current designs that have been conventionally tailored to tackle the\nmemory bottleneck. Based on the insights from our design space exploration, we\npropose RevaMp3D, introducing five key changes. First, we propose removing the\nshared last-level cache, as this delivers speedups comparable to or exceeding\nthose from increasing its size or reducing its latency across all workloads.\nSecond, since improving L1 cache latency has a large impact on performance, we\nreduce L1 latency by leveraging an M3D layout to shorten its wires. Third, we\nrepurpose the area from the removed cache to widen and scale up pipeline\nstructures, accommodating more in-flight requests that are efficiently served\nby M3D memory. To avoid latency penalties from these larger structures, we\nleverage M3D layouts. Fourth, to facilitate high thread-level parallelism, we\npropose a new fine-grained synchronization technique, using M3D's dense\ninter-layer connectivity. Fifth, we leverage the M3D main memory to mitigate\nthe core bottlenecks. We propose a processor frontend design that memoizes the\nrepetitive fetched, decoded, and reordered instructions, stores them in main\nmemory, and turns off the relevant parts of the core when possible. RevaMp3D\nprovides 1.2x-2.9x speedup and 1.2x-1.4x energy reduction compared to a\nstate-of-the-art M3D system. We also analyze RevaMp3D's design decisions across\nvarious memory latencies to facilitate latency-aware design decisions.",

However, a key bottleneck remains: existing schedulers\nfail to effectively overlap CPU-offloaded tasks with GPU execution during the\nlatency-critical, bandwidth-bound decode phase. This particularly penalizes\nreal-time, decode-heavy applications (e.g., chat, Chain-of-Thought reasoning)\nwhich are currently underserved by existing systems, especially under memory\npressure typical of edge or low-cost deployments.\n  We present APEX, a novel, profiling-informed scheduling strategy that\nmaximizes CPU-GPU parallelism during hybrid LLM inference. Unlike systems\nrelying on static rules or purely heuristic approaches, APEX dynamically\ndispatches compute across heterogeneous resources by predicting execution times\nof CPU and GPU subtasks to maximize overlap while avoiding scheduling\noverheads. We evaluate APEX on diverse workloads and GPU architectures (NVIDIA\nT4, A10), using LLaMa-2-7B and LLaMa-3.1-8B models. Compared to GPU-only\nschedulers like VLLM, APEX improves throughput by 84% - 96% on T4 and 11% - 89%\non A10 GPUs, while preserving latency. Against the best existing hybrid\nschedulers, it delivers up to 49% (T4) and 37% (A10) higher throughput in\nlong-output settings.

These advancements promise to benefit a vast array of\napplication domains. However, due to their immense size, performing inference\nwith LLMs is both costly and slow. Consequently, a plethora of recent work has\nproposed strategies to enhance inference efficiency, e.g., quantization,\npruning, and caching. These acceleration strategies reduce the inference cost\nand latency, often by several factors, while maintaining much of the predictive\nperformance measured via common benchmarks. In this work, we explore another\ncritical aspect of LLM performance: demographic bias in model generations due\nto inference acceleration optimizations. Using a wide range of metrics, we\nprobe bias in model outputs from a number of angles. Analysis of outputs before\nand after inference acceleration shows significant change in bias. Worryingly,\nthese bias effects are complex and unpredictable. A combination of an\nacceleration strategy and bias type may show little bias change in one model\nbut may lead to a large effect in another. Our results highlight a need for\nin-depth and case-by-case evaluation of model bias after it has been modified\nto accelerate inference.",

                    "value": "Last few years have seen unprecedented advances in capabilities of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs). These advancements promise to benefit a vast array of\napplication domains. However, due to their immense size, performing inference\nwith LLMs is both costly and slow. Consequently, a plethora of recent work has\nproposed strategies to enhance inference efficiency, e.g., quantization,\npruning, and caching. These acceleration strategies reduce the inference cost\nand latency, often by several factors, while maintaining much of the predictive\nperformance measured via common benchmarks. In this work, we explore another\ncritical aspect of LLM performance: demographic bias in model generations due\nto inference acceleration optimizations. Using a wide range of metrics, we\nprobe bias in model outputs from a number of angles. Analysis of outputs before\nand after inference acceleration shows significant change in bias. Worryingly,\nthese bias effects are complex and unpredictable. A combination of an\nacceleration strategy and bias type may show little bias change in one model\nbut may lead to a large effect in another. Our results highlight a need for\nin-depth and case-by-case evaluation of model bias after it has been modified\nto accelerate inference."

For the ns-pulsed operation, Lmax$\\approx$5 mm (vmax$\\approx$5x10 5\nm/s) and Lmax$\\approx$3.5 mm (vmax$\\approx$1.5x10 5 m/s) during the rising and\nfalling parts of the voltage pulse, respectively. The SDBD dynamics generated\nwith a ns-pulsed voltage is more reproducible than for the AC case allowing for\nthe use of a 500 times smaller ICCD gate width (2 ns) and a more accurate\ndescription of the discharge's spatiotemporal development. This reactor is\nsuitable for performing fundamental studies and understanding key SDBD features\nfor various applications such as flow control, biomedicine and agriculture."

This makes KV cache\ncompression an essential step toward enabling efficient long-context reasoning.\nRecent methods have explored reducing the hidden dimensions of the KV cache,\nbut many introduce additional computation through projection layers or suffer\nfrom significant performance degradation under high compression ratios. To\naddress these challenges, we propose ReCalKV, a post-training KV cache\ncompression method that reduces the hidden dimensions of the KV cache.

To\nreduce the cost of auto-regressive decoding, Key-Value (KV) cache is used to\nstore intermediate activations, which significantly lowers the computational\noverhead for token generation. However, the memory required for the KV cache\ngrows rapidly, often exceeding the capacity of GPU memory. A cost-effective\nalternative is to offload KV cache to CPU memory, which alleviates GPU memory\npressure, but shifts the bottleneck to the limited bandwidth of the PCIe\nconnection between the CPU and GPU. Existing methods attempt to address these\nissues by overlapping GPU computation with I/O or employing CPU-GPU\nheterogeneous execution, but they are hindered by excessive data movement and\ndependence on CPU capabilities. Fully overlapping PCIe communication latency\ngets challenging as the size of the KV cache grows and/or the GPU compute\ncapabilities increase. In this paper, we introduce KVPR, an efficient I/O-aware\nLLM inference method where the CPU first transfers a partial set of\nactivations, from which the GPU can start recomputing the KV cache values.\nWhile the GPU recomputes the partial KV cache, the remaining portion of the KV\ncache is transferred concurrently from the CPU. This approach overlaps GPU\nrecomputation with KV cache transfer to minimize idle GPU time and maximize\ninference performance. KVPR is fully automated by integrating a profiler module\nthat utilizes input characteristics and system hardware information, a\nscheduler module to optimize the distribution of computation and communication\nworkloads, and a runtime module to efficiently execute the derived execution\nplan.

Furthermore, ETAP's design enables seamless integration into\nframeworks like FlashAttention-3 and FlashInfer, supported by a detailed\ntheoretical analysis. Our work addresses a critical gap in resource-constrained\ninference, offering a scalable solution for mid-tier GPUs and paving the way\nfor broader adoption in hardware-aware optimization. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/pengcuo/FlashMLA-ETAP."

In this paper, we aim to speed up inference by reducing this\nredundancy, without additional training. We first study how activations change\nbetween steps in two state-of-the-art open-source DiTs. We find that just 5-25%\nof the values in attention and MLP explain 70-90% of the change in activations\nacross steps. This finding motivates our approach, Chipmunk, which uses dynamic\nsparsity at inference time to recompute only the fastest-changing intermediate\nactivations, while caching the rest. Dynamic sparsity introduces two systems\nchallenges: (1) sparse attention and MLP operations tend to underutilize GPU\ntensor cores; and (2) computing dynamic sparsity patterns at runtime and\ncaching activations both introduce overhead. To address these challenges,\nChipmunk first uses a voxel-based reordering of input tokens to introduce\ncolumn-wise sparsity. We implement column-sparse kernels utilizing efficient\nsparse gathers from global to shared GPU memory, achieving a 9.3x speedup at\n93% sparsity compared to highly-optimized dense baselines. Second, Chipmunk\noverlaps the computation of sparsity patterns and cache updates with other\nparts of the computation (e.g., second layer of the MLP) to hide the extra\nlatency.

We present SwiftKV, a novel model\ntransformation and distillation procedure targeted at reducing the prefill\ncompute (in FLOPs) of prompt tokens while preserving high generation quality.\nFirst, SwiftKV prefills later layers' KV cache using an earlier layer's output,\nallowing prompt tokens to skip those later layers. Second, SwiftKV employs a\nlightweight knowledge-preserving distillation procedure that can adapt existing\nLLMs with minimal accuracy impact. Third, SwiftKV can naturally incorporate KV\ncache compression to improve inference performance in low-memory scenarios.

We present SwiftKV, a novel model\ntransformation and distillation procedure targeted at reducing the prefill\ncompute (in FLOPs) of prompt tokens while preserving high generation quality.\nFirst, SwiftKV prefills later layers' KV cache using an earlier layer's output,\nallowing prompt tokens to skip those later layers. Second, SwiftKV employs a\nlightweight knowledge-preserving distillation procedure that can adapt existing\nLLMs with minimal accuracy impact. Third, SwiftKV can naturally incorporate KV\ncache compression to improve inference performance in low-memory scenarios.

Generating such images is challenging, demanding\nmultimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into\nclear explanatory visuals.

To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt\na unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a\ntarget image's core entities and their dependencies.

However, the traditional process for creating\nsuch benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in\nthe stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and\nvalidating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated\npipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our\npipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce\nSWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment\nconstruction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a\ncollaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to\nenhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based\ngrading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.\nFinally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit\ncode signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show\nthat our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,\nwith GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per\ninstance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at\nthe lowest cost of $0.024 per instance.

We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of\nlarge-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training\nand evaluation.

However, the traditional process for creating\nsuch benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in\nthe stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and\nvalidating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated\npipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our\npipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce\nSWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment\nconstruction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a\ncollaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to\nenhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based\ngrading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.\nFinally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit\ncode signals.

                "summary": "Pansharpening is a crucial remote sensing technique that fuses low-resolution\nmultispectral (LRMS) images with high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images to\ngenerate high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) imagery. Although deep learning\ntechniques have significantly advanced pansharpening, many existing methods\nsuffer from limited cross-sensor generalization and high computational\noverhead, restricting their real-time applications. To address these\nchallenges, we propose an efficient framework that quickly adapts to a specific\ninput instance, completing both training and inference in a short time. Our\nframework splits the input image into multiple patches, selects a subset for\nunsupervised CAT training, and then performs inference on all patches,\nstitching them into the final output.

Although deep learning\ntechniques have significantly advanced pansharpening, many existing methods\nsuffer from limited cross-sensor generalization and high computational\noverhead, restricting their real-time applications. To address these\nchallenges, we propose an efficient framework that quickly adapts to a specific\ninput instance, completing both training and inference in a short time. Our\nframework splits the input image into multiple patches, selects a subset for\nunsupervised CAT training, and then performs inference on all patches,\nstitching them into the final output.

Message content is further personalized using\ndynamic contextual factors including daily fluctuations in self-efficacy,\nsocial influence, and regulatory focus. Over a seven-day trial, participants\nreceive daily messages assigned by one of four models: cMAB alone, LLM alone,\ncombined cMAB with LLM personalization (cMABxLLM), or equal randomization\n(RCT). Outcomes include daily step count and message acceptance, assessed via\necological momentary assessments (EMAs). We apply a causal inference framework\nto evaluate the effects of each model.

Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4\nSonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,\nMistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,\nculture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring\nconstraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\\%\") induces\nsignificant racial and gender biases (up to 12\\% differences in interview\nrates).

Using 80 central and satellite galaxies from three simulation suites\n(Marvelous Massive Dwarfs, Marvelous Dwarfs, and DC Justice League) spanning\nstellar masses of $10^6$--$10^{10}$ $M_\\odot$, we measure 3D shapes through the\nmoment of inertia tensor at two times the effective radius to derive axis\nratios ($C/A$, $B/A$) and triaxiality. We find that stellar shape does indeed\nfollow DM halo shape for our dwarf galaxies. However, the presence of a stellar\ndisk in more massive dwarfs ($M_* \\gtrsim 10^{7.5}$ $M_\\odot$) pulls the\ndistribution of stellar $C/A$ ratios to lower values, while in lower mass\ngalaxies the gravitational potential remains predominantly shaped by DM.\nSimilarly, stellar triaxiality generally tracks dark matter halo triaxiality,\nwith this relationship being particularly strong for non-disky galaxies though\nweaker in disky systems. This correlation is reinforced by strong alignment\nbetween SM and DM axes, particularly in disk galaxies. Further, we find no\ndetectable difference in either SM or DM shape comparing two different SNe\nfeedback implementations, demonstrating that shape measurements may be robust\nto different implementations of baryonic feedback in dwarf galaxies. We also\nobserve that a dwarf galaxy's shape is largely unperturbed by recent mergers\n(with merger ratios $>4$).

VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses\nmodels at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the\nfinal results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to\nevaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions\ncomprehensively.

To that end, we develop a lightweight\n1D-CNN, optimized via hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS), which\nachieves 96.59% accuracy on the ISCX VPN-NonVPN dataset with only 88.26K\nparameters, a 20.12K maximum tensor size, and 10.08M floating-point operations\n(FLOPs). Moreover, it generalizes across various TC tasks, with accuracies\nranging from 94% to 99%. To enable deployment, the model is quantized to INT8,\nsuffering only a marginal 1-2% accuracy drop relative to its Float32\ncounterpart. We evaluate real-world inference performance on two\nmicrocontrollers: the high-performance STM32F746G-DISCO and the cost-sensitive\nNucleo-F401RE. The deployed model achieves inference latencies of 31.43ms and\n115.40ms, with energy consumption of 7.86 mJ and 29.10 mJ per inference,\nrespectively.

This work presents the first-of-its-kind neo-fascist coding scheme\nfor digital discourse in the USA societal context, overseen by political\nscience researchers. Our work bridges the gap between Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) and political science against this phenomena. Furthermore, to\ntest the coding scheme, we collect a tremendous amount of activity on the\ninternet from notable neo-fascist groups (the forums of Iron March and\nStormfront.org), and the guidelines are applied to a subset of the collected\nposts. Through crowdsourcing, we annotate a total of a thousand posts that are\nlabeled as neo-fascist or non-neo-fascist. With this labeled data set, we\nfine-tune and test both Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models\n(LLMs), obtaining the very first classification models for neo-fascist\ndiscourse. We find that the prevalence of neo-fascist rhetoric in this kind of\nforum is ever-present, making them a good target for future research. The\nsocietal context is a key consideration for neo-fascist speech when conducting\nNLP research. Finally, the work against this kind of political movement must be\npressed upon and continued for the well-being of a democratic society.\nDisclaimer: This study focuses on detecting neo-fascist content in text,\nsimilar to other hate speech analyses, without labeling individuals or\norganizations.",

Furthermore, to\ntest the coding scheme, we collect a tremendous amount of activity on the\ninternet from notable neo-fascist groups (the forums of Iron March and\nStormfront.org), and the guidelines are applied to a subset of the collected\nposts. Through crowdsourcing, we annotate a total of a thousand posts that are\nlabeled as neo-fascist or non-neo-fascist. With this labeled data set, we\nfine-tune and test both Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models\n(LLMs), obtaining the very first classification models for neo-fascist\ndiscourse. We find that the prevalence of neo-fascist rhetoric in this kind of\nforum is ever-present, making them a good target for future research. The\nsocietal context is a key consideration for neo-fascist speech when conducting\nNLP research. Finally, the work against this kind of political movement must be\npressed upon and continued for the well-being of a democratic society.\nDisclaimer: This study focuses on detecting neo-fascist content in text,\nsimilar to other hate speech analyses, without labeling individuals or\norganizations."

However, their proficiency in iteratively optimizing complex\nsolutions through learning from previous feedback remains insufficiently\nexplored. To bridge this gap, we present OPT-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark\ndesigned to evaluate LLM agents on large-scale search space optimization\nproblems. OPT-BENCH includes 20 real-world machine learning tasks sourced from\nKaggle and 10 classical NP problems, offering a diverse and challenging\nenvironment for assessing LLM agents on iterative reasoning and solution\nrefinement. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce OPT-Agent, an\nend-to-end optimization framework that emulates human reasoning when tackling\ncomplex problems by generating, validating, and iteratively improving solutions\nthrough leveraging historical feedback. Through extensive experiments on 9\nstate-of-the-art LLMs from 6 model families, we analyze the effects of\noptimization iterations, temperature settings, and model architectures on\nsolution quality and convergence. Our results demonstrate that incorporating\nhistorical context significantly enhances optimization performance across both\nML and NP tasks. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are open-sourced to\npromote further research in advancing LLM-driven optimization and iterative\nreasoning.

However, their proficiency in iteratively optimizing complex\nsolutions through learning from previous feedback remains insufficiently\nexplored. To bridge this gap, we present OPT-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark\ndesigned to evaluate LLM agents on large-scale search space optimization\nproblems. OPT-BENCH includes 20 real-world machine learning tasks sourced from\nKaggle and 10 classical NP problems, offering a diverse and challenging\nenvironment for assessing LLM agents on iterative reasoning and solution\nrefinement. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce OPT-Agent, an\nend-to-end optimization framework that emulates human reasoning when tackling\ncomplex problems by generating, validating, and iteratively improving solutions\nthrough leveraging historical feedback. Through extensive experiments on 9\nstate-of-the-art LLMs from 6 model families, we analyze the effects of\noptimization iterations, temperature settings, and model architectures on\nsolution quality and convergence. Our results demonstrate that incorporating\nhistorical context significantly enhances optimization performance across both\nML and NP tasks. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are open-sourced to\npromote further research in advancing LLM-driven optimization and iterative\nreasoning.

One notable application is\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, where certain biomarkers may influence the\npresence of others, enabling early detection, precise disease staging, targeted\ntreatments, and improved monitoring of disease progression. However,\nunderstanding these causal relationships is complex and requires extensive\nresearch.

To explore\nthis, we collected 200 AD-related research papers published over the past 25\nyears and then integrated scientific literature with RAG to extract AD\nbiomarkers and generate causal relations among them. Given the high-risk nature\nof the medical diagnosis, we applied uncertainty estimation to assess the\nreliability of the generated causal edges and examined the faithfulness and\nscientificness of LLM reasoning using both automatic and human evaluation. We\nfind that RAG enhances the ability of LLMs to generate more accurate causal\nnetworks from scientific papers.

Third,\ngoal-directed simulation breaks spatiotemporal symmetry between internal\nself-models and the external world, enabling embodied inference and solving the\ncombinatorial search problem.

Experimental results demonstrate a\nstrong performance of LLMs against traditional methods.

We employ the upsampling\ntechnique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while\nthis method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on\nLLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world\nlife-threatening language detection problems.",

However, the traditional process for creating\nsuch benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in\nthe stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and\nvalidating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated\npipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our\npipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce\nSWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment\nconstruction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a\ncollaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to\nenhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based\ngrading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.\nFinally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit\ncode signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show\nthat our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,\nwith GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per\ninstance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at\nthe lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our\nexit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection,\nand our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall\nof 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of\nlarge-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training\nand evaluation.

We position\nthis within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit,\n2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the\ninteraction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that\ndemonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief\nupdates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief\nalignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be\nmade more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue\nscenarios.",

In this study, we propose a hybrid approach that combines\ncMAB for selecting intervention types with large language models (LLMs) to\npersonalize message content. We evaluate four intervention types: behavioral\nself-monitoring, gain-framed, loss-framed, and social comparison, each\ndelivered as a motivational message aimed at increasing motivation for physical\nactivity and daily step count. Message content is further personalized using\ndynamic contextual factors including daily fluctuations in self-efficacy,\nsocial influence, and regulatory focus. Over a seven-day trial, participants\nreceive daily messages assigned by one of four models: cMAB alone, LLM alone,\ncombined cMAB with LLM personalization (cMABxLLM), or equal randomization\n(RCT). Outcomes include daily step count and message acceptance, assessed via\necological momentary assessments (EMAs). We apply a causal inference framework\nto evaluate the effects of each model.

Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4\nSonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,\nMistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,\nculture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring\nconstraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\\%\") induces\nsignificant racial and gender biases (up to 12\\% differences in interview\nrates).

Extensive experiments on real-world tasks demonstrate\nthat PLAY2PROMPT significantly improves zero-shot tool performance across both\nopen and closed models, offering a scalable and effective solution for\ndomain-specific tool integration."

This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) for multilingual previously fact-checked claim\ndetection. We assess seven LLMs across 20 languages in both monolingual and\ncross-lingual settings.

Moreover,\ntranslating original texts into English proved to be beneficial for\nlow-resource languages.

Comparative approaches like pairwise and listwise achieve high\neffectiveness but are computationally intensive and thus less practical for\nlarger-scale applications. Scoring-based pointwise approaches exhibit superior\nefficiency by independently and simultaneously generating the relevance scores\nfor each candidate document. However, this independence ignores critical\ncomparative insights between documents, resulting in inconsistent scoring and\nsuboptimal performance. In this paper, we aim to improve the effectiveness of\npointwise methods while preserving their efficiency through two key\ninnovations: (1) We propose a novel Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise\nRanking (GCCP) strategy that incorporates global reference comparisons between\neach candidate and an anchor document to generate contrastive relevance scores.\nWe strategically design the anchor document as a query-focused summary of\npseudo-relevant candidates, which serves as an effective reference point by\ncapturing the global context for document comparison. (2) These contrastive\nrelevance scores can be efficiently Post-Aggregated with existing pointwise\nmethods, seamlessly integrating essential Global Context information in a\ntraining-free manner (PAGC). Extensive experiments on the TREC DL and BEIR\nbenchmark demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous\npointwise methods while maintaining comparable efficiency. Our method also\nachieves competitive performance against comparative methods that require\nsubstantially more computational resources. More analyses further validate the\nefficacy of our anchor construction strategy.",

In this paper, we aim to improve the effectiveness of\npointwise methods while preserving their efficiency through two key\ninnovations: (1) We propose a novel Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise\nRanking (GCCP) strategy that incorporates global reference comparisons between\neach candidate and an anchor document to generate contrastive relevance scores.\nWe strategically design the anchor document as a query-focused summary of\npseudo-relevant candidates, which serves as an effective reference point by\ncapturing the global context for document comparison. (2) These contrastive\nrelevance scores can be efficiently Post-Aggregated with existing pointwise\nmethods, seamlessly integrating essential Global Context information in a\ntraining-free manner (PAGC). Extensive experiments on the TREC DL and BEIR\nbenchmark demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous\npointwise methods while maintaining comparable efficiency. Our method also\nachieves competitive performance against comparative methods that require\nsubstantially more computational resources. More analyses further validate the\nefficacy of our anchor construction strategy."

                "summary": "Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising\nalternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token\ngeneration and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing\nsampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive\ndecoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency\nand limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel\ndynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and\naccelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles:\ncertainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which\ngovern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We\nfurther integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.\nExtensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling\nachieves up to 15.63$\\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and\nup to 34.22$\\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach\noutperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput,\ndemonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of\ndLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.",

Existing\nlanguage-conditioned manipulation tasks typically assume that instructions are\nperfectly aligned with the environment. This assumption limits robustness and\ngeneralization in realistic scenarios where instructions may be ambiguous,\nirrelevant, or infeasible. To address this problem, we introduce RAtional\nMAnipulation (RAMA), a new benchmark that challenges models with both unseen\nexecutable instructions and defective ones that should be rejected. In RAMA, we\nconstruct a dataset with over 14,000 samples, including diverse defective\ninstructions spanning six dimensions: visual, physical, semantic, motion,\nsafety, and out-of-context. We further propose the Rational\nVision-Language-Action model (RationalVLA). It is a dual system for robotic\narms that integrates the high-level vision-language model with the low-level\nmanipulation policy by introducing learnable latent space embeddings. This\ndesign enables RationalVLA to reason over instructions, reject infeasible\ncommands, and execute manipulation effectively. Experiments demonstrate that\nRationalVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on RAMA by a 14.5% higher\nsuccess rate and 0.94 average task length, while maintaining competitive\nperformance on standard manipulation tasks. Real-world trials further validate\nits effectiveness and robustness in practical applications. Our project page is\nhttps://irpn-eai.github.io/rationalvla.",

The key finding\nis that many of the most commonly used binary classification metrics are merely\nfunctions of the composition function $G := F_p \\circ F_n^{-1}$, where\n$F_p(\\cdot)$ and $F_n(\\cdot)$ are the class-conditional cumulative distribution\nfunctions of the classifier scores in the positive and negative classes,\nrespectively. This geometric perspective facilitates the selection of operating\npoints, understanding the effect of decision thresholds, and comparison between\nclassifiers. It also helps explain how the shapes and geometry of ROC/PR curves\nreflect classifier behavior, providing objective tools for building classifiers\noptimized for specific applications with context-specific constraints. We\nfurther explore the conditions for classifier dominance, present analytical and\nnumerical examples demonstrating the effects of class separability and variance\non ROC and PR geometries, and derive a link between the positive-to-negative\nclass leakage function $G(\\cdot)$ and the Kullback--Leibler divergence. The\nframework highlights practical considerations, such as model calibration,\ncost-sensitive optimization, and operating point selection under real-world\ncapacity constraints, enabling more informed approaches to classifier\ndeployment and decision-making.",

                    "value": "We study the geometry of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and\nPrecision-Recall (PR) curves in binary classification problems. The key finding\nis that many of the most commonly used binary classification metrics are merely\nfunctions of the composition function $G := F_p \\circ F_n^{-1}$, where\n$F_p(\\cdot)$ and $F_n(\\cdot)$ are the class-conditional cumulative distribution\nfunctions of the classifier scores in the positive and negative classes,\nrespectively. This geometric perspective facilitates the selection of operating\npoints, understanding the effect of decision thresholds, and comparison between\nclassifiers. It also helps explain how the shapes and geometry of ROC/PR curves\nreflect classifier behavior, providing objective tools for building classifiers\noptimized for specific applications with context-specific constraints. We\nfurther explore the conditions for classifier dominance, present analytical and\nnumerical examples demonstrating the effects of class separability and variance\non ROC and PR geometries, and derive a link between the positive-to-negative\nclass leakage function $G(\\cdot)$ and the Kullback--Leibler divergence. The\nframework highlights practical considerations, such as model calibration,\ncost-sensitive optimization, and operating point selection under real-world\ncapacity constraints, enabling more informed approaches to classifier\ndeployment and decision-making."

It poses a grave danger to democracy and\nthe minorities it targets, and it requires active actions against it to avoid\nescalation. This work presents the first-of-its-kind neo-fascist coding scheme\nfor digital discourse in the USA societal context, overseen by political\nscience researchers. Our work bridges the gap between Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) and political science against this phenomena. Furthermore, to\ntest the coding scheme, we collect a tremendous amount of activity on the\ninternet from notable neo-fascist groups (the forums of Iron March and\nStormfront.org), and the guidelines are applied to a subset of the collected\nposts. Through crowdsourcing, we annotate a total of a thousand posts that are\nlabeled as neo-fascist or non-neo-fascist. With this labeled data set, we\nfine-tune and test both Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models\n(LLMs), obtaining the very first classification models for neo-fascist\ndiscourse. We find that the prevalence of neo-fascist rhetoric in this kind of\nforum is ever-present, making them a good target for future research. The\nsocietal context is a key consideration for neo-fascist speech when conducting\nNLP research. Finally, the work against this kind of political movement must be\npressed upon and continued for the well-being of a democratic society.\nDisclaimer: This study focuses on detecting neo-fascist content in text,\nsimilar to other hate speech analyses, without labeling individuals or\norganizations.",

Based on the derived theory, we\nformulate and solve a non-convex optimization problem to jointly determine the\nLoRA sketching ratios and sampling probabilities, aiming to minimize wall-clock\nconvergence time. An efficient and low-complexity algorithm is developed to\napproximate the solution.

In this work, we present the first\ncomprehensive, large-scale study of user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps,\nleveraging a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps across 14 categories with\n894K AI-specific reviews from Google Play. We develop and validate a\nmulti-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and\nsystematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) and prompting strategies.\nEach stage, including review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and\nclustering, is validated for accuracy and consistency. Our pipeline enables\nscalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million\naspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics.\nOur analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes:\npositive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized\nassistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g.,\nscanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language\nsupport. Our pipeline surfaces both satisfaction with one feature and\nfrustration with another within the same review. These fine-grained,\nco-occurring sentiments are often missed by traditional approaches that treat\npositive and negative feedback in isolation or rely on coarse-grained analysis.\nTo this end, our approach provides a more faithful reflection of the real-world\nuser experiences with AI-powered apps. Category-aware analysis further uncovers\nboth universal drivers of satisfaction and domain-specific frustrations.",

We develop and validate a\nmulti-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and\nsystematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) and prompting strategies.\nEach stage, including review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and\nclustering, is validated for accuracy and consistency. Our pipeline enables\nscalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million\naspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics.\nOur analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes:\npositive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized\nassistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g.,\nscanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language\nsupport. Our pipeline surfaces both satisfaction with one feature and\nfrustration with another within the same review. These fine-grained,\nco-occurring sentiments are often missed by traditional approaches that treat\npositive and negative feedback in isolation or rely on coarse-grained analysis.\nTo this end, our approach provides a more faithful reflection of the real-world\nuser experiences with AI-powered apps. Category-aware analysis further uncovers\nboth universal drivers of satisfaction and domain-specific frustrations."

Yet, a core question remains: do these models\ntruly reason, or do they merely exploit shallow statistical patterns? In this\npaper, we introduce Chain-of-Code Collapse, where we systematically investigate\nthe robustness of reasoning LLMs by introducing a suite of semantically\nfaithful yet adversarially structured prompt perturbations.

Yet, a core question remains: do these models\ntruly reason, or do they merely exploit shallow statistical patterns? In this\npaper, we introduce Chain-of-Code Collapse, where we systematically investigate\nthe robustness of reasoning LLMs by introducing a suite of semantically\nfaithful yet adversarially structured prompt perturbations.

Besides, our analysis reveals that higher mutual information\nbetween a prompt and its output correlates with an increased risk of leakage.\nThis insight guides the design and evaluation of two potential defenses against\nthe security threats posed by PRSA.

This paper presents an effective approach to identifying\nlife-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them\nwith traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling,\nand Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three\nopen-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter\nvariants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance,\nimbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a\nstrong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically,\nMistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced\ndata scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling\ntechnique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while\nthis method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on\nLLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world\nlife-threatening language detection problems.",

Although recent advancements\nhave improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their\neffectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network\noptimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address\nthis gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically\ndesigned to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with\nnumerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500\nquestion-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the\ntelecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation\npipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter\nExperts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best\nperformance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for\nmathematical or logical reasoning.

                    "value": "The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in telecommunications has\nraised interest in the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address\ndomain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks. Although recent advancements\nhave improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their\neffectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network\noptimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address\nthis gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically\ndesigned to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with\nnumerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500\nquestion-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the\ntelecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation\npipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter\nExperts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best\nperformance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for\nmathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even\nthose with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges.\nWe have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result\nreproducibility and support future research."

In other\nwords, numbers which are primes or have at least one prime suffix. The\nresulting sequence exhibits a deterministic yet non-trivial structure, blending\nnumber-theoretic properties with symbolic patterning.

Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to\nthe semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract\ncues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the\nphysical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple\nplausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional\nguidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse\ndance movements. The challenge is further amplified by the scarcity of paired\nmusic and dance data, which restricts the model\\^a\\u{A}\\'Zs ability to learn\ndiverse dance patterns. In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language\nModel (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a\nchoreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit,\nhigh-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit\nlearning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both\nmore diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of\nthree components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that\nproduces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a\nmulti-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm,\nand textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based\nmotion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which\nensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues.\nExtensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.",
