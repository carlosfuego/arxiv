We show that all simple\nG-modules are geometrically rigid, though not in general absolutely rigid. More\nprecisely, we show that if V is a simple G-module, then there is a finite\npurely inseparable extension kV /k naturally attached to V such that V is\nabsolutely rigid as a G-module after base change to kV. The proof turns on an\ninvestigation of algebras of the form K otimes E where K and E are field\nextensions of k; we give an example of such an algebra which is not rigid as a\nmodule over itself. We establish the existence of the purely inseparable field\nextension kV /k through an analogous version for artinian algebras.\n  In the second half of the paper we apply recent results on the structure and\nrepresentation theory of pseudo-reductive groups to give a concrete description\nof kV when G is smooth and connected. Namely, we combine the main structure\ntheorem of the Conrad-Prasad classification of pseudo-reductive G together with\nour previous high weight theory. For V a simple G-module, we calculate the\nminimal field of definition of the geometric Jacobson radical of EndG(V) in\nterms of the high weight of V and the Conrad-Prasad classification data; this\ngives a concrete construction of the field kV as a subextension of the minimal\nfield of definition of the geometric unipotent radical of G.

BatchLLM reorders\nthe requests and schedules the requests with larger ratio of decoding first to\nbetter mix the decoding tokens with the latter prefill chunks, and applies\nmemory-centric token batching to enlarge the token-batch sizes, which helps to\nincrease the GPU utilization. Finally, BatchLLM optimizes the prefix-shared\nAttention kernel with horizontal fusion to reduce tail effect and kernel launch\noverhead. Extensive evaluation shows that BatchLLM outperforms vLLM and SGLang\nby 1.3$\\times$ to 10.8$\\times$ on a set of microbenchmarks and a typical\nindustry workload under different hardware environments."

The proposed architecture leverages a hybrid network of stationary\nanchor UAVs and mobile Micro-UAVs for ubiquitous content dissemination. The\nanchor UAVs are equipped with both vertical and lateral communication links,\nand they serve local users, while the mobile micro-ferrying UAVs extend\ncoverage across communities with increased mobility. The focus is on developing\na content dissemination system that dynamically learns optimal caching policies\nto maximize content availability. The core innovation is an adaptive content\ndissemination framework based on distributed Federated Multi-Armed Bandit\nlearning. The goal is to optimize UAV content caching decisions based on\ngeo-temporal content popularity and user demand variations. A Selective Caching\nAlgorithm is also introduced to reduce redundant content replication by\nincorporating inter-UAV information sharing. This method strategically\npreserves the uniqueness in user preferences while amalgamating the\nintelligence across a distributed learning system. This approach improves the\nlearning algorithm's ability to adapt to diverse user preferences. Functional\nverification and performance evaluation confirm the proposed architecture's\nutility across different network sizes, UAV swarms, and content popularity\npatterns.",

                    "value": "This paper introduces an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle - enabled content management\narchitecture that is suitable for critical content access in communities of\nusers that are communication-isolated during diverse types of disaster\nscenarios. The proposed architecture leverages a hybrid network of stationary\nanchor UAVs and mobile Micro-UAVs for ubiquitous content dissemination. The\nanchor UAVs are equipped with both vertical and lateral communication links,\nand they serve local users, while the mobile micro-ferrying UAVs extend\ncoverage across communities with increased mobility. The focus is on developing\na content dissemination system that dynamically learns optimal caching policies\nto maximize content availability. The core innovation is an adaptive content\ndissemination framework based on distributed Federated Multi-Armed Bandit\nlearning. The goal is to optimize UAV content caching decisions based on\ngeo-temporal content popularity and user demand variations. A Selective Caching\nAlgorithm is also introduced to reduce redundant content replication by\nincorporating inter-UAV information sharing. This method strategically\npreserves the uniqueness in user preferences while amalgamating the\nintelligence across a distributed learning system. This approach improves the\nlearning algorithm's ability to adapt to diverse user preferences. Functional\nverification and performance evaluation confirm the proposed architecture's\nutility across different network sizes, UAV swarms, and content popularity\npatterns."

In this work, we introduce AttriBoT, a series of novel techniques\nfor efficiently computing an approximation of the LOO error for context\nattribution.

This stark\nincrease in performance makes computing context attributions for a given\nresponse 30x faster than generating the response itself, empowering real-world\napplications that require computing attributions at scale.

                "summary": "Authentication in TLS is predominately carried out with X.509 digital\ncertificates issued by certificate authorities (CA). The centralized nature of\ncurrent public key infrastructures, however, comes along with severe risks,\nsuch as single points of failure and susceptibility to cyber-attacks,\npotentially undermining the security and trustworthiness of the entire system.\nWith Decentralized Identifiers (DID) alongside distributed ledger technology,\nit becomes technically feasible to prove ownership of a unique identifier\nwithout requiring an attestation of the proof's public key by a centralized and\ntherefore vulnerable CA. This article presents DID Link, a novel authentication\nscheme for TLS 1.3 that empowers entities to authenticate in a TLS-compliant\nway with self-issued X.509 certificates that are equipped with ledger-anchored\nDIDs instead of CA-issued identifiers.

                    "value": "Authentication in TLS is predominately carried out with X.509 digital\ncertificates issued by certificate authorities (CA). The centralized nature of\ncurrent public key infrastructures, however, comes along with severe risks,\nsuch as single points of failure and susceptibility to cyber-attacks,\npotentially undermining the security and trustworthiness of the entire system.\nWith Decentralized Identifiers (DID) alongside distributed ledger technology,\nit becomes technically feasible to prove ownership of a unique identifier\nwithout requiring an attestation of the proof's public key by a centralized and\ntherefore vulnerable CA. This article presents DID Link, a novel authentication\nscheme for TLS 1.3 that empowers entities to authenticate in a TLS-compliant\nway with self-issued X.509 certificates that are equipped with ledger-anchored\nDIDs instead of CA-issued identifiers. It facilitates the exchange of\ntamper-proof and 3rd-party attested claims in the form of DID-bound Verifiable\nCredentials after the TLS handshake to complete the authentication with a full\nidentification of the communication partner. A prototypical implementation\nshows comparable TLS handshake durations of DID Link if verification material\nis cached and reasonable prolongations if it is obtained from a ledger.

Our model also generalizes better to unseen\ndomains and source models, with smaller variability in the decision boundary\nacross distribution shifts. It is also more robust to adversarial attacks, and\nif the backbone has multilingual capabilities, it presents decent\ngeneralization to languages not seen during supervised training, with LLaMA3-1B\nreaching a mean macro-averaged F1 score of 81.46% in cross-validation with nine\nlanguages."

To further reduce latency, we\nextend distribution matching distillation (DMD) to videos, distilling 50-step\ndiffusion model into a 4-step generator. To enable stable and high-quality\ndistillation, we introduce a student initialization scheme based on teacher's\nODE trajectories, as well as an asymmetric distillation strategy that\nsupervises a causal student model with a bidirectional teacher. This approach\neffectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive generation, allowing\nlong-duration video synthesis despite training on short clips. Our model\nachieves a total score of 84.27 on the VBench-Long benchmark, surpassing all\nprevious video generation models. It enables fast streaming generation of\nhigh-quality videos at 9.4 FPS on a single GPU thanks to KV caching.

DaTo selectively prunes tokens with lower dynamics, allowing\nonly high-dynamic tokens to participate in self-attention layers, thereby\nextending feature dynamics across timesteps. DaTo combines feature caching with\ntoken pruning in a training-free manner, achieving both temporal and token-wise\ninformation reuse. Applied to Stable Diffusion on the ImageNet, our approach\ndelivered a 9$\\times$ speedup while reducing FID by 0.33, indicating enhanced\nimage quality. On the COCO-30k, we observed a 7$\\times$ acceleration coupled\nwith a notable FID reduction of 2.17."

In recent times\nthe usage of Vision Transformer-based backbones has allowed methods to obtain\noutstanding recognition performances in this task but this comes at a\nsignificant cost in terms of computation specially since this task\nsignificantly benefits from incorporating higher resolution images.

However, dropping tokens leads to loss of essential information for\nfine-grained categories, specially as the token keep rate is reduced.\nTherefore, to counteract the loss of information brought by the usage of token\nreduction we propose a novel Cross-Layer Aggregation Classification Head and a\nCross-Layer Cache mechanism to recover and access information from previous\nlayers in later locations. Extensive experiments covering more than 2000 runs\nacross diverse settings including 5 datasets, 9 backbones, 7 token reduction\nmethods, 5 keep rates, and 2 image sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed plug-and-play modules and allow us to push the boundaries of accuracy\nvs cost for UFGIR by reducing the kept tokens to extremely low ratios of up to\n10\\% while maintaining a competitive accuracy to state-of-the-art models.

This observation suggests that information of\nthe segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into\nthe separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by\nthis insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates\ninference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens.\nAdditionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration.\nExperimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and\npost-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the\nLlama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the\nGSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in\nstreaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million\ntokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.",

                "summary": "Network simulators are indispensable tools for the advancement of wireless\nnetwork technologies, offering a cost-effective and controlled environment to\nsimulate real-world network behavior. However, traditional simulators, such as\nthe widely used ns-3, exhibit limitations in accurately modeling indoor and\noutdoor scenarios due to their reliance on simplified statistical and\nstochastic channel propagation models, which often fail to accurately capture\nphysical phenomena like multipath signal propagation and shadowing by obstacles\nin the line-of-sight path. We present Ns3Sionna, which integrates a ray\ntracing-based channel model, implemented using the Sionna RT framework, within\nthe ns-3 network simulator. It allows to simulate environment-specific and\nphysically accurate channel realizations for a given 3D scene and wireless\ndevice positions. Additionally, a mobility model based on ray tracing was\ndeveloped to accurately represent device movements within the simulated 3D\nspace.

                    "value": "Network simulators are indispensable tools for the advancement of wireless\nnetwork technologies, offering a cost-effective and controlled environment to\nsimulate real-world network behavior. However, traditional simulators, such as\nthe widely used ns-3, exhibit limitations in accurately modeling indoor and\noutdoor scenarios due to their reliance on simplified statistical and\nstochastic channel propagation models, which often fail to accurately capture\nphysical phenomena like multipath signal propagation and shadowing by obstacles\nin the line-of-sight path. We present Ns3Sionna, which integrates a ray\ntracing-based channel model, implemented using the Sionna RT framework, within\nthe ns-3 network simulator. It allows to simulate environment-specific and\nphysically accurate channel realizations for a given 3D scene and wireless\ndevice positions. Additionally, a mobility model based on ray tracing was\ndeveloped to accurately represent device movements within the simulated 3D\nspace. Ns3Sionna provides more realistic path and delay loss estimates for both\nindoor and outdoor environments than existing ns-3 propagation models,\nparticularly in terms of spatial and temporal correlation.

In this paper, we propose FLUDE to effectively deal with\nundependable environments. First, FLUDE assesses the dependability of devices\nbased on the probability distribution of their historical behaviors (e.g., the\nlikelihood of successfully completing training). Based on this assessment,\nFLUDE adaptively selects devices with high dependability for training. To\nmitigate resource wastage during the training phase, FLUDE maintains a model\ncache on each device, aiming to preserve the latest training state for later\nuse in case local training on an undependable device is interrupted. Moreover,\nFLUDE proposes a staleness-aware strategy to judiciously distribute the global\nmodel to a subset of devices, thus significantly reducing resource wastage\nwhile maintaining model performance. We have implemented FLUDE on two physical\nplatforms with 120 smartphones and NVIDIA Jetson devices.

We detail the implementation of AspectJulia\nand present diverse use cases, ranging from HPC and scientific computing to\nbusiness applications, demonstrating its effectiveness in managing\ncross-cutting concerns. This integration simplifies application development and\nimproves the adaptability of existing Julia modules and packages, paving the\nway for more efficient and maintainable software systems."

The U.S. National Space\nWeather Strategy and Action Plan identifies underutilized data as a central\nissue for improving risk assessment, motivating this research. Accurate GIC\nprediction is generally not possible without information on the electrical\ncircuit, therefore we define a reproducible method based on open-source data,\nwhich enables risk analysts to collect their own substation component data.\nThis process converts OpenStreetMap (OSM) substation locations to\nhigh-resolution, component-level mapping of electricity transmission assets by\nutilizing an innovative web-browser platform to facilitate component\nannotation. As a case study example, we convert an initial 1,313 high-voltage\n(>115 kV) substations to 52,273 substation components via Google Earth APIs\nutilizing low-altitude, satellite, and Streetview imagery. We find that a total\nof 41,642 substation components (79.6%) connect to the highest substation\nvoltage levels (>345 kV) and are possibly susceptible to GIC, with a total of\n7,949 transformers identified. Compared to the initial OSM baseline, we provide\nnew detailed insights on voltage levels, line capacities, and substation\nconfigurations. Two validation workshops were undertaken to align the method\nand data with GIC assessment needs.

                    "value": "Space weather impact assessment is constrained by the lack of available asset\ninformation to undertake modeling of Geomagnetically Induced Currents (GICs) in\nExtra High Voltage electricity infrastructure networks. The U.S. National Space\nWeather Strategy and Action Plan identifies underutilized data as a central\nissue for improving risk assessment, motivating this research. Accurate GIC\nprediction is generally not possible without information on the electrical\ncircuit, therefore we define a reproducible method based on open-source data,\nwhich enables risk analysts to collect their own substation component data.\nThis process converts OpenStreetMap (OSM) substation locations to\nhigh-resolution, component-level mapping of electricity transmission assets by\nutilizing an innovative web-browser platform to facilitate component\nannotation. As a case study example, we convert an initial 1,313 high-voltage\n(>115 kV) substations to 52,273 substation components via Google Earth APIs\nutilizing low-altitude, satellite, and Streetview imagery. We find that a total\nof 41,642 substation components (79.6%) connect to the highest substation\nvoltage levels (>345 kV) and are possibly susceptible to GIC, with a total of\n7,949 transformers identified. Compared to the initial OSM baseline, we provide\nnew detailed insights on voltage levels, line capacities, and substation\nconfigurations. Two validation workshops were undertaken to align the method\nand data with GIC assessment needs. The approach ensures consistency and rapid\nscalability, enabling users to quickly count components via a flexible\nweb-browser application."

However,\nidentifying the best music for a video can be a difficult and time-consuming\ntask. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for automatically\nretrieving a matching music clip for a given video, and vice versa. Our\napproach leverages annotated music labels, as well as the inherent artistic\ncorrespondence between visual and music elements. Distinct from previous\ncross-modal music retrieval works, our method combines both self-supervised and\nsupervised training objectives. We use self-supervised and label-supervised\ncontrastive learning to train a joint embedding space between music and video.\nWe show the effectiveness of our approach by using music genre labels for the\nsupervised training component, and our framework can be generalized to other\nmusic annotations (e.g., emotion, instrument, etc.). Furthermore, our method\nenables fine-grained control over how much the retrieval process focuses on\nself-supervised vs. label information at inference time. We evaluate the\nlearned embeddings through a variety of video-to-music and music-to-video\nretrieval tasks. Our experiments show that the proposed approach successfully\ncombines self-supervised and supervised objectives and is effective for\ncontrollable music-video retrieval.",

                    "value": "Content creators often use music to enhance their videos, from soundtracks in\nmovies to background music in video blogs and social media content. However,\nidentifying the best music for a video can be a difficult and time-consuming\ntask. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for automatically\nretrieving a matching music clip for a given video, and vice versa. Our\napproach leverages annotated music labels, as well as the inherent artistic\ncorrespondence between visual and music elements. Distinct from previous\ncross-modal music retrieval works, our method combines both self-supervised and\nsupervised training objectives. We use self-supervised and label-supervised\ncontrastive learning to train a joint embedding space between music and video.\nWe show the effectiveness of our approach by using music genre labels for the\nsupervised training component, and our framework can be generalized to other\nmusic annotations (e.g., emotion, instrument, etc.). Furthermore, our method\nenables fine-grained control over how much the retrieval process focuses on\nself-supervised vs. label information at inference time. We evaluate the\nlearned embeddings through a variety of video-to-music and music-to-video\nretrieval tasks. Our experiments show that the proposed approach successfully\ncombines self-supervised and supervised objectives and is effective for\ncontrollable music-video retrieval."

The code transformation to take advantage of multi-strided\nmemory access is a natural extension of the loop unroll and loop interchange\ntechniques, allowing this method to be incorporated into compiler pipelines in\nthe future."

We propose DroidSpeak, a framework\nthat optimizes context sharing between fine-tuned LLMs derived from the same\nfoundational model. DroidSpeak identifies critical layers in the KV cache and\nselectively recomputes them, enabling effective reuse of intermediate data\nwhile maintaining high accuracy.\n  Our approach balances computational efficiency and task fidelity,\nsignificantly reducing inference latency and throughput bottlenecks.\nExperiments on diverse datasets and model pairs demonstrate that DroidSpeak\nachieves up to 3x higher throughputs and 2.6x faster prefill times with\nnegligible accuracy loss compared to full recomputation."

However, the discrepancy between offline metrics and online\nperformance significantly impedes their progress. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce Agent4Edu, a novel personalized learning simulator leveraging recent\nadvancements in human intelligence through large language models (LLMs).\nAgent4Edu features LLM-powered generative agents equipped with learner profile,\nmemory, and action modules tailored to personalized learning algorithms. The\nlearner profiles are initialized using real-world response data, capturing\npractice styles and cognitive factors. Inspired by human psychology theory, the\nmemory module records practice facts and high-level summaries, integrating\nreflection mechanisms. The action module supports various behaviors, including\nexercise understanding, analysis, and response generation. Each agent can\ninteract with personalized learning algorithms, such as computerized adaptive\ntesting, enabling a multifaceted evaluation and enhancement of customized\nservices. Through a comprehensive assessment, we explore the strengths and\nweaknesses of Agent4Edu, emphasizing the consistency and discrepancies in\nresponses between agents and human learners.

To address this challenge, we\nintroduce Agent4Edu, a novel personalized learning simulator leveraging recent\nadvancements in human intelligence through large language models (LLMs).\nAgent4Edu features LLM-powered generative agents equipped with learner profile,\nmemory, and action modules tailored to personalized learning algorithms. The\nlearner profiles are initialized using real-world response data, capturing\npractice styles and cognitive factors. Inspired by human psychology theory, the\nmemory module records practice facts and high-level summaries, integrating\nreflection mechanisms. The action module supports various behaviors, including\nexercise understanding, analysis, and response generation. Each agent can\ninteract with personalized learning algorithms, such as computerized adaptive\ntesting, enabling a multifaceted evaluation and enhancement of customized\nservices. Through a comprehensive assessment, we explore the strengths and\nweaknesses of Agent4Edu, emphasizing the consistency and discrepancies in\nresponses between agents and human learners. The code, data, and appendix are\npublicly available at https://github.com/bigdata-ustc/Agent4Edu."

Existing autoencoder\nmodels have demonstrated impressive results at a moderate spatial compression\nratio (e.g., 8x), but fail to maintain satisfactory reconstruction accuracy for\nhigh spatial compression ratios (e.g., 64x). We address this challenge by\nintroducing two key techniques: (1) Residual Autoencoding, where we design our\nmodels to learn residuals based on the space-to-channel transformed features to\nalleviate the optimization difficulty of high spatial-compression autoencoders;\n(2) Decoupled High-Resolution Adaptation, an efficient decoupled three-phases\ntraining strategy for mitigating the generalization penalty of high\nspatial-compression autoencoders. With these designs, we improve the\nautoencoder's spatial compression ratio up to 128 while maintaining the\nreconstruction quality. Applying our DC-AE to latent diffusion models, we\nachieve significant speedup without accuracy drop. For example, on ImageNet\n512x512, our DC-AE provides 19.1x inference speedup and 17.9x training speedup\non H100 GPU for UViT-H while achieving a better FID, compared with the widely\nused SD-VAE-f8 autoencoder.

We forward-model the 21-cm forest signal using\nsemi-numerical simulations and incorporate various instrumental features to\nexplore the potential of detecting the 21-cm forest at $z=6$, both directly and\nstatistically, with the currently available (uGMRT) and forthcoming (SKA1-low)\nobservatories. We show that it is possible to detect the 1D power spectrum of\nthe 21-cm forest spectrum, especially at large scales of $k\\lesssim8.5\\,\\rm\nMHz^{-1}$ with the $500\\,\\rm hr$ of the uGMRT time and $k\\lesssim32.4\\,\\rm\nMHz^{-1}$ with the SKA1-low over $50\\,\\rm hr$ if the intergalactic medium (IGM)\nis $25\\%$ neutral and these neutral hydrogen regions have a spin temperature of\n$\\lesssim30\\,\\rm K$.

We perform\na detailed analysis of layer similarity in speech representation models using\nthree similarity metrics: cosine similarity, centered kernel alignment, and\nmutual nearest-neighbor alignment. Our findings reveal a block-like structure\nof high similarity, suggesting two main processing steps and significant\nredundancy of layers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of pruning\ntransformer-based speech representation models without the need for\npost-training, achieving up to 40% reduction in transformer layers while\nmaintaining over 95% of the model's predictive capacity. Furthermore, we employ\na knowledge distillation method to substitute the entire transformer stack with\nmimicking layers, reducing the network size 95-98% and the inference time by up\nto 94%. This substantial decrease in computational load occurs without\nconsiderable performance loss, suggesting that the transformer stack is almost\ncompletely redundant for downstream applications of speech representation\nmodels.",

However, current frameworks\noften adopt distinct perspectives on three key aspects (task definition, LLM\nprofiling, and search procedures), making direct comparisons challenging.\nMoreover, the search algorithms employed often diverge from standard\nimplementations, and their specific characteristics are not thoroughly\nspecified. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive technical review that\nunifies task definitions and provides modular definitions of LLM profiling and\nsearch procedures. The definitions enable precise comparisons of various LLM\ninference frameworks while highlighting their departures from conventional\nsearch algorithms. We also discuss the applicability, performance, and\nefficiency of these methods.

                    "value": "LLM test-time compute (or LLM inference) via search has emerged as a\npromising research area with rapid developments. However, current frameworks\noften adopt distinct perspectives on three key aspects (task definition, LLM\nprofiling, and search procedures), making direct comparisons challenging.\nMoreover, the search algorithms employed often diverge from standard\nimplementations, and their specific characteristics are not thoroughly\nspecified. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive technical review that\nunifies task definitions and provides modular definitions of LLM profiling and\nsearch procedures. The definitions enable precise comparisons of various LLM\ninference frameworks while highlighting their departures from conventional\nsearch algorithms. We also discuss the applicability, performance, and\nefficiency of these methods.

While existing\ncompression techniques like pruning can reduce model size, it leads to\nsignificant accuracy degradation under high compression ratios. We present a\nnovel perspective inspired by constant folding in compiler optimization. Our\napproach enables parameter reduction by treating activation functions in LLMs\nas linear functions.\n  However, recent LLMs use complex non-linear activations like GELU that\nprevent direct application of this technique. We propose TARDIS, which enables\noptimization of LLMs with non-linear activations by partially approximating\nthem with linear functions in frequently occurring input ranges. For outlier\ninputs, TARDIS employs an online predictor to dynamically fall back to original\ncomputations.\n  Our experiments demonstrate that TARDIS achieves 80% parameter reduction in\nfeed-forward networks, while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art\npruning methods Wanda and RIA with up to 65% higher accuracy. In practical\ndeployments for a 7B model, TARDIS achieves 1.6x end-to-end inference speedup\nwhen integrated with the vLLM serving system, and 1.4x speedup with the widely\nadopted HuggingFace implementation, while incurring only a 10.9% accuracy\ntrade-off.",

Additionally, these methods have\nprimarily modelled clean speech distributions, with limited exploration of\nnoise distributions, thereby constraining the discriminative capability of\ndiffusion models for speech enhancement. To address these issues, we propose a\nnovel approach that integrates a conditional latent diffusion model (cLDM) with\ndual-context learning (DCL). Our method utilizes a variational autoencoder\n(VAE) to compress mel-spectrograms into a low-dimensional latent space. We then\napply cLDM to transform the latent representations of both clean speech and\nbackground noise into Gaussian noise by the DCL process, and a parameterized\nmodel is trained to reverse this process, conditioned on noisy latent\nrepresentations and text embeddings. By operating in a lower-dimensional space,\nthe latent representations reduce the complexity of the generation process,\nwhile the DCL process enhances the model's ability to handle diverse and unseen\nnoise environments. Our experiments demonstrate the strong performance of the\nproposed approach compared to existing diffusion-based methods, even with fewer\niterative steps, and highlight the superior generalization capability of our\nmodels to out-of-domain noise datasets\n(https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio).",

To this end, first, Flash proposes a\nlow-latency convolution algorithm built upon a fast slot rotation operation and\na novel data encoding scheme, which results in 4-94x performance gain over the\nstate-of-the-art. Second, to minimize the communication cost introduced by the\nstandard nonlinear activation function ReLU, Flash replaces the entire ReLUs\nwith the polynomial $x^2+x$ and trains deep CNN models with the new training\nstrategy. The trained models improve the inference accuracy for CIFAR-10/100\nand TinyImageNet by 16% on average (up to 40% for ResNet-32) compared to prior\nart. Last, Flash proposes an efficient 2PC-based $x^2+x$ evaluation protocol\nthat does not require any offline communication and that reduces the total\ncommunication cost to process the activation layer by 84-196x over the\nstate-of-the-art. As a result, the end-to-end PI latency of Flash implemented\non CPU is 0.02 minute for CIFAR-100 and 0.57 minute for TinyImageNet\nclassification, while the total data communication is 0.07GB for CIFAR-100 and\n0.22GB for TinyImageNet. Flash improves the state-of-the-art PI by 16-45x in\nlatency and 84-196x in communication cost. Moreover, even for ImageNet, Flash\ncan deliver the latency less than 1 minute on CPU with the total communication\nless than 1GB.",

We incorporate prior information to provide initialization\nand weak conditioning,which helps mitigate noisy artifacts and suppress\nhallucinations. Additionally, to improve temporal consistency during\nlong-sequence inference, we expand the temporal receptive fields of both the\nprior model and DiffuEraser, and further enhance consistency by leveraging the\ntemporal smoothing property of Video Diffusion Models.

By\nleveraging a Character Knowledge Graph (CKG) extracted from input and generated\nsummaries, NarrativeFactScore assesses the factual consistency and provides\nactionable guidance for refinement, such as identifying missing or erroneous\nfacts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NarrativeFactScore through a\ndetailed workflow illustration and extensive validation on widely adopted\nbenchmarks, achieving superior performance compared to competitive methods. Our\nresults highlight the potential of agent-driven evaluation systems to improve\nthe factual reliability of LLM-generated summaries."

Existing ML debugging approaches are\ninherently inapplicable as they are designed for single-model, centralized\ntraining.\n  We introduce TraceFL, a fine-grained neuron provenance capturing mechanism\nthat identifies clients responsible for a global model's prediction by tracking\nthe flow of information from individual clients to the global model. Since\ninference on different inputs activates a different set of neurons of the\nglobal model, TraceFL dynamically quantifies the significance of the global\nmodel's neurons in a given prediction, identifying the most crucial neurons in\nthe global model. It then maps them to the corresponding neurons in every\nparticipating client to determine each client's contribution, ultimately\nlocalizing the responsible client. We evaluate TraceFL on six datasets,\nincluding two real-world medical imaging datasets and four neural networks,\nincluding advanced models such as GPT. TraceFL achieves 99% accuracy in\nlocalizing the responsible client in FL tasks spanning both image and text\nclassification tasks.

However, the potential for misuse of these models in activities\nsuch as plagiarism, generating fake news, and spamming has raised concern about\ntheir responsible use. Consequently, the reliable detection of AI-generated\ntext has become a critical area of research. AI text detectors have shown to be\neffective under their specific settings. In this paper, we stress-test the\nrobustness of these AI text detectors in the presence of an attacker. We\nintroduce recursive paraphrasing attack to stress test a wide range of\ndetection schemes, including the ones using the watermarking as well as neural\nnetwork-based detectors, zero shot classifiers, and retrieval-based detectors.\nOur experiments conducted on passages, each approximately 300 tokens long,\nreveal the varying sensitivities of these detectors to our attacks. Our\nfindings indicate that while our recursive paraphrasing method can\nsignificantly reduce detection rates, it only slightly degrades text quality in\nmany cases, highlighting potential vulnerabilities in current detection systems\nin the presence of an attacker.

However, the potential for misuse of these models in activities\nsuch as plagiarism, generating fake news, and spamming has raised concern about\ntheir responsible use. Consequently, the reliable detection of AI-generated\ntext has become a critical area of research. AI text detectors have shown to be\neffective under their specific settings. In this paper, we stress-test the\nrobustness of these AI text detectors in the presence of an attacker. We\nintroduce recursive paraphrasing attack to stress test a wide range of\ndetection schemes, including the ones using the watermarking as well as neural\nnetwork-based detectors, zero shot classifiers, and retrieval-based detectors.\nOur experiments conducted on passages, each approximately 300 tokens long,\nreveal the varying sensitivities of these detectors to our attacks.

To validate NL2KQL's performance, we utilize an\narray of online (based on query execution) and offline (based on query parsing)\nmetrics. Through ablation studies, the significance of each framework component\nis examined, and the datasets used for benchmarking are made publicly\navailable. This work is the first of its kind and is compared with available\nbaselines to demonstrate its effectiveness."

However,\ntheir capacity for face understanding has not been systematically studied. To\naddress this gap, we introduce FaceXBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed\nto evaluate MLLMs on complex face understanding tasks. FaceXBench includes\n5,000 multimodal multiple-choice questions derived from 25 public datasets and\na newly created dataset, FaceXAPI. These questions cover 14 tasks across 6\nbroad categories, assessing MLLMs' face understanding abilities in bias and\nfairness, face authentication, recognition, analysis, localization and tool\nretrieval. Using FaceXBench, we conduct an extensive evaluation of 26\nopen-source MLLMs alongside 2 proprietary models, revealing the unique\nchallenges in complex face understanding tasks. We analyze the models across\nthree evaluation settings: zero-shot, in-context task description, and\nchain-of-thought prompting. Our detailed analysis reveals that current MLLMs,\nincluding advanced models like GPT-4o, and GeminiPro 1.5, show significant room\nfor improvement.

                "summary": "Recent LLMs have enabled significant advancements for conversational agents.\nHowever, they are also well-known to hallucinate, i.e., they often produce\nresponses that seem plausible but are not factually correct. On the other hand,\nusers tend to over-rely on LLM-based AI agents; they accept the AI's suggestion\neven when it is wrong. Adding good friction, such as explanations or getting\nuser confirmations, has been proposed as a mitigation in AI-supported\ndecision-making systems. In this paper, we propose an accountability model for\nLLM-based task-oriented dialogue agents to address user overreliance via\nfriction turns in cases of model uncertainty and errors associated with\ndialogue state tracking (DST).

Adding good friction, such as explanations or getting\nuser confirmations, has been proposed as a mitigation in AI-supported\ndecision-making systems.

                "summary": "Language has long been conceived as an essential tool for human reasoning.\nThe breakthrough of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked significant\nresearch interest in leveraging these models to tackle complex reasoning tasks.\nResearchers have moved beyond simple autoregressive token generation by\nintroducing the concept of \"thought\" -- a sequence of tokens representing\nintermediate steps in the reasoning process. This innovative paradigm enables\nLLMs' to mimic complex human reasoning processes, such as tree search and\nreflective thinking. Recently, an emerging trend of learning to reason has\napplied reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLMs to master reasoning\nprocesses. This approach enables the automatic generation of high-quality\nreasoning trajectories through trial-and-error search algorithms, significantly\nexpanding LLMs' reasoning capacity by providing substantially more training\ndata. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrate that encouraging LLMs to \"think\"\nwith more tokens during test-time inference can further significantly boost\nreasoning accuracy. Therefore, the train-time and test-time scaling combined to\nshow a new research frontier -- a path toward Large Reasoning Model. The\nintroduction of OpenAI's o1 series marks a significant milestone in this\nresearch direction. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of recent\nprogress in LLM reasoning. We begin by introducing the foundational background\nof LLMs and then explore the key technical components driving the development\nof large reasoning models, with a focus on automated data construction,\nlearning-to-reason techniques, and test-time scaling. We also analyze popular\nopen-source projects at building large reasoning models, and conclude with open\nchallenges and future research directions.",

                    "value": "Language has long been conceived as an essential tool for human reasoning.\nThe breakthrough of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked significant\nresearch interest in leveraging these models to tackle complex reasoning tasks.\nResearchers have moved beyond simple autoregressive token generation by\nintroducing the concept of \"thought\" -- a sequence of tokens representing\nintermediate steps in the reasoning process. This innovative paradigm enables\nLLMs' to mimic complex human reasoning processes, such as tree search and\nreflective thinking. Recently, an emerging trend of learning to reason has\napplied reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLMs to master reasoning\nprocesses. This approach enables the automatic generation of high-quality\nreasoning trajectories through trial-and-error search algorithms, significantly\nexpanding LLMs' reasoning capacity by providing substantially more training\ndata. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrate that encouraging LLMs to \"think\"\nwith more tokens during test-time inference can further significantly boost\nreasoning accuracy. Therefore, the train-time and test-time scaling combined to\nshow a new research frontier -- a path toward Large Reasoning Model. The\nintroduction of OpenAI's o1 series marks a significant milestone in this\nresearch direction. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of recent\nprogress in LLM reasoning. We begin by introducing the foundational background\nof LLMs and then explore the key technical components driving the development\nof large reasoning models, with a focus on automated data construction,\nlearning-to-reason techniques, and test-time scaling. We also analyze popular\nopen-source projects at building large reasoning models, and conclude with open\nchallenges and future research directions."

To address\nthis difficulty, we propose Andromeda, a framework that utilizes large language\nmodels (LLMs) to enable automatic DBMS configuration debugging. Andromeda\nserves as a natural surrogate of DBAs to answer a wide range of natural\nlanguage (NL) questions on DBMS configuration issues, and to generate\ndiagnostic suggestions to fix these issues. Nevertheless, directly prompting\nLLMs with these professional questions may result in overly generic and often\nunsatisfying answers. To this end, we propose a retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG) strategy that effectively provides matched domain-specific contexts for\nthe question from multiple sources. They come from related historical\nquestions, troubleshooting manuals and DBMS telemetries, which significantly\nimprove the performance of configuration debugging. To support the RAG\nstrategy, we develop a document retrieval mechanism addressing heterogeneous\ndocuments and design an effective method for telemetry analysis. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world DBMS configuration debugging datasets show that\nAndromeda significantly outperforms existing solutions.",

Andromeda\nserves as a natural surrogate of DBAs to answer a wide range of natural\nlanguage (NL) questions on DBMS configuration issues, and to generate\ndiagnostic suggestions to fix these issues. Nevertheless, directly prompting\nLLMs with these professional questions may result in overly generic and often\nunsatisfying answers. To this end, we propose a retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG) strategy that effectively provides matched domain-specific contexts for\nthe question from multiple sources. They come from related historical\nquestions, troubleshooting manuals and DBMS telemetries, which significantly\nimprove the performance of configuration debugging. To support the RAG\nstrategy, we develop a document retrieval mechanism addressing heterogeneous\ndocuments and design an effective method for telemetry analysis. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world DBMS configuration debugging datasets show that\nAndromeda significantly outperforms existing solutions."

These tasks usually show the characteristic of prefix\nsharing, where different prompt input can partially show the common prefix.\nHowever, the existing LLM inference engines tend to optimize the streaming\nrequests and show limitations of supporting the large batched tasks with the\nprefix sharing characteristic. The existing solutions use the LRU-based cache\nto reuse the KV context of common prefix between requests. The KV context that\nare about to be reused may prematurely evicted with the implicit cache\nmanagement.

We propose BatchLLM to address the above problems. BatchLLM explicitly\nidentifies the common prefixes globally. The requests sharing the same prefix\nwill be scheduled together to reuse the KV context the best.

However, we observe that even though the LMMs have abundant knowledge\nabout industrial anomaly detection in the textual domain, the LMMs are unable\nto leverage the knowledge due to the modality gap between textual and visual\ndomains. To stimulate the relevant knowledge in LMMs and adapt the LMMs towards\nanomaly detection tasks, we introduce existing IAD methods as vision experts\nand present a novel large multimodal model applying vision experts for\nindustrial anomaly detection~(abbreviated to {Myriad}).

Learnersourcing enhances learning by engaging students in\ncreating their own educational content. When learnersourcing multiple-choice\nquestions, creating explanations for the solution of a question is a crucial\nstep; it helps other students understand the solution and promotes a deeper\nunderstanding of related concepts. However, it is often difficult for students\nto craft effective solution explanations, due to limited subject understanding.\nTo help scaffold the task of automated explanation generation, we present and\nevaluate a framework called \"ILearner-LLM\", that iteratively enhances the\ngenerated explanations for the given questions with large language models.\nComprising an explanation generation model and an explanation evaluation model,\nthe framework generates high-quality student-aligned explanations by\niteratively feeding the quality rating score from the evaluation model back\ninto the instruction prompt of the explanation generation model. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of our ILearner-LLM on LLaMA2-13B and\nGPT-4 to generate higher quality explanations that are closer to those written\nby students on five PeerWise datasets. Our findings represent a promising path\nto enrich the learnersourcing experience for students and to enhance the\ncapabilities of large language models for educational applications.",

When learnersourcing multiple-choice\nquestions, creating explanations for the solution of a question is a crucial\nstep; it helps other students understand the solution and promotes a deeper\nunderstanding of related concepts. However, it is often difficult for students\nto craft effective solution explanations, due to limited subject understanding.\nTo help scaffold the task of automated explanation generation, we present and\nevaluate a framework called \"ILearner-LLM\", that iteratively enhances the\ngenerated explanations for the given questions with large language models.\nComprising an explanation generation model and an explanation evaluation model,\nthe framework generates high-quality student-aligned explanations by\niteratively feeding the quality rating score from the evaluation model back\ninto the instruction prompt of the explanation generation model. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of our ILearner-LLM on LLaMA2-13B and\nGPT-4 to generate higher quality explanations that are closer to those written\nby students on five PeerWise datasets. Our findings represent a promising path\nto enrich the learnersourcing experience for students and to enhance the\ncapabilities of large language models for educational applications."

To address this gap, we introduce CS-Eval, a publicly\naccessible, comprehensive and bilingual LLM benchmark specifically designed for\ncybersecurity. CS-Eval synthesizes the research hotspots from academia and\npractical applications from industry, curating a diverse set of high-quality\nquestions across 42 categories within cybersecurity, systematically organized\ninto three cognitive levels: knowledge, ability, and application. Through an\nextensive evaluation of a wide range of LLMs using CS-Eval, we have uncovered\nvaluable insights. For instance, while GPT-4 generally excels overall, other\nmodels may outperform it in certain specific subcategories. Additionally, by\nconducting evaluations over several months, we observed significant\nimprovements in many LLMs' abilities to solve cybersecurity tasks.

In this regard, evaluations on Gemma-2-2B and Gemma-2-9B\nmodels across various steering tasks demonstrate that FGAA outperforms existing\nsteering methods of CAA, SAE decoder steering, and SAE-TS. Our results also\nhighlight important trade-offs between steering scale and general model\ncapabilities that are consistent across all tested steering methods."

In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to study the\nphenomena, mechanism, and mitigation of LLM hallucinations within more\npractical and complex development contexts in repository-level generation\nscenario. First, we manually examine the code generation results from six\nmainstream LLMs to establish a hallucination taxonomy of LLM-generated code.\nNext, we elaborate on the phenomenon of hallucinations, analyze their\ndistribution across different models. We then analyze causes of hallucinations\nand identify four potential factors contributing to hallucinations.

Left unresolved, SATD can degrade code\nquality and increase maintenance costs. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have\nshown promise in tasks like code generation and program repair, their potential\nin automated SATD repayment remains underexplored.\n  In this paper, we identify three key challenges in training and evaluating\nLLMs for SATD repayment: (1) dataset representativeness and scalability, (2)\nremoval of irrelevant SATD repayments, and (3) limitations of existing\nevaluation metrics.

In this work, we identify a critical gap in evaluating sanitized\nmodels, particularly in terms of their performance across various concept\ndimensions. We systematically investigate the failure modes of current concept\nerasure techniques, with a focus on visually similar, binomial, and\nsemantically related concepts. We propose that these interconnected\nrelationships give rise to a phenomenon of concept entanglement resulting in\nripple effects and degradation in image quality. To facilitate more\ncomprehensive evaluation, we introduce EraseBENCH, a multi-dimensional\nbenchmark designed to assess concept erasure methods with greater depth. Our\ndataset includes over 100 diverse concepts and more than 1,000 tailored\nprompts, paired with a comprehensive suite of metrics that together offer a\nholistic view of erasure efficacy. Our findings reveal that even\nstate-of-the-art techniques struggle with maintaining quality post-erasure,\nindicating that these approaches are not yet ready for real-world deployment.\nThis highlights the gap in reliability of the concept erasure techniques.",

Specifically, besides visual\nsign recognition features that encode the input video, we integrate\ncomplementary textual information from (i) captions describing the background\nshow, (ii) translation of previous sentences, as well as (iii) pseudo-glosses\ntranscribing the signing. These are automatically extracted and inputted along\nwith the visual features to a pre-trained large language model (LLM), which we\nfine-tune to generate spoken language translations in text form. Through\nextensive ablation studies, we show the positive contribution of each input cue\nto the translation performance. We train and evaluate our approach on BOBSL --\nthe largest British Sign Language dataset currently available. We show that our\ncontextual approach significantly enhances the quality of the translations\ncompared to previously reported results on BOBSL, and also to state-of-the-art\nmethods that we implement as baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate the\ngenerality of our approach by applying it also to How2Sign, an American Sign\nLanguage dataset, and achieve competitive results.",

These are automatically extracted and inputted along\nwith the visual features to a pre-trained large language model (LLM), which we\nfine-tune to generate spoken language translations in text form. Through\nextensive ablation studies, we show the positive contribution of each input cue\nto the translation performance. We train and evaluate our approach on BOBSL --\nthe largest British Sign Language dataset currently available. We show that our\ncontextual approach significantly enhances the quality of the translations\ncompared to previously reported results on BOBSL, and also to state-of-the-art\nmethods that we implement as baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate the\ngenerality of our approach by applying it also to How2Sign, an American Sign\nLanguage dataset, and achieve competitive results."

Recent research has begun to explore inference-time scaling\nbehavior in Large Language Models (LLMs), revealing how performance can further\nimprove with additional computation during inference. Unlike LLMs, diffusion\nmodels inherently possess the flexibility to adjust inference-time computation\nvia the number of denoising steps, although the performance gains typically\nflatten after a few dozen. In this work, we explore the inference-time scaling\nbehavior of diffusion models beyond increasing denoising steps and investigate\nhow the generation performance can further improve with increased computation.\nSpecifically, we consider a search problem aimed at identifying better noises\nfor the diffusion sampling process. We structure the design space along two\naxes: the verifiers used to provide feedback, and the algorithms used to find\nbetter noise candidates. Through extensive experiments on class-conditioned and\ntext-conditioned image generation benchmarks, our findings reveal that\nincreasing inference-time compute leads to substantial improvements in the\nquality of samples generated by diffusion models, and with the complicated\nnature of images, combinations of the components in the framework can be\nspecifically chosen to conform with different application scenario.",

Recent research has begun to explore inference-time scaling\nbehavior in Large Language Models (LLMs), revealing how performance can further\nimprove with additional computation during inference. Unlike LLMs, diffusion\nmodels inherently possess the flexibility to adjust inference-time computation\nvia the number of denoising steps, although the performance gains typically\nflatten after a few dozen. In this work, we explore the inference-time scaling\nbehavior of diffusion models beyond increasing denoising steps and investigate\nhow the generation performance can further improve with increased computation.\nSpecifically, we consider a search problem aimed at identifying better noises\nfor the diffusion sampling process. We structure the design space along two\naxes: the verifiers used to provide feedback, and the algorithms used to find\nbetter noise candidates. Through extensive experiments on class-conditioned and\ntext-conditioned image generation benchmarks, our findings reveal that\nincreasing inference-time compute leads to substantial improvements in the\nquality of samples generated by diffusion models, and with the complicated\nnature of images, combinations of the components in the framework can be\nspecifically chosen to conform with different application scenario."

The e-Llama models are obtained by\ncontinuously pretraining the Llama 3.1 base models on 1 trillion tokens of\ndomain-specific data.\n  We discuss our approach and motivate our choice of hyperparameters with a\nseries of ablation studies. To quantify how well the models have been adapted\nto the e-commerce domain, we define and implement a set of multilingual,\ne-commerce specific evaluation tasks.\n  We show that, when carefully choosing the training setup, the Llama 3.1\nmodels can be adapted towards the new domain without sacrificing significant\nperformance on general domain tasks. We also explore the possibility of merging\nthe adapted model and the base model for a better control of the performance\ntrade-off between domains.",
