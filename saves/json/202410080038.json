Existing inverse rendering techniques with co-located light-camera\nfocus on single objects only, without modeling global illumination and\nnear-field lighting more prominent in scenes with multiple objects. We\nintroduce a system that solves this problem in two stages; we first reconstruct\nthe geometry powered by neural volumetric rendering NeuS, followed by inverse\nneural radiosity that uses the previously predicted geometry to estimate albedo\nand roughness. However, such a naive combination fails and we propose multiple\ntechnical contributions that enable this two-stage approach. We observe that\nNeuS fails to handle near-field illumination and strong specular reflections\nfrom the flashlight in a scene. We propose to implicitly model the effects of\nnear-field illumination and introduce a surface angle loss function to handle\nspecular reflections. Similarly, we observe that invNeRad assumes constant\nillumination throughout the capture and cannot handle moving flashlights during\ncapture. We propose a light position-aware radiance cache network and\nadditional smoothness priors on roughness to reconstruct reflectance.\nExperimental evaluation on synthetic and real data shows that our method\noutperforms the existing co-located light-camera-based inverse rendering\ntechniques. Our approach produces significantly better reflectance and slightly\nbetter geometry than capture strategies that do not require a dark room.",

Existing inverse rendering techniques with co-located light-camera\nfocus on single objects only, without modeling global illumination and\nnear-field lighting more prominent in scenes with multiple objects. We\nintroduce a system that solves this problem in two stages; we first reconstruct\nthe geometry powered by neural volumetric rendering NeuS, followed by inverse\nneural radiosity that uses the previously predicted geometry to estimate albedo\nand roughness. However, such a naive combination fails and we propose multiple\ntechnical contributions that enable this two-stage approach. We observe that\nNeuS fails to handle near-field illumination and strong specular reflections\nfrom the flashlight in a scene. We propose to implicitly model the effects of\nnear-field illumination and introduce a surface angle loss function to handle\nspecular reflections. Similarly, we observe that invNeRad assumes constant\nillumination throughout the capture and cannot handle moving flashlights during\ncapture. We propose a light position-aware radiance cache network and\nadditional smoothness priors on roughness to reconstruct reflectance.\nExperimental evaluation on synthetic and real data shows that our method\noutperforms the existing co-located light-camera-based inverse rendering\ntechniques. Our approach produces significantly better reflectance and slightly\nbetter geometry than capture strategies that do not require a dark room."

Motivated by these insights, we developed PyramidKV, a\nnovel and effective KV cache compression method. This approach dynamically\nadjusts the KV cache size across different layers, allocating more cache in\nlower layers and less in higher ones, diverging from traditional methods that\nmaintain a uniform KV cache size. Our experimental evaluations, utilizing the\nLongBench benchmark, show that PyramidKV matches the performance of models with\na full KV cache while retaining only 12% of the KV cache, thus significantly\nreducing memory usage. In scenarios emphasizing memory efficiency, where only\n0.7% of the KV cache is maintained, PyramidKV surpasses other KV cache\ncompression techniques, achieving up to a 20.5 absolute accuracy improvement on\nTREC dataset. In the Needle-in-a-Haystack experiment, PyramidKV outperforms\ncompeting methods in maintaining long-context comprehension in LLMs; notably,\nretaining just 128 KV cache entries enables the LLAMA-3-70B model to achieve\n100% Acc. performance, matching that of a full KV cache.",

                },
                "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advances in supporting\nlong-context comprehension and processing tasks. However, scaling the\ngeneration inference of LLMs to such long contexts incurs significant\nadditional computation load, and demands a substantial GPU memory footprint to\nmaintain the key-value (KV) cache of transformer-based LLMs. Existing KV cache\ncompression methods, such as quantization, face memory bottlenecks as context\nlength increases, while static-sized caches, such as eviction, suffer from\ninefficient policies. These limitations restrict deployment on consumer-grade\ndevices like a single Nvidia 4090 GPU. To overcome this, we propose Locret, a\nframework for long-context LLM inference that introduces retaining heads to\nevaluate the causal importance of KV cache units, allowing for more accurate\neviction within a fixed cache size. Locret is fine-tuned on top of the frozen\nbackbone LLM using a minimal amount of data from standard long-context SFT\ndatasets. During inference, we evict low-importance cache units along with a\nchunked prefill pattern, significantly reducing peak GPU memory usage. We\nconduct an extensive empirical study to evaluate Locret, where the experimental\nresults show that Locret outperforms the recent competitive approaches,\nincluding InfLLM, Quantization, SirLLM, and MInference, in terms of memory\nefficiency and the quality of generated contents -- Locret achieves over a 20x\nand 8x KV cache compression ratio compared to the full KV cache for\nPhi-3-mini-128K and Llama-3.1-8B-instruct. Additionally, Locret can be combined\nwith other methods, such as quantization and token merging. To our knowledge,\nLocret is the first framework capable of deploying Llama-3.1-8B or similar\nmodels on a single Nvidia 4090 GPU, enabling 128K long-context inference\nwithout compromising generation quality, and requiring little additional system\noptimizations.",

To address this, two critical steps are often required: a\npretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length\nextension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural\nmodifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper\nargues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction\narchitecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but\nalso achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed\nLongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during\nlength extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention\npatterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink\n(initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are\nwell-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their\nGPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just\ntheoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to\nhave direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention\nlayers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency\nand long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data\nis sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.\n  We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its\neffectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts,\nLongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%,\ncompared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV\ncache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding\nspeedup.",

Traditional approaches often encode the entire context. Instead,\nBlock-Attention divides retrieved documents into discrete blocks, with each\nblock independently calculating key-value (KV) states except for the final\nblock. In RAG scenarios, by defining each passage as a block, Block-Attention\nenables us to reuse the KV states of passages that have been seen before,\nthereby significantly reducing the latency and the computation overhead during\ninference. The implementation of Block-Attention involves block segmentation,\nposition re-encoding, and fine-tuning the LLM to adapt to the Block-Attention\nmechanism. Experiments on four RAG benchmarks demonstrate that after block\nfine-tuning, the Block-Attention model achieves performance comparable to\nself-attention models (68.4\\% vs 67.9\\% on Llama3) or even superior performance\n(62.8\\% vs 59.6\\% on Mistral). Notably, Block-Attention significantly reduces\nthe time to first token (TTFT) and floating point operations (FLOPs) to a very\nlow level.

                    "value": "We introduce Block-Attention, an attention mechanism designed to address the\nincreased inference latency and cost in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nscenarios. Traditional approaches often encode the entire context. Instead,\nBlock-Attention divides retrieved documents into discrete blocks, with each\nblock independently calculating key-value (KV) states except for the final\nblock. In RAG scenarios, by defining each passage as a block, Block-Attention\nenables us to reuse the KV states of passages that have been seen before,\nthereby significantly reducing the latency and the computation overhead during\ninference. The implementation of Block-Attention involves block segmentation,\nposition re-encoding, and fine-tuning the LLM to adapt to the Block-Attention\nmechanism. Experiments on four RAG benchmarks demonstrate that after block\nfine-tuning, the Block-Attention model achieves performance comparable to\nself-attention models (68.4\\% vs 67.9\\% on Llama3) or even superior performance\n(62.8\\% vs 59.6\\% on Mistral). Notably, Block-Attention significantly reduces\nthe time to first token (TTFT) and floating point operations (FLOPs) to a very\nlow level. It only takes 45 ms to output the first token for an input sequence\nwith a total length of 32K. Compared to the self-attention models, the time\nconsumption and corresponding FLOPs are reduced by 98.7\\% and 99.8\\%,\nrespectively."

There are $L$ antennas at\nthe server, and each cache has a normalized size of $M/N \\leq 1$. The cyclic\nwrap-around MACC network with a single antenna at the server has been a\nwell-investigated topic, and several coded caching schemes and improved lower\nbounds on the performance are known for the same. However, this MACC network\nhas not yet been studied under multi-antenna settings in the coded caching\nliterature. We study the multi-antenna MACC problem and propose a solution for\nthe same by constructing a pair of arrays called caching and delivery arrays.\nWe present three constructions of caching and delivery arrays for different\nscenarios and obtain corresponding multi-antenna MACC schemes for the same. Two\nschemes resulting from the above constructions achieve optimal performance\nunder uncoded placement and one-shot delivery. The optimality is shown by\nmatching the performance of the multi-antenna MACC scheme to that of an optimal\nmulti-antenna scheme for a dedicated cache network having an identical number\nof users, and each user has a normalized cache size of $rM/N$.

Unlike\nfew-shot learning methods in natural images that can leverage the labels of\neach image, existing few-shot WSI classification methods only utilize a small\nnumber of fine-grained labels or weakly supervised slide labels for training in\norder to avoid expensive fine-grained annotation. They lack sufficient mining\nof available WSIs, severely limiting WSI classification performance. To address\nthe above issues, we propose a novel and efficient dual-tier few-shot learning\nparadigm for WSI classification, named FAST. FAST consists of a dual-level\nannotation strategy and a dual-branch classification framework. Firstly, to\navoid expensive fine-grained annotation, we collect a very small number of WSIs\nat the slide level, and annotate an extremely small number of patches. Then, to\nfully mining the available WSIs, we use all the patches and available patch\nlabels to build a cache branch, which utilizes the labeled patches to learn the\nlabels of unlabeled patches and through knowledge retrieval for patch\nclassification. In addition to the cache branch, we also construct a prior\nbranch that includes learnable prompt vectors, using the text encoder of\nvisual-language models for patch classification. Finally, we integrate the\nresults from both branches to achieve WSI classification. Extensive experiments\non binary and multi-class datasets demonstrate that our proposed method\nsignificantly surpasses existing few-shot classification methods and approaches\nthe accuracy of fully supervised methods with only 0.22$\\%$ annotation costs.\nAll codes and models will be publicly available on\nhttps://github.com/fukexue/FAST.",

The segments were converted\nto stereolithographic (STL) files and smoothed in Fusion360. A slit to\naccommodate a radiochromic film (RCF) was added at the location of the glioma\ntumor. UPDOG was 3D printed on a polyjet printer using VeroUltraWhite ($\\rho$ =\n1.19-1.20 g/cm\\textsuperscript{3}) for the bone and Agilus30 ($\\rho$ =\n1.14-1.15 g/cm\\textsuperscript{3}) for the soft tissue. CT scans of UPDOG were\nacquired on a clinical CT scanner. An LD-V1 RCF was inserted into UPDOG and\nirradiated with a kV x-ray source from two angles. The delivered dose to the\nRCF was compared to Monte Carlo (MC) simulations performed in TOPAS.\n  Results: The bone and soft tissue segments in UPDOG were mimicked the patient\nanatomy well with tube voltage-dependent CT numbers. The contrast in HU was of\n49, 47 and 50 HU for the 80, 100, and 120 kVp scans, respectively, sufficient\nfor anatomy visualization. The irradiations delivered a maximum dose to RCF of\n284 mGy which was compared to the results of MC simulations using a depth dose\ncurve and central-axis (CAX) beam profiles. The mean difference in CAX profiles\nand PDD between RCF and MC results was 15.9\\% and 2.3\\%, respectively.\n  Conclusions: We have demonstrated that UPDOG is a useful QA tool for kV\ncanine radiotherapy. UPDOG successfully anatomically mimicked the dog anatomy,\nwith a reduced but sufficient bone contrast. We showed that dose delivered to a\ncanine glioma with kV x-rays can be successfully measured with an RCF\npositioned at the tumor location.",

To increase capacity, high bit-density cells, such as Triple-Level\nCell (TLC), are utilized within 3D SSDs.

In SLC/TLC hybrid 3D SSDs, a portion of the TLC space is designated\nas an SLC cache to achieve high SSD performance by writing host data at the SLC\nspeed.

The validity of the proposed strategy is demonstrated\nby simulation on a $\\pm$525 kV, three-terminal meshed MMC-HVDC system model in\nReal Time Digital Simulator (RTDS)."

The paper\ndescribes the use of models based on real time records and including solar\nslews, to investigate the most extreme wind variations likely to be encountered\nin future, enabling strategies to be devised to mitigate them. Wind lulls are\nsurprisingly frequent, occasionally lasting a week or more, and are always\nlikely to be beyond the capabilities of stored or imported electrical energy to\nmitigate them. The models indicate that there will be a continuing need for gas\npowered generation to mitigate wind lulls. Currently, Combined Cycle Gas\nTurbines (CCGTs) provide most of the dispatchable generation. However, CCGTs\nare not sufficiently fast acting to cope with the wind and solar slews\nanticipated in future. The paper suggests that a range of already proven\nfast-acting sources of dispatchable generation, including Open Cycle Gas\nTurbines (OCGTs), Internal Combustion Gas-Fired Reciprocating engines (ICGRs)\nand stored electrical energy systems, should be capable of coping with the\nlargest wind and solar slews likely to be encountered up to the year 2035.\nExamples are given of the recent introduction of these fast-acting sources of\ngeneration which, it is suggested, will progressively replace CCGTs as the wind\nand solar fleets increase in size. Moreover, we see the pattern of recent\ninvestments, summarised in the paper, as a good indication of likely future\ninvestments, with OCGT investments mainly serving the 440 kV grid, and ICGRs\nand stored electrical energy more local networks.",

In this paper, through trace-based experiments, we found\nthat the existing method for long sequences results in a high\nTime-To-First-Token (TTFT) due to sequential chunk processing, long\nTime-Between-Tokens (TBT) from batching long-sequence prefills and decodes, and\nlow throughput due to constrained key-value cache (KVC) for long sequences. To\naddress these issues, we propose two Sequence-Parallelism (SP) architectures\nfor both tensor parallelism (TP) and non-TP. However, SP introduces two\nchallenges: 1) network communication and computation become performance\nbottlenecks; 2) the latter two issues above are mitigated but not resolved, and\nSP's resultant KV value distribution across GPUs still requires communication\nfor decode, increasing TBT. Hence, we propose a Communication-efficient Sparse\nAttention (CSA) and communication-computation-communication three-phase\npipelining. We also propose SP-based decode that processes decode separately\nfrom prefill, distributes KV values of a request across different GPUs, and\nnovelly moves Query (Q) values instead of KV values to reduce communication\noverhead. These methods constitute a communication-efficient\nSequence-Parallelism based LLM Serving System (SPS2). Our trace-driven\nevaluation demonstrates that SPS2 improves the average TTFT, TBT, and response\ntime by up to 7.5x, 1.92x, and 9.8x and improves the prefill and decode\nthroughput by 8.2x and 5.2x while maintaining the accuracy compared to\nSarathi-Serve.

Our\nconstruction achieves an asymptotically optimal (amortized) runtime of\n$\\Theta(\\log N)$ per operation for a capacity of $N$ elements and is of\nindependent interest.\n  Building on our construction, we additionally present efficient\nexternal-memory instantiations of our oblivious, perfectly-secure construction:\nFor the cache-aware setting, we match the optimal I/O complexity of\n$\\Theta(\\frac{1}{B} \\log \\frac{N}{M})$ per operation (amortized), and for the\ncache-oblivious setting we achieve a near-optimal I/O complexity of\n$O(\\frac{1}{B} \\log \\frac{N}{M} \\log\\log_M N)$ per operation (amortized)."

We delve into\nLLM weight low-rank factorization, and find that the challenges of this task\nstem from the outlier phenomenon in the LLM activations and the sensitivity\ndifference among various kinds of layers. To address these issues, we propose a\ntraining-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition\n(ASVD). Specifically, ASVD manages activation outliers by scaling the weight\nmatrix based on the activation distribution, thereby enhancing decomposition\naccuracy. Additionally, we propose an efficient iterative calibration process\nto optimize layer-specific decomposition by addressing the varying sensitivity\nof different LLM layers. ASVD can compress a network by 10-20%, without\ncompromising the performance of LLMs. Based on the success of the low-rank\ndecomposition of projection matrices in the self-attention module, we further\nintroduce ASVD to compress the KV cache. By reducing the channel dimension of\nKV activations, memory requirements for KV cache can be largely reduced. Thanks\nto the 50-75% reduction in the rank of the KV projection matrices, ASVD can\nfurther achieve 50% KV cache reductions without performance drop in a\ntraining-free manner.",

This\ninnovative approach enables the provision of tailored networks to accommodate\nspecific business types or industry users, thus delivering more customized and\nefficient services. However, the shared memory and cache in network slicing\nintroduce security vulnerabilities that have yet to be fully addressed. In this\npaper, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based side-channel cache attack\nframework specifically designed for network slicing environments. Unlike\ntraditional cache attack methods, our framework leverages reinforcement\nlearning to dynamically identify and exploit cache locations storing sensitive\ninformation, such as authentication keys and user registration data. We assume\nthat one slice network is compromised and demonstrate how the attacker can\ninduce another shared slice to send registration requests, thereby estimating\nthe cache locations of critical data. By formulating the cache timing channel\nattack as a reinforcement learning-driven guessing game between the attack\nslice and the victim slice, our model efficiently explores possible actions to\npinpoint memory blocks containing sensitive information. Experimental results\nshowcase the superiority of our approach, achieving a success rate of\napproximately 95\\% to 98\\% in accurately identifying the storage locations of\nsensitive data. This high level of accuracy underscores the potential risks in\nshared network slicing environments and highlights the need for robust security\nmeasures to safeguard against such advanced side-channel attacks.",

                "summary": "As the use of large language models (LLMs) expands rapidly, so does the range\nof knowledge needed to supplement various LLM queries. Thus, enabling flexible\nand efficient injection of new knowledge in LLM inference is critical. Three\nhigh-level options exist: (i) embedding the knowledge in LLM's weights (i.e.,\nfine-tuning), (ii) including the knowledge as a part of LLM's text input (i.e.,\nin-context learning), or (iii) injecting the KV caches of the new knowledge to\nLLM during prefill. This paper argues that, although fine-tuning and in-context\nlearning are popular, using KV caches as the medium of knowledge could\nsimultaneously enable more modular management of knowledge injection and more\nefficient LLM serving with low cost and fast response. To realize these\nbenefits, we envision a Knowledge Delivery Network (KDN), a new system\ncomponent in LLM services that dynamically optimizes the storage, transfer, and\ncomposition of KV cache across LLM engines and other compute and storage\nresources. We believe that, just like content delivery networks (CDNs), such as\nAkamai, enabled the success of the Internet ecosystem through their efficient\ndata delivery, KDNs will be critical to the success of LLM applications through\ntheir efficient knowledge delivery. We have open-sourced a KDN prototype at\nhttps://github.com/LMCache/LMCache.",

                    "value": "As the use of large language models (LLMs) expands rapidly, so does the range\nof knowledge needed to supplement various LLM queries. Thus, enabling flexible\nand efficient injection of new knowledge in LLM inference is critical. Three\nhigh-level options exist: (i) embedding the knowledge in LLM's weights (i.e.,\nfine-tuning), (ii) including the knowledge as a part of LLM's text input (i.e.,\nin-context learning), or (iii) injecting the KV caches of the new knowledge to\nLLM during prefill. This paper argues that, although fine-tuning and in-context\nlearning are popular, using KV caches as the medium of knowledge could\nsimultaneously enable more modular management of knowledge injection and more\nefficient LLM serving with low cost and fast response. To realize these\nbenefits, we envision a Knowledge Delivery Network (KDN), a new system\ncomponent in LLM services that dynamically optimizes the storage, transfer, and\ncomposition of KV cache across LLM engines and other compute and storage\nresources. We believe that, just like content delivery networks (CDNs), such as\nAkamai, enabled the success of the Internet ecosystem through their efficient\ndata delivery, KDNs will be critical to the success of LLM applications through\ntheir efficient knowledge delivery. We have open-sourced a KDN prototype at\nhttps://github.com/LMCache/LMCache."

Existing approaches in TTA continuously\nadapt the DNN, leading to excessive resource consumption and performance\ndegradation due to accumulation of error stemming from lack of supervision. In\nthis work, we propose Domain-Aware Real-Time Dynamic Adaptation (DARDA) to\naddress such issues. Our key approach is to proactively learn latent\nrepresentations of some corruption types, each one associated with a\nsub-network state tailored to correctly classify inputs affected by that\ncorruption. After deployment, DARDA adapts the DNN to previously unseen\ncorruptions in an unsupervised fashion by (i) estimating the latent\nrepresentation of the ongoing corruption; (ii) selecting the sub-network whose\nassociated corruption is the closest in the latent space to the ongoing\ncorruption; and (iii) adapting DNN state, so that its representation matches\nthe ongoing corruption. This way, DARDA is more resource efficient and can\nswiftly adapt to new distributions caused by different corruptions without\nrequiring a large variety of input data. Through experiments with two popular\nmobile edge devices - Raspberry Pi and NVIDIA Jetson Nano - we show that DARDA\nreduces energy consumption and average cache memory footprint respectively by\n1.74x and 2.64x with respect to the state of the art, while increasing the\nperformance by 10.4%, 5.7% and 4.4% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and TinyImagenet.",

In contrast, WarmSwap offers a broad middle ground, which optimizes\nentire categories of serverless functions. WarmSwap eliminates the need to\ninitialize middleware or software dependencies when launching a new serverless\ncontainer, by migrating a pre-initialized live dependency image to the new\nfunction instance. WarmSwap respects the provider's cache constraints, as a\nsingle pre-warmed dependency image in the cache is shared among all serverless\nfunctions requiring that software dependency image. WarmSwap has been tested on\nseven representative functions from FunctionBench. The functions are chosen to\ncompare with previous work.

                "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are distinguished by their\nmultimodal comprehensive ability and widely used in many real-world\napplications including GPT-4o, autonomous driving and robotics. Despite their\nimpressive performance, the multimodal inputs always incur long context. The\ninference under long context requires caching massive Key and Value states (KV\ncache) of previous tokens, which introduces high latency and excessive memory\nconsumption. Due to this reason, it is challenging to deploy streaming\ninference of MLLMs on edge devices, which largely constrains the power and\nusage of MLLMs in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce\nInf-MLLM, an efficient inference framework for MLLMs, which enable streaming\ninference of MLLM on a single GPU with infinite context. Inf-MLLM is based on\nour key observation of the attention pattern in both LLMs and MLLMs called\n\"attention saddles\". Thanks to the newly discovered attention pattern, Inf-MLLM\nmaintains a size-constrained KV cache by dynamically caching recent tokens and\nrelevant tokens.

                    "value": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are distinguished by their\nmultimodal comprehensive ability and widely used in many real-world\napplications including GPT-4o, autonomous driving and robotics. Despite their\nimpressive performance, the multimodal inputs always incur long context. The\ninference under long context requires caching massive Key and Value states (KV\ncache) of previous tokens, which introduces high latency and excessive memory\nconsumption. Due to this reason, it is challenging to deploy streaming\ninference of MLLMs on edge devices, which largely constrains the power and\nusage of MLLMs in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce\nInf-MLLM, an efficient inference framework for MLLMs, which enable streaming\ninference of MLLM on a single GPU with infinite context. Inf-MLLM is based on\nour key observation of the attention pattern in both LLMs and MLLMs called\n\"attention saddles\". Thanks to the newly discovered attention pattern, Inf-MLLM\nmaintains a size-constrained KV cache by dynamically caching recent tokens and\nrelevant tokens. Furthermore, Inf-MLLM proposes attention bias, a novel\napproach to enable MLLMs to capture long-term dependency. We show that Inf-MLLM\nenables multiple LLMs and MLLMs to achieve stable performance over 4M-token\nlong texts and multi-round conversations with 1-hour-long videos on a single\nGPU. In addition, Inf-MLLM exhibits superior streaming reasoning quality than\nexisting methods such as StreamingLLM and 2x speedup than H2O."

                "summary": "With the growing demand for live video streaming, there is an increasing need\nfor low-latency and high-quality transmission, especially with the advent of 5G\nnetworks. While 5G offers hardware-level improvements, effective software\nsolutions for minimizing latency remain essential. Current methods, such as\nmulti-channel streaming, fail to address latency issues fundamentally, often\nonly adding new channels without optimizing overall performance. This thesis\nproposes a novel approach using a 3D engine (e.g., Unity 3D) to stream\nmulti-input video data through a single channel with reduced latency. By\nleveraging 3D engine capabilities, such as World/Screen Space Cameras, 3D\nCanvases, and Webcam Textures, the proposed system consolidates video streams\nfrom multiple external cameras into a unified, low-latency output. The\naffiliated project of this thesis demonstrates the implementation of a\nlow-latency multi-channel live video streaming system. It employs the RTSP\nprotocol and examines video encoding techniques, alongside a client-side\napplication based on Unity 3D.

                    "value": "With the growing demand for live video streaming, there is an increasing need\nfor low-latency and high-quality transmission, especially with the advent of 5G\nnetworks. While 5G offers hardware-level improvements, effective software\nsolutions for minimizing latency remain essential. Current methods, such as\nmulti-channel streaming, fail to address latency issues fundamentally, often\nonly adding new channels without optimizing overall performance. This thesis\nproposes a novel approach using a 3D engine (e.g., Unity 3D) to stream\nmulti-input video data through a single channel with reduced latency. By\nleveraging 3D engine capabilities, such as World/Screen Space Cameras, 3D\nCanvases, and Webcam Textures, the proposed system consolidates video streams\nfrom multiple external cameras into a unified, low-latency output. The\naffiliated project of this thesis demonstrates the implementation of a\nlow-latency multi-channel live video streaming system. It employs the RTSP\nprotocol and examines video encoding techniques, alongside a client-side\napplication based on Unity 3D.

In this paper, we formally define the problem of\n$\\textbf{cross-modality parametric knowledge conflict}$ and present a\nsystematic approach to detect, interpret, and mitigate them. We introduce a\npipeline that identifies conflicts between visual and textual answers, showing\na persistently high conflict rate across modalities in recent LVLMs regardless\nof the model size. We further investigate how these conflicts interfere with\nthe inference process and propose a contrastive metric to discern the\nconflicting samples from the others. Building on these insights, we develop a\nnovel dynamic contrastive decoding method that removes undesirable logits\ninferred from the less confident modality components based on answer\nconfidence. For models that do not provide logits, we also introduce two\nprompt-based strategies to mitigate the conflicts. Our methods achieve\npromising improvements in accuracy on both the ViQuAE and InfoSeek datasets.\nSpecifically, using LLaVA-34B, our proposed dynamic contrastive decoding\nimproves an average accuracy of 2.24%.",

In this paper, we formally define the problem of\n$\\textbf{cross-modality parametric knowledge conflict}$ and present a\nsystematic approach to detect, interpret, and mitigate them. We introduce a\npipeline that identifies conflicts between visual and textual answers, showing\na persistently high conflict rate across modalities in recent LVLMs regardless\nof the model size. We further investigate how these conflicts interfere with\nthe inference process and propose a contrastive metric to discern the\nconflicting samples from the others. Building on these insights, we develop a\nnovel dynamic contrastive decoding method that removes undesirable logits\ninferred from the less confident modality components based on answer\nconfidence. For models that do not provide logits, we also introduce two\nprompt-based strategies to mitigate the conflicts. Our methods achieve\npromising improvements in accuracy on both the ViQuAE and InfoSeek datasets.\nSpecifically, using LLaVA-34B, our proposed dynamic contrastive decoding\nimproves an average accuracy of 2.24%."

SCoRe\naddresses these challenges by training under the model's own distribution of\nself-generated correction traces and using appropriate regularization to steer\nthe learning process into learning a self-correction behavior that is effective\nat test time as opposed to fitting high-reward responses for a given prompt.\nThis regularization process includes an initial phase of multi-turn RL on a\nbase model to generate a policy initialization that is less susceptible to\ncollapse, followed by using a reward bonus to amplify self-correction.

We propose a \"wrapper box''\npipeline: training a neural model as usual and then using its learned feature\nrepresentation in classic, interpretable models to perform prediction. Across\nseven language models of varying sizes, including four large language models\n(LLMs), two datasets at different scales, three classic models, and four\nevaluation metrics, we first show that the predictive performance of wrapper\nclassic models is largely comparable to the original neural models.\n  Because classic models are transparent, each model decision is determined by\na known set of training examples that can be directly shown to users. Our\npipeline thus preserves the predictive performance of neural language models\nwhile faithfully attributing classic model decisions to training data. Among\nother use cases, such attribution enables model decisions to be contested based\non responsible training instances. Compared to prior work, our approach\nachieves higher coverage and correctness in identifying which training data to\nremove to change a model decision.

We evaluate our framework and\nbaseline methods using state-of-the-art LLMs across a suite of real-world\nmedical knowledge and medical diagnosis benchmarks. MDAgents achieved the best\nperformance in seven out of ten benchmarks on tasks requiring an understanding\nof medical knowledge and multi-modal reasoning, showing a significant\nimprovement of up to 6.5% (p < 0.05) compared to previous methods' best\nperformances. Ablation studies reveal that MDAgents effectively determines\nmedical complexity to optimize for efficiency and accuracy across diverse\nmedical tasks.

However, achieving optimal results with a given prompt or\ninstruction can be challenging, especially for billion-sized models.\nAdditionally, undesired behaviors such as toxicity or hallucinations can\nmanifest. While much larger models (e.g., ChatGPT) may demonstrate strength in\nmitigating these issues, there is still no guarantee of complete prevention. In\nthis work, we propose formalizing text generation as a future-constrained\ngeneration problem to minimize undesirable behaviors and enforce faithfulness\nto instructions. The estimation of future constraint satisfaction, accomplished\nusing LLMs, guides the text generation process.

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a powerful ability for text\ngeneration. However, achieving optimal results with a given prompt or\ninstruction can be challenging, especially for billion-sized models.\nAdditionally, undesired behaviors such as toxicity or hallucinations can\nmanifest. While much larger models (e.g., ChatGPT) may demonstrate strength in\nmitigating these issues, there is still no guarantee of complete prevention. In\nthis work, we propose formalizing text generation as a future-constrained\ngeneration problem to minimize undesirable behaviors and enforce faithfulness\nto instructions. The estimation of future constraint satisfaction, accomplished\nusing LLMs, guides the text generation process.

In this work, we take several steps to bridge\nthis gap. First, we formalize this problem as (black-box) RAG Dataset Inference\n(RAG-DI). To facilitate research on this challenge, we further introduce a\nnovel dataset specifically designed for benchmarking RAG-DI methods under\nrealistic conditions, and propose a set of baseline approaches. Building on\nthis foundation, we introduce Ward, a RAG-DI method based on LLM watermarks\nthat enables data owners to obtain rigorous statistical guarantees regarding\nthe usage of their dataset in a RAG system. In our experimental evaluation, we\nshow that Ward consistently outperforms all baselines across many challenging\nsettings, achieving higher accuracy, superior query efficiency and robustness.\nOur work provides a foundation for future studies of RAG-DI and highlights LLM\nwatermarks as a promising approach to this problem.",

In this\npaper, we introduce OpenHands (f.k.a.

We describe how the platform allows for the\nimplementation of new agents, safe interaction with sandboxed environments for\ncode execution, coordination between multiple agents, and incorporation of\nevaluation benchmarks. Based on our currently incorporated benchmarks, we\nperform an evaluation of agents over 15 challenging tasks, including software\nengineering (e.g., SWE-BENCH) and web browsing (e.g., WEBARENA), among others.\nReleased under the permissive MIT license, OpenHands is a community project\nspanning academia and industry with more than 2.1K contributions from over 188\ncontributors.",

Yet, many LLMs suffer from self-inconsistency, which\nraises doubts about their trustworthiness and reliability. This paper focuses\non entity type ambiguity, analyzing the proficiency and consistency of\nstate-of-the-art LLMs in applying factual knowledge when prompted with\nambiguous entities. To do so, we propose an evaluation protocol that\ndisentangles knowing from applying knowledge, and test state-of-the-art LLMs on\n49 ambiguous entities. Our experiments reveal that LLMs struggle with choosing\nthe correct entity reading, achieving an average accuracy of only 85%, and as\nlow as 75% with underspecified prompts. The results also reveal systematic\ndiscrepancies in LLM behavior, showing that while the models may possess\nknowledge, they struggle to apply it consistently, exhibit biases toward\npreferred readings, and display self-inconsistencies. This highlights the need\nto address entity ambiguity in the future for more trustworthy LLMs.",

Yet, many LLMs suffer from self-inconsistency, which\nraises doubts about their trustworthiness and reliability. This paper focuses\non entity type ambiguity, analyzing the proficiency and consistency of\nstate-of-the-art LLMs in applying factual knowledge when prompted with\nambiguous entities. To do so, we propose an evaluation protocol that\ndisentangles knowing from applying knowledge, and test state-of-the-art LLMs on\n49 ambiguous entities. Our experiments reveal that LLMs struggle with choosing\nthe correct entity reading, achieving an average accuracy of only 85%, and as\nlow as 75% with underspecified prompts. The results also reveal systematic\ndiscrepancies in LLM behavior, showing that while the models may possess\nknowledge, they struggle to apply it consistently, exhibit biases toward\npreferred readings, and display self-inconsistencies. This highlights the need\nto address entity ambiguity in the future for more trustworthy LLMs."

We find that LLMs display strong translation capability after being\nfine-tuned on as few as 32 parallel sentences and that fine-tuning on a single\ntranslation direction enables translation in multiple directions. However, the\nchoice of direction is critical: fine-tuning LLMs with only English on the\ntarget side can lead to task misinterpretation, which hinders translation into\nnon-English languages. Problems also arise when noisy synthetic data is placed\non the target side, especially when the target language is well-represented in\nLLM pre-training. Yet interestingly, synthesized data in an under-represented\nlanguage has a less pronounced effect.

ERs play a critical role in software development and\nmaintenance. However, how to automatically generate ERs of code remains an open\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose a self-reflection approach to generating\nERs of code. It enables two Large Language Models (LLMs) to work mutually and\nproduce an ER through a reflection process. Depending on whether constraints on\nERs are applied, our approach generates ERs in both open and constrained\nsettings. We conduct a empirical study to generate ERs in two settings and\nobtain eight findings. (1) Generating ERs in the open setting. In the open\nsetting, we allow LLMs to represent code without any constraints, analyzing the\nresulting ERs and uncovering five key findings. These findings shed light on\nhow LLMs comprehend syntactic structures, APIs, and numerical computations in\ncode. (2) Generating ERs in the constrained setting. In the constrained\nsetting, we impose constraints on ERs, such as natural language comments,\npseudocode, and flowcharts. This allows our approach to address a range of\nsoftware engineering tasks. Based on our experiments, we have three findings\ndemonstrating that our approach can effectively generate ERs that adhere to\nspecific constraints, thus supporting various software engineering tasks.

In this work, we propose a more\neffective sampling method, named Preference-Guided Reflective Sampling (PRS).\nUnlike random sampling, PRS employs a tree-based generation framework to enable\nmore efficient sampling. It leverages adaptive self-refinement techniques to\nbetter explore the sampling space. By specifying user preferences in natural\nlanguage, PRS can further optimize response generation according to these\npreferences. As a result, PRS can align models to diverse user preferences. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that PRS generates higher-quality responses with\nsignificantly higher rewards. On AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard, PRS substantially\noutperforms repeated random sampling in best-of-$N$ sampling. Moreover, PRS\nshows strong performance when applied in iterative offline RL training.",

In this work, we propose a more\neffective sampling method, named Preference-Guided Reflective Sampling (PRS).\nUnlike random sampling, PRS employs a tree-based generation framework to enable\nmore efficient sampling. It leverages adaptive self-refinement techniques to\nbetter explore the sampling space. By specifying user preferences in natural\nlanguage, PRS can further optimize response generation according to these\npreferences. As a result, PRS can align models to diverse user preferences. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that PRS generates higher-quality responses with\nsignificantly higher rewards. On AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard, PRS substantially\noutperforms repeated random sampling in best-of-$N$ sampling. Moreover, PRS\nshows strong performance when applied in iterative offline RL training."

In addition to these, we introduce a novel 2D lookup-free\napproach for motion tokenization, which preserves motion information and\nexpands codebook capacity, further enhancing the representative ability of\nlarge motion models. The release of MotionBase and the insights gained from\nthis study are expected to pave the way for the development of more powerful\nand versatile motion generation models."

Next to English, we further include Danish and Italian translations\nof the sentiment classification task and compare self-explanations to human\nannotations for all samples. To allow for direct comparisons, we also compute\npost-hoc feature attribution, i.e., layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) and\napply this pipeline to 4 LLMs (Llama2, Llama3, Mistral and Mixtral). Our\nresults show that self-explanations align more closely with human annotations\ncompared to LRP, while maintaining a comparable level of faithfulness."

For evaluation, we establish the ALOE (ALign With\nCustOmized PrEferences) benchmark, consisting of 100 carefully selected\nexamples and well-designed metrics to measure the customized alignment\nperformance during conversations.

To\naddress these shortcomings, we develop a multi-turn online reinforcement\nlearning (RL) approach, SCoRe, that significantly improves an LLM's\nself-correction ability using entirely self-generated data. To build SCoRe, we\nfirst show that variants of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on offline\nmodel-generated correction traces are often insufficient for instilling\nself-correction behavior.

SCoRe\naddresses these challenges by training under the model's own distribution of\nself-generated correction traces and using appropriate regularization to steer\nthe learning process into learning a self-correction behavior that is effective\nat test time as opposed to fitting high-reward responses for a given prompt.\nThis regularization process includes an initial phase of multi-turn RL on a\nbase model to generate a policy initialization that is less susceptible to\ncollapse, followed by using a reward bonus to amplify self-correction.

In this work, we present the advanced SaySelf, a training\nframework that teaches LLMs to express more accurate fine-grained confidence\nestimates.

There are a number of\nlightweight LLMs (e.g., Gemini Nano, LLAMA2 7B) that can run locally on\nsmartphones, providing users with greater control over their personal data. As\na rapidly emerging application, we are concerned about their performance on\ncommercial-off-the-shelf mobile devices. To fully understand the current\nlandscape of LLM deployment on mobile platforms, we conduct a comprehensive\nmeasurement study on mobile devices. We evaluate both metrics that affect user\nexperience, including token throughput, latency, and battery consumption, as\nwell as factors critical to developers, such as resource utilization, DVFS\nstrategies, and inference engines. In addition, we provide a detailed analysis\nof how these hardware capabilities and system dynamics affect on-device LLM\nperformance, which may help developers identify and address bottlenecks for\nmobile LLM applications. We also provide comprehensive comparisons across the\nmobile system-on-chips (SoCs) from major vendors, highlighting their\nperformance differences in handling LLM workloads. We hope that this study can\nprovide insights for both the development of on-device LLMs and the design for\nfuture mobile system architecture.",

                    "value": "As large language models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into every aspect of\nour work and daily lives, there are growing concerns about user privacy, which\npush the trend toward local deployment of these models. There are a number of\nlightweight LLMs (e.g., Gemini Nano, LLAMA2 7B) that can run locally on\nsmartphones, providing users with greater control over their personal data. As\na rapidly emerging application, we are concerned about their performance on\ncommercial-off-the-shelf mobile devices. To fully understand the current\nlandscape of LLM deployment on mobile platforms, we conduct a comprehensive\nmeasurement study on mobile devices. We evaluate both metrics that affect user\nexperience, including token throughput, latency, and battery consumption, as\nwell as factors critical to developers, such as resource utilization, DVFS\nstrategies, and inference engines. In addition, we provide a detailed analysis\nof how these hardware capabilities and system dynamics affect on-device LLM\nperformance, which may help developers identify and address bottlenecks for\nmobile LLM applications. We also provide comprehensive comparisons across the\nmobile system-on-chips (SoCs) from major vendors, highlighting their\nperformance differences in handling LLM workloads. We hope that this study can\nprovide insights for both the development of on-device LLMs and the design for\nfuture mobile system architecture."

Yet despite their\npromise, the best way to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex\nmedical tasks remains an open question. We introduce a novel multi-agent\nframework, named Medical Decision-making Agents (MDAgents) that helps address\nthis gap by automatically assigning a collaboration structure to a team of\nLLMs. The assigned solo or group collaboration structure is tailored to the\nmedical task at hand, emulating real-world medical decision-making processes\nadapted to tasks of varying complexities. We evaluate our framework and\nbaseline methods using state-of-the-art LLMs across a suite of real-world\nmedical knowledge and medical diagnosis benchmarks. MDAgents achieved the best\nperformance in seven out of ten benchmarks on tasks requiring an understanding\nof medical knowledge and multi-modal reasoning, showing a significant\nimprovement of up to 6.5% (p < 0.05) compared to previous methods' best\nperformances. Ablation studies reveal that MDAgents effectively determines\nmedical complexity to optimize for efficiency and accuracy across diverse\nmedical tasks.

We also\ndiscover that results from LLM written code are not always better than using\ntextual reasoning, even if the task could be solved through code. To mitigate\nthe above issues, we propose three methods to better steer LLM code/text\ngeneration and achieve a notable improvement. The costs of token lengths and\nruntime are thoroughly discussed for all the methods. We believe the problem of\nsteering LLM code/text generation is critical for future research and has much\nspace for further improvement.

In this letter, we propose a novel framework called\nGrasps As Points for RL (GAP-RL) to effectively and reliably grasp moving\nobjects. By implementing a fast region-based grasp detector, we build a Grasp\nEncoder by transforming 6D grasp poses into Gaussian points and extracting\ngrasp features as a higher-level abstraction than the original object point\nfeatures. Additionally, we develop a Graspable Region Explorer for real-world\ndeployment, which searches for consistent graspable regions, enabling smoother\ngrasp generation and stable policy execution. To assess the performance fairly,\nwe construct a simulated dynamic grasping benchmark involving objects with\nvarious complex motions. Experiment results demonstrate that our method\neffectively generalizes to novel objects and unseen dynamic motions compared to\nother baselines. Real-world experiments further validate the framework's\nsim-to-real transferability.",

In this paper, we propose a novel perspective that\nattributes this vulnerability to reward misspecification during the alignment\nprocess.

In this\npaper, we introduce OpenHands (f.k.a.

We describe how the platform allows for the\nimplementation of new agents, safe interaction with sandboxed environments for\ncode execution, coordination between multiple agents, and incorporation of\nevaluation benchmarks. Based on our currently incorporated benchmarks, we\nperform an evaluation of agents over 15 challenging tasks, including software\nengineering (e.g., SWE-BENCH) and web browsing (e.g., WEBARENA), among others.\nReleased under the permissive MIT license, OpenHands is a community project\nspanning academia and industry with more than 2.1K contributions from over 188\ncontributors.",

These methods demonstrate promising results, often\nsurpassing traditional static code analysis tools in effectiveness.\n  In this study, we explore a novel approach to vulnerability detection\nutilizing the tools from topological data analysis (TDA) on the attention\nmatrices of the BERT model. Our findings reveal that traditional machine\nlearning (ML) techniques, when trained on the topological features extracted\nfrom these attention matrices, can perform competitively with pre-trained\nlanguage models (LLMs) such as CodeBERTa. This suggests that TDA tools,\nincluding persistent homology, are capable of effectively capturing semantic\ninformation critical for identifying vulnerabilities.",

                    "value": "Recently, deep learning (DL) approaches to vulnerability detection have\ngained significant traction. These methods demonstrate promising results, often\nsurpassing traditional static code analysis tools in effectiveness.\n  In this study, we explore a novel approach to vulnerability detection\nutilizing the tools from topological data analysis (TDA) on the attention\nmatrices of the BERT model. Our findings reveal that traditional machine\nlearning (ML) techniques, when trained on the topological features extracted\nfrom these attention matrices, can perform competitively with pre-trained\nlanguage models (LLMs) such as CodeBERTa. This suggests that TDA tools,\nincluding persistent homology, are capable of effectively capturing semantic\ninformation critical for identifying vulnerabilities."

We then prompted\nstate-of-the art toxicity classifiers (TCs) and large language models (LLMs) to\nrate and explain the harm. Our analysis revealed that TCs and LLMs rated\ntoxicity significantly lower than PwD, but LLMs rated ableism generally on par\nwith PwD.

Our\npreliminary experiments reveal that it is challenging for a single model to\nexcel in both recall and precision. Further analysis shows that: 1) the one2set\nparadigm owns the advantage of high recall, but suffers from improper\nassignments of supervision signals during training; 2) LLMs are powerful in\nkeyphrase selection, but existing selection methods often make redundant\nselections. Given these observations, we introduce a generate-then-select\nframework decomposing KPG into two steps, where we adopt a one2set-based model\nas generator to produce candidates and then use an LLM as selector to select\nkeyphrases from these candidates. Particularly, we make two important\nimprovements on our generator and selector: 1) we design an Optimal\nTransport-based assignment strategy to address the above improper assignments;\n2) we model the keyphrase selection as a sequence labeling task to alleviate\nredundant selections.

In the current practice of fine-tuning large\nlanguage models (LLMs) for translation, we revisit the importance of these\nfactors. We find that LLMs display strong translation capability after being\nfine-tuned on as few as 32 parallel sentences and that fine-tuning on a single\ntranslation direction enables translation in multiple directions. However, the\nchoice of direction is critical: fine-tuning LLMs with only English on the\ntarget side can lead to task misinterpretation, which hinders translation into\nnon-English languages. Problems also arise when noisy synthetic data is placed\non the target side, especially when the target language is well-represented in\nLLM pre-training. Yet interestingly, synthesized data in an under-represented\nlanguage has a less pronounced effect. Our findings suggest that when adapting\nLLMs to translation, the requirement on data quantity can be eased but careful\nconsiderations are still crucial to prevent an LLM from exploiting unintended\ndata biases.",

In this paper, we propose a self-reflection approach to generating\nERs of code. It enables two Large Language Models (LLMs) to work mutually and\nproduce an ER through a reflection process. Depending on whether constraints on\nERs are applied, our approach generates ERs in both open and constrained\nsettings.

In the open\nsetting, we allow LLMs to represent code without any constraints, analyzing the\nresulting ERs and uncovering five key findings. These findings shed light on\nhow LLMs comprehend syntactic structures, APIs, and numerical computations in\ncode. (2) Generating ERs in the constrained setting. In the constrained\nsetting, we impose constraints on ERs, such as natural language comments,\npseudocode, and flowcharts. This allows our approach to address a range of\nsoftware engineering tasks. Based on our experiments, we have three findings\ndemonstrating that our approach can effectively generate ERs that adhere to\nspecific constraints, thus supporting various software engineering tasks.

By leveraging this vast dataset, our large motion\nmodel demonstrates strong performance across a broad range of motions,\nincluding unseen ones. Through systematic investigation, we underscore the\nimportance of scaling both data and model size, with synthetic data and pseudo\nlabels playing a crucial role in mitigating data acquisition costs. Moreover,\nour research reveals the limitations of existing evaluation metrics,\nparticularly in handling out-of-domain text instructions -- an issue that has\nlong been overlooked. In addition to these, we introduce a novel 2D lookup-free\napproach for motion tokenization, which preserves motion information and\nexpands codebook capacity, further enhancing the representative ability of\nlarge motion models.

We\nintroduce the Psychological Depth Scale (PDS), a novel framework rooted in\nliterary theory that measures an LLM's ability to produce authentic and\nnarratively complex stories that provoke emotion, empathy, and engagement. We\nempirically validate our framework by showing that humans can consistently\nevaluate stories based on PDS (0.72 Krippendorff's alpha). We also explore\ntechniques for automating the PDS to easily scale future analyses. GPT-4o,\ncombined with a novel Mixture-of-Personas (MoP) prompting strategy, achieves an\naverage Spearman correlation of 0.51 with human judgment while Llama-3-70B with\nconstrained decoding scores as high as 0.68 for empathy. Finally, we compared\nthe depth of stories authored by both humans and LLMs. Surprisingly, GPT-4\nstories either surpassed or were statistically indistinguishable from\nhighly-rated human-written stories sourced from Reddit.

First, we experimentally quantify the magnitude\nof benchmark overfitting based on scaling along three dimensions: The number of\nmodel parameters (up to 1.6B), the number of times an example is seen (up to\n144), and the number of training tokens (up to 40B).

At the same time, even 144 times of contamination can be forgotten\nif the training data is scaled beyond five times Chinchilla, a regime\ncharacteristic of many modern LLMs. We then derive a simple theory of example\nforgetting via cumulative weight decay. It allows us to bound the number of\ngradient steps required to forget past data for any training run where we know\nthe hyperparameters of AdamW. This indicates that many LLMs, including Llama 3,\nhave forgotten the data seen at the beginning of training.

For many languages, however, film subtitles are\nnot easily available, or are overwhelmingly translated from English. We\ndemonstrate that frequencies extracted from carefully processed YouTube\nsubtitles provide an approximation comparable to, and often better than, the\nbest currently available resources. Moreover, they are available for languages\nfor which a high-quality subtitle or speech corpus does not exist. We use\nYouTube subtitles to construct frequency norms for five diverse languages,\nChinese, English, Indonesian, Japanese, and Spanish, and evaluate their\ncorrelation with lexical decision time, word familiarity, and lexical\ncomplexity. In addition to being strongly correlated with two psycholinguistic\nvariables, a simple linear regression on the new frequencies achieves a new\nhigh score on a lexical complexity prediction task in English and Japanese,\nsurpassing both models trained on film subtitle frequencies and the LLM GPT-4.\nOur code, the frequency lists, fastText word embeddings, and statistical\nlanguage models are freely available at https://github.com/naist-nlp/tubelex.",

For many languages, however, film subtitles are\nnot easily available, or are overwhelmingly translated from English. We\ndemonstrate that frequencies extracted from carefully processed YouTube\nsubtitles provide an approximation comparable to, and often better than, the\nbest currently available resources. Moreover, they are available for languages\nfor which a high-quality subtitle or speech corpus does not exist. We use\nYouTube subtitles to construct frequency norms for five diverse languages,\nChinese, English, Indonesian, Japanese, and Spanish, and evaluate their\ncorrelation with lexical decision time, word familiarity, and lexical\ncomplexity. In addition to being strongly correlated with two psycholinguistic\nvariables, a simple linear regression on the new frequencies achieves a new\nhigh score on a lexical complexity prediction task in English and Japanese,\nsurpassing both models trained on film subtitle frequencies and the LLM GPT-4.\nOur code, the frequency lists, fastText word embeddings, and statistical\nlanguage models are freely available at https://github.com/naist-nlp/tubelex."

Existing frame\nselection approaches, such as uniform frame sampling and text-frame retrieval,\nfail to account for the information density variations in the videos or the\ncomplex instructions in the tasks, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this\npaper, we propose Frame-Voyager that learns to query informative frame\ncombinations, based on the given textual queries in the task. To train\nFrame-Voyager, we introduce a new data collection and labeling pipeline, by\nranking frame combinations using a pre-trained Video-LLM. Given a video of M\nframes, we traverse its T-frame combinations, feed them into a Video-LLM, and\nrank them based on Video-LLM's prediction losses. Using this ranking as\nsupervision, we train Frame-Voyager to query the frame combinations with lower\nlosses. In experiments, we evaluate Frame-Voyager on four Video Question\nAnswering benchmarks by plugging it into two different Video-LLMs. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that Frame-Voyager achieves impressive results\nin all settings, highlighting its potential as a plug-and-play solution for\nVideo-LLMs.",

In this\npaper, we propose Frame-Voyager that learns to query informative frame\ncombinations, based on the given textual queries in the task. To train\nFrame-Voyager, we introduce a new data collection and labeling pipeline, by\nranking frame combinations using a pre-trained Video-LLM. Given a video of M\nframes, we traverse its T-frame combinations, feed them into a Video-LLM, and\nrank them based on Video-LLM's prediction losses. Using this ranking as\nsupervision, we train Frame-Voyager to query the frame combinations with lower\nlosses. In experiments, we evaluate Frame-Voyager on four Video Question\nAnswering benchmarks by plugging it into two different Video-LLMs. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that Frame-Voyager achieves impressive results\nin all settings, highlighting its potential as a plug-and-play solution for\nVideo-LLMs."

This\npaper introduces AutoPenBench, an open benchmark for evaluating generative\nagents in automated penetration testing.

Tasks are of increasing difficulty levels, including in-vitro\nand real-world scenarios. We assess the agent performance with generic and\nspecific milestones that allow us to compare results in a standardised manner\nand understand the limits of the agent under test. We show the benefits of\nAutoPenBench by testing two agent architectures: a fully autonomous and a\nsemi-autonomous supporting human interaction. We compare their performance and\nlimitations. For example, the fully autonomous agent performs unsatisfactorily\nachieving a 21% Success Rate (SR) across the benchmark, solving 27% of the\nsimple tasks and only one real-world task. In contrast, the assisted agent\ndemonstrates substantial improvements, with 64% of SR.

Our\ndiagnostic analysis indicates that the primary reason for model errors lies in\nassessing task solvability. Additionally, open-weight models suffer from\nperformance drops with verbose replies, whereas proprietary models excel with\nlonger reasoning."
