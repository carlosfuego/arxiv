In contrast, static analysis reuse profile estimation is a\npromisingly faster approach since it is calculated at compile time without\nrunning the program or collecting memory traces. This work presents a static\nanalysis technique to estimate the reuse profile of loop-based programs. For an\ninput program, we generate a basic block-level control flow graph and the\nexecution count by analyzing the LLVM IR of the program. We present the memory\naccesses of the application kernel in a compact bracketed format and use a\nrecursive algorithm to predict the reuse distance histogram. We deploy a\nseparate predictor that unrolls the loop(s) for smaller bounds and generates a\ntemporary reuse distance profile for those small cases. Using these smaller\nprofiles, the reuse profile is extrapolated for the actual loop bound(s). We\nuse this reuse profile to predict the cache hit rate.

The beam\ncould be modulated and the maximum overall duration was 50 ms. With the upgrade\nof RFX-mod to the present RFX-mod2 machine, the DNBI is being renovated to\nsolve several plant faults and improve the overall reliability of the system.\nThe 50 kV power supply is being improved, as well as the power supplies in the\nhigh voltage deck and its insulation transformer. The control system,\noriginally based on CAMAC technology, was redesigned to be fully replaced.

However, the growing size of Mamba models continues to pose\ntraining and deployment challenges and raises environmental concerns due to\nconsiderable energy consumption. In this work, we introduce Bi-Mamba, a\nscalable and powerful 1-bit Mamba architecture designed for more efficient\nlarge language models with multiple sizes across 780M, 1.3B, and 2.7B. Bi-Mamba\nmodels are trained from scratch on data volume as regular LLM pertaining using\nan autoregressive distillation loss. Extensive experimental results on language\nmodeling demonstrate that Bi-Mamba achieves performance comparable to its\nfull-precision counterparts (e.g., FP16 or BF16) and much better accuracy than\npost-training-binarization (PTB) Mamba baselines, while significantly reducing\nmemory footprint and energy consumption compared to the original Mamba model.\nOur study pioneers a new linear computational complexity LLM framework under\nlow-bit representation and facilitates the future design of specialized\nhardware tailored for efficient 1-bit Mamba-based LLMs.",

                    "value": "The typical selective state-space model (SSM) of Mamba addresses several\nlimitations of Transformers, such as quadratic computational complexity with\nsequence length and significant inference-time memory requirements due to the\nkey-value cache. However, the growing size of Mamba models continues to pose\ntraining and deployment challenges and raises environmental concerns due to\nconsiderable energy consumption. In this work, we introduce Bi-Mamba, a\nscalable and powerful 1-bit Mamba architecture designed for more efficient\nlarge language models with multiple sizes across 780M, 1.3B, and 2.7B. Bi-Mamba\nmodels are trained from scratch on data volume as regular LLM pertaining using\nan autoregressive distillation loss. Extensive experimental results on language\nmodeling demonstrate that Bi-Mamba achieves performance comparable to its\nfull-precision counterparts (e.g., FP16 or BF16) and much better accuracy than\npost-training-binarization (PTB) Mamba baselines, while significantly reducing\nmemory footprint and energy consumption compared to the original Mamba model.\nOur study pioneers a new linear computational complexity LLM framework under\nlow-bit representation and facilitates the future design of specialized\nhardware tailored for efficient 1-bit Mamba-based LLMs."

Across 44 benchmarks, LJR's interpreter is on average 179% faster than\nthe official PUC Lua interpreter, and 31% faster than LuaJIT's interpreter.\nLJR's baseline JIT has negligible startup delay, and its execution performance\nis on average 360% faster than PUC Lua and only 33% slower (but faster on 13/44\nbenchmarks) than LuaJIT's optimizing JIT."

To solve this problem, some\nrecent works were introduced to drop the unimportant tokens during inference\nwhere the importance of each token is decided only by the information in either\nthe vision encoding stage or the prefilling stage. In this paper, we propose\nMulti-stage Token Dropping (MustDrop) to measure the importance of each token\nfrom the whole lifecycle, including the vision encoding stage, prefilling\nstage, and decoding stage. Concretely, in the visual encoding stage, MustDrop\nmerges spatially adjacent tokens with high similarity, and establishes a key\ntoken set to retain the most vision-critical tokens, preventing them from being\ndiscarded in later stages. In the prefilling stage, MustDrop further compresses\nvision tokens by the guidance of text semantics, with a dual-attention\nfiltering strategy. In the decoding stage, an output-aware cache policy is\nproposed to further reduce the size of the KV cache. By leveraging tailored\nstrategies in the multi-stage process, MustDrop can more precisely recognize\nthe important and redundant tokens, thus achieving an optimal balance between\nperformance and efficiency. For instance, MustDrop reduces about 88.5\\% FLOPs\non LLaVA with a compression ratio of 92.2\\% while maintaining comparable\naccuracy.

In this paper, we propose\nMulti-stage Token Dropping (MustDrop) to measure the importance of each token\nfrom the whole lifecycle, including the vision encoding stage, prefilling\nstage, and decoding stage. Concretely, in the visual encoding stage, MustDrop\nmerges spatially adjacent tokens with high similarity, and establishes a key\ntoken set to retain the most vision-critical tokens, preventing them from being\ndiscarded in later stages. In the prefilling stage, MustDrop further compresses\nvision tokens by the guidance of text semantics, with a dual-attention\nfiltering strategy. In the decoding stage, an output-aware cache policy is\nproposed to further reduce the size of the KV cache. By leveraging tailored\nstrategies in the multi-stage process, MustDrop can more precisely recognize\nthe important and redundant tokens, thus achieving an optimal balance between\nperformance and efficiency. For instance, MustDrop reduces about 88.5\\% FLOPs\non LLaVA with a compression ratio of 92.2\\% while maintaining comparable\naccuracy.

The\neffectiveness of a key-value cache relies on its ability of accommodating the\nneeded data. However, expanding the cache capacity is often more difficult than\ncommonly expected because of many practical constraints, such as server costs,\ncooling issues, rack space, and even human resource expenses. A potential\nsolution is compression, which virtually extends the cache capacity by\ncondensing data in cache. In practice, this seemingly simple idea has not\ngained much traction in key-value cache system design, due to several critical\nissues: the compression-unfriendly index structure, severe read/write\namplification, wasteful decompression operations, and heavy computing cost.\nThis paper presents a hybrid DRAM-SSD cache design to realize a systematic\nintegration of data compression in key-value cache. By treating compression as\nan essential component, we have redesigned the indexing structure, data\nmanagement, and leveraged the emerging computational SSD hardware for\ncollaborative optimizations.

However, for many of\nthese applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different\nuser inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations\nto process user inputs quickly, as they are received. In this work, we propose\nSqueezed Attention as a mechanism to accelerate LLM applications where a large\nportion of the input prompt is fixed.

We also extend our method to use a hierarchical centroid lookup to\nidentify important keys, which can reduce the complexity of attention from\nlinear to logarithmic with respect to the context length. We implement\noptimized Triton kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with\nimportant keys, achieving more than 4x speedups during both the prefill and\ngeneration phases for long-context inference.

By\nleveraging predictable memory access patterns and the high bandwidth of modern\nhardware like the NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, Pie enables concurrent\ndata swapping without affecting foreground computation, expanding effective\nmemory without added latency.

With its extended capacity, Pie\noutperforms vLLM by up to 1.9X in throughput and 2X in latency. Additionally,\nPie can reduce GPU memory usage by up to 1.67X while maintaining the same\nperformance.

However, the current ordinary\ndifferential equation (ODE) solver for FDMs, e.g., the Euler solver, still\nsuffers from slow generation since ODE solvers need many number function\nevaluations (NFE) to keep high-quality generation. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel training-free flow-solver to reduce NFE while maintaining high-quality\ngeneration. The key insight for the flow-solver is to leverage the previous\nsteps to reduce the NFE, where a cache is created to reuse these results from\nthe previous steps. Specifically, the Taylor expansion is first used to\napproximate the ODE. To calculate the high-order derivatives of Taylor\nexpansion, the flow-solver proposes to use the previous steps and a polynomial\ninterpolation to approximate it, where the number of orders we could\napproximate equals the number of previous steps we cached. We also prove that\nthe flow-solver has a more minor approximation error and faster generation\nspeed. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ, LSUN-Bedroom,\nLSUN-Church, ImageNet, and real text-to-image generation prove the efficiency\nof the flow-solver. Specifically, the flow-solver improves the FID-30K from\n13.79 to 6.75, from 46.64 to 19.49 with $\\text{NFE}=10$ on CIFAR-10 and\nLSUN-Church, respectively.",

The key insight for the flow-solver is to leverage the previous\nsteps to reduce the NFE, where a cache is created to reuse these results from\nthe previous steps. Specifically, the Taylor expansion is first used to\napproximate the ODE. To calculate the high-order derivatives of Taylor\nexpansion, the flow-solver proposes to use the previous steps and a polynomial\ninterpolation to approximate it, where the number of orders we could\napproximate equals the number of previous steps we cached. We also prove that\nthe flow-solver has a more minor approximation error and faster generation\nspeed. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ, LSUN-Bedroom,\nLSUN-Church, ImageNet, and real text-to-image generation prove the efficiency\nof the flow-solver. Specifically, the flow-solver improves the FID-30K from\n13.79 to 6.75, from 46.64 to 19.49 with $\\text{NFE}=10$ on CIFAR-10 and\nLSUN-Church, respectively."

This paper presents\nGastCoCo, a system with graph storage and coroutine-based prefetch co-design.\nBy employing software prefetching via stackless coroutines and introducing a\nprefetch-friendly data structure CBList, GastCoCo significantly alleviates the\nperformance degradation caused by cache misses. Our results show that GastCoCo\noutperforms state-of-the-art graph storage systems by 1.3x - 180x in graph\nupdates and 1.4x - 41.1x in graph computation."

Furthermore, we examine our\n\\texttt{HEXA-MoE} with heterogeneous devices for both data- and model-centric\nsettings. Promising results show that employing optimal parallel configuration\nwith \\texttt{HEXA-MoE} on heterogeneous devices can substantially minimize\noverall latency.

However, this\nprogress faces two major challenges: performance degradation due to sequence\nlengths out-of-distribution, and excessively long inference times caused by the\nquadratic computational complexity of attention. These issues hinder the\napplication of LLMs in long-context scenarios. In this paper, we propose\nDynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection (TokenSelect), a model-agnostic,\ntraining-free method for efficient and accurate long-context inference.\nTokenSelect builds upon the observation of non-contiguous attention sparsity,\nusing Query-Key dot products to measure per-head KV Cache criticality at\ntoken-level. By per-head soft voting mechanism, TokenSelect selectively\ninvolves a small number of critical KV cache tokens in the attention\ncalculation without sacrificing accuracy. To further accelerate TokenSelect, we\ndesigned the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query\nsimilarity and implemented efficient dot product kernel, significantly reducing\nthe overhead of token selection. A comprehensive evaluation of TokenSelect\ndemonstrates up to 23.84x speedup in attention computation and up to 2.28x\nacceleration in end-to-end latency, while providing superior performance\ncompared to state-of-the-art long-context inference methods.",

                "summary": "In recent years, the Internet has been dominated by content-rich platforms,\nemploying recommendation systems to provide users with more appealing content\n(e.g., videos in YouTube, movies in Netflix). While traditional content\nrecommendations are oblivious to network conditions, the paradigm of\nNetwork-Friendly Recommendations (NFR) has recently emerged, favoring content\nthat improves network performance (e.g. cached near the user), while still\nbeing appealing to the user. However, NFR algorithms sometimes achieve their\ngoal by shrinking the pool of content recommended to users. The undesirable\nside-effect is reduced content diversity, a phenomenon known as\n``content/filter bubble''. This reduced diversity is problematic for both\nusers, who are prevented from exploring a broader range of content, and content\ncreators (e.g. YouTubers) whose content may be recommended less frequently,\nleading to perceived unfairness.

                    "value": "In recent years, the Internet has been dominated by content-rich platforms,\nemploying recommendation systems to provide users with more appealing content\n(e.g., videos in YouTube, movies in Netflix). While traditional content\nrecommendations are oblivious to network conditions, the paradigm of\nNetwork-Friendly Recommendations (NFR) has recently emerged, favoring content\nthat improves network performance (e.g. cached near the user), while still\nbeing appealing to the user. However, NFR algorithms sometimes achieve their\ngoal by shrinking the pool of content recommended to users. The undesirable\nside-effect is reduced content diversity, a phenomenon known as\n``content/filter bubble''. This reduced diversity is problematic for both\nusers, who are prevented from exploring a broader range of content, and content\ncreators (e.g. YouTubers) whose content may be recommended less frequently,\nleading to perceived unfairness. In this paper, we first investigate - using\nreal data and state-of-the-art NFR schemes - the extent of this phenomenon. We\nthen formulate a ``Diverse-NFR'' optimization problem (i.e., network-friendly\nrecommendations with - sufficient - content diversity), and through a series of\ntransformation steps, we manage to reduce it to a linear program that can be\nsolved fast and optimally.

Their workloads may be diverse, ranging from online\ntransaction processing to analytics and decision support. The cloud\ninfrastructure enables disaggregation of monolithic DBMSs into components that\nfacilitate software-hardware co-design. This is realized using pools of\nhardware resources, i.e., CPUs, GPUs, memory, FPGA, NVM, etc., connected using\nhigh-speed networks. This disaggregation trend is being adopted by cloud DBMSs\nbecause hardware re-provisioning can be achieved by simply invoking software\nAPIs. Disaggregated DBMSs separate processing from storage, enabling each to\nscale elastically and independently. They may disaggregate compute usage based\non functionality, e.g., compute needed for writes from compute needed for\nqueries and compute needed for compaction. They may also use disaggregated\nmemory, e.g., for intermediate results in a shuffle or for remote caching. The\nDBMS monitors the characteristics of a workload and dynamically assembles its\ncomponents that are most efficient and cost effective for the workload. This\npaper is a summary of a panel session that discussed the capability,\nchallenges, and opportunities of these emerging DBMSs and disaggregated\nhardware systems.",

                    "value": "Modern applications demand high performance and cost efficient database\nmanagement systems (DBMSs). Their workloads may be diverse, ranging from online\ntransaction processing to analytics and decision support. The cloud\ninfrastructure enables disaggregation of monolithic DBMSs into components that\nfacilitate software-hardware co-design. This is realized using pools of\nhardware resources, i.e., CPUs, GPUs, memory, FPGA, NVM, etc., connected using\nhigh-speed networks. This disaggregation trend is being adopted by cloud DBMSs\nbecause hardware re-provisioning can be achieved by simply invoking software\nAPIs. Disaggregated DBMSs separate processing from storage, enabling each to\nscale elastically and independently. They may disaggregate compute usage based\non functionality, e.g., compute needed for writes from compute needed for\nqueries and compute needed for compaction. They may also use disaggregated\nmemory, e.g., for intermediate results in a shuffle or for remote caching. The\nDBMS monitors the characteristics of a workload and dynamically assembles its\ncomponents that are most efficient and cost effective for the workload. This\npaper is a summary of a panel session that discussed the capability,\nchallenges, and opportunities of these emerging DBMSs and disaggregated\nhardware systems."

Self-attention requires the key-value (KV)\ncache of all previous sequences to be retrieved from memory at every decoding\nstep to retrieve context information, leading to two primary bottlenecks during\nbatch inference. First, there is a significant delay in obtaining the first\ntoken, as the information of the entire prompt must first be processed to\nprefill the KV cache. Second, computation of subsequent tokens is bottlenecked\nby the high memory I/O demand of fetching the entire KV cache, which grows\nlinearly with sequence length, incurring quadratic memory reads overall. We\ndesign the Block Transformer to strategically mitigate these costs, by\nincorporating coarsity and locality into an integrated global-to-local\narchitecture.

The key-value (KV) cache mechanism reduces computational\noverhead in transformer models, but challenges in maintaining contextual\nunderstanding remain. In this paper, we propose BUZZ, a novel KV caching\nalgorithm that leverages structured contextual information to minimize cache\nmemory usage while enhancing inference speed. BUZZ employs a beehive-structured\nsparse cache, incorporating a sliding window to capture recent information and\ndynamically segmenting historical tokens into chunks to prioritize important\ntokens in local neighborhoods. We evaluate BUZZ on four real-world datasets:\nCNN/Daily Mail, XSUM, Wikitext, and 10-QA. Our results demonstrate that BUZZ\n(1) reduces cache memory usage by $\\textbf{2.5}\\times$ in LLM inference while\nmaintaining over 99% accuracy in long-text summarization, and (2) surpasses\nstate-of-the-art performance in multi-document question answering by\n$\\textbf{7.69%}$ under the same memory limit, where full cache methods\nencounter out-of-memory issues.

To assess the impact of space weather on the\npower grid, one needs to calculate the GIC on a national or continental scale.\nIn this study, we developed a smart and parallelized GIC modelling algorithm,\nGraph GIC. This algorithm deploys a graph representing a power grid in a\nsingle-line diagram, in which substations/transformers act as nodes and\ntransmission lines as edges. With these denotations, a power grid and its\nelectric parameters are mathematically represented with an adjacency matrix and\nan admittance matrix. We used sparse matrix and parallelisation techniques to\nexpedite the intensive computation in cases of large-scale power grids. The\nGraph GIC was validated with a benchmark grid, applied to the GIC calculation\nof the 500 kV power grid of Guangdong, China, and conducted preliminary\nanalysis on the grid's susceptibility to geomagnetic storms. The Graph GIC\nalgorithm has the advantage of an intuitive and highly scalable graph\nrepresentation of a power grid at any scale. It achieves high-accuracy\ncalculation and a speedup of about 18 times after parallelisation. This\nalgorithm could be applied to assess the impact of space weather on a power\ngrid up to continental scales and could be incorporated into global space\nweather modelling frameworks.",

Based on the recognized\nstructure, we then construct the KV cache in an adaptive manner: evicting\nlong-range contexts on attention heads emphasizing local contexts, discarding\nnon-special tokens on attention heads centered on special tokens, and only\nemploying the standard KV cache for attention heads that broadly attend to all\ntokens. Moreover, with the lightweight attention profiling used to guide the\nconstruction of the adaptive KV cache, FastGen can be deployed without\nresource-intensive fine-tuning or re-training. In our experiments across\nvarious asks, FastGen demonstrates substantial reduction on GPU memory\nconsumption with negligible generation quality loss. We will release our code\nand the compatible CUDA kernel for reproducibility.",

Based on the recognized\nstructure, we then construct the KV cache in an adaptive manner: evicting\nlong-range contexts on attention heads emphasizing local contexts, discarding\nnon-special tokens on attention heads centered on special tokens, and only\nemploying the standard KV cache for attention heads that broadly attend to all\ntokens. Moreover, with the lightweight attention profiling used to guide the\nconstruction of the adaptive KV cache, FastGen can be deployed without\nresource-intensive fine-tuning or re-training. In our experiments across\nvarious asks, FastGen demonstrates substantial reduction on GPU memory\nconsumption with negligible generation quality loss. We will release our code\nand the compatible CUDA kernel for reproducibility."

To address these issues, we propose a\ntraining-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition\n(ASVD). Specifically, ASVD manages activation outliers by transforming the\nweight matrix based on the activation distribution. This transformation allows\nthe outliers in the activation matrix to be absorbed into the transformed\nweight matrix, thereby enhancing decomposition accuracy. Additionally, we\npropose an efficient iterative calibration process to optimize layer-specific\ndecomposition by addressing the varying sensitivity of different LLM layers. In\nthis way, ASVD can compress a network by 10%-30%. Based on the success of the\nlow-rank decomposition of projection matrices in the self-attention module, we\nfurther introduce ASVD to compress the KV cache.

The median volume variation is a contraction of a factor of a few\nfor the 4D posteriors and a contraction of 20 to 30 % in the case of the\nmarginalized 1D posteriors. This shows that our approach is a possible\nalternative to looking for sufficient statistics in the theoretical sense."

However, incorporating perceptual signals often introduces\nadditional disturbances to the system, potentially reducing its robustness,\ngeneralizability, and efficiency. This paper presents the Perceptive Internal\nModel (PIM), which relies on onboard, continuously updated elevation maps\ncentered around the robot to perceive its surroundings. We train the policy\nusing ground-truth obstacle heights surrounding the robot in simulation,\noptimizing it based on the Hybrid Internal Model (HIM), and perform inference\nwith heights sampled from the constructed elevation map. Unlike previous\nmethods that directly encode depth maps or raw point clouds, our approach\nallows the robot to perceive the terrain beneath its feet clearly and is less\naffected by camera movement or noise. Furthermore, since depth map rendering is\nnot required in simulation, our method introduces minimal additional\ncomputational costs and can train the policy in 3 hours on an RTX 4090 GPU. We\nverify the effectiveness of our method across various humanoid robots, various\nindoor and outdoor terrains, stairs, and various sensor configurations. Our\nmethod can enable a humanoid robot to continuously climb stairs and has the\npotential to serve as a foundational algorithm for the development of future\nhumanoid control methods.",

                    "value": "In contrast to quadruped robots that can navigate diverse terrains using a\n\"blind\" policy, humanoid robots require accurate perception for stable\nlocomotion due to their high degrees of freedom and inherently unstable\nmorphology. However, incorporating perceptual signals often introduces\nadditional disturbances to the system, potentially reducing its robustness,\ngeneralizability, and efficiency. This paper presents the Perceptive Internal\nModel (PIM), which relies on onboard, continuously updated elevation maps\ncentered around the robot to perceive its surroundings. We train the policy\nusing ground-truth obstacle heights surrounding the robot in simulation,\noptimizing it based on the Hybrid Internal Model (HIM), and perform inference\nwith heights sampled from the constructed elevation map. Unlike previous\nmethods that directly encode depth maps or raw point clouds, our approach\nallows the robot to perceive the terrain beneath its feet clearly and is less\naffected by camera movement or noise. Furthermore, since depth map rendering is\nnot required in simulation, our method introduces minimal additional\ncomputational costs and can train the policy in 3 hours on an RTX 4090 GPU. We\nverify the effectiveness of our method across various humanoid robots, various\nindoor and outdoor terrains, stairs, and various sensor configurations. Our\nmethod can enable a humanoid robot to continuously climb stairs and has the\npotential to serve as a foundational algorithm for the development of future\nhumanoid control methods."

A common approach is to write the model in a probabilistic programming\nlanguage and then sample via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). However, there are\nmany ways a user can transform a model that make inference more or less\nefficient. In particular, marginalizing some variables can greatly improve\ninference but is difficult for users to do manually. We develop an algorithm to\neasily marginalize random effects in LMMs. A naive approach introduces cubic\ntime operations within an inference algorithm like HMC, but we reduce the\nrunning time to linear using fast linear algebra techniques.

A common approach is to write the model in a probabilistic programming\nlanguage and then sample via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). However, there are\nmany ways a user can transform a model that make inference more or less\nefficient. In particular, marginalizing some variables can greatly improve\ninference but is difficult for users to do manually. We develop an algorithm to\neasily marginalize random effects in LMMs. A naive approach introduces cubic\ntime operations within an inference algorithm like HMC, but we reduce the\nrunning time to linear using fast linear algebra techniques. We show that\nmarginalization is always beneficial when applicable and highlight improvements\nin various models, especially ones from cognitive sciences."

This represents a significant improvement over the basic\nrepetition protocols without using global entanglement, where the error decays\nat a slower rate of $\\mathcal{O}(m^{-1})$."

The learned\ninference bias due to short-term dependency of text data. Therefore, we propose\nLACING, a systemic framework designed to address the language bias of LVLMs\nwith muLtimodal duAl-attention meChanIsm (MDA) aNd soft-image Guidance (IFG).\nSpecifically, MDA introduces a parallel dual-attention mechanism that enhances\nthe integration of visual inputs across the model. IFG introduces a learnable\nsoft visual prompt during training and inference to replace visual inputs,\ndesigned to compel LVLMs to prioritize text inputs. Then, IFG further proposes\na novel decoding strategy using the soft visual prompt to mitigate the model's\nover-reliance on adjacent text inputs. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our method effectively debiases LVLMs from their language bias, enhancing\nvisual comprehension and reducing hallucinations without requiring additional\ntraining resources or data.

Tasks are expressed in natural language (NL), requiring the robots to\napply their capabilities at various locations and semantic objects. Several\nrecent works have addressed similar planning problems by leveraging pre-trained\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to design effective multi-robot plans. However,\nthese approaches lack performance guarantees. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce a new distributed LLM-based planner, called S-ATLAS for Safe plAnning\nfor Teams of Language-instructed AgentS, that is capable of achieving\nuser-defined mission success rates. This is accomplished by leveraging\nconformal prediction (CP), a distribution-free uncertainty quantification tool\nin black-box models. CP allows the proposed multi-robot planner to reason about\nits inherent uncertainty in a distributed fashion, enabling robots to make\nindividual decisions when they are sufficiently certain and seek help\notherwise. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that the proposed\nplanner can achieve user-specified task success rates, assuming successful plan\nexecution, while minimizing the overall number of help requests. We provide\ncomparative experiments against related works showing that our method is\nsignificantly more computational efficient and achieves lower help rates. The\nadvantage of our algorithm over baselines becomes more pronounced with\nincreasing robot team size.",

Tasks are expressed in natural language (NL), requiring the robots to\napply their capabilities at various locations and semantic objects. Several\nrecent works have addressed similar planning problems by leveraging pre-trained\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to design effective multi-robot plans. However,\nthese approaches lack performance guarantees. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce a new distributed LLM-based planner, called S-ATLAS for Safe plAnning\nfor Teams of Language-instructed AgentS, that is capable of achieving\nuser-defined mission success rates. This is accomplished by leveraging\nconformal prediction (CP), a distribution-free uncertainty quantification tool\nin black-box models. CP allows the proposed multi-robot planner to reason about\nits inherent uncertainty in a distributed fashion, enabling robots to make\nindividual decisions when they are sufficiently certain and seek help\notherwise. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that the proposed\nplanner can achieve user-specified task success rates, assuming successful plan\nexecution, while minimizing the overall number of help requests. We provide\ncomparative experiments against related works showing that our method is\nsignificantly more computational efficient and achieves lower help rates. The\nadvantage of our algorithm over baselines becomes more pronounced with\nincreasing robot team size."

To reduce temporal bias on static voxels, we design\ntemporal decoupling to improve end-to-end OCF by temporally associating\ninstances via predicted flows. We develop an efficient multi-head network\nEfficientOCF to achieve 3D OCF with our devised spatiotemporally decoupled\nrepresentation. A new metric, conditional IoU (C-IoU), is also introduced to\nprovide a robust 3D OCF performance assessment, especially in datasets with\nmissing or incomplete annotations. The experimental results demonstrate that\nEfficientOCF surpasses existing baseline methods on accuracy and efficiency,\nachieving state-of-the-art performance with a fast inference time of 82.33ms\nwith a single GPU. Our code will be released as open source."

Moreover,\ncompared to existing diffusion models, it is more user-friendly and can\ncomplete complex tasks end-to-end through instructions without the need for\nextra intermediate steps, greatly simplifying the image generation workflow. 3)\nKnowledge Transfer: Benefit from learning in a unified format, OmniGen\neffectively transfers knowledge across different tasks, manages unseen tasks\nand domains, and exhibits novel capabilities. We also explore the model's\nreasoning capabilities and potential applications of the chain-of-thought\nmechanism.

Using GPT-4, we automatically annotate more than 18k further instances\n(with a cost of around 500 Euro) across 155 years and find that solidarity with\nmigrants outweighs anti-solidarity but that frequencies and solidarity types\nshift over time. Most importantly, group-based notions of (anti-)solidarity\nfade in favor of compassionate solidarity, focusing on the vulnerability of\nmigrant groups, and exchange-based anti-solidarity, focusing on the lack of\n(economic) contribution. Our study highlights the interplay of historical\nevents, socio-economic needs, and political ideologies in shaping migration\ndiscourse and social cohesion.

Labeling multiple classes (i.e., organs) in a surgical\nscene is time-intensive, requiring medical experts. Although synthetically\ngenerated images can enhance segmentation performance, maintaining both organ\nstructure and texture during generation is challenging. We introduce a\nmulti-stage approach using diffusion models to generate multi-class surgical\ndatasets with annotations.

This versatile approach allows\nthe generation of multi-class datasets from real binary datasets and simulated\nsurgical masks.

Recent efforts\nhave explored reasonable acceleration schemes by reducing the number of\nsampling steps.

To address this\nlimitation, we propose PatchScaler, an efficient patch-independent diffusion\npipeline for single image super-resolution. Specifically, PatchScaler\nintroduces a Patch-adaptive Group Sampling (PGS) strategy that groups feature\npatches by quantifying their reconstruction difficulty and establishes shortcut\npaths with different sampling configurations for each group. To further\noptimize the patch-level reconstruction process of PGS, we propose a texture\nprompt that provides rich texture conditional information to the diffusion\nmodel. The texture prompt adaptively retrieves texture priors for the target\npatch from a common reference texture memory.

We find that (3) Porter Stemmer and Snowball Stemmer\nperform better than Lancaster Stemmer; and that (4) Part-of-Speech (POS)\nTagging does not help Lemmatisation. To repair less effective Stop Words\nRemoval and Stemming/Lemmatisation used in OM tasks, we propose a novel\ncontext-based pipeline repair approach that significantly improves matching\ncorrectness and overall matching performance. We also discuss the use of text\npreprocessing pipeline in the new era of large language models (LLMs)."

This paper proposes a novel\nspeech-text multimodal LLM architecture called Freeze-Omni. Our main\ncontribution is that the speech input and output modalities can be easily\nconnected to a textual LLM while keeping the LLM's parameters frozen throughout\nthe training process. We design a three-stage training strategy for modeling\nboth the speech input and output, enabling Freeze-Omni to obtain\nspeech-to-speech conversation ability using text-speech paired data (such as\nASR and TTS data) and only 60,000 multi-round text Q&A data on 8 GPUs.\nMoreover, we can effectively ensure that the intelligence of the Freeze-Omni in\nthe speech modality is at the same level compared with that in the text\nmodality of its backbone LLM, while achieving low latency end-to-end spoken\nresponse. In addition, we also designed a method to achieve duplex dialogue\nability through multi-task training, giving Freeze-Omni a more natural style of\ndialogue ability between users and agents.

While numerous approaches have been\nproposed for this task, they primarily address common, widespread errors and\nstruggle to adapt to unique, evolving errors specific to individual code\nrepositories. To fill this gap, we propose EvoCoder, a multi-agent continuous\nlearning framework for issue code reproduction.

We evaluate the\neffectiveness of PIORS and SFMSS through automatic and human assessments\ninvolving 15 users and 15 clinical experts. The results demonstrate that\nPIORS-Nurse outperforms all baselines, including the current state-of-the-art\nmodel GPT-4o, and aligns with human preferences and clinical needs.

As attackers\nexploit LLMs to craft more convincing and evasive phishing emails, it is\ncrucial to assess the resilience of current phishing defenses. In this study we\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation of traditional phishing detectors, such as\nGmail Spam Filter, Apache SpamAssassin, and Proofpoint, as well as machine\nlearning models like SVM, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes, in identifying\nboth traditional and LLM-rephrased phishing emails. We also explore the\nemerging role of LLMs as phishing detection tools, a method already adopted by\ncompanies like NTT Security Holdings and JPMorgan Chase. Our results reveal\nnotable declines in detection accuracy for rephrased emails across all\ndetectors, highlighting critical weaknesses in current phishing defenses.

                    "value": "The escalating threat of phishing emails has become increasingly\nsophisticated with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs). As attackers\nexploit LLMs to craft more convincing and evasive phishing emails, it is\ncrucial to assess the resilience of current phishing defenses. In this study we\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation of traditional phishing detectors, such as\nGmail Spam Filter, Apache SpamAssassin, and Proofpoint, as well as machine\nlearning models like SVM, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes, in identifying\nboth traditional and LLM-rephrased phishing emails. We also explore the\nemerging role of LLMs as phishing detection tools, a method already adopted by\ncompanies like NTT Security Holdings and JPMorgan Chase. Our results reveal\nnotable declines in detection accuracy for rephrased emails across all\ndetectors, highlighting critical weaknesses in current phishing defenses.

In this\npaper, we present Insight-V, an early effort to 1) scalably produce long and\nrobust reasoning data for complex multi-modal tasks, and 2) an effective\ntraining pipeline to enhance the reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs). Specifically, to create long and structured reasoning\ndata without human labor, we design a two-step pipeline with a progressive\nstrategy to generate sufficiently long and diverse reasoning paths and a\nmulti-granularity assessment method to ensure data quality.

To tackle this problem, we design a multi-agent\nsystem consisting of a reasoning agent dedicated to performing long-chain\nreasoning and a summary agent trained to judge and summarize reasoning results.\nWe further incorporate an iterative DPO algorithm to enhance the reasoning\nagent's generation stability and quality. Based on the popular LLaVA-NeXT model\nand our stronger base MLLM, we demonstrate significant performance gains across\nchallenging multi-modal benchmarks requiring visual reasoning.

Recently, large language\nmodels (LLMs) have been applied to enhance the generalization capabilities of\nend-to-end driving models.

This paper proposes an efficient architecture that integrates\nmultimodal LLMs into end-to-end driving models operating in closed-loop\nsettings in real-world environments. In our architecture, the LLM periodically\nprocesses raw sensor data to generate high-level driving instructions,\neffectively guiding the end-to-end model, even at a slower rate than the raw\nsensor data.

For each\ndomain we test humans and GPT models on robustness to variants of the original\nanalogy problems that test the same abstract reasoning abilities but are likely\ndissimilar from tasks in the pre-training data. The performance of a system\nthat uses robust abstract reasoning should not decline substantially on these\nvariants.\n  On simple letter-string analogies, we find that while the performance of\nhumans remains high for two types of variants we tested, the GPT models'\nperformance declines sharply. This pattern is less pronounced as the complexity\nof these problems is increased, as both humans and GPT models perform poorly on\nboth the original and variant problems requiring more complex analogies. On\ndigit-matrix problems, we find a similar pattern but only on one out of the two\ntypes of variants we tested. On story-based analogy problems, we find that,\nunlike humans, the performance of GPT models are susceptible to answer-order\neffects, and that GPT models also may be more sensitive than humans to\nparaphrasing.\n  This work provides evidence that LLMs often lack the robustness of zero-shot\nhuman analogy-making, exhibiting brittleness on most of the variations we\ntested.

Although existing LVLMs have achieved\nsignificant success, their inference efficiency is still limited by the\nsubstantial number of visual tokens and the potential redundancy among them. To\nmitigate this issue, we propose Focal Pruning (FoPru), a training-free method\nthat prunes visual tokens based on the attention-based token significance\nderived from the vision encoder. Specifically, we introduce two alternative\npruning strategies: 1) the rank strategy, which leverages all token\nsignificance scores to retain more critical tokens in a global view; 2) the row\nstrategy, which focuses on preserving continuous key information in images from\na local perspective. Finally, the selected tokens are reordered to maintain\ntheir original positional relationships. Extensive experiments across various\nLVLMs and multimodal datasets demonstrate that our method can prune a large\nnumber of redundant tokens while maintaining high accuracy, leading to\nsignificant improvements in inference efficiency.",

However, the lack of\nstandardisation in text preprocessing creates diversity in mapping results. In\nthis paper, we investigate the effect of the text preprocessing pipeline on OM\ntasks at syntactic levels. Our experiments on 8 Ontology Alignment Evaluation\nInitiative (OAEI) track repositories with 49 distinct alignments indicate: (1)\nTokenisation and Normalisation are currently more effective than Stop Words\nRemoval and Stemming/Lemmatisation; and (2) The selection of Lemmatisation and\nStemming is task-specific. We recommend standalone Lemmatisation or Stemming\nwith post-hoc corrections. We find that (3) Porter Stemmer and Snowball Stemmer\nperform better than Lancaster Stemmer; and that (4) Part-of-Speech (POS)\nTagging does not help Lemmatisation.

                    "value": "The generic text preprocessing pipeline, comprising Tokenisation,\nNormalisation, Stop Words Removal, and Stemming/Lemmatisation, has been\nimplemented in many ontology matching (OM) systems. However, the lack of\nstandardisation in text preprocessing creates diversity in mapping results. In\nthis paper, we investigate the effect of the text preprocessing pipeline on OM\ntasks at syntactic levels. Our experiments on 8 Ontology Alignment Evaluation\nInitiative (OAEI) track repositories with 49 distinct alignments indicate: (1)\nTokenisation and Normalisation are currently more effective than Stop Words\nRemoval and Stemming/Lemmatisation; and (2) The selection of Lemmatisation and\nStemming is task-specific. We recommend standalone Lemmatisation or Stemming\nwith post-hoc corrections. We find that (3) Porter Stemmer and Snowball Stemmer\nperform better than Lancaster Stemmer; and that (4) Part-of-Speech (POS)\nTagging does not help Lemmatisation. To repair less effective Stop Words\nRemoval and Stemming/Lemmatisation used in OM tasks, we propose a novel\ncontext-based pipeline repair approach that significantly improves matching\ncorrectness and overall matching performance.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of EMI and phase errors\non STAR-RIS-assisted cell-free massive MIMO systems and propose techniques to\nmitigate these effects. We introduce a novel projected gradient descent (GD)\nalgorithm for STAR-RIS coefficient matrix design by minimizing the local\nchannel estimation normalised mean square error.

The results reveal that the\nprojected GD algorithm can effectively tackle EMI and phase errors to improve\nestimation accuracy and compensate for performance degradation with nearly\n$10\\%\\sim20\\%$ SE improvement. Moreover, increasing access points (APs),\nantennas per AP, and STAR-RIS elements can also improve SE performance.\nApplying STAR-RIS in the proposed system achieves a larger $25\\%$-likely SE\nthan conventional RISs.

However, these evaluations typically focus on simple,\nfunction-level translations without considering dependencies, which does not\nreflect the complexities of real-world software development. Further, their\neffectiveness in translating to newer, lower-resource languages like Rust in\nrealistic scenarios is still under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce\nfirst repository-level code translation benchmark comprising 375 tasks\ntargeting Rust, complete with relevant dependencies. Using this benchmark, we\nstudy four state-of-the-art LLMs, analyzing their erroneous outputs to\nunderstand their performance in more complex translation scenarios. Our\nfindings reveal that LLMs exhibit substantially worse performance (41.5%-56.2%\nPass@1 drop of GPT-4) on repository-level translations compared to simpler\ntasks, highlighting limitations in existing evaluation methods. The model that\nperformed the best is Claude-3.5, demonstrating the strongest translation\ncapabilities in both basic functionality accuracy and several relevant\nadditional abilities. Additionally, we discover that LLMs struggle with\nidentifying language differences in complex tasks, and that increased\ndependencies correlate with greater translation difficulty.",

However, these evaluations typically focus on simple,\nfunction-level translations without considering dependencies, which does not\nreflect the complexities of real-world software development. Further, their\neffectiveness in translating to newer, lower-resource languages like Rust in\nrealistic scenarios is still under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce\nfirst repository-level code translation benchmark comprising 375 tasks\ntargeting Rust, complete with relevant dependencies. Using this benchmark, we\nstudy four state-of-the-art LLMs, analyzing their erroneous outputs to\nunderstand their performance in more complex translation scenarios. Our\nfindings reveal that LLMs exhibit substantially worse performance (41.5%-56.2%\nPass@1 drop of GPT-4) on repository-level translations compared to simpler\ntasks, highlighting limitations in existing evaluation methods. The model that\nperformed the best is Claude-3.5, demonstrating the strongest translation\ncapabilities in both basic functionality accuracy and several relevant\nadditional abilities. Additionally, we discover that LLMs struggle with\nidentifying language differences in complex tasks, and that increased\ndependencies correlate with greater translation difficulty."

In this paper, we present the Personalized\nIntelligent Outpatient Reception System (PIORS). This system integrates an\nLLM-based reception nurse and a collaboration between LLM and hospital\ninformation system (HIS) into real outpatient reception setting, aiming to\ndeliver personalized, high-quality, and efficient reception services.\nAdditionally, to enhance the performance of LLMs in real-world healthcare\nscenarios, we propose a medical conversational data generation framework named\nService Flow aware Medical Scenario Simulation (SFMSS), aiming to adapt the LLM\nto the real-world environments and PIORS settings. We evaluate the\neffectiveness of PIORS and SFMSS through automatic and human assessments\ninvolving 15 users and 15 clinical experts. The results demonstrate that\nPIORS-Nurse outperforms all baselines, including the current state-of-the-art\nmodel GPT-4o, and aligns with human preferences and clinical needs.

                    "value": "In China, receptionist nurses face overwhelming workloads in outpatient\nsettings, limiting their time and attention for each patient and ultimately\nreducing service quality. In this paper, we present the Personalized\nIntelligent Outpatient Reception System (PIORS). This system integrates an\nLLM-based reception nurse and a collaboration between LLM and hospital\ninformation system (HIS) into real outpatient reception setting, aiming to\ndeliver personalized, high-quality, and efficient reception services.\nAdditionally, to enhance the performance of LLMs in real-world healthcare\nscenarios, we propose a medical conversational data generation framework named\nService Flow aware Medical Scenario Simulation (SFMSS), aiming to adapt the LLM\nto the real-world environments and PIORS settings. We evaluate the\neffectiveness of PIORS and SFMSS through automatic and human assessments\ninvolving 15 users and 15 clinical experts. The results demonstrate that\nPIORS-Nurse outperforms all baselines, including the current state-of-the-art\nmodel GPT-4o, and aligns with human preferences and clinical needs.

However, the\ncomplex structures and numerous model parameters of GMs make the input-output\nprocesses opaque, complicating the understanding and control of outputs.\nMoreover, the purely data-driven learning mechanism limits GM's ability to\nacquire broader knowledge.

We propose a novel Generative\nFuzzy System framework, named GenFS, which integrates the deep learning\ncapabilities of GM with the interpretability and dual-driven mechanisms of\nfuzzy systems. Specifically, we propose an end-to-end GenFS-based model for\nsequence generation, called FuzzyS2S.

                "summary": "Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) under resource constraints is a\nsignificant challenge in deep learning. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), pruning,\nand quantization are all effective methods for improving resource efficiency.\nHowever, combining them directly often results in suboptimal performance,\nespecially with uniform quantization across all model layers. This is due to\nthe complex, uneven interlayer relationships introduced by pruning,\nnecessitating more refined quantization strategies. To address this, we propose\nAutoMixQ, an end-to-end optimization framework that selects optimal\nquantization configurations for each LLM layer. AutoMixQ leverages lightweight\nperformance models to guide the selection process, significantly reducing time\nand computational resources compared to exhaustive search methods.

                    "value": "Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) under resource constraints is a\nsignificant challenge in deep learning. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), pruning,\nand quantization are all effective methods for improving resource efficiency.\nHowever, combining them directly often results in suboptimal performance,\nespecially with uniform quantization across all model layers. This is due to\nthe complex, uneven interlayer relationships introduced by pruning,\nnecessitating more refined quantization strategies. To address this, we propose\nAutoMixQ, an end-to-end optimization framework that selects optimal\nquantization configurations for each LLM layer. AutoMixQ leverages lightweight\nperformance models to guide the selection process, significantly reducing time\nand computational resources compared to exhaustive search methods.

SemiKong, the first industry-specific\nLLM for the semiconductor domain, provides a foundation that can be used to\ndevelop tailored proprietary models. With SemiKong 1.0, we aim to develop a\nfoundational model capable of understanding etching problems at an expert\nlevel. Our key contributions include (a) curating a comprehensive corpus of\nsemiconductor-related texts, (b) creating a foundational model with in-depth\nsemiconductor knowledge, and (c) introducing a framework for integrating expert\nknowledge, thereby advancing the evaluation process of domain-specific AI\nmodels. Through fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM using our curated dataset, we\nhave shown that SemiKong outperforms larger, general-purpose LLMs in various\nsemiconductor manufacturing and design tasks. Our extensive experiments\nunderscore the importance of developing domain-specific LLMs as a foundation\nfor company- or tool-specific proprietary models, paving the way for further\nresearch and applications in the semiconductor domain.

Traditional display advertising systems utilize a multi-stage\narchitecture consisting of retrieval, coarse ranking, and final ranking.\nHowever, conventional retrieval methods rely on ID-based learning to rank\nmechanisms and fail to adequately utilize the content information of ads, which\nhampers their ability to provide diverse recommendation lists.\n  To address this limitation, we propose leveraging the extensive world\nknowledge of LLMs. However, three key challenges arise when attempting to\nmaximize the effectiveness of LLMs: \"How to capture user interests\", \"How to\nbridge the knowledge gap between LLMs and advertising system\", and \"How to\nefficiently deploy LLMs\". To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel\nLLM-based framework called LLM Empowered Display ADvertisement REcommender\nsystem (LEADRE). LEADRE consists of three core modules: (1) The Intent-Aware\nPrompt Engineering introduces multi-faceted knowledge and designs intent-aware\n<Prompt, Response> pairs that fine-tune LLMs to generate ads tailored to users'\npersonal interests. (2) The Advertising-Specific Knowledge Alignment\nincorporates auxiliary fine-tuning tasks and Direct Preference Optimization\n(DPO) to align LLMs with ad semantic and business value. (3) The Efficient\nSystem Deployment deploys LEADRE in an online environment by integrating both\nlatency-tolerant and latency-sensitive service. Extensive offline experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of LEADRE and validate the contributions of\nindividual modules. Online A/B test shows that LEADRE leads to a 1.57% and\n1.17% GMV lift for serviced users on WeChat Channels and Moments separately.\nLEADRE has been deployed on both platforms, serving tens of billions of\nrequests each day.",

To address the\nabove issues, we propose TransLinkGuard, a plug-and-play model protection\napproach against model stealing on edge devices. The core part of\nTransLinkGuard is a lightweight authorization module residing in a secure\nenvironment, e.g., TEE. The authorization module can freshly authorize each\nrequest based on its input.

To address this gap, we focus on journalistic interviews, a\ndomain rich in grounding communication and abundant in data. We curate a\ndataset of 40,000 two-person informational interviews from NPR and CNN, and\nreveal that LLMs are significantly less likely than human interviewers to use\nacknowledgements and to pivot to higher-level questions.

Identifying critical\nparameters for BFAs in the vast parameter space of LLMs poses significant\nchallenges.
