A production T2I service typically\ninvolves a serving workflow where a base diffusion model is augmented with\nvarious \"add-on\" modules, notably ControlNet and LoRA, to enhance image\ngeneration control. Compared to serving the base model alone, these add-on\nmodules introduce significant loading and computational overhead, resulting in\nincreased latency. In this paper, we present SwiftDiffusion, a system that\nefficiently serves a T2I workflow through a holistic approach. SwiftDiffusion\ndecouples ControNet from the base model and deploys it as a separate,\nindependently scaled service on dedicated GPUs, enabling ControlNet caching,\nparallelization, and sharing. To mitigate the high loading overhead of LoRA\nserving, SwiftDiffusion employs a bounded asynchronous LoRA loading (BAL)\ntechnique, allowing LoRA loading to overlap with the initial base model\nexecution by up to k steps without compromising image quality. Furthermore,\nSwiftDiffusion optimizes base model execution with a novel latent parallelism\ntechnique. Collectively, these designs enable SwiftDiffusion to outperform the\nstate-of-the-art T2I serving systems, achieving up to 7.8x latency reduction\nand 1.6x throughput improvement in serving SDXL models on H800 GPUs, without\nsacrificing image quality.",

The one-hop\nnavigation is from a vertex using either its in-coming or out-going edges with\nselection predicates that filter edges and vertices. Its cache entry identifies\na unique one-hop sub-query (key) and its result set consisting of immutable\nvertex ids (value). When processing a gR-Tx, the query processor identifies its\nsequence of individual one-hop sub-queries and looks up their results in the\ncache. A cache hit fetches less data from the storage manager and eliminates\nthe requirement to process the one-hop sub-query. A cache miss populates the\ncache asynchronously and in a transactional manner, maintaining the separation\nof read and write paths of our transactional storage manager. A graph read and\nwrite transaction, gRW-Tx, identifies the impacted cache entries and either\ndeletes or updates them. Our implementation of the cache is inside the graph\nquery processing engine and transparent to a user application. We evaluate the\ncache using our eCommerce production workload and with rules that re-write\ngraph queries to maximize the performance enhancements observed with the cache.\nObtained results show the cache enhances 95th and 99th percentile of query\nresponse times by at least 2x and 1.63x, respectively. When combined with query\nre-writing, the enhancements are at least 2.33x and 4.48x, respectively. An\ninteresting result is the significant performance enhancement observed by the\nindirect beneficiaries of the cache, gRW-Txs and gR-Txs that do not reference\none-hop sub-queries.

The majority of computation stems from the\noverwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer decoder. In\nthis paper, we propose to build efficient MLLMs by leveraging the\nMixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each transformer decoder layer selects\nessential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant ones. However,\nintegrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the challenges of\ntraining and inference stability as well as limited training data, we adapt the\nMoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight normalization (TanhNorm)\nand symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we observe that vision\ntokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layer and thus design a progressive\nratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the token retention ratio\nlayer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This crucial design fully\nunleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the efficiency and\nperformance of our models. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we\nconduct extensive experiments with two baseline models across 14 benchmarks.\nOur model, p-MoD, matches or even surpasses the performance of the baseline\nmodels, with only 55.6% TFLOPs and 53.8% KV cache storage during inference, and\n77.7% GPU hours during training.",

To address this, two critical steps are often required: a\npretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length\nextension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural\nmodifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper\nargues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction\narchitecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but\nalso achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed\nLongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during\nlength extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention\npatterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink\n(initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are\nwell-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their\nGPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just\ntheoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to\nhave direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention\nlayers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency\nand long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data\nis sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.\n  We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its\neffectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts,\nLongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%,\ncompared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV\ncache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding\nspeedup.",

Existing KV cache compression methods,\nincluding quantization and pruning, struggle with limitations such as uniform\ntreatment of keys and values and static memory allocation across attention\nheads. To address these challenges, we introduce LeanKV, a unified KV cache\ncompression framework that enhances LLM serving efficiency without compromising\naccuracy through three innovations: (1) Hetero-KV quantization, which stores\nkeys at a higher precision than values to reflect their greater impact on\nattention computations; (2) per-head dynamic sparsity, which allocates memory\nbased on token importance per head and per request; and (3) unified KV\ncompression, integrating mixed-precision quantization and selective pruning to\nenable a smooth tradeoff between model accuracy and memory efficiency. To\nefficiently support these techniques, LeanKV introduces systems optimizations\nincluding unified paging and on-GPU parallel memory management. Implemented on\nvLLM, LeanKV compresses the KV cache by $3.0\\times$ to $5.0\\times$ without\naccuracy loss and up to $11.0\\times$ with under 5% accuracy loss, enhancing\nthroughput by $1.9\\times$ to $2.5\\times$, and up to $6.9\\times$.",

Meanwhile, throughout the entire generation\nprocess of MLLMs, Dynamic-LLaVA reduces the $\\sim$50\\% computation consumption\nunder decoding without KV cache, while saving $\\sim$50\\% GPU memory overhead\nwhen decoding with KV cache, due to the vision-language context sparsification.\nExtensive experiments also demonstrate that Dynamic-LLaVA achieves efficient\ninference for MLLMs with negligible understanding and generation ability\ndegradation or even performance gains compared to the full-context inference\nbaselines.

Nitrogen oxides ($\\mathrm{NO_x = NO_2 + NO}$) and\nvolatile organic compounds (VOCs), in the presence of sunlight, lead to ozone\nformation in the troposphere. When the rate of oxidant production, defined as\nthe sum of $\\mathrm{O_3}$ and $\\mathrm{NO_2}$, is faster than the rate of\n$\\mathrm{NO_x}$ production, a region is said to be $\\mathrm{NO_x}$limited, and\nozone formation will be limited by the concentration of $\\mathrm{NO_x}$ species\nin the region. The inverse of this situation makes the region VOC-limited.\nKnowing whether a region is $\\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited or VOC-limited can aid in\ngenerating effective mitigation strategies. Understanding the background or\nregional contributions to ozone in a region, whether from the transport of\nprecursors or of ozone, provides information about the lower limit for ozone\nconcentrations that a region can achieve through regulation of local\nprecursors. In this paper, measured oxidant and $\\mathrm{NO_x}$ concentrations\nare analyzed from 14 counties in the state of Utah to calculate the regional\nand local contributions to ozone for each region. This analysis is used to\ndetermine the nature of the atmosphere in each county by identifying whether\nthe region is VOC or $\\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited. Furthermore, this analysis is\nperformed for each county for the years 2012 and 2022 to assess changes in the\noxidative nature and quantify regional and local contributions to ozone over a\n10-year period. All studied counties--except for Washington County--in Utah\nwere found to be VOC-limited in 2012. This shifted in 2022, with most counties\nbeing either in a transitional state or $\\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited. Local\ncontributions to ozone increased in two major counties, Cache and Salt Lake\nCounties, but decreased in Carbon, Davis, Duchesne, Uinta, Utah, Washington,\nand Weber Counties. Generally, the regional contributions to oxidant\nconcentrations decreased across the state. A summertime spike in both regional\nand local contributions to oxidants was observed. Smoke from wildfires was\nfound to increase regional contributions to oxidants and shift the local regime\nto be more $\\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited.",

Although deeper and larger neural networks\ncan significantly improve performance, their substantial memory requirements\nhinder training on consumer GPUs. In this paper, we explore a memory-efficient\ntraining strategy for deep speaker embedding learning in resource-constrained\nscenarios. Firstly, we conduct a systematic analysis of GPU memory allocation\nduring SV system training. Empirical observations show that activations and\noptimizer states are the main sources of memory consumption. For activations,\nwe design two types of reversible neural networks which eliminate the need to\nstore intermediate activations during back-propagation, thereby significantly\nreducing memory usage without performance loss. For optimizer states, we\nintroduce a dynamic quantization approach that replaces the original 32-bit\nfloating-point values with a dynamic tree-based 8-bit data type. Experimental\nresults on VoxCeleb demonstrate that the reversible variants of ResNets and\nDF-ResNets can perform training without the need to cache activations in GPU\nmemory. In addition, the 8-bit versions of SGD and Adam save 75% of memory\ncosts while maintaining performance compared to their 32-bit counterparts.\nFinally, a detailed comparison of memory usage and performance indicates that\nour proposed models achieve up to 16.2x memory savings, with nearly identical\nparameters and performance compared to the vanilla systems. In contrast to the\nprevious need for multiple high-end GPUs such as the A100, we can effectively\ntrain deep speaker embedding extractors with just one or two consumer-level\n2080Ti GPUs.",

Experimental\nresults on VoxCeleb demonstrate that the reversible variants of ResNets and\nDF-ResNets can perform training without the need to cache activations in GPU\nmemory. In addition, the 8-bit versions of SGD and Adam save 75% of memory\ncosts while maintaining performance compared to their 32-bit counterparts.\nFinally, a detailed comparison of memory usage and performance indicates that\nour proposed models achieve up to 16.2x memory savings, with nearly identical\nparameters and performance compared to the vanilla systems. In contrast to the\nprevious need for multiple high-end GPUs such as the A100, we can effectively\ntrain deep speaker embedding extractors with just one or two consumer-level\n2080Ti GPUs."

These tasks usually show the\ncharacteristic of prefix sharing, where different prompt input can partially\nshow the common prefix. However, the existing LLM inference engines tend to\noptimize the streaming requests and show limitations of supporting the large\nbatched tasks with the prefix sharing characteristic. The existing solutions\nuse the LRU-based cache to reuse the KV context of common prefix. The KV\ncontext that is about to be reused may prematurely be evicted with the implicit\ncache management. Even if not evicted, the lifetime of the shared KV context is\nextended since requests sharing the same context are not scheduled together,\nresulting in larger memory usage. These streaming oriented systems schedule the\nrequests in the first-come-first-serve or similar order. As a result, the\nrequests with larger ratio of decoding steps may be scheduled too late to be\nable to mix with the prefill chunks to increase the hardware utilization.\nBesides, the token and request number based batching can limit the size of\ntoken-batch, which keeps the GPU from saturating for the iterations dominated\nby decoding tokens. We propose BatchLLM to address the above problems. BatchLLM\nexplicitly identifies the common prefixes globally. The requests sharing the\nsame prefix will be scheduled together to reuse the KV context the best, which\nalso shrinks the lifetime of common KV memory. BatchLLM reorders the requests\nand schedules the requests with larger ratio of decoding first to better mix\nthe decoding tokens with the latter prefill chunks and applies memory-centric\ntoken batching to enlarge the token-batch sizes, which helps to increase the\nGPU utilization.

Different from the existing\nmulti-antenna coded caching problems, we introduce a passive RIS (with limited\nnumber of units) into the systems to further increase the multicast gain (i.e.,\ndegrees of freedom (DoF)) in the transmission, which is done by using\nRIS-assisted interference nulling. That is, by using RIS, we can `erase' any\npath between one transmission antenna and one receive antenna. We first propose\na new RIS-assisted interference nulling approach to search for the phase-shift\ncoefficients of RIS for the sake of interference nulling, which converges\nfaster than the state-of-the-art algorithm. After erasing some paths in each\ntime slot, the delivery can be divided into several non-overlapping groups\nincluding transmission antennas and users, where in each group the transmission\nantennas serve the contained users without suffering interference from the\ntransmissions by other groups. The division of groups for the sake of\nmaximizing the DoF could be formulated into a combinatorial optimization\nproblem.

While still building on the ESP32 microcontroller, this\nversion improves the overall performance by switching to an SD card caching\nsystem and upgrading the analog-digital converter to an AD7606C-18, which has a\nhigher resolution, provides eight channels, oversampling, and\nsoftware-adjustable voltage ranges. Also improved is the IEPE front-end and\npower supply, as well as the firmware of the acquisition system, which can now\nachieve a sample rate of up to 36 kHz while sampling all eight channels. This\npaper documents the hardware and software of OASIS-UROS and provides all\nmaterials required to reproduce the open acquisition system. Lastly, the system\nwas validated against commercial hardware and software in an experimental modal\nanalysis context. This showed that the system performs close to the commercial\none in some aspects with respect to the utilized test case. While OASIS-UROS\ncannot match the full performance of the commercial system, the developed\nsystem can be a viable alternative for students, people in academia, or smaller\ncompanies that have a constrained budget or require complete insight as well as\nadaptability of the hardware and software.",

While still building on the ESP32 microcontroller, this\nversion improves the overall performance by switching to an SD card caching\nsystem and upgrading the analog-digital converter to an AD7606C-18, which has a\nhigher resolution, provides eight channels, oversampling, and\nsoftware-adjustable voltage ranges. Also improved is the IEPE front-end and\npower supply, as well as the firmware of the acquisition system, which can now\nachieve a sample rate of up to 36 kHz while sampling all eight channels. This\npaper documents the hardware and software of OASIS-UROS and provides all\nmaterials required to reproduce the open acquisition system. Lastly, the system\nwas validated against commercial hardware and software in an experimental modal\nanalysis context. This showed that the system performs close to the commercial\none in some aspects with respect to the utilized test case. While OASIS-UROS\ncannot match the full performance of the commercial system, the developed\nsystem can be a viable alternative for students, people in academia, or smaller\ncompanies that have a constrained budget or require complete insight as well as\nadaptability of the hardware and software."

Star Attention integrates\nseamlessly with most Transformer-based LLMs trained with global attention,\nreducing memory requirements and inference time by up to 11x while preserving\n95-100% of accuracy."

Despite the success of TGNNs, they\nare prone to the prevalent noise found in real-world dynamic graphs like\ntime-deprecated links and skewed interaction distribution. The noise causes two\ncritical issues that significantly compromise the accuracy of TGNNs: (1) models\nare supervised by inferior interactions, and (2) noisy input induces high\nvariance in the aggregated messages. However, current TGNN denoising techniques\ndo not consider the diverse and dynamic noise pattern of each node.

To alleviate the\nbottleneck in mini-batch generation, TASER implements a pure GPU-based temporal\nneighbor finder and a dedicated GPU feature cache.

We developed a pipeline comprising a trained U-Net for automatic liver\ndome region segmentation from the triggered images followed by extraction of\nthe liver dome via thresholding, edge detection, and morphological operations.\nThe performance and generalizability of the pipeline was evaluated using 2-fold\ncross validation. The training of the U-Net model for liver region segmentation\ntook under 30 minutes and the automatic delineation of a liver dome for any\ntriggered image took less than one second. The RMSE and rate of detection for\nFold1 with 366 images was (6.4 +/- 1.6) mm and 91.7%, respectively.

We developed a pipeline comprising a trained U-Net for automatic liver\ndome region segmentation from the triggered images followed by extraction of\nthe liver dome via thresholding, edge detection, and morphological operations.\nThe performance and generalizability of the pipeline was evaluated using 2-fold\ncross validation. The training of the U-Net model for liver region segmentation\ntook under 30 minutes and the automatic delineation of a liver dome for any\ntriggered image took less than one second. The RMSE and rate of detection for\nFold1 with 366 images was (6.4 +/- 1.6) mm and 91.7%, respectively. For Fold2\nwith 345 images, the RMSE and rate of detection was (7.7 +/- 2.3) mm and 76.3%\nrespectively."

This work presents a static\nanalysis technique to estimate the reuse profile of loop-based programs. For an\ninput program, we generate a basic block-level control flow graph and the\nexecution count by analyzing the LLVM IR of the program. We present the memory\naccesses of the application kernel in a compact bracketed format and use a\nrecursive algorithm to predict the reuse distance histogram. We deploy a\nseparate predictor that unrolls the loop(s) for smaller bounds and generates a\ntemporary reuse distance profile for those small cases. Using these smaller\nprofiles, the reuse profile is extrapolated for the actual loop bound(s). We\nuse this reuse profile to predict the cache hit rate.

Solving tridiagonal systems on\ndistributed-memory environments is not straightforward, and often requires\nsignificant amount of communication. In this article, we present a novel\ndistributed-memory tridiagonal solver algorithm, DistD2-TDS, based on a\nspecialised data structure. DistD2-TDS algorithm takes advantage of the\ndiagonal dominance in tridiagonal systems to reduce the communications in\ndistributed-memory environments. The underlying data structure plays a crucial\nrole for the performance of the algorithm. First, the data structure improves\ndata localities and makes it possible to minimise data movements via cache\nblocking and kernel fusion strategies. Second, data continuity enables a\ncontiguous data access pattern and results in efficient utilisation of the\navailable memory bandwidth. Finally, the data layout supports vectorisation on\nCPUs and thread level parallelisation on GPUs for improved performance. In\norder to demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm, we implemented and\nbenchmarked the algorithm on CPUs and GPUs. We investigated the single rank\nperformance and compared against existing algorithms. Furthermore, we analysed\nthe strong scaling of the implementation up to 384 NVIDIA H100 GPUs and up to\n8192 AMD EPYC 7742 CPUs. Finally, we demonstrated a practical use case of the\nalgorithm by using compact finite difference schemes to solve a 3D non-linear\nPDE.

The MSE and MAE values of this model are significantly reduced,\nproving its effectiveness under complex data access patterns.

Most existing methods rely on depth estimation\nthrough self-supervision or multi-modality sensor fusion. In this paper, we\npropose Driv3R, a DUSt3R-based framework that directly regresses per-frame\npoint maps from multi-view image sequences. To achieve streaming dense\nreconstruction, we maintain a memory pool to reason both spatial relationships\nacross sensors and dynamic temporal contexts to enhance multi-view 3D\nconsistency and temporal integration. Furthermore, we employ a 4D flow\npredictor to identify moving objects within the scene to direct our network\nfocus more on reconstructing these dynamic regions.

Most existing methods rely on depth estimation\nthrough self-supervision or multi-modality sensor fusion. In this paper, we\npropose Driv3R, a DUSt3R-based framework that directly regresses per-frame\npoint maps from multi-view image sequences. To achieve streaming dense\nreconstruction, we maintain a memory pool to reason both spatial relationships\nacross sensors and dynamic temporal contexts to enhance multi-view 3D\nconsistency and temporal integration. Furthermore, we employ a 4D flow\npredictor to identify moving objects within the scene to direct our network\nfocus more on reconstructing these dynamic regions.

To address this, we propose ONEBench(OpeN-Ended\nBenchmarking), a new testing paradigm that consolidates individual evaluation\ndatasets into a unified, ever-expanding sample pool. ONEBench allows users to\ngenerate custom, open-ended evaluation benchmarks from this pool, corresponding\nto specific capabilities of interest. By aggregating samples across test sets,\nONEBench enables the assessment of diverse capabilities beyond those covered by\nthe original test sets, while mitigating overfitting and dataset bias. Most\nimportantly, it frames model evaluation as a collective process of selecting\nand aggregating sample-level tests.\n  The shift from task-specific benchmarks to ONEBench introduces two\nchallenges: (1)heterogeneity and (2)incompleteness. Heterogeneity refers to the\naggregation over diverse metrics, while incompleteness describes comparing\nmodels evaluated on different data subsets. To address these challenges, we\nexplore algorithms to aggregate sparse measurements into reliable model scores.\nOur aggregation algorithm ensures identifiability(asymptotically recovering\nground-truth scores) and rapid convergence, enabling accurate model ranking\nwith less data. On homogenous datasets, we show our aggregation algorithm\nprovides rankings that highly correlate with those produced by average scores.\nWe also demonstrate robustness to ~95% of measurements missing, reducing\nevaluation cost by up to 20x with little-to-no change in model rankings. We\nintroduce ONEBench-LLM for language models and ONEBench-LMM for vision-language\nmodels, unifying evaluations across these domains.

Effective RD\nmethods have applications in accessibility, translation or writing support\nsystems. Moreover, in NLP research we find RD to be used to benchmark text\nencoders at various granularities, as it often requires word, definition and\nsentence embeddings. In this paper, we propose a simple approach to RD that\nleverages LLMs in combination with embedding models. Despite its simplicity,\nthis approach outperforms supervised baselines in well studied RD datasets,\nwhile also showing less over-fitting. We also conduct a number of experiments\non different dictionaries and analyze how different styles, registers and\ntarget audiences impact the quality of RD systems. We conclude that, on\naverage, untuned embeddings alone fare way below an LLM-only baseline (although\nthey are competitive in highly technical dictionaries), but are crucial for\nboosting performance in combined methods.",

                    "value": "Reverse Dictionary (RD) is the task of obtaining the most relevant word or\nset of words given a textual description or dictionary definition. Effective RD\nmethods have applications in accessibility, translation or writing support\nsystems. Moreover, in NLP research we find RD to be used to benchmark text\nencoders at various granularities, as it often requires word, definition and\nsentence embeddings. In this paper, we propose a simple approach to RD that\nleverages LLMs in combination with embedding models. Despite its simplicity,\nthis approach outperforms supervised baselines in well studied RD datasets,\nwhile also showing less over-fitting. We also conduct a number of experiments\non different dictionaries and analyze how different styles, registers and\ntarget audiences impact the quality of RD systems. We conclude that, on\naverage, untuned embeddings alone fare way below an LLM-only baseline (although\nthey are competitive in highly technical dictionaries), but are crucial for\nboosting performance in combined methods."

To investigate this, we analysed a dataset of 4,354 Twitter mentions\nassociated with 504 retracted articles. The effectiveness of Twitter mentions\nin predicting article retractions was evaluated by both manual and Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) labelling. Manual labelling results indicated that 25.7%\nof tweets signalled problems before retraction. Using the manual labelling\nresults as the baseline, we found that LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and\nClaude-3.5-Haiku) outperformed lexicon-based sentiment analysis tools (e.g.,\nTextBlob) in detecting potential problems, suggesting that automatic detection\nof problematic articles from social media using LLMs is technically feasible.\nNevertheless, since only a small proportion of retracted articles (11.1%) were\ncriticised on Twitter prior to retraction, such automatic systems would detect\nonly a minority of problematic articles.

This memory burden\nnecessitates using more or higher-end GPUs or reducing batch sizes, limiting\ntraining scalability and throughput. To address this, various memory-efficient\noptimizers have been proposed to reduce optimizer memory usage. However, they\nface critical challenges: (i) reliance on costly SVD operations; (ii)\nsignificant performance trade-offs compared to AdamW; and (iii) still\nsubstantial optimizer memory overhead to maintain competitive performance.\n  In this work, we identify that AdamW's learning rate adaptation rule can be\neffectively coarsened as a structured learning rate update. Based on this\ninsight, we propose Approximated Gradient Scaling for Memory-Efficient LLM\nOptimization (APOLLO), which approximates learning rate scaling using an\nauxiliary low-rank optimizer state based on pure random projection. This\nstructured learning rate update rule makes APOLLO highly tolerant to further\nmemory reductions while delivering comparable pre-training performance. Even\nits rank-1 variant, APOLLO-Mini, achieves superior pre-training performance\ncompared to AdamW with SGD-level memory costs.\n  Extensive experiments demonstrate that the APOLLO series performs on-par with\nor better than AdamW, while achieving greater memory savings by nearly\neliminating the optimization states of AdamW. These savings provide significant\nsystem-level benefits: (1) Enhanced Throughput: 3x throughput on an 8xA100-80GB\nsetup compared to AdamW by supporting 4x larger batch sizes. (2) Improved Model\nScalability: Pre-training LLaMA-13B with naive DDP on A100-80GB GPUs without\nsystem-level optimizations. (3) Low-End GPU Friendly Pre-training: Pre-training\nLLaMA-7B on a single GPU using less than 12 GB of memory with weight\nquantization.",

It\ncovers pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and affects the starting conditions\nfor reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The simplicity and\nscalability of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for next token prediction\nled to its role as predominant paradigm. However, the broader field of\nimitation learning can more effectively utilize the sequential structure\nunderlying autoregressive generation. We focus on investigating the inverse\nreinforcement learning (IRL) perspective to imitation, extracting rewards and\ndirectly optimizing sequences instead of individual token likelihoods and\nevaluate its benefits for fine-tuning large language models. We provide a new\nangle, reformulating inverse soft-Q-learning as a temporal difference\nregularized extension of MLE. This creates a principled connection between MLE\nand IRL and allows trading off added complexity with increased performance and\ndiversity of generations in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) setting. We find\nclear advantages for IRL-based imitation, in particular for retaining diversity\nwhile maximizing task performance, rendering IRL a strong alternative on fixed\nSFT datasets even without online data generation. Our analysis of IRL-extracted\nreward functions further indicates benefits for more robust reward functions\nvia tighter integration of supervised and preference-based LLM post-training.",

The simplicity and\nscalability of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for next token prediction\nled to its role as predominant paradigm. However, the broader field of\nimitation learning can more effectively utilize the sequential structure\nunderlying autoregressive generation. We focus on investigating the inverse\nreinforcement learning (IRL) perspective to imitation, extracting rewards and\ndirectly optimizing sequences instead of individual token likelihoods and\nevaluate its benefits for fine-tuning large language models. We provide a new\nangle, reformulating inverse soft-Q-learning as a temporal difference\nregularized extension of MLE. This creates a principled connection between MLE\nand IRL and allows trading off added complexity with increased performance and\ndiversity of generations in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) setting. We find\nclear advantages for IRL-based imitation, in particular for retaining diversity\nwhile maximizing task performance, rendering IRL a strong alternative on fixed\nSFT datasets even without online data generation. Our analysis of IRL-extracted\nreward functions further indicates benefits for more robust reward functions\nvia tighter integration of supervised and preference-based LLM post-training."

Previous OCD methods employ the hash-based\ntechnique to represent old/new categories by hash codes for instance-wise\ninference. However, directly mapping features into low-dimensional hash space\nnot only inevitably damages the ability to distinguish classes and but also\ncauses \"high sensitivity\" issue, especially for fine-grained classes, leading\nto inferior performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel\nPrototypical Hash Encoding (PHE) framework consisting of Category-aware\nPrototype Generation (CPG) and Discriminative Category Encoding (DCE) to\nmitigate the sensitivity of hash code while preserving rich discriminative\ninformation contained in high-dimension feature space, in a two-stage\nprojection fashion. CPG enables the model to fully capture the intra-category\ndiversity by representing each category with multiple prototypes. DCE boosts\nthe discrimination ability of hash code with the guidance of the generated\ncategory prototypes and the constraint of minimum separation distance. By\njointly optimizing CPG and DCE, we demonstrate that these two components are\nmutually beneficial towards an effective OCD. Extensive experiments show the\nsignificant superiority of our PHE over previous methods, e.g., obtaining an\nimprovement of +5.3% in ALL ACC averaged on all datasets. Moreover, due to the\nnature of the interpretable prototypes, we visually analyze the underlying\nmechanism of how PHE helps group certain samples into either known or unknown\ncategories.

                    "value": "In this paper, we study a practical yet challenging task, On-the-fly Category\nDiscovery (OCD), aiming to online discover the newly-coming stream data that\nbelong to both known and unknown classes, by leveraging only known category\nknowledge contained in labeled data. Previous OCD methods employ the hash-based\ntechnique to represent old/new categories by hash codes for instance-wise\ninference. However, directly mapping features into low-dimensional hash space\nnot only inevitably damages the ability to distinguish classes and but also\ncauses \"high sensitivity\" issue, especially for fine-grained classes, leading\nto inferior performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel\nPrototypical Hash Encoding (PHE) framework consisting of Category-aware\nPrototype Generation (CPG) and Discriminative Category Encoding (DCE) to\nmitigate the sensitivity of hash code while preserving rich discriminative\ninformation contained in high-dimension feature space, in a two-stage\nprojection fashion. CPG enables the model to fully capture the intra-category\ndiversity by representing each category with multiple prototypes. DCE boosts\nthe discrimination ability of hash code with the guidance of the generated\ncategory prototypes and the constraint of minimum separation distance. By\njointly optimizing CPG and DCE, we demonstrate that these two components are\nmutually beneficial towards an effective OCD. Extensive experiments show the\nsignificant superiority of our PHE over previous methods, e.g., obtaining an\nimprovement of +5.3% in ALL ACC averaged on all datasets. Moreover, due to the\nnature of the interpretable prototypes, we visually analyze the underlying\nmechanism of how PHE helps group certain samples into either known or unknown\ncategories.

A diffeomorphic\nmapping for the output and a loss that captures time-invariant trajectory\nsimilarity are proposed. We validate the efficacy of our approach through\nexperiments conducted on a public dataset of handwritten shapes and within a\nsimulated object manipulation task."

We implement this framework in both a\ntext-based environment, which offers a tightly controlled setting and enables\nhigh-throughput parameter sweeps, and in an embodied 3D environment, which\nrequires addressing complexities of multi-modal interaction more relevant to\nreal-world applications. We further investigate whether approaches such as\nself-correction and increased inference time improve information gathering\nefficiency. In a relatively simple task that requires identifying a single\nrewarding feature, we find that LLM's information gathering capability is close\nto optimal.

We analyze the gaming data retrospectively to uncover the underlying\nreasoning processes of LLMs and measure their fine-grained reasoning\ncapabilities. We collect over 2000 game sessions and provide detailed\nassessments of various reasoning capabilities for five state-of-the-art LLMs.\nOur user study with 100 participants suggests that GameArena improves user\nengagement compared to Chatbot Arena.

Our work aims to measure the propensity of\nOpenAI's LLMs to exhibit verbatim memorization in its outputs relative to other\nLLMs, specifically focusing on news articles. We discover that both GPT and\nClaude models use refusal training and output filters to prevent verbatim\noutput of the memorized articles. We apply a basic prompt template to bypass\nthe refusal training and show that OpenAI models are currently less prone to\nmemorization elicitation than models from Meta, Mistral, and Anthropic. We find\nthat as models increase in size, especially beyond 100 billion parameters, they\ndemonstrate significantly greater capacity for memorization. Our findings have\npractical implications for training: more attention must be placed on\npreventing verbatim memorization in very large models. Our findings also have\nlegal significance: in assessing the relative memorization capacity of OpenAI's\nLLMs, we probe the strength of The New York Times's copyright infringement\nclaims and OpenAI's legal defenses, while underscoring issues at the\nintersection of generative AI, law, and policy.",

Although there have been several benchmark\ndatasets for medical QA, they either cover common knowledge across different\ndepartments or are specific to another department rather than pediatrics.\nMoreover, some of them are limited to objective questions and do not measure\nthe generation capacity of LLMs. Therefore, they cannot comprehensively assess\nthe QA ability of LLMs in pediatrics. To fill this gap, we construct\nPediaBench, the first Chinese pediatric dataset for LLM evaluation.\nSpecifically, it contains 4,565 objective questions and 1,632 subjective\nquestions spanning 12 pediatric disease groups. It adopts an integrated scoring\ncriterion based on different difficulty levels to thoroughly assess the\nproficiency of an LLM in instruction following, knowledge understanding,\nclinical case analysis, etc. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of\nPediaBench with extensive experiments on 20 open-source and commercial LLMs.\nThrough an in-depth analysis of experimental results, we offer insights into\nthe ability of LLMs to answer pediatric questions in the Chinese context,\nhighlighting their limitations for further improvements.

                    "value": "The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the medical domain has\nstressed a compelling need for standard datasets to evaluate their\nquestion-answering (QA) performance. Although there have been several benchmark\ndatasets for medical QA, they either cover common knowledge across different\ndepartments or are specific to another department rather than pediatrics.\nMoreover, some of them are limited to objective questions and do not measure\nthe generation capacity of LLMs. Therefore, they cannot comprehensively assess\nthe QA ability of LLMs in pediatrics. To fill this gap, we construct\nPediaBench, the first Chinese pediatric dataset for LLM evaluation.\nSpecifically, it contains 4,565 objective questions and 1,632 subjective\nquestions spanning 12 pediatric disease groups. It adopts an integrated scoring\ncriterion based on different difficulty levels to thoroughly assess the\nproficiency of an LLM in instruction following, knowledge understanding,\nclinical case analysis, etc. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of\nPediaBench with extensive experiments on 20 open-source and commercial LLMs.\nThrough an in-depth analysis of experimental results, we offer insights into\nthe ability of LLMs to answer pediatric questions in the Chinese context,\nhighlighting their limitations for further improvements. Our code and data are\npublished at https://github.com/ACMISLab/PediaBench."

While some previous methods have explored\ndirectly pruning or merging tokens in the inference stage to accelerate models,\nour method excels in both performance and throughput by two key designs. First,\nwhile most previous methods only try to save the computations of Large Language\nModels (LLMs), our method accelerates the forward pass of both image encoders\nand LLMs in LVLMs, which both occupy a significant part of time during\ninference. Second, our method recycles the beneficial information from the\npruned tokens into existing tokens, which avoids directly dropping context\ntokens like previous methods to cause performance loss. iLLaVA can nearly\n2$\\times$ the throughput, and reduce the memory costs by half with only a 0.2\\%\n- 0.5\\% performance drop across models of different scales including 7B, 13B\nand 34B. On tasks across different domains including single-image, multi-images\nand videos, iLLaVA demonstrates strong generalizability with consistently\npromising efficiency.

To address this, we propose ONEBench(OpeN-Ended\nBenchmarking), a new testing paradigm that consolidates individual evaluation\ndatasets into a unified, ever-expanding sample pool. ONEBench allows users to\ngenerate custom, open-ended evaluation benchmarks from this pool, corresponding\nto specific capabilities of interest. By aggregating samples across test sets,\nONEBench enables the assessment of diverse capabilities beyond those covered by\nthe original test sets, while mitigating overfitting and dataset bias. Most\nimportantly, it frames model evaluation as a collective process of selecting\nand aggregating sample-level tests.\n  The shift from task-specific benchmarks to ONEBench introduces two\nchallenges: (1)heterogeneity and (2)incompleteness. Heterogeneity refers to the\naggregation over diverse metrics, while incompleteness describes comparing\nmodels evaluated on different data subsets. To address these challenges, we\nexplore algorithms to aggregate sparse measurements into reliable model scores.\nOur aggregation algorithm ensures identifiability(asymptotically recovering\nground-truth scores) and rapid convergence, enabling accurate model ranking\nwith less data. On homogenous datasets, we show our aggregation algorithm\nprovides rankings that highly correlate with those produced by average scores.\nWe also demonstrate robustness to ~95% of measurements missing, reducing\nevaluation cost by up to 20x with little-to-no change in model rankings. We\nintroduce ONEBench-LLM for language models and ONEBench-LMM for vision-language\nmodels, unifying evaluations across these domains.

Subsequently, we utilize this synthesized data to train\ncompact models (e.g., BERT). This novel methodology is termed JAPAGEN. Our\nexperimental findings underscore that JAPAGEN achieves robust performance in\nclassification tasks that necessitate formal text inputs, demonstrating\ncompetitive results compared to conventional LLM prompting strategies.",

Moreover, we also release an effective code sandbox execution\ntool (i.e., SandboxFusion) supporting various programming languages and\npackages to evaluate the performance of our FullStack Bench efficiently.\nComprehensive experimental results on our FullStack Bench demonstrate the\nnecessity and effectiveness of our FullStack Bench and SandboxFusion."

This memory burden\nnecessitates using more or higher-end GPUs or reducing batch sizes, limiting\ntraining scalability and throughput. To address this, various memory-efficient\noptimizers have been proposed to reduce optimizer memory usage. However, they\nface critical challenges: (i) reliance on costly SVD operations; (ii)\nsignificant performance trade-offs compared to AdamW; and (iii) still\nsubstantial optimizer memory overhead to maintain competitive performance.\n  In this work, we identify that AdamW's learning rate adaptation rule can be\neffectively coarsened as a structured learning rate update. Based on this\ninsight, we propose Approximated Gradient Scaling for Memory-Efficient LLM\nOptimization (APOLLO), which approximates learning rate scaling using an\nauxiliary low-rank optimizer state based on pure random projection. This\nstructured learning rate update rule makes APOLLO highly tolerant to further\nmemory reductions while delivering comparable pre-training performance. Even\nits rank-1 variant, APOLLO-Mini, achieves superior pre-training performance\ncompared to AdamW with SGD-level memory costs.\n  Extensive experiments demonstrate that the APOLLO series performs on-par with\nor better than AdamW, while achieving greater memory savings by nearly\neliminating the optimization states of AdamW. These savings provide significant\nsystem-level benefits: (1) Enhanced Throughput: 3x throughput on an 8xA100-80GB\nsetup compared to AdamW by supporting 4x larger batch sizes. (2) Improved Model\nScalability: Pre-training LLaMA-13B with naive DDP on A100-80GB GPUs without\nsystem-level optimizations. (3) Low-End GPU Friendly Pre-training: Pre-training\nLLaMA-7B on a single GPU using less than 12 GB of memory with weight\nquantization.",

However, they\nface critical challenges: (i) reliance on costly SVD operations; (ii)\nsignificant performance trade-offs compared to AdamW; and (iii) still\nsubstantial optimizer memory overhead to maintain competitive performance.\n  In this work, we identify that AdamW's learning rate adaptation rule can be\neffectively coarsened as a structured learning rate update. Based on this\ninsight, we propose Approximated Gradient Scaling for Memory-Efficient LLM\nOptimization (APOLLO), which approximates learning rate scaling using an\nauxiliary low-rank optimizer state based on pure random projection. This\nstructured learning rate update rule makes APOLLO highly tolerant to further\nmemory reductions while delivering comparable pre-training performance. Even\nits rank-1 variant, APOLLO-Mini, achieves superior pre-training performance\ncompared to AdamW with SGD-level memory costs.\n  Extensive experiments demonstrate that the APOLLO series performs on-par with\nor better than AdamW, while achieving greater memory savings by nearly\neliminating the optimization states of AdamW. These savings provide significant\nsystem-level benefits: (1) Enhanced Throughput: 3x throughput on an 8xA100-80GB\nsetup compared to AdamW by supporting 4x larger batch sizes. (2) Improved Model\nScalability: Pre-training LLaMA-13B with naive DDP on A100-80GB GPUs without\nsystem-level optimizations. (3) Low-End GPU Friendly Pre-training: Pre-training\nLLaMA-7B on a single GPU using less than 12 GB of memory with weight\nquantization."

Inspired by methods combining\nvisual modality and Large Language Models (LLMs) through appropriate prompts,\nour framework (1) generates questions based on cultural categories from images,\n(2) extracts cultural visual elements from Visual Question Answering (VQA)\nusing generated questions, and (3) generates culturally-aware captions using\nLLMs with the prompts. Our human evaluation conducted on 45 participants from 4\ndifferent cultural groups with a high understanding of the corresponding\nculture shows that our proposed framework generates more culturally descriptive\ncaptions when compared to the image captioning baseline based on VLPs.\nResources can be found at https://shane3606.github.io/cic..",

These latent skills are influenced by computational\nresources like model size and training tokens but with varying efficiencies\nacross model families. Sloth exploits correlations across benchmarks to provide\nmore accurate and interpretable predictions while alleviating the need to train\nmultiple LLMs per family. We present both theoretical results on parameter\nidentification and empirical evaluations on 12 prominent benchmarks, from Open\nLLM Leaderboard v1/v2, demonstrating that Sloth predicts LLM performance\nefficiently and offers insights into scaling behaviors for downstream tasks\nsuch as coding and emotional intelligence applications."

However, these models\nremain susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which can bypass built-in safety\nmechanisms and induce the production of potentially harmful content.\nConsequently, understanding the methods of jailbreak attacks and existing\ndefense mechanisms is essential to ensure the safe deployment of multimodal\ngenerative models in real-world scenarios, particularly in security-sensitive\napplications. To provide comprehensive insight into this topic, this survey\nreviews jailbreak and defense in multimodal generative models. First, given the\ngeneralized lifecycle of multimodal jailbreak, we systematically explore\nattacks and corresponding defense strategies across four levels: input,\nencoder, generator, and output. Based on this analysis, we present a detailed\ntaxonomy of attack methods, defense mechanisms, and evaluation frameworks\nspecific to multimodal generative models. Additionally, we cover a wide range\nof input-output configurations, including modalities such as Any-to-Text,\nAny-to-Vision, and Any-to-Any within generative systems.

Nevertheless, the practical implementation of FL\npresents technical and organizational challenges, as it generally requires\ncomplex communication infrastructures. In this context, consensus-based\nlearning (CBL) may represent a promising collaborative learning alternative,\nthanks to the ability of combining local knowledge into a federated decision\nsystem, while potentially reducing deployment overhead. Methods. In this work\nwe propose an extensive benchmark of the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of a\npanel of FL and CBL methods in a wide range of collaborative medical data\nanalysis scenarios. The benchmark includes 7 different medical datasets,\nencompassing 3 machine learning tasks, 8 different data modalities, and\nmulti-centric settings involving 3 to 23 clients. Findings. Our results reveal\nthat CBL is a cost-effective alternative to FL.

                    "value": "Background. Federated learning (FL) has gained wide popularity as a\ncollaborative learning paradigm enabling collaborative AI in sensitive\nhealthcare applications. Nevertheless, the practical implementation of FL\npresents technical and organizational challenges, as it generally requires\ncomplex communication infrastructures. In this context, consensus-based\nlearning (CBL) may represent a promising collaborative learning alternative,\nthanks to the ability of combining local knowledge into a federated decision\nsystem, while potentially reducing deployment overhead. Methods. In this work\nwe propose an extensive benchmark of the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of a\npanel of FL and CBL methods in a wide range of collaborative medical data\nanalysis scenarios. The benchmark includes 7 different medical datasets,\nencompassing 3 machine learning tasks, 8 different data modalities, and\nmulti-centric settings involving 3 to 23 clients. Findings. Our results reveal\nthat CBL is a cost-effective alternative to FL. When compared across the panel\nof medical dataset in the considered benchmark, CBL methods provide equivalent\naccuracy to the one achieved by FL.Nonetheless, CBL significantly reduces\ntraining time and communication cost (resp. 15 fold and 60 fold decrease) (p <\n0.05).

In this work, we investigate whether a universal\ntruthfulness hyperplane that distinguishes the model's factually correct and\nincorrect outputs exists within the model. To this end, we scale up the number\nof training datasets and conduct an extensive evaluation -- we train the\ntruthfulness hyperplane on a diverse collection of over 40 datasets and examine\nits cross-task, cross-domain, and in-domain generalization. Our results\nindicate that increasing the diversity of the training datasets significantly\nenhances the performance in all scenarios, while the volume of data samples\nplays a less critical role.

To assess\nthe information gathering abilities of foundation models in interactive\nenvironments, we introduce a framework in which a model must determine the\nfactors influencing a hidden reward function by iteratively reasoning about its\npreviously gathered information and proposing its next exploratory action to\nmaximize information gain at each step. We implement this framework in both a\ntext-based environment, which offers a tightly controlled setting and enables\nhigh-throughput parameter sweeps, and in an embodied 3D environment, which\nrequires addressing complexities of multi-modal interaction more relevant to\nreal-world applications. We further investigate whether approaches such as\nself-correction and increased inference time improve information gathering\nefficiency. In a relatively simple task that requires identifying a single\nrewarding feature, we find that LLM's information gathering capability is close\nto optimal. However, when the model must identify a conjunction of rewarding\nfeatures, performance is suboptimal. The hit in performance is due partly to\nthe model translating task description to a policy and partly to the model's\neffectiveness in using its in-context memory. Performance is comparable in both\ntext and 3D embodied environments, although imperfect visual object recognition\nreduces its accuracy in drawing conclusions from gathered information in the 3D\nembodied case.

Despite its promising\nefficacy, DPO faces a notable drawback: \"verbosity\", a common over-optimization\nphenomenon also observed in RLHF. While previous studies mainly attributed\nverbosity to biased labels within the data, we propose that the issue also\nstems from an inherent algorithmic length reliance in DPO. Specifically, we\nsuggest that the discrepancy between sequence-level Kullback-Leibler (KL)\ndivergences between chosen and rejected sequences, used in DPO, results in\noverestimated or underestimated rewards due to varying token lengths.\nEmpirically, we utilize datasets with different label lengths to demonstrate\nthe presence of biased rewards. We then introduce an effective downsampling\napproach, named SamPO, to eliminate potential length reliance. Our experimental\nevaluations, conducted across three LLMs of varying scales and a diverse array\nof conditional and open-ended benchmarks, highlight the efficacy of SamPO in\nmitigating verbosity, achieving improvements of 5% to 12% over DPO through\ndebaised rewards.

To address this limitation, we propose\nPORTIA, an alignment-based system designed to mimic human comparison strategies\nto calibrate position bias in a lightweight yet effective manner. Specifically,\nPORTIA splits the answers into multiple segments, aligns similar content across\ncandidate answers, and then merges them back into a single prompt for\nevaluation by LLMs. We conducted extensive experiments with six diverse LLMs to\nevaluate 11,520 answer pairs. Our results show that PORTIA markedly enhances\nthe consistency rates for all the models and comparison forms tested, achieving\nan average relative improvement of 47.46%. Remarkably, PORTIA enables less\nadvanced GPT models to achieve 88% agreement with the state-of-the-art GPT-4\nmodel at just 10% of the cost. Furthermore, it rectifies around 80% of the\nposition bias instances within the GPT-4 model, elevating its consistency rate\nup to 98%. Subsequent human evaluations indicate that the PORTIA-enhanced\nGPT-3.5 model can even surpass the standalone GPT-4 in terms of alignment with\nhuman evaluators. These findings highlight PORTIA's ability to correct position\nbias, improve LLM consistency, and boost performance while keeping\ncost-efficiency.

This has led to speculation\nthat the orchestration of these repository-level tasks could lead to software\nengineering agents capable of performing almost independently of human\nintervention. However, of the suite of tasks that would need to be performed by\nthis autonomous software engineering agent, we argue that one important task is\nmissing, which is to fulfil project level dependency by installing other\nrepositories. To investigate the feasibility of this repository level\ninstallation task, we introduce a benchmark of of repository installation tasks\ncurated from 40 open source Python projects, which includes a ground truth\ninstallation process for each target repository. Further, we propose\nInstallamatic, an agent which aims to perform and verify the installation of a\ngiven repository by searching for relevant instructions from documentation in\nthe repository. Empirical experiments reveal that that 55% of the studied\nrepositories can be automatically installed by our agent at least one out of\nten times. Through further analysis, we identify the common causes for our\nagent's inability to install a repository, discuss the challenges faced in the\ndesign and implementation of such an agent and consider the implications that\nsuch an agent could have for developers.",

                    "value": "Many works have recently proposed the use of Large Language Model (LLM) based\nagents for performing `repository level' tasks, loosely defined as a set of\ntasks whose scopes are greater than a single file. This has led to speculation\nthat the orchestration of these repository-level tasks could lead to software\nengineering agents capable of performing almost independently of human\nintervention. However, of the suite of tasks that would need to be performed by\nthis autonomous software engineering agent, we argue that one important task is\nmissing, which is to fulfil project level dependency by installing other\nrepositories. To investigate the feasibility of this repository level\ninstallation task, we introduce a benchmark of of repository installation tasks\ncurated from 40 open source Python projects, which includes a ground truth\ninstallation process for each target repository. Further, we propose\nInstallamatic, an agent which aims to perform and verify the installation of a\ngiven repository by searching for relevant instructions from documentation in\nthe repository. Empirical experiments reveal that that 55% of the studied\nrepositories can be automatically installed by our agent at least one out of\nten times. Through further analysis, we identify the common causes for our\nagent's inability to install a repository, discuss the challenges faced in the\ndesign and implementation of such an agent and consider the implications that\nsuch an agent could have for developers."

While some previous methods have explored\ndirectly pruning or merging tokens in the inference stage to accelerate models,\nour method excels in both performance and throughput by two key designs. First,\nwhile most previous methods only try to save the computations of Large Language\nModels (LLMs), our method accelerates the forward pass of both image encoders\nand LLMs in LVLMs, which both occupy a significant part of time during\ninference. Second, our method recycles the beneficial information from the\npruned tokens into existing tokens, which avoids directly dropping context\ntokens like previous methods to cause performance loss. iLLaVA can nearly\n2$\\times$ the throughput, and reduce the memory costs by half with only a 0.2\\%\n- 0.5\\% performance drop across models of different scales including 7B, 13B\nand 34B.

This paper introduces Pangea, a multilingual multimodal LLM\ntrained on PangeaIns, a diverse 6M instruction dataset spanning 39 languages.\nPangeaIns features: 1) high-quality English instructions, 2) carefully\nmachine-translated instructions, and 3) culturally relevant multimodal tasks to\nensure cross-cultural coverage. To rigorously assess models' capabilities, we\nintroduce PangeaBench, a holistic evaluation suite encompassing 14 datasets\ncovering 47 languages. Results show that Pangea significantly outperforms\nexisting open-source models in multilingual settings and diverse cultural\ncontexts. Ablation studies further reveal the importance of English data\nproportions, language popularity, and the number of multimodal training samples\non overall performance.

This paper introduces Pangea, a multilingual multimodal LLM\ntrained on PangeaIns, a diverse 6M instruction dataset spanning 39 languages.\nPangeaIns features: 1) high-quality English instructions, 2) carefully\nmachine-translated instructions, and 3) culturally relevant multimodal tasks to\nensure cross-cultural coverage. To rigorously assess models' capabilities, we\nintroduce PangeaBench, a holistic evaluation suite encompassing 14 datasets\ncovering 47 languages. Results show that Pangea significantly outperforms\nexisting open-source models in multilingual settings and diverse cultural\ncontexts. Ablation studies further reveal the importance of English data\nproportions, language popularity, and the number of multimodal training samples\non overall performance. We fully open-source our data, code, and trained\ncheckpoints, to facilitate the development of inclusive and robust multilingual\nMLLMs, promoting equity and accessibility across a broader linguistic and\ncultural spectrum."

Traditional Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU)\nmethods focus on frame-level anomaly prediction, often missing the\ninterpretability of complex and diverse real-world anomalies. Recent multimodal\napproaches leverage visual and textual data but lack hierarchical annotations\nthat capture both short-term and long-term anomalies. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce HIVAU-70k, a large-scale benchmark for hierarchical\nvideo anomaly understanding across any granularity. We develop a semi-automated\nannotation engine that efficiently scales high-quality annotations by combining\nmanual video segmentation with recursive free-text annotation using large\nlanguage models (LLMs). This results in over 70,000 multi-granular annotations\norganized at clip-level, event-level, and video-level segments. For efficient\nanomaly detection in long videos, we propose the Anomaly-focused Temporal\nSampler (ATS). ATS integrates an anomaly scorer with a density-aware sampler to\nadaptively select frames based on anomaly scores, ensuring that the multimodal\nLLM concentrates on anomaly-rich regions, which significantly enhances both\nefficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nhierarchical instruction data markedly improves anomaly comprehension. The\nintegrated ATS and visual-language model outperform traditional methods in\nprocessing long videos. Our benchmark and model are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/pipixin321/HolmesVAU.",

Recent\nwork has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs), with their rich prior\nknowledge and reasoning capabilities, can potentially help with planning by\nsearching over promising states and adapting to feedback from the world. In\nthis paper, we propose and study two fundamentally competing frameworks that\nleverage LLMs for query-efficient planning. The first uses LLMs as a heuristic\nwithin a search-based planner to select promising nodes to expand and propose\npromising actions. The second uses LLMs as a generative planner to propose an\nentire sequence of actions from start to goal, query a world model, and adapt\nbased on feedback. We show that while both approaches improve upon comparable\nbaselines, using an LLM as a generative planner results in significantly fewer\ninteractions. Our key finding is that the LLM as a planner can more rapidly\nadapt its planning strategies based on immediate feedback than LLM as a\nheuristic. We present evaluations and ablations on Robotouille and PDDL\nplanning benchmarks and discuss connections to existing theory on\nquery-efficient planning algorithms.

We present evaluations and ablations on Robotouille and PDDL\nplanning benchmarks and discuss connections to existing theory on\nquery-efficient planning algorithms.

However, Medical LVLMs (Med-LVLMs) encounter\nfactuality challenges due to modality misalignment, where the models prioritize\ntextual knowledge over visual input, leading to hallucinations that contradict\ninformation in medical images. Previous attempts to enhance modality alignment\nin Med-LVLMs through preference optimization have inadequately mitigated\nclinical relevance in preference data, making these samples easily\ndistinguishable and reducing alignment effectiveness. To address this\nchallenge, we propose MMedPO, a novel multimodal medical preference\noptimization approach that considers the clinical relevance of preference\nsamples to enhance Med-LVLM alignment. MMedPO curates multimodal preference\ndata by introducing two types of dispreference: (1) plausible hallucinations\ninjected through target Med-LVLMs or GPT-4o to produce medically inaccurate\nresponses, and (2) lesion region neglect achieved through local lesion-noising,\ndisrupting visual understanding of critical areas. We then calculate clinical\nrelevance for each sample based on scores from multiple Med-LLMs and visual\ntools, and integrate these scores into the preference optimization process as\nweights, enabling effective alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that MMedPO\nsignificantly enhances factual accuracy in Med-LVLMs, achieving substantial\nimprovements over existing preference optimization methods by averaging 14.2%\nand 51.7% across the Med-VQA and report generation tasks.

Given such complex instructions, SOTA models often make mistakes in\nfaithfully modeling object attributes, and relationships among them. In this\nwork, we present an alternate paradigm for T2I synthesis, decomposing the task\nof complex multi-step generation into three steps, (a) Generate: we first\ngenerate an image using existing diffusion models (b) Plan: we make use of\nMulti-Modal LLMs (MLLMs) to identify the mistakes in the generated image\nexpressed in terms of individual objects and their properties, and produce a\nsequence of corrective steps required in the form of an edit-plan. (c) Edit: we\nmake use of an existing text-guided image editing models to sequentially\nexecute our edit-plan over the generated image to get the desired image which\nis faithful to the original instruction. Our approach derives its strength from\nthe fact that it is modular in nature, is training free, and can be applied\nover any combination of image generation and editing models. As an added\ncontribution, we also develop a model capable of compositional editing, which\nfurther helps improve the overall accuracy of our proposed approach. Our method\nflexibly trades inference time compute with performance on compositional text\nprompts. We perform extensive experimental evaluation across 3 benchmarks and\n10 T2I models including DALLE-3 and the latest -- SD-3.5-Large. Our approach\nnot only improves the performance of the SOTA models, by upto 3 points, it also\nreduces the performance gap between weaker and stronger models.\n$\\href{https://dair-iitd.github.io/GraPE/}{https://dair-iitd.github.io/GraPE/}$",
