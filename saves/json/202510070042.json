Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache\nsemantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size,\nsupporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus,\nwe propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic\ncommunication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the\nsource model's KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic\ntransfer. A learnable gating mechanism selects the target layers that benefit\nfrom cache communication.

Enabling well-trained LLMs (e.g., Llama) to rapidly adapt to MLA\nwithout pre-training from scratch is both meaningful and challenging. This\npaper proposes the first data-efficient fine-tuning method for transitioning\nfrom MHA to MLA (MHA2MLA), which includes two key components: for partial-RoPE,\nwe remove RoPE from dimensions of queries and keys that contribute less to the\nattention scores, for low-rank approximation, we introduce joint SVD\napproximations based on the pre-trained parameters of keys and values. These\ncarefully designed strategies enable MHA2MLA to recover performance using only\na small fraction (0.3% to 0.6%) of the data, significantly reducing inference\ncosts while seamlessly integrating with compression techniques such as KV cache\nquantization. For example, the KV cache size of Llama2-7B is reduced by 92.19%,\nwith only a 0.5% drop in LongBench performance.",

                    "value": "Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) is an innovative architecture proposed by\nDeepSeek, designed to ensure efficient and economical inference by\nsignificantly compressing the Key-Value (KV) cache into a latent vector.\nCompared to MLA, standard LLMs employing Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and its\nvariants such as Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) exhibit significant cost\ndisadvantages. Enabling well-trained LLMs (e.g., Llama) to rapidly adapt to MLA\nwithout pre-training from scratch is both meaningful and challenging. This\npaper proposes the first data-efficient fine-tuning method for transitioning\nfrom MHA to MLA (MHA2MLA), which includes two key components: for partial-RoPE,\nwe remove RoPE from dimensions of queries and keys that contribute less to the\nattention scores, for low-rank approximation, we introduce joint SVD\napproximations based on the pre-trained parameters of keys and values. These\ncarefully designed strategies enable MHA2MLA to recover performance using only\na small fraction (0.3% to 0.6%) of the data, significantly reducing inference\ncosts while seamlessly integrating with compression techniques such as KV cache\nquantization. For example, the KV cache size of Llama2-7B is reduced by 92.19%,\nwith only a 0.5% drop in LongBench performance."

Recent diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs) enable parallel token\ngeneration through iterative denoising. However, current parallel decoding\nstrategies rely on fixed, input-agnostic heuristics (e.g., confidence\nthresholds), which fail to adapt to input-specific characteristics, resulting\nin suboptimal speed-quality trade-offs across diverse NLP tasks. In this work,\nwe explore a more flexible and dynamic approach to parallel decoding. We\npropose Learning to Parallel Decode (Learn2PD), a framework that trains a\nlightweight and adaptive filter model to predict, for each token position,\nwhether the current prediction matches the final output. This learned filter\napproximates an oracle parallel decoding strategy that unmasks tokens only when\ncorrectly predicted. Importantly, the filter model is learned in a\npost-training manner, requiring only a small amount of computation to optimize\nit (minute-level GPU time). Additionally, we introduce End-of-Text Prediction\n(EoTP) to detect decoding completion at the end of sequence, avoiding redundant\ndecoding of padding tokens. Experiments on the LLaDA benchmark demonstrate that\nour method achieves up to 22.58$\\times$ speedup without any performance drop,\nand up to 57.51$\\times$ when combined with KV-Cache.",

However, current parallel decoding\nstrategies rely on fixed, input-agnostic heuristics (e.g., confidence\nthresholds), which fail to adapt to input-specific characteristics, resulting\nin suboptimal speed-quality trade-offs across diverse NLP tasks. In this work,\nwe explore a more flexible and dynamic approach to parallel decoding. We\npropose Learning to Parallel Decode (Learn2PD), a framework that trains a\nlightweight and adaptive filter model to predict, for each token position,\nwhether the current prediction matches the final output. This learned filter\napproximates an oracle parallel decoding strategy that unmasks tokens only when\ncorrectly predicted. Importantly, the filter model is learned in a\npost-training manner, requiring only a small amount of computation to optimize\nit (minute-level GPU time). Additionally, we introduce End-of-Text Prediction\n(EoTP) to detect decoding completion at the end of sequence, avoiding redundant\ndecoding of padding tokens. Experiments on the LLaDA benchmark demonstrate that\nour method achieves up to 22.58$\\times$ speedup without any performance drop,\nand up to 57.51$\\times$ when combined with KV-Cache."

GATEBLEED can be used as a high\nperformance, stealthy remote covert channel and a generic magnifier for timing\ntransmission channels, capable of bypassing traditional cache defenses to leak\narbitrary memory addresses and evading state of the art microarchitectural\nattack detectors under realistic network conditions and system configurations\nin which previous attacks fail. We implement an end-to-end microarchitectural\ninference attack on a transformer model optimized with Intel AMX, achieving a\nmembership inference accuracy of 81% and a precision of 0.89. In a CNN-based or\ntransformer-based mixture-of-experts model optimized with Intel AMX, we leak\nexpert choice with 100% accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first\nside-channel attack on AI privacy that exploits hardware optimizations."

In this work, we\npropose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a\npre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video\ngenerator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using\na single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to\nthe user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate\nthe next latent frame.

The mainstream sequence\nparallelism (SP) method, Ring Attention, attempts to solve this by distributing\nthe query into multiple query chunks across accelerators and enable each Q\ntensor to access all KV tensors from other accelerators via the Ring AllGather\ncommunication primitive. However, it exhibits low communication efficiency,\nrestricting its practical applicability. This inefficiency stems from the\nmismatch between the Ring AllGather communication primitive it adopts and the\nAlltoAll topology of modern accelerators. A Ring AllGather primitive is\ncomposed of iterations of ring-styled data transfer, which can only utilize a\nvery limited fraction of an AlltoAll topology.\n  Inspired by the Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs, we\nidentify that modern accelerator topology can be decomposed into multiple\northogonal ring datapaths which can concurrently transfer data without\ninterference. Based on this, we further observe that the Ring AllGather\nprimitive can also be decomposed into the same number of concurrent ring-styled\ndata transfer at every iteration. Based on these insights, we propose TASP, a\ntopology-aware SP method for long-context LLMs that fully utilizes the\ncommunication capacity of modern accelerators via topology decomposition and\nprimitive decomposition. Experimental results on both single-node and\nmulti-node NVIDIA H100 systems and a single-node AMD MI300X system demonstrate\nthat TASP achieves higher communication efficiency than Ring Attention on these\nmodern accelerator topologies and achieves up to 3.58 speedup than Ring\nAttention and its variant Zigzag-Ring Attention.

While this is a potential candidate for lifelong\nlearning, it falls short in memory capacity. In this paper, we propose LoLA, a\ntraining-free augmentation to linear attention that boosts associative recall.\nLoLA distributes past key-value pairs from context into three memory systems:\n(i) recent pairs in a local sliding window cache; (ii) difficult-to-memorize\npairs in a sparse, global cache; and (iii) generic pairs in the recurrent\nhidden state of linear attention. We show through ablations that our\nself-recall error metric is crucial to efficiently manage long-term associative\nmemories. On pass-key retrieval tasks, LoLA improves the base model's\nperformance from 0.6% to 97.4% accuracy. This is achieved with a 4.6x smaller\ncache than Llama-3.1 8B on 4K context length. LoLA also outperforms other 1B\nand 8B parameter subquadratic models on zero-shot commonsense reasoning tasks.",

In this paper, we propose LoLA, a\ntraining-free augmentation to linear attention that boosts associative recall.\nLoLA distributes past key-value pairs from context into three memory systems:\n(i) recent pairs in a local sliding window cache; (ii) difficult-to-memorize\npairs in a sparse, global cache; and (iii) generic pairs in the recurrent\nhidden state of linear attention. We show through ablations that our\nself-recall error metric is crucial to efficiently manage long-term associative\nmemories. On pass-key retrieval tasks, LoLA improves the base model's\nperformance from 0.6% to 97.4% accuracy. This is achieved with a 4.6x smaller\ncache than Llama-3.1 8B on 4K context length. LoLA also outperforms other 1B\nand 8B parameter subquadratic models on zero-shot commonsense reasoning tasks."

In our experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves\nstrong performance on video benchmarks, reaching 65.1% and 71.1% accuracy on\nVideoMME without and with subtitles, respectively, and consistently\noutperforming LongVILA-7B across multiple benchmarks.

In addition, we release our training system for public\navailability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and\naudio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video\ngeneration models.

To alleviate this bottleneck, many\nsparsity-based acceleration methods have been proposed. However, their diverse\nsparsity patterns often require customized kernels for high-performance\ninference, limiting universality. We propose FlashOmni, a unified sparse\nattention engine compatible with arbitrary DiT architectures. FlashOmni\nintroduces flexible sparse symbols to standardize the representation of a wide\nrange of sparsity strategies, such as feature caching and block-sparse\nskipping. This unified abstraction enables the execution of diverse sparse\ncomputations within a single attention kernel. In addition, FlashOmni designs\noptimized sparse GEMMs for attention blocks, leveraging sparse symbols to\neliminate redundant computations and further improve efficiency. Experiments\ndemonstrate that FlashOmni delivers near-linear, closely matching the sparsity\nratio speedup (1:1) in attention and GEMM-$Q$, and achieves\n2.5$\\times$-3.8$\\times$ acceleration in GEMM-$O$ (max peaking at about 87.5% of\nthe theoretical limit). Applied with a multi-granularity sparsity strategy, it\nenables the Hunyuan model (33K) to achieve about 1.5$\\times$ end-to-end\nacceleration without degrading visual quality.",

                    "value": "Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) demonstrate exceptional\ncapabilities in visual synthesis, yet their deployment remains constrained by\nsubstantial computational demands. To alleviate this bottleneck, many\nsparsity-based acceleration methods have been proposed. However, their diverse\nsparsity patterns often require customized kernels for high-performance\ninference, limiting universality. We propose FlashOmni, a unified sparse\nattention engine compatible with arbitrary DiT architectures. FlashOmni\nintroduces flexible sparse symbols to standardize the representation of a wide\nrange of sparsity strategies, such as feature caching and block-sparse\nskipping. This unified abstraction enables the execution of diverse sparse\ncomputations within a single attention kernel. In addition, FlashOmni designs\noptimized sparse GEMMs for attention blocks, leveraging sparse symbols to\neliminate redundant computations and further improve efficiency. Experiments\ndemonstrate that FlashOmni delivers near-linear, closely matching the sparsity\nratio speedup (1:1) in attention and GEMM-$Q$, and achieves\n2.5$\\times$-3.8$\\times$ acceleration in GEMM-$O$ (max peaking at about 87.5% of\nthe theoretical limit). Applied with a multi-granularity sparsity strategy, it\nenables the Hunyuan model (33K) to achieve about 1.5$\\times$ end-to-end\nacceleration without degrading visual quality."

Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video\ngeneration: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation,\nwhich is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens\nprocessed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear\nAttention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video\ngeneration by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative\nproperties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with\nglobal context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional\nKV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we\nexplore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the\ntraining cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of\nMovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance\ncompared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B\nand SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover,\nSANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating\nthe inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x\nspeedup).

Dynamic sparse attention algorithms (DSAs)\nmitigate this by attending only to the key-value (KV) cache of critical tokens.\nHowever, with DSAs, the main performance bottleneck shifts from HBM bandwidth\nto HBM capacity: KV caches for unselected tokens must remain in HBM for\nlow-latency decoding, constraining parallel batch size and stalling further\nthroughput gains. Offloading these underutilized KV caches to DRAM could free\nHBM capacity, allowing larger parallel batch sizes. Yet, achieving such\nhierarchical HBM-DRAM storage raises new challenges, including fragmented KV\ncache access, HBM cache contention, and high HBM demands of hybrid batching,\nthat remain unresolved in prior work.\n  This paper proposes SparseServe, an LLM serving system that unlocks the\nparallel potential of DSAs through efficient hierarchical HBM-DRAM management.\nSparseServe introduces three key innovations to address the challenges\nmentioned above: (1) fragmentation-aware KV cache transfer, which accelerates\nHBM-DRAM data movement through GPU-direct loading (FlashH2D) and CPU-assisted\nsaving (FlashD2H); (2) working-set-aware batch size control that adjusts batch\nsizes based on real-time working set estimation to minimize HBM cache\nthrashing; (3) layer-segmented prefill that bounds HBM use during prefill to a\nsingle layer, enabling efficient execution even for long prompts.

                "summary": "Multi-agent systems (MAS) are increasingly capable of tackling complex\nreal-world tasks, yet their reliance on inter-agent coordination, tool use, and\nlong-horizon reasoning makes error recognition particularly challenging. Minor\nerrors can propagate across agents, escalating into task failures while\nproducing long, intertwined execution trajectories that impose significant\ncosts for both human developers and automated systems to debug and analyze. Our\nkey insight is that, despite surface differences in failure trajectories (e.g.,\nlogs), MAS errors often recur with similar structural patterns. This paper\npresents CORRECT, the first lightweight, training-free framework that leverages\nan online cache of distilled error schemata to recognize and transfer knowledge\nof failure structures across new requests. This cache-based reuse allows LLMs\nto perform targeted error localization at inference time, avoiding the need for\nexpensive retraining while adapting to dynamic MAS deployments in subseconds.\nTo support rigorous study in this domain, we also introduce CORRECT-Error, a\nlarge-scale dataset of over 2,000 annotated trajectories collected through a\nnovel error-injection pipeline guided by real-world distributions, and further\nvalidated through human evaluation to ensure alignment with natural failure\npatterns. Experiments across seven diverse MAS applications show that CORRECT\nimproves step-level error localization up to 19.8% over existing advances while\nat near-zero overhead, substantially narrowing the gap between automated and\nhuman-level error recognition.",

                    "value": "Multi-agent systems (MAS) are increasingly capable of tackling complex\nreal-world tasks, yet their reliance on inter-agent coordination, tool use, and\nlong-horizon reasoning makes error recognition particularly challenging. Minor\nerrors can propagate across agents, escalating into task failures while\nproducing long, intertwined execution trajectories that impose significant\ncosts for both human developers and automated systems to debug and analyze. Our\nkey insight is that, despite surface differences in failure trajectories (e.g.,\nlogs), MAS errors often recur with similar structural patterns. This paper\npresents CORRECT, the first lightweight, training-free framework that leverages\nan online cache of distilled error schemata to recognize and transfer knowledge\nof failure structures across new requests. This cache-based reuse allows LLMs\nto perform targeted error localization at inference time, avoiding the need for\nexpensive retraining while adapting to dynamic MAS deployments in subseconds.\nTo support rigorous study in this domain, we also introduce CORRECT-Error, a\nlarge-scale dataset of over 2,000 annotated trajectories collected through a\nnovel error-injection pipeline guided by real-world distributions, and further\nvalidated through human evaluation to ensure alignment with natural failure\npatterns. Experiments across seven diverse MAS applications show that CORRECT\nimproves step-level error localization up to 19.8% over existing advances while\nat near-zero overhead, substantially narrowing the gap between automated and\nhuman-level error recognition."

To overcome these\nlimitations, we\n  propose VAMamba, a Visual Adaptive Mamba framework with two key innovations.\nFirst,\n  QCLAM(Queue-basedCacheLow-rankAdaptiveMemory)enhancesfeaturelearningthrougha\n  FIFO cache that stores historical representations. Similarity between current\nLoRA-adapted and\n  cached features guides intelligent fusion, enabling dynamic reuse while\neffectively controlling\n  memorygrowth.Second, GPS-SS2D(GreedyPathScanSS2D)introducesadaptive scanning.\nA\n  Vision Transformer generates score maps to estimate pixel importance, and a\ngreedy strategy de termines optimal forward and backward scanning paths. These\nlearned trajectories replace rigid\n  patterns, enabling SS2D to perform targeted feature extraction. The\nintegration of QCLAM and\n  GPS-SS2D allows VAMamba to adaptively focus on degraded regions while\nmaintaining high\n  computational efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration\ntasks demonstrate\n  that VAMamba consistently outperforms existing approaches in both restoration\nquality and\n  efficiency, establishing new benchmarks for adaptive image restoration.

To overcome these\nlimitations, we\n  propose VAMamba, a Visual Adaptive Mamba framework with two key innovations.\nFirst,\n  QCLAM(Queue-basedCacheLow-rankAdaptiveMemory)enhancesfeaturelearningthrougha\n  FIFO cache that stores historical representations. Similarity between current\nLoRA-adapted and\n  cached features guides intelligent fusion, enabling dynamic reuse while\neffectively controlling\n  memorygrowth.Second, GPS-SS2D(GreedyPathScanSS2D)introducesadaptive scanning.\nA\n  Vision Transformer generates score maps to estimate pixel importance, and a\ngreedy strategy de termines optimal forward and backward scanning paths. These\nlearned trajectories replace rigid\n  patterns, enabling SS2D to perform targeted feature extraction. The\nintegration of QCLAM and\n  GPS-SS2D allows VAMamba to adaptively focus on degraded regions while\nmaintaining high\n  computational efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration\ntasks demonstrate\n  that VAMamba consistently outperforms existing approaches in both restoration\nquality and\n  efficiency, establishing new benchmarks for adaptive image restoration. Our\ncode is available\n  at https://github.com/WaterHQH/VAMamba."

To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level\nAR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states\nwith new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable\nlong video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);\nand short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as\nframe sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.\nWith these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model\nto minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days.

We used a nanolaminate dielectric\ncomprising a stack of multiple thin TiO2 and Al2O3 layers as RESURF dielectric\nand for field plate edge termination. Both Wfin of 200 nm and 500 nm\ndemonstrate excellent on-state performance with specific on-resistance (Ron,sp)\nof 9.8-12 mohmcm2, and 10^10 rectification ratio. A self-aligned photoresist\nplanarization and etch-back process was employed to expose the top of the fins\nfor Schottky contact formation, eliminating critical lithographic alignment\nchallenges in sub-micron scale processing. We achieved a breakdown of 2.34 kV\nwith very low leakage currents before catastrophic breakdown. The measured\nbreakdown voltage is limited by dielectric breakdown at the trench bottom\ncorner as verified by metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) test structure. TCAD\nsimulation shows a reduced electric field at the surface of the\nmetal-semiconductor junction due to the RESURF effect, resulting in very low\nreverse leakage before breakdown. The parallel plane electric field in the\n\\b{eta} -Ga2O3 is extracted to be 3.8 MV/cm from TCAD simulations using\naccurately extracted drift layer doping profile from high voltage CV\nmeasurements. A power figure of merit of 0.867 GW/cm2(0.56 GW/cm2 with current\nspreading) was calculated. Enhanced RESURF by integration of high-k dielectrics\nwith self-aligned photoresist planarization, offers a promising pathway towards\nhigh figure of merit, low leakage high-performance vertical devices.",

Finally, we propose the reply\naugmented reinforcement learning method that enables TP agent to periodically\nreplay from a failures experience buffer, emerging notable agentic capacity.

While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising\ndirection, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that\nperforms poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations,\nwe introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid\nstorage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that\nnot all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial\nfirst and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors\nfor attention. Second, for the vast majority of intermediate tokens, it applies\nlow-rank compression by incrementally adapting the projection basis using Oja's\nalgorithm for online principal component analysis. This adaptation involves a\ncomprehensive update during prompt prefilling and lightweight periodic updates\nduring decoding, ensuring the subspace remains aligned with the evolving\ncontext. Crucially, our framework is fully compatible with modern attention\nmodules like FlashAttention.

To\nthis end, we propose a novel decoupled decoding framework that decouples\npositional guidance from content representation, encoding them separately as\nqueries and key-value pairs.

Consequently,\nARPG readily generalizes to zero-shot inference tasks such as image inpainting,\noutpainting, and resolution expansion.

Using an Arepo simulation which\nincorporates a two-moment cosmic ray (CR) transport scheme and a multiphase\ninterstellar medium, we compare magnetic fields inferred from synthetic\nsynchrotron emission maps with the true fields in the simulation. Starting from\nthe derivation of the equipartition formula, we find that the deviation between\nthe equipartition magnetic field and the true magnetic field depends only\nweakly on the ratio of the magnetic to the CR energy density. In practice, for\nboth face-on and edge-on projections, the equipartition model slightly\noverestimates the total synchrotron-weighted magnetic field with mean offsets\nof 32% (0.17 dex) and 36% (0.2 dex), even though the energy equipartition does\nnot hold locally. Beyond these average offsets, a clear trend emerges in\nedge-on projections that the model underestimates the field in the disk and\noverestimates it in the halo. Our results demonstrate that the validity of the\nequipartition model depends only weakly on the strict fulfillment of energy\nequipartition, and that the equipartition model remains a practical method for\nestimating magnetic field strengths in face-on projection maps based on our\nCR-magnetohydrodynamics simulation.",

Our analysis reveals that the inner Galaxy is dominated by\na distinct prolate stellar population with axis ratio $q$=1.30. Consistent with\nprevious work, we find the halo follows a $r^{-4}$ power-law profile that\nflattens within 12 kpc of the Galactic center. We also confirm the halo is\noblate ($q$=0.62) with a tilt angle of $12.22^{\\circ}$. We report for the first\ntime that this tilt aligns the halo major axis in the direction of the\nSagittarius dwarf galaxy.

Our LLM-based fuzzer, LLAMAFUZZ,\nintegrates the power of LLM to understand and mutate structured data to\nfuzzing. We conduct experiments on the standard bug-based benchmark Magma and a\nwide variety of real-world programs. LLAMAFUZZ outperforms our top competitor\nby 41 bugs on average. We also identified 47 unique bugs across all trials.\nMoreover, LLAMAFUZZ demonstrated consistent performance on both bug trigger and\nbug reached.

In\nreal-world projects, developers often rely on broader repository and\nproject-level context beyond the local code to resolve such bugs. In this\npaper, we investigate how automatically extracting and providing such knowledge\ncan improve LLM-based program repair. We propose a layered knowledge injection\nframework that incrementally augments LLMs with structured context. It starts\nwith the Bug Knowledge Layer, which includes information such as the buggy\nfunction and failing tests; expands to the Repository Knowledge Layer, which\nadds structural dependencies, related files, and commit history; and finally\ninjects the Project Knowledge Layer, which incorporates relevant details from\ndocumentation and previously fixed bugs. We evaluate this framework on a\ndataset of 314 bugs from BugsInPy using two LLMs (Llama 3.3 and GPT-4o-mini),\nand analyze fix rates across six bug types. By progressively injecting\nknowledge across layers, our approach achieves a fix rate of 79% (250/314)\nusing Llama 3.3, a significant improvement of 23% over previous work. All bug\ntypes show improvement with the addition of repository-level context, while\nonly a subset benefit further from project-level knowledge, highlighting that\ndifferent bug types require different levels of contextual information for\neffective repair. We also analyze the remaining unresolved bugs and find that\nmore complex and structurally isolated bugs, such as Program Anomaly and GUI\nbugs, remain difficult even after injecting all available information. Our\nresults show that layered context injection improves program repair and suggest\nthe need for interactive and adaptive APR systems.",

In this\npaper, we investigate how automatically extracting and providing such knowledge\ncan improve LLM-based program repair. We propose a layered knowledge injection\nframework that incrementally augments LLMs with structured context. It starts\nwith the Bug Knowledge Layer, which includes information such as the buggy\nfunction and failing tests; expands to the Repository Knowledge Layer, which\nadds structural dependencies, related files, and commit history; and finally\ninjects the Project Knowledge Layer, which incorporates relevant details from\ndocumentation and previously fixed bugs. We evaluate this framework on a\ndataset of 314 bugs from BugsInPy using two LLMs (Llama 3.3 and GPT-4o-mini),\nand analyze fix rates across six bug types. By progressively injecting\nknowledge across layers, our approach achieves a fix rate of 79% (250/314)\nusing Llama 3.3, a significant improvement of 23% over previous work. All bug\ntypes show improvement with the addition of repository-level context, while\nonly a subset benefit further from project-level knowledge, highlighting that\ndifferent bug types require different levels of contextual information for\neffective repair. We also analyze the remaining unresolved bugs and find that\nmore complex and structurally isolated bugs, such as Program Anomaly and GUI\nbugs, remain difficult even after injecting all available information. Our\nresults show that layered context injection improves program repair and suggest\nthe need for interactive and adaptive APR systems."

Inferring the\nintensity of geophysical activity in the core has direct implications for the\npotential hydrothermal activity and supply of chemical species important for\nhabitability to the ocean. We build a statistical framework to constrain the\ninterior using estimates of libration, shape, heat flux, gravity, and total\nmass. We use this framework to examine the extent that geodetic measurements\ncan improve our understanding of the interior structure, with an emphasis on\npartitioning of dissipation between the shell and the core. We quantify\nplausible ranges of gravitational (k2) and displacement (h2, l2) tidal Love\nnumbers consistent with existing observations. We demonstrate that measuring k2\nalone can only constrain the total tidally dissipated energy, but not its\nradial distribution. However, measuring the amplitude and phase of h2 or l2\nfacilitates determining the extent of tidal dissipation in the shell and the\ncore. We provide the precisions required for measuring k2, h2, and l2 that\nenable distinguishing between the main tidal heating scenarios, i.e., in the\nshell versus the core. We also explore the effect of the structural\nheterogeneities of the shell on the tidal response. Lastly, we evaluate the\nefficacy of future geodetic measurements to constrain key interior properties\nessential to understand the present-day (instantaneous) and long-term\n(sustained) habitability at Enceladus.",

We use this framework to examine the extent that geodetic measurements\ncan improve our understanding of the interior structure, with an emphasis on\npartitioning of dissipation between the shell and the core. We quantify\nplausible ranges of gravitational (k2) and displacement (h2, l2) tidal Love\nnumbers consistent with existing observations. We demonstrate that measuring k2\nalone can only constrain the total tidally dissipated energy, but not its\nradial distribution. However, measuring the amplitude and phase of h2 or l2\nfacilitates determining the extent of tidal dissipation in the shell and the\ncore. We provide the precisions required for measuring k2, h2, and l2 that\nenable distinguishing between the main tidal heating scenarios, i.e., in the\nshell versus the core. We also explore the effect of the structural\nheterogeneities of the shell on the tidal response. Lastly, we evaluate the\nefficacy of future geodetic measurements to constrain key interior properties\nessential to understand the present-day (instantaneous) and long-term\n(sustained) habitability at Enceladus."

We characterize weighting schemes that\nensure consistency and asymptotic normality of the weighted GMM estimators,\nenabling valid hypothesis testing and uniform confidence region construction.\nKey applications include dynamic treatment effect estimation and dynamic\noff-policy evaluation."

Existing approaches fall into\npost-training binarization, which is simple but causes severe performance loss,\nand training-aware methods, which depend on full-precision latent weights,\nadding complexity and limiting efficiency. We propose a novel framework that\nrepresents LLMs with multi-kernel Boolean parameters and, for the first time,\nenables direct finetuning LMMs in the Boolean domain, eliminating the need for\nlatent weights. This enhances representational capacity and dramatically\nreduces complexity during both finetuning and inference. Extensive experiments\nacross diverse LLMs show our method outperforms recent ultra low-bit\nquantization and binarization techniques."

As part of the standard\nreporting workflow, a junior radiologist typically prepares a preliminary\nreport, which is then reviewed and edited by a senior radiologist to produce\nthe final report. Identifying semantic differences between preliminary and\nfinal reports is essential for junior doctors, both as a training tool and to\nhelp uncover gaps in clinical knowledge. While AI in radiology is a rapidly\ngrowing field, the application of large language models (LLMs) remains\nchallenging due to the need for specialised domain knowledge. In this paper, we\nexplore the ability of LLMs to provide explainable and accurate comparisons of\nreports in the radiology domain. We begin by comparing the performance of\nseveral LLMs in comparing radiology reports. We then assess a more traditional\napproach based on Named-Entity-Recognition (NER). However, both approaches\nexhibit limitations in delivering accurate feedback on semantic similarity. To\naddress this, we propose Llama-EntScore, a semantic similarity scoring method\nusing a combination of Llama 3.1 and NER with tunable weights to emphasise or\nde-emphasise specific types of differences. Our approach generates a\nquantitative similarity score for tracking progress and also gives an\ninterpretation of the score that aims to offer valuable guidance in reviewing\nand refining their reporting.

Galaxy mergers are a commonly suggested\ncatalyst for starbursts, but once the galaxies coalesce into a single\nkinematically disturbed system, their merger history can be difficult to\nassess. This is particularly true for dwarf galaxies, which are expected to\ndominate the merger rate at all redshifts due to their large numbers. One such\ndwarf galaxy undergoing an enigmatic starburst episode is Henize 2-10, which\nappears to be isolated. Possible scenarios that might have caused the starburst\nepisode include a previous merger or stochastic processes within the galaxy\nitself, such as self-regulation via feedback processes. We present new VLA\n21-cm observations and unpublished archival CARMA CO data to investigate the\ndynamical state and star formation activity in the galaxy. We do not detect an\nHI tail consistent with the structure reported by Kobulnicky et al. (1995),\nwhich was suggested as evidence for a merger or interaction, but rather these\nnew observations indicate an extended HI distribution. We also find that the HI\nappears dynamically decoupled from an extended CO feature (inferred to be a\ntidal tail in previous work), suggesting large-scale dynamical processes of\nsome type are affecting the gas in this system. We provide a meta-analysis of\navailable results to enhance our understanding of what might be triggering the\nstarburst episode in Henize 2-10, and speculate that the large CO feature could\nbe falling into the galaxy and potentially trigger starburst activity.",

Galaxy mergers are a commonly suggested\ncatalyst for starbursts, but once the galaxies coalesce into a single\nkinematically disturbed system, their merger history can be difficult to\nassess. This is particularly true for dwarf galaxies, which are expected to\ndominate the merger rate at all redshifts due to their large numbers. One such\ndwarf galaxy undergoing an enigmatic starburst episode is Henize 2-10, which\nappears to be isolated. Possible scenarios that might have caused the starburst\nepisode include a previous merger or stochastic processes within the galaxy\nitself, such as self-regulation via feedback processes. We present new VLA\n21-cm observations and unpublished archival CARMA CO data to investigate the\ndynamical state and star formation activity in the galaxy. We do not detect an\nHI tail consistent with the structure reported by Kobulnicky et al. (1995),\nwhich was suggested as evidence for a merger or interaction, but rather these\nnew observations indicate an extended HI distribution. We also find that the HI\nappears dynamically decoupled from an extended CO feature (inferred to be a\ntidal tail in previous work), suggesting large-scale dynamical processes of\nsome type are affecting the gas in this system. We provide a meta-analysis of\navailable results to enhance our understanding of what might be triggering the\nstarburst episode in Henize 2-10, and speculate that the large CO feature could\nbe falling into the galaxy and potentially trigger starburst activity."

The test dataset is divided into various subsets\naccording to the topics of the code and complexity of the coding tasks to\nrepresent different scenarios of using LLMs for code generation. We will also\npresent an automated test system for this purpose and report experiments with\nthe Java programs generated in response to prompts given to four\nstate-of-the-art LLMs: Gemini Pro, ChatGPT, Codex, and Falcon.\n  Results: We find that LLM-generated code has a higher incidence of code\nsmells compared to reference solutions. Falcon performed the least badly, with\na smell increase of 42.28%, followed by Gemini Pro (62.07%), ChatGPT (65.05%)\nand finally Codex (84.97%).

To address this challenge, we introduce LPG-Bench, a comprehensive\nbenchmark for evaluating long-prompt-based text-to-image generation. LPG-Bench\nfeatures 200 meticulously crafted prompts with an average length of over 250\nwords, approaching the input capacity of several leading commercial models.\nUsing these prompts, we generate 2,600 images from 13 state-of-the-art models\nand further perform comprehensive human-ranked annotations. Based on LPG-Bench,\nwe observe that state-of-the-art T2I alignment evaluation metrics exhibit poor\nconsistency with human preferences on long-prompt-based image generation. To\naddress the gap, we introduce a novel zero-shot metric based on\ntext-to-image-to-text consistency, termed TIT, for evaluating\nlong-prompt-generated images. The core concept of TIT is to quantify T2I\nalignment by directly comparing the consistency between the raw prompt and the\nLMM-produced description on the generated image, which includes an efficient\nscore-based instantiation TIT-Score and a large-language-model (LLM) based\ninstantiation TIT-Score-LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nframework achieves superior alignment with human judgment compared to\nCLIP-score, LMM-score, etc., with TIT-Score-LLM attaining a 7.31% absolute\nimprovement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline.

We introduce FR-LUX (Friction-aware, Regime-conditioned\nLearning under eXecution costs), a reinforcement learning framework that learns\nafter-cost trading policies and remains robust across volatility-liquidity\nregimes. FR-LUX integrates three ingredients: (i) a microstructure-consistent\nexecution model combining proportional and impact costs, directly embedded in\nthe reward; (ii) a trade-space trust region that constrains changes in\ninventory flow rather than logits, yielding stable low-turnover updates; and\n(iii) explicit regime conditioning so the policy specializes to LL/LH/HL/HH\nstates without fragmenting the data. On a 4 x 5 grid of regimes and cost levels\nwith multiple random seeds, FR-LUX achieves the top average Sharpe ratio with\nnarrow bootstrap confidence intervals, maintains a flatter cost-performance\nslope than strong baselines, and attains superior risk-return efficiency for a\ngiven turnover budget. Pairwise scenario-level improvements are strictly\npositive and remain statistically significant after multiple-testing\ncorrections. We provide formal guarantees on optimality under convex frictions,\nmonotonic improvement under a KL trust region, long-run turnover bounds and\ninduced inaction bands due to proportional costs, positive value advantage for\nregime-conditioned policies, and robustness to cost misspecification. The\nmethodology is implementable: costs are calibrated from standard liquidity\nproxies, scenario-level inference avoids pseudo-replication, and all figures\nand tables are reproducible from released artifacts.",

FR-LUX integrates three ingredients: (i) a microstructure-consistent\nexecution model combining proportional and impact costs, directly embedded in\nthe reward; (ii) a trade-space trust region that constrains changes in\ninventory flow rather than logits, yielding stable low-turnover updates; and\n(iii) explicit regime conditioning so the policy specializes to LL/LH/HL/HH\nstates without fragmenting the data. On a 4 x 5 grid of regimes and cost levels\nwith multiple random seeds, FR-LUX achieves the top average Sharpe ratio with\nnarrow bootstrap confidence intervals, maintains a flatter cost-performance\nslope than strong baselines, and attains superior risk-return efficiency for a\ngiven turnover budget. Pairwise scenario-level improvements are strictly\npositive and remain statistically significant after multiple-testing\ncorrections. We provide formal guarantees on optimality under convex frictions,\nmonotonic improvement under a KL trust region, long-run turnover bounds and\ninduced inaction bands due to proportional costs, positive value advantage for\nregime-conditioned policies, and robustness to cost misspecification. The\nmethodology is implementable: costs are calibrated from standard liquidity\nproxies, scenario-level inference avoids pseudo-replication, and all figures\nand tables are reproducible from released artifacts."

While effective, RAG introduces new risks of external data\nextraction attacks (EDEAs), where sensitive or copyrighted data in its\nknowledge base may be extracted verbatim. These risks are particularly acute\nwhen RAG is used to customize specialized LLM applications with private\nknowledge bases. Despite initial studies exploring these risks, they often lack\na formalized framework, robust attack performance, and comprehensive\nevaluation, leaving critical questions about real-world EDEA feasibility\nunanswered.\n  In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study to formalize EDEAs\nagainst retrieval-augmented LLMs. We first formally define EDEAs and propose a\nunified framework decomposing their design into three components: extraction\ninstruction, jailbreak operator, and retrieval trigger, under which prior\nattacks can be considered instances within our framework.

Specifically, SECRET incorporates (1) an adaptive optimization process\nusing LLMs as optimizers to generate specialized jailbreak prompts for EDEAs,\nand (2) cluster-focused triggering, an adaptive strategy that alternates\nbetween global exploration and local exploitation to efficiently generate\neffective retrieval triggers. Extensive evaluations across 4 models reveal that\nSECRET significantly outperforms previous attacks, and is highly effective\nagainst all 16 tested RAG instances.

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on smaller,\ndomain-specific datasets to improve downstream performance. These datasets\noften contain proprietary or copyrighted material, raising the need for\nreliable safeguards against unauthorized use. Existing membership inference\nattacks (MIAs) and dataset-inference methods typically require access to\ninternal signals such as logits, while current black-box approaches often rely\non handcrafted prompts or a clean reference dataset for calibration, both of\nwhich limit practical applicability. Watermarking is a promising alternative,\nbut prior techniques can degrade text quality or reduce task performance. We\npropose TRACE, a practical framework for fully black-box detection of\ncopyrighted dataset usage in LLM fine-tuning. \\texttt{TRACE} rewrites datasets\nwith distortion-free watermarks guided by a private key, ensuring both text\nquality and downstream utility. At detection time, we exploit the radioactivity\neffect of fine-tuning on watermarked data and introduce an entropy-gated\nprocedure that selectively scores high-uncertainty tokens, substantially\namplifying detection power. Across diverse datasets and model families, TRACE\nconsistently achieves significant detections (p<0.05), often with extremely\nstrong statistical evidence. Furthermore, it supports multi-dataset attribution\nand remains robust even after continued pretraining on large non-watermarked\ncorpora. These results establish TRACE as a practical route to reliable\nblack-box verification of copyrighted dataset usage. We will make our code\navailable at: https://github.com/NusIoraPrivacy/TRACE.",

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on smaller,\ndomain-specific datasets to improve downstream performance. These datasets\noften contain proprietary or copyrighted material, raising the need for\nreliable safeguards against unauthorized use. Existing membership inference\nattacks (MIAs) and dataset-inference methods typically require access to\ninternal signals such as logits, while current black-box approaches often rely\non handcrafted prompts or a clean reference dataset for calibration, both of\nwhich limit practical applicability. Watermarking is a promising alternative,\nbut prior techniques can degrade text quality or reduce task performance. We\npropose TRACE, a practical framework for fully black-box detection of\ncopyrighted dataset usage in LLM fine-tuning. \\texttt{TRACE} rewrites datasets\nwith distortion-free watermarks guided by a private key, ensuring both text\nquality and downstream utility. At detection time, we exploit the radioactivity\neffect of fine-tuning on watermarked data and introduce an entropy-gated\nprocedure that selectively scores high-uncertainty tokens, substantially\namplifying detection power. Across diverse datasets and model families, TRACE\nconsistently achieves significant detections (p<0.05), often with extremely\nstrong statistical evidence. Furthermore, it supports multi-dataset attribution\nand remains robust even after continued pretraining on large non-watermarked\ncorpora. These results establish TRACE as a practical route to reliable\nblack-box verification of copyrighted dataset usage. We will make our code\navailable at: https://github.com/NusIoraPrivacy/TRACE."

To overcome these limitations, we propose THOR\n(Tool-Integrated Hierarchical Optimization via RL). First, we introduce TIRGen,\na multi-agent actor-critic-based pipeline for constructing high-quality\ndatasets of tool-integrated reasoning paths, aligning with the policy and\ngeneralizing well across diverse models. Second, to perform fine-grained\nhierarchical optimization, we introduce an RL strategy that jointly optimizes\nfor both episode-level problem solving and step-level code generation. This is\nmotivated by our key insight that the success of an intermediate tool call is a\nstrong predictor of the final answer's correctness. Finally, THOR incorporates\na self-correction mechanism that leverages immediate tool feedback to\ndynamically revise erroneous reasoning paths during inference. Our approach\ndemonstrates strong generalization across diverse models, performing\neffectively in both reasoning and non-reasoning models. It further achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance for models of a similar scale on multiple\nmathematical benchmarks, while also delivering consistent improvements on code\nbenchmarks.

While most studies and global discussions focus\non generic harms, such as models assisting users in harming themselves or\nothers, enterprises face a more fundamental concern: whether LLM-based agents\nare safe for their intended use case. To address this, we introduce operational\nsafety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user\nqueries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval,\nan evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in\ngeneral and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model\nfamilies comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies\nacross models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the\nstrongest models - Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96% -\nfall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in the\n62-73% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48-70%), and Gemma and\nLlama-3 collapse to 39.53% and 23.84%, respectively. While operational safety\nis a core model alignment issue, to suppress these failures, we propose\nprompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt\ngrounding (P-ground), which substantially improve OOD refusal. Q-ground\nprovides consistent gains of up to 23%, while P-ground delivers even larger\nboosts, raising Llama-3.3 (70B) by 41% and Qwen-3 (30B) by 27%. These results\nhighlight both the urgent need for operational safety interventions and the\npromise of prompt-based steering as a first step toward more reliable LLM-based\nagents.",

However, its initial mass and the amount of mass lost during this\nphase remain uncertain. In this study, we investigate the asteroseismic\nsignatures of mass loss and the parameters that influence it. We examine six\nstars identified as red giant branch (RGB) stars in the APOKASC-2 catalog.\nAssuming these stars are on their first ascent of the RGB, we construct\ninterior models. The resulting model ages are significantly older than the age\nof the Galaxy, indicating that these stars are likely experiencing mass loss\nand evolving toward the red clump (RC) phase. The minimum possible initial\nmasses are estimated using the mass-metallicity diagram, from which we infer\nthat the minimum mass lost by these stars ranges from $0.1$-$0.3{\\rm\nM}_{\\odot}$. Models constructed with an initial minimum mass yield the maximum\npossible age of the star. The ages of these models fall within the range of\n9-9.5Gyr. For two stars, asteroseismic parameters confirm RC classification.\nDue to degeneracies in the HR diagram, distinguishing between internal\nstructure models is challenging; however, asteroseismic constraints provide\nclear differentiation. Although mass-loss and mass-conservation models have\nsimilar $M$, $R$, and $T_{\\rm eff}$ values, $\\Delta\\nu$s determined from the\n$l$=0 modes in the mass-loss models are 5-10$\\%$ higher than observed. This\ndiscrepancy may arise from differences in internal structure. Finally,\nevolutionary model grids are used to examine how initial mass and $Z$ affect\nmass loss. Mass loss increases with increasing metallicity and decreases with\nincreasing initial mass, regardless of the adopted value of $\\eta$.",

                    "value": "Red giant stars play a key role in advancing our understanding of stellar\nmass loss. However, its initial mass and the amount of mass lost during this\nphase remain uncertain. In this study, we investigate the asteroseismic\nsignatures of mass loss and the parameters that influence it. We examine six\nstars identified as red giant branch (RGB) stars in the APOKASC-2 catalog.\nAssuming these stars are on their first ascent of the RGB, we construct\ninterior models. The resulting model ages are significantly older than the age\nof the Galaxy, indicating that these stars are likely experiencing mass loss\nand evolving toward the red clump (RC) phase. The minimum possible initial\nmasses are estimated using the mass-metallicity diagram, from which we infer\nthat the minimum mass lost by these stars ranges from $0.1$-$0.3{\\rm\nM}_{\\odot}$. Models constructed with an initial minimum mass yield the maximum\npossible age of the star. The ages of these models fall within the range of\n9-9.5Gyr. For two stars, asteroseismic parameters confirm RC classification.\nDue to degeneracies in the HR diagram, distinguishing between internal\nstructure models is challenging; however, asteroseismic constraints provide\nclear differentiation. Although mass-loss and mass-conservation models have\nsimilar $M$, $R$, and $T_{\\rm eff}$ values, $\\Delta\\nu$s determined from the\n$l$=0 modes in the mass-loss models are 5-10$\\%$ higher than observed. This\ndiscrepancy may arise from differences in internal structure. Finally,\nevolutionary model grids are used to examine how initial mass and $Z$ affect\nmass loss. Mass loss increases with increasing metallicity and decreases with\nincreasing initial mass, regardless of the adopted value of $\\eta$."

Across both reasoning and\nnon-reasoning models, KG-guided precise retrieval yields substantial gains on\nthe FinReflectKG - MultiHop QA benchmark dataset, boosting correctness scores\nby approximately 24 percent while reducing token utilization by approximately\n84.5 percent compared to the page window setting, which reflects the\ntraditional vector retrieval paradigm.

Using a service-based architecture, critical 5G\ncomponents, such as the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF), Session\nManagement Function (SMF), and User Plane Function (UPF), now run as\ncontainerized pods on Kubernetes clusters. Although this approach improves\nscalability, flexibility, and resilience, it also introduces new security\nchallenges, particularly to ensure the integrity and trustworthiness of these\ncomponents. Current 5G security specifications (for example, 3GPP TS 33.501)\nfocus on communication security and assume that network functions remain\ntrustworthy after authentication, consequently lacking mechanisms to\ncontinuously validate the integrity of NVFs at runtime. To close this gap, and\nto align with Zero Trust principles of 'never trust, always verify', we present\na TPM 2.0-based continuous remote attestation solution for core 5G components\ndeployed on Kubernetes. Our approach uses the Linux Integrity Measurement\nArchitecture (IMA) and a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to provide\nhardware-based runtime validation. We integrate the open-source Keylime\nframework with a custom IMA template that isolates pod-level measurements,\nallowing per-pod integrity verification. A prototype on a k3s cluster\n(consisting of 1 master, 2 worker nodes) was implemented to attest to core\nfunctions, including AMF, SMF and UPF. The experimental results show that the\nsystem detects unauthorized modifications in real time, labels each pod's trust\nstate, and generates detailed audit logs. This work provides hardware-based\ncontinuous attestation for cloud native and edge deployments, strengthening the\nresilience of 5G as critical infrastructure in multi-vendor and\nmission-critical scenarios of 5G.",

Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache\nsemantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size,\nsupporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus,\nwe propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic\ncommunication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the\nsource model's KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic\ntransfer. A learnable gating mechanism selects the target layers that benefit\nfrom cache communication. Compared with text communication, C2C utilizes the\ndeep, specialized semantics from both models, while avoiding explicit\nintermediate text generation. Experiments show that C2C achieves 8.5-10.5%\nhigher average accuracy than individual models.

While this openness creates unprecedented opportunities for\ninnovation, it also expands the attack surface, demanding resilient, low-cost,\nand autonomous security solutions. Legacy defenses remain largely reactive,\nlabor-intensive, and inadequate for the scale and complexity of next-generation\nsystems. Current O-RAN applications focus mainly on network optimization or\npassive threat detection, with limited capability for closed-loop, automated\nresponse.\n  To address this critical gap, we present an agentic AI framework for fully\nautomated, end-to-end threat mitigation in 6G O-RAN environments. MobiLLM\norchestrates security workflows through a modular multi-agent system powered by\nLarge Language Models (LLMs). The framework features a Threat Analysis Agent\nfor real-time data triage, a Threat Classification Agent that uses\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to map anomalies to specific\ncountermeasures, and a Threat Response Agent that safely operationalizes\nmitigation actions via O-RAN control interfaces. Grounded in trusted knowledge\nbases such as the MITRE FiGHT framework and 3GPP specifications, and equipped\nwith robust safety guardrails, MobiLLM provides a blueprint for trustworthy\nAI-driven network security. Initial evaluations demonstrate that MobiLLM can\neffectively identify and orchestrate complex mitigation strategies,\nsignificantly reducing response latency and showcasing the feasibility of\nautonomous security operations in 6G.",

However, research shows that LLMs often lack a deep\nunderstanding of program semantics. Even minor changes to syntax, such as\nrenaming variables, can significantly degrade performance across various tasks.\nIn this work, we examine the task of type prediction: given a partially typed\nprogram, can a model predict a missing type annotations such that the resulting\nprogram is more typed? We construct a dataset of adversarial examples where\nmodels initially predict the correct types, but begin to fail after\nsemantically irrelevant edits. This is problematic, as models should ideally\ngeneralize across different syntactic forms of semantically equivalent code.\nThis lack of robustness suggests that models may have a shallow understanding\nof code semantics. Despite this, we provide evidence that LLMs do, in fact,\nlearn robust mechanisms for type prediction-though these mechanisms often fail\nto activate in adversarial scenarios. By using activation steering, a method\nthat manipulates a model's internal activations to guide it toward using latent\nknowledge, we restore accurate predictions on adversarial inputs. We show that\nsteering successfully activates a type prediction mechanism that is shared by\nboth Python and TypeScript, and is more effective than prompting with\nin-context examples.

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used by software engineers for\nprogramming tasks. However, research shows that LLMs often lack a deep\nunderstanding of program semantics. Even minor changes to syntax, such as\nrenaming variables, can significantly degrade performance across various tasks.\nIn this work, we examine the task of type prediction: given a partially typed\nprogram, can a model predict a missing type annotations such that the resulting\nprogram is more typed? We construct a dataset of adversarial examples where\nmodels initially predict the correct types, but begin to fail after\nsemantically irrelevant edits. This is problematic, as models should ideally\ngeneralize across different syntactic forms of semantically equivalent code.\nThis lack of robustness suggests that models may have a shallow understanding\nof code semantics. Despite this, we provide evidence that LLMs do, in fact,\nlearn robust mechanisms for type prediction-though these mechanisms often fail\nto activate in adversarial scenarios. By using activation steering, a method\nthat manipulates a model's internal activations to guide it toward using latent\nknowledge, we restore accurate predictions on adversarial inputs. We show that\nsteering successfully activates a type prediction mechanism that is shared by\nboth Python and TypeScript, and is more effective than prompting with\nin-context examples. Across five different models, our comprehensive evaluation\ndemonstrates that LLMs can learn generalizable representations of code\nsemantics that transfer across programming languages."

As part of the standard\nreporting workflow, a junior radiologist typically prepares a preliminary\nreport, which is then reviewed and edited by a senior radiologist to produce\nthe final report. Identifying semantic differences between preliminary and\nfinal reports is essential for junior doctors, both as a training tool and to\nhelp uncover gaps in clinical knowledge. While AI in radiology is a rapidly\ngrowing field, the application of large language models (LLMs) remains\nchallenging due to the need for specialised domain knowledge. In this paper, we\nexplore the ability of LLMs to provide explainable and accurate comparisons of\nreports in the radiology domain. We begin by comparing the performance of\nseveral LLMs in comparing radiology reports. We then assess a more traditional\napproach based on Named-Entity-Recognition (NER). However, both approaches\nexhibit limitations in delivering accurate feedback on semantic similarity. To\naddress this, we propose Llama-EntScore, a semantic similarity scoring method\nusing a combination of Llama 3.1 and NER with tunable weights to emphasise or\nde-emphasise specific types of differences. Our approach generates a\nquantitative similarity score for tracking progress and also gives an\ninterpretation of the score that aims to offer valuable guidance in reviewing\nand refining their reporting. We find our method achieves 67% exact-match\naccuracy and 93% accuracy within +/- 1 when compared to radiologist-provided\nground truth scores - outperforming both LLMs and NER used independently.

While existing literature offers various strategies for\ndecomposing monoliths, these approaches primarily focus on architecture-level\nguidance, often overlooking the code-level challenges and dependencies that\ndevelopers must address during the migration. This article introduces a\ncatalogue of seven refactorings specifically designed to support the transition\nto a microservices architecture with a focus on handling dependencies. The\ncatalogue provides developers with a systematic guide that consolidates\nrefactorings identified in the literature and addresses the critical gap in\nsystematizing the process at the code level. By offering a structured,\nstep-by-step approach, this work simplifies the migration process and lays the\ngroundwork for its potential automation, empowering developers to implement\nthese changes efficiently and effectively.",

However, this migration process remains largely manual and\nlabour-intensive. While existing literature offers various strategies for\ndecomposing monoliths, these approaches primarily focus on architecture-level\nguidance, often overlooking the code-level challenges and dependencies that\ndevelopers must address during the migration. This article introduces a\ncatalogue of seven refactorings specifically designed to support the transition\nto a microservices architecture with a focus on handling dependencies. The\ncatalogue provides developers with a systematic guide that consolidates\nrefactorings identified in the literature and addresses the critical gap in\nsystematizing the process at the code level. By offering a structured,\nstep-by-step approach, this work simplifies the migration process and lays the\ngroundwork for its potential automation, empowering developers to implement\nthese changes efficiently and effectively."

                "summary": "Automatic prompt optimization has recently emerged as a strategy for\nimproving the quality of prompts used in Large Language Models (LLMs), with the\ngoal of generating more accurate and useful responses. However, most prior work\nfocuses on direct prompt refinement or model fine-tuning, overlooking the\npotential of leveraging LLMs' inherent reasoning capability to learn from\ncontrasting examples. In this paper, we present Contrastive Reasoning Prompt\nOptimization (CRPO), a novel framework that formulates prompt optimization as a\nretrieval-augmented reasoning process. Our approach retrieves top k reference\nprompt-response pairs from the HelpSteer2 dataset, an open source collection\nwhere each response is annotated for helpfulness, correctness, coherence,\ncomplexity, and verbosity, and constructs two complementary optimization\nparadigms: (1) tiered contrastive reasoning, where the LLM compares high-,\nmedium-, and low-quality exemplars (both prompts and responses) to refine its\nown generation through reflective reasoning, and (2) multi-metric contrastive\nreasoning, where the LLM analyzes the best exemplars along each evaluation\ndimension and integrates their strengths into an optimized prompt. By\nexplicitly contrasting high and low quality exemplars, CRPO enables the model\nto deduce why certain prompts succeed while others fail, thereby achieving more\nrobust and interpretable optimization. Experimental results on the HelpSteer2\nbenchmark demonstrate that CRPO significantly outperforms baselines. Our\nfindings highlight the promise of contrastive, retrieval-augmented reasoning\nfor advancing automatic prompt optimization.",

                    "value": "Automatic prompt optimization has recently emerged as a strategy for\nimproving the quality of prompts used in Large Language Models (LLMs), with the\ngoal of generating more accurate and useful responses. However, most prior work\nfocuses on direct prompt refinement or model fine-tuning, overlooking the\npotential of leveraging LLMs' inherent reasoning capability to learn from\ncontrasting examples. In this paper, we present Contrastive Reasoning Prompt\nOptimization (CRPO), a novel framework that formulates prompt optimization as a\nretrieval-augmented reasoning process. Our approach retrieves top k reference\nprompt-response pairs from the HelpSteer2 dataset, an open source collection\nwhere each response is annotated for helpfulness, correctness, coherence,\ncomplexity, and verbosity, and constructs two complementary optimization\nparadigms: (1) tiered contrastive reasoning, where the LLM compares high-,\nmedium-, and low-quality exemplars (both prompts and responses) to refine its\nown generation through reflective reasoning, and (2) multi-metric contrastive\nreasoning, where the LLM analyzes the best exemplars along each evaluation\ndimension and integrates their strengths into an optimized prompt. By\nexplicitly contrasting high and low quality exemplars, CRPO enables the model\nto deduce why certain prompts succeed while others fail, thereby achieving more\nrobust and interpretable optimization. Experimental results on the HelpSteer2\nbenchmark demonstrate that CRPO significantly outperforms baselines. Our\nfindings highlight the promise of contrastive, retrieval-augmented reasoning\nfor advancing automatic prompt optimization."

However, they still struggle to effectively\nunderstand and follow long and detailed prompts, displaying inconsistent\ngeneration. To address this challenge, we introduce LPG-Bench, a comprehensive\nbenchmark for evaluating long-prompt-based text-to-image generation. LPG-Bench\nfeatures 200 meticulously crafted prompts with an average length of over 250\nwords, approaching the input capacity of several leading commercial models.\nUsing these prompts, we generate 2,600 images from 13 state-of-the-art models\nand further perform comprehensive human-ranked annotations. Based on LPG-Bench,\nwe observe that state-of-the-art T2I alignment evaluation metrics exhibit poor\nconsistency with human preferences on long-prompt-based image generation. To\naddress the gap, we introduce a novel zero-shot metric based on\ntext-to-image-to-text consistency, termed TIT, for evaluating\nlong-prompt-generated images. The core concept of TIT is to quantify T2I\nalignment by directly comparing the consistency between the raw prompt and the\nLMM-produced description on the generated image, which includes an efficient\nscore-based instantiation TIT-Score and a large-language-model (LLM) based\ninstantiation TIT-Score-LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nframework achieves superior alignment with human judgment compared to\nCLIP-score, LMM-score, etc., with TIT-Score-LLM attaining a 7.31% absolute\nimprovement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline. LPG-Bench and TIT\nmethods together offer a deeper perspective to benchmark and foster the\ndevelopment of T2I models. All resources will be made publicly available.",

The extensive length and volume of these guidelines can impede\ntheir utilisation within a time-constrained healthcare system, a challenge this\nproject addresses through the creation of a system capable of providing users\nwith precisely matched information in response to natural language queries. The\nsystem's retrieval architecture, composed of a hybrid embedding mechanism, was\nevaluated against a database of 10,195 text chunks derived from three hundred\nguidelines. It demonstrates high performance, with a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)\nof 0.814, a Recall of 81% at the first chunk and of 99.1% within the top ten\nretrieved chunks, when evaluated on 7901 queries.\n  The most significant impact of the RAG system was observed during the\ngeneration phase. When evaluated on a manually curated dataset of seventy\nquestion-answer pairs, RAG-enhanced models showed substantial gains in\nperformance. Faithfulness, the measure of whether an answer is supported by the\nsource text, was increased by 64.7 percentage points to 99.5% for the\nRAG-enhanced O4-Mini model and significantly outperformed the medical-focused\nMeditron3-8B LLM, which scored 43%. This, combined with a perfect Context\nPrecision score of 1 for all RAG-enhanced models, confirms the system's ability\nto prevent information fabrication by grounding its answers in relevant source\nmaterial. This study thus establishes RAG as an effective, reliable, and\nscalable approach for applying generative AI in healthcare, enabling\ncost-effective access to medical guidelines.",

Faithfulness, the measure of whether an answer is supported by the\nsource text, was increased by 64.7 percentage points to 99.5% for the\nRAG-enhanced O4-Mini model and significantly outperformed the medical-focused\nMeditron3-8B LLM, which scored 43%. This, combined with a perfect Context\nPrecision score of 1 for all RAG-enhanced models, confirms the system's ability\nto prevent information fabrication by grounding its answers in relevant source\nmaterial. This study thus establishes RAG as an effective, reliable, and\nscalable approach for applying generative AI in healthcare, enabling\ncost-effective access to medical guidelines."

By integrating externally retrieved information, RAG\nalleviates issues like outdated knowledge and, crucially, insufficient domain\nexpertise. While effective, RAG introduces new risks of external data\nextraction attacks (EDEAs), where sensitive or copyrighted data in its\nknowledge base may be extracted verbatim. These risks are particularly acute\nwhen RAG is used to customize specialized LLM applications with private\nknowledge bases. Despite initial studies exploring these risks, they often lack\na formalized framework, robust attack performance, and comprehensive\nevaluation, leaving critical questions about real-world EDEA feasibility\nunanswered.\n  In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study to formalize EDEAs\nagainst retrieval-augmented LLMs. We first formally define EDEAs and propose a\nunified framework decomposing their design into three components: extraction\ninstruction, jailbreak operator, and retrieval trigger, under which prior\nattacks can be considered instances within our framework.

Extending RLVR to electronic design automation (EDA), especially\nautomatically generating hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog\nfrom natural-language (NL) specifications, however, poses three key challenges:\nthe lack of automated and accurate verification environments, the scarcity of\nhigh-quality NL-code pairs, and the prohibitive computation cost of RLVR. To\nthis end, we introduce CodeV-R1, an RLVR framework for training Verilog\ngeneration LLMs. First, we develop a rule-based testbench generator that\nperforms robust equivalence checking against golden references. Second, we\npropose a round-trip data synthesis method that pairs open-source Verilog\nsnippets with LLM-generated NL descriptions, verifies code-NL-code consistency\nvia the generated testbench, and filters out inequivalent examples to yield a\nhigh-quality dataset. Third, we employ a two-stage \"distill-then-RL\" training\npipeline: distillation for the cold start of reasoning abilities, followed by\nadaptive DAPO, our novel RLVR algorithm that can reduce training cost by\nadaptively adjusting sampling rate. The resulting model, CodeV-R1-7B, achieves\n68.6% and 72.9% pass@1 on VerilogEval v2 and RTLLM v1.1, respectively,\nsurpassing prior state-of-the-art by 12~20%, while even exceeding the\nperformance of 671B DeepSeek-R1 on RTLLM.

Integrating external\ntools has emerged as a promising approach to bridge this gap. Despite recent\nadvances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: constructing\ntool-integrated reasoning data, performing fine-grained optimization, and\nenhancing inference. To overcome these limitations, we propose THOR\n(Tool-Integrated Hierarchical Optimization via RL). First, we introduce TIRGen,\na multi-agent actor-critic-based pipeline for constructing high-quality\ndatasets of tool-integrated reasoning paths, aligning with the policy and\ngeneralizing well across diverse models. Second, to perform fine-grained\nhierarchical optimization, we introduce an RL strategy that jointly optimizes\nfor both episode-level problem solving and step-level code generation. This is\nmotivated by our key insight that the success of an intermediate tool call is a\nstrong predictor of the final answer's correctness. Finally, THOR incorporates\na self-correction mechanism that leverages immediate tool feedback to\ndynamically revise erroneous reasoning paths during inference. Our approach\ndemonstrates strong generalization across diverse models, performing\neffectively in both reasoning and non-reasoning models. It further achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance for models of a similar scale on multiple\nmathematical benchmarks, while also delivering consistent improvements on code\nbenchmarks.

While most studies and global discussions focus\non generic harms, such as models assisting users in harming themselves or\nothers, enterprises face a more fundamental concern: whether LLM-based agents\nare safe for their intended use case. To address this, we introduce operational\nsafety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user\nqueries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval,\nan evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in\ngeneral and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model\nfamilies comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies\nacross models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the\nstrongest models - Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96% -\nfall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in the\n62-73% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48-70%), and Gemma and\nLlama-3 collapse to 39.53% and 23.84%, respectively. While operational safety\nis a core model alignment issue, to suppress these failures, we propose\nprompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt\ngrounding (P-ground), which substantially improve OOD refusal. Q-ground\nprovides consistent gains of up to 23%, while P-ground delivers even larger\nboosts, raising Llama-3.3 (70B) by 41% and Qwen-3 (30B) by 27%.

In this work, we show that pairing\nLLMs with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) enables interpretation not only of model\nbehavior but also of the deeper structures, themes, and biases embedded in the\ntraining data.

Our key algorithmic\ndesign includes (1) a general deterministic policy-switching strategy that\nachieves low switching cost, (2) a monotonic value function structure with\ncarefully controlled function class complexity, and (3) a variance-weighted\nregression scheme that exploits historical trajectories with high data\nefficiency. MQL-UCB achieves minimax optimal regret of $\\tilde{O}(d\\sqrt{HK})$\nwhen $K$ is sufficiently large and near-optimal policy switching cost of\n$\\tilde{O}(dH)$, with $d$ being the eluder dimension of the function class, $H$\nbeing the planning horizon, and $K$ being the number of episodes.\n  Our work sheds light on designing provably sample-efficient and\ndeployment-efficient Q-learning with nonlinear function approximation."

To address this challenge, we\npropose SelfBudgeter - a novel user-friendly adaptive controllable reasoning\nframework that incorporates a budget estimation mechanism prior to reasoning.\nThe framework adopts a dual-phase training paradigm: during the cold-start\nphase, the model learns to predict token budgets before executing reasoning in\na standardized format; in the reinforcement learning phase, the model is\ntrained to autonomously plan budgets based on problem difficulty and strictly\nadhere to them when generating responses. Since the model outputs budget\nestimates at the initial stage, users can immediately anticipate waiting\nduration, enabling flexible decisions on whether to interrupt or continue the\ngeneration process.

                "summary": "Despite substantial efforts in safety alignment, recent research indicates\nthat Large Language Models (LLMs) remain highly susceptible to jailbreak\nattacks. Among these attacks, finetuning-based ones that compromise LLMs'\nsafety alignment via fine-tuning stand out due to its stable jailbreak\nperformance. In particular, a recent study indicates that fine-tuning with as\nfew as 10 harmful question-answer (QA) pairs can lead to successful\njailbreaking across various harmful questions. However, such malicious\nfine-tuning attacks are readily detectable and hence thwarted by moderation\nmodels. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs can be jailbroken by\nfine-tuning with only 10 benign QA pairs; our attack exploits the increased\nsensitivity of LLMs to fine-tuning data after being overfitted. Specifically,\nour fine-tuning process starts with overfitting an LLM via fine-tuning with\nbenign QA pairs involving identical refusal answers. Further fine-tuning is\nthen performed with standard benign answers, causing the overfitted LLM to\nforget the refusal attitude and thus provide compliant answers regardless of\nthe harmfulness of a question. We implement our attack on the ten LLMs and\ncompare it with five existing baselines. Experiments demonstrate that our\nmethod achieves significant advantages in both attack effectiveness and attack\nstealth. Our findings expose previously unreported security vulnerabilities in\ncurrent LLMs and provide a new perspective on understanding how LLMs' security\nis compromised, even with benign fine-tuning.

                    "value": "Despite substantial efforts in safety alignment, recent research indicates\nthat Large Language Models (LLMs) remain highly susceptible to jailbreak\nattacks. Among these attacks, finetuning-based ones that compromise LLMs'\nsafety alignment via fine-tuning stand out due to its stable jailbreak\nperformance. In particular, a recent study indicates that fine-tuning with as\nfew as 10 harmful question-answer (QA) pairs can lead to successful\njailbreaking across various harmful questions. However, such malicious\nfine-tuning attacks are readily detectable and hence thwarted by moderation\nmodels. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs can be jailbroken by\nfine-tuning with only 10 benign QA pairs; our attack exploits the increased\nsensitivity of LLMs to fine-tuning data after being overfitted. Specifically,\nour fine-tuning process starts with overfitting an LLM via fine-tuning with\nbenign QA pairs involving identical refusal answers. Further fine-tuning is\nthen performed with standard benign answers, causing the overfitted LLM to\nforget the refusal attitude and thus provide compliant answers regardless of\nthe harmfulness of a question. We implement our attack on the ten LLMs and\ncompare it with five existing baselines. Experiments demonstrate that our\nmethod achieves significant advantages in both attack effectiveness and attack\nstealth. Our findings expose previously unreported security vulnerabilities in\ncurrent LLMs and provide a new perspective on understanding how LLMs' security\nis compromised, even with benign fine-tuning.

Using five open-source LLMs, we\nsystematically examine how different persona prompt strategies, specifically\nrole adoption formats and demographic priming strategies, influence LLM\nsimulations across 15 intersectional demographic groups in both open- and\nclosed-ended tasks. Our findings show that LLMs struggle to simulate\nmarginalized groups but that the choice of demographic priming and role\nadoption strategy significantly impacts their portrayal. Specifically, we find\nthat prompting in an interview-style format and name-based priming can help\nreduce stereotyping and improve alignment.

In this paper, we present the\nlatest advancements on MarketSenseAI, driven by rapid technological expansion\nin LLMs. Through a novel architecture combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation\nand LLM agents, the framework processes SEC filings and earnings calls, while\nenriching macroeconomic analysis through systematic processing of diverse\ninstitutional reports. We demonstrate a significant improvement in fundamental\nanalysis accuracy over the previous version. Empirical evaluation on S\\&P 100\nstocks over two years (2023-2024) shows MarketSenseAI achieving cumulative\nreturns of 125.9% compared to the index return of 73.5%, while maintaining\ncomparable risk profiles. Further validation on S\\&P 500 stocks during 2024\ndemonstrates the framework's scalability, delivering a 33.8% higher Sortino\nratio than the market. This work marks a significant advancement in applying\nLLM technology to financial analysis, offering insights into the robustness of\nLLM-driven investment strategies.",
