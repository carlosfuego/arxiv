Previous research aimed\nat reducing visual tokens during inference typically leverages importance maps\nderived from attention scores among vision-only tokens or vision-language\ntokens to prune tokens across one or multiple pruning stages. Despite this\nprogress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and\ninsufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance\ndegradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that\nintroduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning\nmodule with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy\nare further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically,\nwe compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived\ncontext relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which\ntokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to\navoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information\nflow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most\nrepresentative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the\ndiscrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning,\nthereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs.\nExperiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while\nmaintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache\nmemory and 3.8 times faster inference.",

In this paper, we propose p-MoD, an efficient MLLM\narchitecture that significantly reduces training and inference costs while\nmaintaining model performance. The majority of computation in MLLMs stems from\nthe overwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer-based\nLLM. Accordingly, we leverage the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each\nLLM layer selects essential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant\nones. However, integrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the\nchallenges of training and inference stability as well as limited training\ndata, we adapt the MoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight\nnormalization (TanhNorm) and symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we\nobserve that vision tokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layers and thus\ndesign a progressive ratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the\ntoken retention ratio layer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This\ncrucial design fully unleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the\nefficiency and performance of our models. Extensive experiments on two baseline\nmodels across 15 benchmarks show that our model matches or even surpasses the\nperformance of corresponding baselines, while requiring only 55.6% TFLOPs and\n53.7% KV cache storage during inference, and 77.7% GPU hours during training.",

                "summary": "Modern large-scale services such as search engines, messaging platforms, and\nserverless functions, rely on key-value (KV) stores to maintain high\nperformance at scale. When such services are deployed in constrained memory\nenvironments, they present challenging requirements: point operations requiring\nhigh throughput, working sets much larger than main memory, and natural skew in\nkey access patterns. Traditional KV stores, based on LSM- and B-Trees, have\nbeen widely used to handle such use cases, but they often suffer from\nsuboptimal use of modern hardware resources. The FASTER project, developed as a\nhigh-performance open-source KV storage library, has demonstrated remarkable\nsuccess in both in-memory and hybrid storage environments. However, when tasked\nwith serving large skewed workloads, it faced challenges, including high\nindexing and compactions overheads, and inefficient management of\nnon-overlapping read-hot and write-hot working sets.\n  In this paper, we introduce F2 (for FASTER v2), an evolution of FASTER\ndesigned to meet the requirements of large skewed workloads common in industry\napplications. F2 adopts a two-tier record-oriented design to handle\nlarger-than-memory skewed workloads, along with new concurrent latch-free\nmechanisms and components to maximize performance on modern hardware. To\nrealize this design, F2 tackles key challenges and introduces several\ninnovations, including new latch-free algorithms for multi-threaded log\ncompaction, a two-level hash index to reduce indexing overhead for cold\nrecords, and a read-cache for serving read-hot records. Our evaluation shows\nthat F2 achieves 2-11.9x better throughput compared to existing KV stores,\neffectively serving the target workload. F2 is open-source and available as\npart of the FASTER project.",

To address this challenge, we introduce\nESeMan (Event Sequence Manager), an event sequence management system designed\nto support interactive rendering of timeline visualizations with tunable\naccuracy. ESeMan employs hierarchical data structures and intelligent caching\nto provide visualizations with only the data necessary to generate accurate\nsummarizations with significantly reduced data fetch time. We evaluate ESeMan's\nquery times against summed area tables, M4 aggregation, and statistical\nsub-sampling on a variety of program execution traces. Our results demonstrate\nESeMan provides better performance, achieving sub-100ms fetch times while\nmaintaining visualization accuracy at the pixel level. We further present our\nbenchmarking harness, enabling future performance evaluations for event\nsequence visualization."

To alleviate this situation, we present BiTHaC which\nrealizes bidirectional TLS handshake caching by exploiting that significant\nparts of repeated TLS handshakes, especially certificates, are static. Thus,\nredundant information neither needs to be transmitted nor corresponding\ncomputations performed, saving valuable bandwidth and processing resources.

                    "value": "While TLS has become the de-facto standard for end-to-end security, its use\nto secure critical communication in evolving industrial IoT scenarios is\nseverely limited by prevalent resource constraints of devices and networks.\nMost notably, the TLS handshake to establish secure connections incurs\nsignificant bandwidth and processing overhead that often cannot be handled in\nconstrained environments. To alleviate this situation, we present BiTHaC which\nrealizes bidirectional TLS handshake caching by exploiting that significant\nparts of repeated TLS handshakes, especially certificates, are static. Thus,\nredundant information neither needs to be transmitted nor corresponding\ncomputations performed, saving valuable bandwidth and processing resources.

CUs decide whether to\nrequest content from a CP and which eRRH to send the request to, while eRRHs\ndecide whether to command CPs to update content or use cached content. We study\ntwo general classes of policies: (i) oblivious policies, where decision-making\nis independent of historical information, and (ii) non-oblivious policies,\nwhere decisions are influenced by historical information. First, we obtain\nclosed-form expressions for the average AoI of eRRHs under both policy types.\nDue to the complexity of calculating closed-form expressions for CUs, we then\nderive general upper bounds for their average AoI. Next, we identify optimal\npolicies for both types. Under both optimal policies, each CU requests content\nfrom each CP at an equal rate, consolidating all requests to a single eRRH when\ndemand is low or resources are limited, and distributing requests evenly among\neRRHs when demand is high and resources are ample. eRRHs command content from\neach CP at an equal rate under an optimal oblivious policy, while prioritize\nthe CP with the highest age under an optimal non-oblivious policy. Our\nnumerical results validate these theoretical findings.",

We study\ntwo general classes of policies: (i) oblivious policies, where decision-making\nis independent of historical information, and (ii) non-oblivious policies,\nwhere decisions are influenced by historical information. First, we obtain\nclosed-form expressions for the average AoI of eRRHs under both policy types.\nDue to the complexity of calculating closed-form expressions for CUs, we then\nderive general upper bounds for their average AoI. Next, we identify optimal\npolicies for both types. Under both optimal policies, each CU requests content\nfrom each CP at an equal rate, consolidating all requests to a single eRRH when\ndemand is low or resources are limited, and distributing requests evenly among\neRRHs when demand is high and resources are ample. eRRHs command content from\neach CP at an equal rate under an optimal oblivious policy, while prioritize\nthe CP with the highest age under an optimal non-oblivious policy. Our\nnumerical results validate these theoretical findings."

However, existing\ntoken-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their\nirreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns\nduring decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both\nmarginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the\ncollective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal\ninformation over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two\ncompensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices\nbetween LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted\ncompensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention\nmatching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in\nperceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller\nmodel's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger\nmodel. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and\nLongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV. Moreover, efficiency\nevaluations show that SmallKV achieves 1.75 - 2.56 times higher throughput than\nbaseline methods, highlighting its potential for efficient and performant LLM\ninference in resource constrained environments.",

Unlike prior approaches that rely on model-specific internal features,\nMoDM caches final images, allowing seamless retrieval and reuse across multiple\ndiffusion model families.\n  This design enables adaptive serving by dynamically balancing latency and\nimage quality: using smaller models for cache-hit requests to reduce latency\nwhile reserving larger models for cache-miss requests to maintain quality.\nSmall model image quality is preserved using retrieved cached images.\n  We design a global monitor that optimally allocates GPU resources and\nbalances inference workload, ensuring high throughput while meeting\nservice-level objectives under varying request rates.

Unlike prior approaches that rely on model-specific internal features,\nMoDM caches final images, allowing seamless retrieval and reuse across multiple\ndiffusion model families.\n  This design enables adaptive serving by dynamically balancing latency and\nimage quality: using smaller models for cache-hit requests to reduce latency\nwhile reserving larger models for cache-miss requests to maintain quality.\nSmall model image quality is preserved using retrieved cached images.\n  We design a global monitor that optimally allocates GPU resources and\nbalances inference workload, ensuring high throughput while meeting\nservice-level objectives under varying request rates. Our evaluations show that\nMoDM significantly reduces average serving time by 2.5x while retaining image\nquality, making it a practical solution for scalable and resource-efficient\nmodel deployment."

In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that\nenables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt\ndynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid\ndistillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft\nand target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive\ndrafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM\napplications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major\npoints of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above\nchallenges and motivates the \\textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We\nshowcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online\nlearning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks.

In our experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves\nstrong performance on video benchmarks, reaching 65.1% and 71.1% accuracy on\nVideoMME without and with subtitles, respectively, and consistently\noutperforming LongVILA-7B across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, LongVILA-R1-7B\nsupports processing up to 8,192 video frames per video, and configurable FPS\nsettings. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video\nRL training. In addition, we release our training system for public\navailability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and\naudio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video\ngeneration models.

With broad applications in network science and\ndistributed optimization, recent innovations like the self-repellent random\nwalk (SRRW) achieve near-zero variance by prioritizing under-sampled states\nthrough transition kernel modifications based on past visit frequencies.\nHowever, SRRW's reliance on explicit computation of transition probabilities\nfor all neighbors at each step introduces substantial computational overhead,\nwhile its strict dependence on time-reversible Markov chains excludes advanced\nnon-reversible MCMC methods. To overcome these limitations, instead of direct\nmodification of transition kernel, HDT introduces a history-dependent target\ndistribution $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}[\\mathbf{x}]$ to replace the original target\n$\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ in any graph sampler, where $\\mathbf{x}$ represents the\nempirical measure of past visits. This design preserves lightweight\nimplementation by requiring only local information between the current and\nproposed states and achieves compatibility with both reversible and\nnon-reversible MCMC samplers, while retaining unbiased samples with target\ndistribution $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ and near-zero variance performance. Extensive\nexperiments in graph sampling demonstrate consistent performance gains, and a\nmemory-efficient Least Recently Used (LRU) cache ensures scalability to large\ngeneral graphs.",

With broad applications in network science and\ndistributed optimization, recent innovations like the self-repellent random\nwalk (SRRW) achieve near-zero variance by prioritizing under-sampled states\nthrough transition kernel modifications based on past visit frequencies.\nHowever, SRRW's reliance on explicit computation of transition probabilities\nfor all neighbors at each step introduces substantial computational overhead,\nwhile its strict dependence on time-reversible Markov chains excludes advanced\nnon-reversible MCMC methods. To overcome these limitations, instead of direct\nmodification of transition kernel, HDT introduces a history-dependent target\ndistribution $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}[\\mathbf{x}]$ to replace the original target\n$\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ in any graph sampler, where $\\mathbf{x}$ represents the\nempirical measure of past visits. This design preserves lightweight\nimplementation by requiring only local information between the current and\nproposed states and achieves compatibility with both reversible and\nnon-reversible MCMC samplers, while retaining unbiased samples with target\ndistribution $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ and near-zero variance performance. Extensive\nexperiments in graph sampling demonstrate consistent performance gains, and a\nmemory-efficient Least Recently Used (LRU) cache ensures scalability to large\ngeneral graphs."

Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel\nMulti-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces\nboth KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention\nexpressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed\ninference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers\ninto specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost\nefficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared\nwith models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at\nlonger context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per\ntoken (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that\nhardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are\ncritical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with\nDeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios. Our implementation on Hopper GPUs\nachieves a decoding throughput of up to 4,039 tokens per second per GPU under\n50ms TPOT SLA (4K context, FP8, no MTP). It is higher than DeepSeek-V3's 2,324\nin the same setup and sets a new Pareto frontier for LLM decoding.",

Unlike conventional speaker-tracing buffers, AOSC orders embeddings\nby speaker index corresponding to their arrival time order, and is dynamically\nupdated by selecting frames with the highest scores based on the model's past\npredictions. Notably, the number of stored embeddings per speaker is determined\ndynamically by the update mechanism, ensuring efficient cache utilization and\nprecise speaker tracking. Experiments on benchmark datasets confirm the\neffectiveness and flexibility of our approach, even in low-latency setups.\nThese results establish Streaming Sortformer as a robust solution for real-time\nmulti-speaker tracking and a foundation for streaming multi-talker speech\nprocessing.",

As a result, serverless is becoming\nincreasingly popular to support highly elastic and bursty workloads. However,\nexisting platforms are supported by bloated virtualization stacks, which,\ncombined with bursty and irregular invocations, lead to high memory and latency\noverheads.\n  To reduce the virtualization stack bloat, we propose Hydra, a virtualized\nmulti-language runtime and platform capable of hosting multiple sandboxes\nrunning concurrently. To fully leverage Hydra's virtualized runtime, we revisit\nthe existing serverless platform design to make it colocation-aware across\nowners and functions, and to feature a caching layer of pre-allocated Hydra\ninstances that can be used by different functions written in different\nlanguages to reduce cold starts. We also propose a snapshotting mechanism to\ncheckpoint and restore individual sandboxes.\n  By consolidating multiple serverless function invocations through Hydra, we\nimprove the overall function density (ops/GB-sec) by 2.41x on average compared\nto OpenWhisk runtimes, the state-of-the-art single-language runtimes used in\nmost serverless platforms, and by 1.43x on average compared to Knative runtimes\nsupporting invocation colocation within the same function. When reproducing the\nAzure Functions trace, our serverless platform operating Hydra instances\nreduces the overall memory footprint by 21.3-43.9% compared to operating\nOpenWhisk instances and by 14.5-30% compared to operating Knative instances.\nHydra eliminates cold starts thanks to the pool of pre-warmed runtime\ninstances, reducing p99 latency by 45.3-375.5x compared to OpenWhisk and by\n1.9-51.4x compared to Knative.",

This enables adaptive memory control, supports\nconstant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more\nflexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global\ncontext compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory,\nforming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and\nfine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware\nalgorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive\nexperiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher\nmodel's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while\nsignificantly outperforming previous linearization methods.

In the in-distribution setting, our approach achieves a\n96.93% success rate, which is over 8.80% higher than the previous\nstate-of-the-art baselines with over 3.72 times fewer collisions and 2.43 times\nfewer intrusions into ground-truth human future trajectories. In three\nout-of-distribution scenarios, our method shows much stronger robustness when\nfacing distribution shifts in velocity variations, policy changes, and\ntransitions from individual to group dynamics. We deploy our method on a real\nrobot, and experiments show that the robot makes safe and robust decisions when\ninteracting with both sparse and dense crowds.

As AI systems begin to exhaust\nhigh-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for\nreward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges\nthat could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The\nproposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated\ndata, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on\nextensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the\nbottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we\nidentify as the \\textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI\nsystems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to\nchanging circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing\nexternal reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,\nallowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a\nunified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative\nworld models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create\nagents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with\nhuman values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that\ncan develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical\nconstraints.",

                    "value": "This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation\nfor developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without\ncontinuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust\nhigh-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for\nreward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges\nthat could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The\nproposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated\ndata, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on\nextensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the\nbottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we\nidentify as the \\textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI\nsystems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to\nchanging circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing\nexternal reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,\nallowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a\nunified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative\nworld models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create\nagents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with\nhuman values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that\ncan develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical\nconstraints."

Currently, there are two mainstream\nreward paradigms: model-based rewards and rule-based rewards. However, both\napproaches suffer from limitations: rule-based rewards lack robustness, while\nmodel-based rewards are vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these issues,\nwe propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework\nthat jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper\nleverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct\nresponses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample\npairs for continued training the reward model. This design enhances robustness\nand mitigates the risk of reward hacking. To further support Cooper, we\nintroduce a hybrid annotation strategy that efficiently and accurately\ngenerates training data for the reward model. We also propose a reference-based\nreward modeling paradigm, where the reward model takes a reference answer as\ninput. Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM, which\nachieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench compared to other models of the same\nsize. We conduct reinforcement learning using both VerifyRM and Cooper. Our\nexperiments show that Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also\nimproves end-to-end RL performance, for instance, achieving a 0.54% gain in\naverage accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct. Our findings demonstrate that\ndynamically updating reward model is an effective way to combat reward hacking,\nproviding a reference for better integrating reward models into RL.",

                "summary": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential\nsubtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains\nchallenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to\nsupport reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited\ncapacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories\ncaused by fragmented architectures.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought\nframework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a\nsingle unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image\nunderstanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving\nvisual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is\nnon-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To\naddress this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A\nMacro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask\nexecution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.\nFurthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines\ninterleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task\nobjectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to\nperform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our\ndesign, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs\nwith 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation\nbenchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT\ndemonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT\nas a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning.

Experiments across five benchmarks,\ncategorized as easy & medium (GSM8K, MATH-500) and hard (AIME2024, AIME2025,\nOlympiadBench), show that MathSmith consistently outperforms existing baselines\nunder both short and long CoT settings. Additionally, a weakness-focused\nvariant generation module enables targeted improvement on specific concepts.\nOverall, MathSmith exhibits strong scalability, generalization, and\ntransferability, highlighting the promise of high-difficulty synthetic data in\nadvancing LLM reasoning capabilities."

These trajectories contain\nrich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving\nproblems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they\nignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of\nsearch spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To\naddress these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that\nenables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach\nrevisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations:\nrevision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables\ntwo critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by\nintelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories,\nand (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance\nperformance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through\nthese mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that\nincrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench\nVerified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five\nstrong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative\nimprovement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source\nagents on SWE-bench Verified.

                "summary": "Due to their ability to process long and complex contexts, LLMs can offer key\nbenefits to the Legal domain, but their adoption has been hindered by their\ntendency to generate unfaithful, ungrounded, or hallucinatory outputs. While\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation offers a promising solution by grounding\ngenerations in external knowledge, it offers no guarantee that the provided\ncontext will be effectively integrated. To address this, context-aware decoding\nstrategies have been proposed to amplify the influence of relevant context, but\nthey usually do not explicitly enforce faithfulness to the context.

While\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation offers a promising solution by grounding\ngenerations in external knowledge, it offers no guarantee that the provided\ncontext will be effectively integrated. To address this, context-aware decoding\nstrategies have been proposed to amplify the influence of relevant context, but\nthey usually do not explicitly enforce faithfulness to the context.

While recent studies demonstrated the\nmerits of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in various video\nunderstanding tasks, their application to multimodal content moderation, a\ndomain that requires nuanced understanding of both visual and textual cues,\nremains relatively underexplored. In this work, we benchmark the capabilities\nof MLLMs in brand safety classification, a critical subset of content\nmoderation for safe-guarding advertising integrity. To this end, we introduce a\nnovel, multimodal and multilingual dataset, meticulously labeled by\nprofessional reviewers in a multitude of risk categories. Through a detailed\ncomparative analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MLLMs such as Gemini,\nGPT, and Llama in multimodal brand safety, and evaluate their accuracy and cost\nefficiency compared to professional human reviewers. Furthermore, we present an\nin-depth discussion shedding light on limitations of MLLMs and failure cases.\nWe are releasing our dataset alongside this paper to facilitate future research\non effective and responsible brand safety and content moderation.",

                    "value": "As the volume of video content online grows exponentially, the demand for\nmoderation of unsafe videos has surpassed human capabilities, posing both\noperational and mental health challenges. While recent studies demonstrated the\nmerits of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in various video\nunderstanding tasks, their application to multimodal content moderation, a\ndomain that requires nuanced understanding of both visual and textual cues,\nremains relatively underexplored. In this work, we benchmark the capabilities\nof MLLMs in brand safety classification, a critical subset of content\nmoderation for safe-guarding advertising integrity. To this end, we introduce a\nnovel, multimodal and multilingual dataset, meticulously labeled by\nprofessional reviewers in a multitude of risk categories. Through a detailed\ncomparative analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MLLMs such as Gemini,\nGPT, and Llama in multimodal brand safety, and evaluate their accuracy and cost\nefficiency compared to professional human reviewers. Furthermore, we present an\nin-depth discussion shedding light on limitations of MLLMs and failure cases.\nWe are releasing our dataset alongside this paper to facilitate future research\non effective and responsible brand safety and content moderation."

However, ERC data remains scarce, and existing datasets\nface numerous challenges due to their highly biased sources and the inherent\nsubjectivity of soft labels. Even though Large Language Models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated their quality in many affective tasks, they are typically\nexpensive to train, and their application to ERC tasks--particularly in data\ngeneration--remains limited. To address these challenges, we employ a small,\nresource-efficient, and general-purpose LLM to synthesize ERC datasets with\ndiverse properties, supplementing the three most widely used ERC benchmarks. We\ngenerate six novel datasets, with two tailored to enhance each benchmark. We\nevaluate the utility of these datasets to (1) supplement existing datasets for\nERC classification, and (2) analyze the effects of label imbalance in ERC. Our\nexperimental results indicate that ERC classifier models trained on the\ngenerated datasets exhibit strong robustness and consistently achieve\nstatistically significant performance improvements on existing ERC benchmarks.",

In this work, we\nintroduce a novel medical assistant system, optimized through our\ngeneral-purpose compression framework, which tailors Large Language Models\n(LLMs) for deployment in specialized domains. By measuring neuron saliency on\ndomain-specific data, our method can aggressively prune irrelevant neurons,\nreducing model size while preserving performance. Following pruning, we apply\npost-training quantization to further reduce the memory footprint, and evaluate\nthe compressed model across medical benchmarks including MedMCQA, MedQA, and\nPubMedQA. We also deploy the 50\\% compressed Gemma and the 67\\% compressed\nLLaMA3 models on Jetson Orin Nano (18.7W peak) and Raspberry Pi 5 (6.3W peak),\nachieving real-time, energy-efficient inference under hardware constraints."

In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel approach inspired by the Real-Time Iteration (RTI) Scheme, a\nmethod from optimal control that accelerates optimization by leveraging\nsolutions from previous time steps as initial guesses for subsequent\niterations. We explore the application of this scheme in diffusion inference\nand propose a scaling-based method to effectively handle discrete actions, such\nas grasping, in robotic manipulation. The proposed scheme significantly reduces\nruntime computational costs without the need for distillation or policy\nredesign. This enables a seamless integration into many pre-trained\ndiffusion-based models, in particular, to resource-demanding large models. We\nalso provide theoretical conditions for the contractivity which could be useful\nfor estimating the initial denoising step.

Our approach is structured into two key components: weather background\nediting and weather particle construction. For weather background editing, we\nintroduce an all-in-one adapter that integrates multiple weather styles into a\nsingle pretrained diffusion model, enabling the generation of diverse weather\neffects in 2D image backgrounds. During inference, we design a Temporal-View\n(TV-) attention mechanism that follows a specific order to aggregate temporal\nand spatial information, ensuring consistent editing across multi-frame and\nmulti-view images. To construct the weather particles, we first reconstruct a\n3D scene using the edited images and then introduce a dynamic 4D Gaussian field\nto generate snowflakes, raindrops and fog in the scene. The attributes and\ndynamics of these particles are precisely controlled through physical-based\nmodelling and simulation, ensuring realistic weather representation and\nflexible severity adjustments. Finally, we integrate the 4D Gaussian field with\nthe 3D scene to render consistent and highly realistic weather effects.\nExperiments on multiple driving datasets demonstrate that WeatherEdit can\ngenerate diverse weather effects with controllable condition severity,\nhighlighting its potential for autonomous driving simulation in adverse\nweather.

We\npropose Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a framework that enables\ndual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution directly\nfrom RGB and Depth human demonstrations. GF-VLA first extracts\nShannon-information-based cues to identify hands and objects with the highest\ntask relevance, then encodes these cues into temporally ordered scene graphs\nthat capture both hand-object and object-object interactions. These graphs are\nfused with a language-conditioned transformer that generates hierarchical\nbehavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion commands. To improve\nexecution efficiency in bimanual settings, we further introduce a cross-hand\nselection policy that infers optimal gripper assignment without explicit\ngeometric reasoning. We evaluate GF-VLA on four structured dual-arm block\nassembly tasks involving symbolic shape construction and spatial\ngeneralization. Experimental results show that the information-theoretic scene\nrepresentation achieves over 95 percent graph accuracy and 93 percent subtask\nsegmentation, supporting the LLM planner in generating reliable and\nhuman-readable task policies. When executed by the dual-arm robot, these\npolicies yield 94 percent grasp success, 89 percent placement accuracy, and 90\npercent overall task success across stacking, letter-building, and geometric\nreconfiguration scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization and robustness\nacross diverse spatial and semantic variations.",

This can lead to the use of suboptimal models, resulting in subpar\npredictive accuracy, slow evaluations, or poor generalisation, hindering\neffective real-time decision-making and process optimisation. In this work, we\ndiscuss applying k-fold cross-validation to assess regression models for\ntabular DEM datasets and propose a simple framework for readers to follow to\nfind the optimal model for their data. An example demonstrates its application\nto a DEM dataset of packing fractions measured in a simple measuring beaker\nwith varying inter-particle properties, namely, average particle diameter,\ncoefficient of restitution, coefficient of sliding friction, coefficient of\nrolling resistance, and cohesive energy density. Out of 16 different models\ntested, a histogram-based gradient boosting model was found to be optimal,\nproviding a good fit with acceptable training and inference times.",

This can lead to the use of suboptimal models, resulting in subpar\npredictive accuracy, slow evaluations, or poor generalisation, hindering\neffective real-time decision-making and process optimisation. In this work, we\ndiscuss applying k-fold cross-validation to assess regression models for\ntabular DEM datasets and propose a simple framework for readers to follow to\nfind the optimal model for their data. An example demonstrates its application\nto a DEM dataset of packing fractions measured in a simple measuring beaker\nwith varying inter-particle properties, namely, average particle diameter,\ncoefficient of restitution, coefficient of sliding friction, coefficient of\nrolling resistance, and cohesive energy density. Out of 16 different models\ntested, a histogram-based gradient boosting model was found to be optimal,\nproviding a good fit with acceptable training and inference times."

Specifically, through sketches with the theme of \"a person picking an\napple from a tree (PPAT)\", it can be revealed whether the participants are in\nmental states such as depression. Compared with scales, the DPT can enrich\npsychologists' understanding of an individual's mental state. However, the\ninterpretation of the PPAT is laborious and depends on the experience of the\npsychologists. To address this issue, we propose an effective identification\nmethod to support psychologists in conducting a large-scale automatic DPT.\nUnlike traditional sketch recognition, DPT more focus on the overall evaluation\nof the sketches, such as color usage and space utilization. Moreover, PPAT\nimposes a time limit and prohibits verbal reminders, resulting in low drawing\naccuracy and a lack of detailed depiction. To address these challenges, we\npropose the following efforts: (1) Providing an experimental environment for\nautomated analysis of PPAT sketches for depression assessment; (2) Offering a\nVisual-Semantic depression assessment based on LLM (VS-LLM) method; (3)\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method improves by 17.6% compared to\nthe psychologist assessment method.

To address these challenges, we\nintroduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore\nhuman-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically\ngrounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free\nGeneral Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly\nknowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer\ninteraction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners\nover a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis\nreveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our\nspecially designed \"trap questions\" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's\nshallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct\nlearners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners'\nself-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing\nsurprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4)\nCritically, the default profile of base LLM is a \"diligent but brittle Surface\nLearner\"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true,\ngeneralizable understanding.

                "summary": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential\nsubtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains\nchallenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to\nsupport reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited\ncapacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories\ncaused by fragmented architectures.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought\nframework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a\nsingle unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image\nunderstanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving\nvisual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is\nnon-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To\naddress this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A\nMacro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask\nexecution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.\nFurthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines\ninterleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task\nobjectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to\nperform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our\ndesign, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs\nwith 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation\nbenchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT\ndemonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT\nas a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning.

                    "value": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential\nsubtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains\nchallenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to\nsupport reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited\ncapacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories\ncaused by fragmented architectures.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought\nframework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a\nsingle unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image\nunderstanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving\nvisual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is\nnon-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To\naddress this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A\nMacro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask\nexecution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.\nFurthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines\ninterleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task\nobjectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to\nperform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our\ndesign, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs\nwith 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation\nbenchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT\ndemonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT\nas a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning.

While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated\ntasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory\nleading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain\nrich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving\nproblems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they\nignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of\nsearch spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To\naddress these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that\nenables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach\nrevisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations:\nrevision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables\ntwo critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by\nintelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories,\nand (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance\nperformance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through\nthese mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that\nincrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench\nVerified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five\nstrong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative\nimprovement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source\nagents on SWE-bench Verified.

The process iterates through these levels,\nhalting early if a convergence criterion is met: specifically, if two or more\nconsecutive levels yield the same answer, the solution from the earliest such\nlevel is output; otherwise, the process continues until all levels are\ncompleted. Through extensive experiments across five popular math reasoning\ndatasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of BloomWise.

The process iterates through these levels,\nhalting early if a convergence criterion is met: specifically, if two or more\nconsecutive levels yield the same answer, the solution from the earliest such\nlevel is output; otherwise, the process continues until all levels are\ncompleted. Through extensive experiments across five popular math reasoning\ndatasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of BloomWise. We also present\ncomprehensive ablation studies to analyze the strengths of each component\nwithin our system."

We employ a z-statistic-based\nstatistical analysis to detect the watermark, ensuring reliable extraction over\nmultiple rounds.

Although some attacks have highlighted\nvulnerabilities in these safety-aligned LLMs, they typically have limitations,\nsuch as necessitating access to the model weights or the generation process.\nSince proprietary models through API-calling do not grant users such\npermissions, these attacks find it challenging to compromise them. In this\npaper, we propose Jailbreaking Using LLM Introspection (JULI), which jailbreaks\nLLMs by manipulating the token log probabilities, using a tiny plug-in block,\nBiasNet. JULI relies solely on the knowledge of the target LLM's predicted\ntoken log probabilities. It can effectively jailbreak API-calling LLMs under a\nblack-box setting and knowing only top-$5$ token log probabilities.

Although some attacks have highlighted\nvulnerabilities in these safety-aligned LLMs, they typically have limitations,\nsuch as necessitating access to the model weights or the generation process.\nSince proprietary models through API-calling do not grant users such\npermissions, these attacks find it challenging to compromise them. In this\npaper, we propose Jailbreaking Using LLM Introspection (JULI), which jailbreaks\nLLMs by manipulating the token log probabilities, using a tiny plug-in block,\nBiasNet. JULI relies solely on the knowledge of the target LLM's predicted\ntoken log probabilities. It can effectively jailbreak API-calling LLMs under a\nblack-box setting and knowing only top-$5$ token log probabilities.

We introduce NomicLaw, a structured multi-agent simulation where LLMs\nengage in collaborative law-making, responding to complex legal vignettes by\nproposing rules, justifying them, and voting on peer proposals. We\nquantitatively measure trust and reciprocity via voting patterns and\nqualitatively assess how agents use strategic language to justify proposals and\ninfluence outcomes. Experiments involving homogeneous and heterogeneous LLM\ngroups demonstrate how agents spontaneously form alliances, betray trust, and\nadapt their rhetoric to shape collective decisions.

We introduce NomicLaw, a structured multi-agent simulation where LLMs\nengage in collaborative law-making, responding to complex legal vignettes by\nproposing rules, justifying them, and voting on peer proposals. We\nquantitatively measure trust and reciprocity via voting patterns and\nqualitatively assess how agents use strategic language to justify proposals and\ninfluence outcomes. Experiments involving homogeneous and heterogeneous LLM\ngroups demonstrate how agents spontaneously form alliances, betray trust, and\nadapt their rhetoric to shape collective decisions. Our results highlight the\nlatent social reasoning and persuasive capabilities of ten open-source LLMs and\nprovide insights into the design of future AI systems capable of autonomous\nnegotiation, coordination and drafting legislation in legal settings."

GhostShell also proves effective in long-horizon multimodal\ntasks, demonstrating strong robustness and generalization."

                "summary": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning\ncapabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the reliability of these\nreasoning chains remains a critical challenge. A widely held \"cascading\nfailure\" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur\nearly in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through\nsystematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive\nphenomenon we term \"Late-Stage Fragility\": errors introduced in the later\nstages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer\nthan identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific\nvulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought\n(ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive\nVerification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective\nSelf-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score\nfunction I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the\nreasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and\nprioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps.

                    "value": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning\ncapabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the reliability of these\nreasoning chains remains a critical challenge. A widely held \"cascading\nfailure\" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur\nearly in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through\nsystematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive\nphenomenon we term \"Late-Stage Fragility\": errors introduced in the later\nstages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer\nthan identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific\nvulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought\n(ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive\nVerification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective\nSelf-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score\nfunction I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the\nreasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and\nprioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are\nidentified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the\nfailure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH\ndemonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong\nbaselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of\ndiagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift\nfrom uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware\ncorrection mechanisms."

Despite offering strong performance\nand computational efficiency, large MoE-based LLMs like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and\nKimi-K2-Instruct present serious challenges due to substantial memory\nrequirements in deployment. While recent works have explored MoE compression to\naddress this issue, existing methods often suffer from considerable accuracy\ndrops (e.g., 7-14% relatively) even at modest compression rates. This paper\nintroduces a novel Mixture-of-Basis-Experts (MoBE) method that achieves model\ncompression while incurring minimal accuracy drops. Specifically, each up/gate\nmatrix in an expert is decomposed via a rank decomposition as W = AB, where\nmatrix A is unique to each expert. The relatively larger matrix B is further\nre-parameterized as a linear combination of basis matrices {Bi} shared across\nall experts within a given MoE layer. The factorization is learned by\nminimizing the reconstruction error relative to the original weight matrices.\nExperiments demonstrate that MoBE achieves notably lower accuracy drops\ncompared to prior works. For instance, MoBE can reduce the parameter counts of\nQwen3-235B-A22B-2507, DeepSeek-V3-0324 (671B) and Kimi-K2-Instruct (1T) by\n24%-30% with only 1%-2% accuracy drop (about 2% drops when measured\nrelatively).",

This paper introduces\nMetaOcc, a novel multi-modal framework for omnidirectional 3D occupancy\nprediction that leverages both multi-view 4D radar and images. To address the\nlimitations of directly applying LiDAR-oriented encoders to sparse radar data,\nwe propose a Radar Height Self-Attention module that enhances vertical spatial\nreasoning and feature extraction. Additionally, a Hierarchical Multi-scale\nMulti-modal Fusion strategy is developed to perform adaptive local-global\nfusion across modalities and time, mitigating spatio-temporal misalignments and\nenriching fused feature representations. To reduce reliance on expensive point\ncloud annotations, we further propose a pseudo-label generation pipeline based\non an open-set segmentor. This enables a semi-supervised strategy that achieves\n90% of the fully supervised performance using only 50% of the ground truth\nlabels, offering an effective trade-off between annotation cost and accuracy.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that MetaOcc under full supervision achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by +0.47 SC IoU\nand +4.02 mIoU on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset, and by +1.16 SC IoU and +1.24 mIoU\non the SurroundOcc-nuScenes dataset.

Both\ncomponents are data-free, training-free, and enable lightweight adaptation on a\ncommodity GPU in 20 minutes. Experiments on ARCs, OBOA and HellaSwag show that\nCross-LoRA achieves relative gains of up to 5.26% over base models. Across\nother commonsense reasoning benchmarks, Cross-LoRA maintains performance\ncomparable to that of directly trained LoRA adapters."

                "summary": "Spectral information has long been recognized as a critical cue in remote\nsensing observations. Although numerous vision-language models have been\ndeveloped for pixel-level interpretation, spectral information remains\nunderutilized, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly in\nmultispectral scenarios. To address this limitation, we construct a\nvision-language instruction-following dataset named SPIE, which encodes\nspectral priors of land-cover objects into textual attributes recognizable by\nlarge language models (LLMs), based on classical spectral index computations.\nLeveraging this dataset, we propose SPEX, a multimodal LLM designed for\ninstruction-driven land cover extraction.

Although numerous vision-language models have been\ndeveloped for pixel-level interpretation, spectral information remains\nunderutilized, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly in\nmultispectral scenarios. To address this limitation, we construct a\nvision-language instruction-following dataset named SPIE, which encodes\nspectral priors of land-cover objects into textual attributes recognizable by\nlarge language models (LLMs), based on classical spectral index computations.\nLeveraging this dataset, we propose SPEX, a multimodal LLM designed for\ninstruction-driven land cover extraction.
