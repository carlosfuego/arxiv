KV cache is widely adopted as it stores previously generated key and\nvalue tokens, effectively reducing redundant computations during inference.\nHowever, as memory overhead becomes a significant concern, efficient\ncompression of KV cache has gained increasing attention. Most existing methods\nperform compression from two perspectives: identifying important tokens and\ndesigning compression strategies. However, these approaches often produce\nbiased distributions of important tokens due to the influence of accumulated\nattention scores or positional encoding. Furthermore, they overlook the\nsparsity and redundancy across different heads, which leads to difficulties in\npreserving the most effective information at the head level. To this end, we\npropose EMS to overcome these limitations, while achieving better KV cache\ncompression under extreme compression ratios. Specifically, we introduce a\nGlobal-Local score that combines accumulated attention scores from both global\nand local KV tokens to better identify the token importance. For the\ncompression strategy, we design an adaptive and unified Evict-then-Merge\nframework that accounts for the sparsity and redundancy of KV tokens across\ndifferent heads. Additionally, we implement the head-wise parallel compression\nthrough a zero-class mechanism to enhance efficiency. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate our SOTA performance even under extreme compression ratios. EMS\nconsistently achieves the lowest perplexity, improves scores by over 1.28\npoints across four LLMs on LongBench under a 256 cache budget, and preserves\n95% retrieval accuracy with a cache budget less than 2% of the context length\nin the Needle-in-a-Haystack task.",

Consequently, the tailored prompts often fail to discern\nclass-specific visual concepts, thereby hindering the transferred performance\nfor classes that share similar or complex visual attributes. Recent advances\nmitigate this challenge by leveraging external knowledge from Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to furnish class descriptions, yet incurring notable inference\ncosts. In this paper, we introduce TextRefiner, a plug-and-play method to\nrefine the text prompts of existing methods by leveraging the internal\nknowledge of VLMs. Particularly, TextRefiner builds a novel local cache module\nto encapsulate fine-grained visual concepts derivedfrom local tokens within the\nimage branch. By aggregating and aligning the cached visual descriptions with\nthe original output of the text branch, TextRefiner can efficiently refine and\nenrich the learned prompts from existing methods without relying on any\nexternal expertise. For example, it improves the performance of CoOp from 71.66\n% to 76.94 % on 11 benchmarks, surpassing CoCoOp which introduces instance-wise\nfeatures for text prompts.

Our method is based on the\nnotion of modulating per-class prototypes in the shared embedding space. By\npre-computing and caching prototypes generated with the pre-trained text\nencoder, TPS not only facilitates optimization-free prototype reuse for\nsubsequent predictions but also enables seamless integration with current\nadvancements in prompt engineering. At test-time, TPS dynamically learns shift\nvectors for each prototype based solely on the given test sample, effectively\nbridging the domain gap and enhancing classification accuracy. A notable aspect\nof our framework is its significantly reduced memory and computational demands\nwhen compared to conventional text-prompt tuning methods. Extensive evaluations\nacross 15 image classification datasets involving natural distribution shifts\nand cross-dataset generalization, as well as in context-dependent visual\nreasoning, demonstrate TPS's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art\nresults while reducing resource requirements.",

In this work, we propose Video-XL, a\nnovel approach that leverages MLLMs' inherent key-value (KV) sparsification\ncapacity to condense the visual input.

Composite data curation,\nwhich integrates single-image, multi-image, and synthetic data to overcome the\nscarcity of long-video instruction data. The compression quality is further\nimproved by dynamic compression, which customizes compression granularity based\non the information density of different video intervals. Video-XL's\neffectiveness is verified from three aspects. First, it achieves a superior\nlong-video understanding capability, outperforming state-of-the-art models of\ncomparable sizes across multiple popular benchmarks.

We use self-supervised and label-supervised\ncontrastive learning to train a joint embedding space between music and video.\nWe show the effectiveness of our approach by using music genre labels for the\nsupervised training component, and our framework can be generalized to other\nmusic annotations (e.g., emotion, instrument, etc.). Furthermore, our method\nenables fine-grained control over how much the retrieval process focuses on\nself-supervised vs. label information at inference time.

While\nsome efforts have optimized attention mechanisms by pruning heads or sharing\nparameters among heads, these methods often lead to performance degradation or\nnecessitate substantial continued pre-training costs to restore performance.\nBased on the analysis of attention redundancy, we design a Decoupled-Head\nAttention (DHA) mechanism. DHA adaptively configures group sharing for key\nheads and value heads across various layers, achieving a better balance between\nperformance and efficiency. Inspired by the observation of clustering similar\nheads, we propose to progressively transform the MHA checkpoint into the DHA\nmodel through linear fusion of similar head parameters step by step, retaining\nthe parametric knowledge of the MHA checkpoint. We construct DHA models by\ntransforming various scales of MHA checkpoints given target head budgets. Our\nexperiments show that DHA remarkably requires a mere 0.25\\% of the original\nmodel's pre-training budgets to achieve 97.6\\% of performance while saving 75\\%\nof KV cache.

These engines reduce latency by using an incremental\nlayout algorithm to redraw the page when the user interacts with it. In such an\nalgorithm, elements that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty; only the dirty\nelements need be processed to draw the next frame, dramatically reducing\nlatency. However, the standard incremental layout algorithm must search the\npage for dirty elements, accessing a number of auxiliary elements in the\nprocess. These auxiliary elements add cache misses and stalled cycles, and are\nresponsible for a sizable fraction of all layout latency. We introduce a new,\nfaster incremental layout algorithm called Spineless Traversal. Spineless\nTraversal uses a more computationally demanding priority queue algorithm to\navoid the need to access auxiliary nodes and thus reduces cache traffic and\nstalls. This leads to dramatic speedups on the most latency-critical\ninteractions such as hovering, typing, or animations. Moreover, thanks to\nnumerous low-level optimizations, we are able to make Spineless Traversal\ncompetitive across the whole spectrum of incremental layout workloads.

The one-hop\nnavigation is from a vertex using either its in-coming or out-going edges with\nselection predicates that filter edges and vertices. Its cache entry identifies\na unique one-hop sub-query (key) and its result set consisting of immutable\nvertex ids (value). When processing a gR-Tx, the query processor identifies its\nsequence of individual one-hop sub-queries and looks up their results in the\ncache. A cache hit fetches less data from the storage manager and eliminates\nthe requirement to process the one-hop sub-query. A cache miss populates the\ncache asynchronously and in a transactional manner, maintaining the separation\nof read and write paths of our transactional storage manager. A graph read and\nwrite transaction, gRW-Tx, identifies the impacted cache entries and either\ndeletes or updates them. Our implementation of the cache is inside the graph\nquery processing engine and transparent to a user application. We evaluate the\ncache using our eCommerce production workload and with rules that re-write\ngraph queries to maximize the performance enhancements observed with the cache.\nObtained results show the cache enhances 95th and 99th percentile of query\nresponse times by at least 2x and 1.63x, respectively. When combined with query\nre-writing, the enhancements are at least 2.33x and 4.48x, respectively. An\ninteresting result is the significant performance enhancement observed by the\nindirect beneficiaries of the cache, gRW-Txs and gR-Txs that do not reference\none-hop sub-queries. The cache frees system resources to expedite their\nprocessing significantly.",

                    "value": "This paper introduces a novel one-hop sub-query result cache for processing\ngraph read transactions, gR-Txs, in a graph database system. The one-hop\nnavigation is from a vertex using either its in-coming or out-going edges with\nselection predicates that filter edges and vertices. Its cache entry identifies\na unique one-hop sub-query (key) and its result set consisting of immutable\nvertex ids (value). When processing a gR-Tx, the query processor identifies its\nsequence of individual one-hop sub-queries and looks up their results in the\ncache. A cache hit fetches less data from the storage manager and eliminates\nthe requirement to process the one-hop sub-query. A cache miss populates the\ncache asynchronously and in a transactional manner, maintaining the separation\nof read and write paths of our transactional storage manager. A graph read and\nwrite transaction, gRW-Tx, identifies the impacted cache entries and either\ndeletes or updates them. Our implementation of the cache is inside the graph\nquery processing engine and transparent to a user application. We evaluate the\ncache using our eCommerce production workload and with rules that re-write\ngraph queries to maximize the performance enhancements observed with the cache.\nObtained results show the cache enhances 95th and 99th percentile of query\nresponse times by at least 2x and 1.63x, respectively. When combined with query\nre-writing, the enhancements are at least 2.33x and 4.48x, respectively. An\ninteresting result is the significant performance enhancement observed by the\nindirect beneficiaries of the cache, gRW-Txs and gR-Txs that do not reference\none-hop sub-queries. The cache frees system resources to expedite their\nprocessing significantly."

The majority of computation stems from the\noverwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer decoder. In\nthis paper, we propose to build efficient MLLMs by leveraging the\nMixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each transformer decoder layer selects\nessential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant ones. However,\nintegrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the challenges of\ntraining and inference stability as well as limited training data, we adapt the\nMoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight normalization (TanhNorm)\nand symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we observe that vision\ntokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layer and thus design a progressive\nratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the token retention ratio\nlayer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This crucial design fully\nunleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the efficiency and\nperformance of our models. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we\nconduct extensive experiments with two baseline models across 14 benchmarks.\nOur model, p-MoD, matches or even surpasses the performance of the baseline\nmodels, with only 55.6% TFLOPs and 53.8% KV cache storage during inference, and\n77.7% GPU hours during training.",

To address this, two critical steps are often required: a\npretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length\nextension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural\nmodifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper\nargues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction\narchitecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but\nalso achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed\nLongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during\nlength extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention\npatterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink\n(initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are\nwell-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their\nGPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just\ntheoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to\nhave direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention\nlayers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency\nand long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data\nis sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.\n  We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its\neffectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts,\nLongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%,\ncompared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV\ncache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding\nspeedup.",

However, their demanding\ncomputational requirements have hindered their practical application in\nreal-time object detection (OD) scenarios. In this paper, we scrutinize the\nlimitations of two leading models in the OVDEval benchmark, OmDet and\nGrounding-DINO, and introduce OmDet-Turbo. This novel transformer-based\nreal-time OVD model features an innovative Efficient Fusion Head (EFH) module\ndesigned to alleviate the bottlenecks observed in OmDet and Grounding-DINO.\nNotably, OmDet-Turbo-Base achieves a 100.2 frames per second (FPS) with\nTensorRT and language cache techniques applied.

However, their demanding\ncomputational requirements have hindered their practical application in\nreal-time object detection (OD) scenarios. In this paper, we scrutinize the\nlimitations of two leading models in the OVDEval benchmark, OmDet and\nGrounding-DINO, and introduce OmDet-Turbo. This novel transformer-based\nreal-time OVD model features an innovative Efficient Fusion Head (EFH) module\ndesigned to alleviate the bottlenecks observed in OmDet and Grounding-DINO.\nNotably, OmDet-Turbo-Base achieves a 100.2 frames per second (FPS) with\nTensorRT and language cache techniques applied.

After erasing some paths in each\ntime slot, the delivery can be divided into several non-overlapping groups\nincluding transmission antennas and users, where in each group the transmission\nantennas serve the contained users without suffering interference from the\ntransmissions by other groups. The division of groups for the sake of\nmaximizing the DoF could be formulated into a combinatorial optimization\nproblem. We propose a grouping algorithm which can find the optimal solution\nwith low complexity, and the corresponding coded caching scheme achieving this\nDoF."

However,\nGPU-stored projections must be loaded into SRAM for each new generation step,\ncausing latency and energy bottlenecks.\n  We present a custom self-attention in-memory computing architecture based on\nemerging charge-based memories called gain cells, which can be efficiently\nwritten to store new tokens during sequence generation and enable parallel\nanalog dot-product computation required for self-attention. However, the analog\ngain cell circuits introduce non-idealities and constraints preventing the\ndirect mapping of pre-trained models. To circumvent this problem, we design an\ninitialization algorithm achieving text processing performance comparable to\nGPT-2 without training from scratch.

In generative Transformers, self-attention uses cache memory to store\ntoken projections, avoiding recomputation at each time step. However,\nGPU-stored projections must be loaded into SRAM for each new generation step,\ncausing latency and energy bottlenecks.\n  We present a custom self-attention in-memory computing architecture based on\nemerging charge-based memories called gain cells, which can be efficiently\nwritten to store new tokens during sequence generation and enable parallel\nanalog dot-product computation required for self-attention. However, the analog\ngain cell circuits introduce non-idealities and constraints preventing the\ndirect mapping of pre-trained models. To circumvent this problem, we design an\ninitialization algorithm achieving text processing performance comparable to\nGPT-2 without training from scratch. Our architecture respectively reduces\nattention latency and energy consumption by up to two and five orders of\nmagnitude compared to GPUs, marking a significant step toward ultra-fast,\nlow-power generative Transformers."

                "summary": "Recently, Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have demonstrated\nstate-of-the-art performance in various high-impact applications, including\nfraud detection and content recommendation. Despite the success of TGNNs, they\nare prone to the prevalent noise found in real-world dynamic graphs like\ntime-deprecated links and skewed interaction distribution. The noise causes two\ncritical issues that significantly compromise the accuracy of TGNNs: (1) models\nare supervised by inferior interactions, and (2) noisy input induces high\nvariance in the aggregated messages. However, current TGNN denoising techniques\ndo not consider the diverse and dynamic noise pattern of each node. In\naddition, they also suffer from the excessive mini-batch generation overheads\ncaused by traversing more neighbors. We believe the remedy for fast and\naccurate TGNNs lies in temporal adaptive sampling. In this work, we propose\nTASER, the first adaptive sampling method for TGNNs optimized for accuracy,\nefficiency, and scalability. TASER adapts its mini-batch selection based on\ntraining dynamics and temporal neighbor selection based on the contextual,\nstructural, and temporal properties of past interactions. To alleviate the\nbottleneck in mini-batch generation, TASER implements a pure GPU-based temporal\nneighbor finder and a dedicated GPU feature cache. We evaluate the performance\nof TASER using two state-of-the-art backbone TGNNs. On five popular datasets,\nTASER outperforms the corresponding baselines by an average of 2.3% in Mean\nReciprocal Rank (MRR) while achieving an average of 5.1x speedup in training\ntime.",

                    "value": "Recently, Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have demonstrated\nstate-of-the-art performance in various high-impact applications, including\nfraud detection and content recommendation. Despite the success of TGNNs, they\nare prone to the prevalent noise found in real-world dynamic graphs like\ntime-deprecated links and skewed interaction distribution. The noise causes two\ncritical issues that significantly compromise the accuracy of TGNNs: (1) models\nare supervised by inferior interactions, and (2) noisy input induces high\nvariance in the aggregated messages. However, current TGNN denoising techniques\ndo not consider the diverse and dynamic noise pattern of each node. In\naddition, they also suffer from the excessive mini-batch generation overheads\ncaused by traversing more neighbors. We believe the remedy for fast and\naccurate TGNNs lies in temporal adaptive sampling. In this work, we propose\nTASER, the first adaptive sampling method for TGNNs optimized for accuracy,\nefficiency, and scalability. TASER adapts its mini-batch selection based on\ntraining dynamics and temporal neighbor selection based on the contextual,\nstructural, and temporal properties of past interactions. To alleviate the\nbottleneck in mini-batch generation, TASER implements a pure GPU-based temporal\nneighbor finder and a dedicated GPU feature cache. We evaluate the performance\nof TASER using two state-of-the-art backbone TGNNs. On five popular datasets,\nTASER outperforms the corresponding baselines by an average of 2.3% in Mean\nReciprocal Rank (MRR) while achieving an average of 5.1x speedup in training\ntime."

Key-Value Cache\nand Semantic Cache have been proposed as a solution to the above problem, but\nboth suffer from limited scalability due to significant memory cost for each\ntoken or instruction embeddings. Motivated by the observations that most\ninstructions are short, repetitive and predictable by LLMs, we propose to\npredict user-instructions by an instruction-aligned LLM and store them in a\npredictive cache, so-called InstCache. We introduce an instruction\npre-population algorithm based on the negative log likelihood of instructions,\ndetermining the cache size with regard to the hit rate. The proposed InstCache\nis efficiently implemented as a hash table with minimal lookup latency for\ndeployment. Experimental results show that InstCache can achieve up to 51.34%\nhit rate on LMSys dataset, which corresponds to a 2x speedup, at a memory cost\nof only 4.5GB.",

                    "value": "Large language models are revolutionizing every aspect of human life.\nHowever, the unprecedented power comes at the cost of significant computing\nintensity, suggesting long latency and large energy footprint. Key-Value Cache\nand Semantic Cache have been proposed as a solution to the above problem, but\nboth suffer from limited scalability due to significant memory cost for each\ntoken or instruction embeddings. Motivated by the observations that most\ninstructions are short, repetitive and predictable by LLMs, we propose to\npredict user-instructions by an instruction-aligned LLM and store them in a\npredictive cache, so-called InstCache. We introduce an instruction\npre-population algorithm based on the negative log likelihood of instructions,\ndetermining the cache size with regard to the hit rate. The proposed InstCache\nis efficiently implemented as a hash table with minimal lookup latency for\ndeployment. Experimental results show that InstCache can achieve up to 51.34%\nhit rate on LMSys dataset, which corresponds to a 2x speedup, at a memory cost\nof only 4.5GB."

Finally, we demonstrated a practical use case of the\nalgorithm by using compact finite difference schemes to solve a 3D non-linear\nPDE. The results demonstrate that DistD2 algorithm can sustain around 66% of\nthe theoretical peak bandwidth at scale on CPU and GPU based supercomputers."

To this\nend, we train a conditional Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) for masked\nreconstruction, using multi-view consistent masks rendered from a randomly\ngenerated 3D occlusion, and using one clean viewpoint as the conditional\nsignal. During inference, we manually define a 3D region to edit and provide an\nedited image from a canonical viewpoint to fill in that region. We demonstrate\nthat, in just a single forward pass, our method not only preserves the input\ngeometry in the unmasked region through reconstruction capabilities on par with\nSoTA, but is also expressive enough to perform a variety of mesh edits from a\nsingle image guidance that past works struggle with, while being 10x faster\nthan the top-performing competing prior work.",

However, the galaxy-matter cross-power spectra are already affected\nby baryons on these scales, directly impacting the modelling of galaxy-galaxy\nlensing. We propose to extend models of the galaxy-matter cross-power spectrum\n$P_{\\rm gm}(k)$ (currently only accounting for dark matter) by including a\nbaryonic correction inferred from the matter component ($S_{\\rm mm}(k)$), so\nthat $P_{\\rm gm, full \\, physics} (k) = \\sqrt{S_{\\rm mm}} P_{\\rm gm, gravity \\,\nonly}$. We use the FLAMINGO simulations to measure the effect of baryons on the\ngalaxy-matter cross-power spectrum and to assess the performance of our model.\nWe perform a Bayesian analysis of synthetic data, implementing a model based on\nBACCO's hybrid Lagrangian bias expansion (for the nonlinear galaxy bias) and\nBaryon Correction Model. Ignoring baryons in the galaxy-matter cross-power\nspectrum leads to a biased inference of the galaxy bias, while ignoring baryons\nin both the galaxy-matter and matter-matter power spectra leads to a biased\ninference of both the galaxy bias and cosmological parameters. In contrast, our\nmethod is 1% accurate compared to all physics variations in FLAMINGO and on all\nscales described by hybrid perturbative models ($k < 0.7h$/Mpc).

These are often prone to hallucinations, licensing issues and\nthe generation process is often hard to scale and interpret. In this work, we\npresent a programmatic approach that employs scene graphs as symbolic\nrepresentations of images and human-written programs to systematically\nsynthesize vision-centric instruction data. Our approach ensures the\ninterpretability and controllability of the data generation process and scales\nefficiently while maintaining factual accuracy. By implementing a suite of 24\nsingle-image, 14 multi-image instruction generators, and a scene graph\ngeneration pipeline, we build a scalable, cost-effective system: ProVision\nwhich produces diverse question-answer pairs concerning objects, attributes,\nrelations, depth, etc., for any given image. Applied to Visual Genome and\nDataComp datasets, we generate over 10 million instruction data points,\nProVision-10M, and leverage them in both pretraining and instruction tuning\nstages of MLMs. When adopted in the instruction tuning stage, our single-image\ninstruction data yields up to a 7% improvement on the 2D split and 8% on the 3D\nsplit of CVBench, along with a 3% increase in performance on QBench2,\nRealWorldQA, and MMMU.

Our solution introduces two key innovations: FlashQ,\na headwise attention quantization technique that enables both compression of KV\ncache and quantized execution of activation-activation multiplication, and\nSparsity-based Softmax Approximation (SAS), which eliminates the need for\ndequantization to FP32 during exponentiation operation in attention.\nExperimental results demonstrate that TurboAttention achieves 1.2-1.8x speedup\nin attention, reduces the KV cache size by over 4.4x, and enables up to 2.37x\nmaximum throughput over the FP16 baseline while outperforming state-of-the-art\nquantization and compression techniques across various datasets and models."

KV cache is widely adopted as it stores previously generated key and\nvalue tokens, effectively reducing redundant computations during inference.\nHowever, as memory overhead becomes a significant concern, efficient\ncompression of KV cache has gained increasing attention. Most existing methods\nperform compression from two perspectives: identifying important tokens and\ndesigning compression strategies. However, these approaches often produce\nbiased distributions of important tokens due to the influence of accumulated\nattention scores or positional encoding. Furthermore, they overlook the\nsparsity and redundancy across different heads, which leads to difficulties in\npreserving the most effective information at the head level. To this end, we\npropose EMS to overcome these limitations, while achieving better KV cache\ncompression under extreme compression ratios. Specifically, we introduce a\nGlobal-Local score that combines accumulated attention scores from both global\nand local KV tokens to better identify the token importance. For the\ncompression strategy, we design an adaptive and unified Evict-then-Merge\nframework that accounts for the sparsity and redundancy of KV tokens across\ndifferent heads. Additionally, we implement the head-wise parallel compression\nthrough a zero-class mechanism to enhance efficiency. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate our SOTA performance even under extreme compression ratios. EMS\nconsistently achieves the lowest perplexity, improves scores by over 1.28\npoints across four LLMs on LongBench under a 256 cache budget, and preserves\n95% retrieval accuracy with a cache budget less than 2% of the context length\nin the Needle-in-a-Haystack task.",

This paper aims to\nassess their internal structure and habitability, considering their tidal\nheating, atmospheric heating, and global transport. We model the interior\nstructure of the planets by applying Bayesian inference to an exoplanet's\ninterior model. A constant quality factor model is used to calculate the range\nof tidal heating, and a one-dimensional analytical model of tidally locked\nplanets is used to assess their surface temperature distribution and\nhabitability. Assuming no or only thin atmospheres, K2-18 b and TOI-1468 c are\nlikely to be water worlds. However, TOI-1452 b and LHS 1140 b may have rocky\nsurfaces. We find that tidal heating is not enough to raise the global mean\nsurface temperature, but greenhouse heating can effectively do so. If the\nconsidered planets have retained thick atmospheres, K2-18 b, TOI-1468 c, and\nTOI-1452 b may, for significant atmospheric heating and heat transport factors,\nbe too hot to sustain liquid water on their surface.

We impose no structural\nrestriction on the seller's feasible advertising strategies and allow her to\nadvertise the product by disclosing or concealing any information. Following\nthe literature in information design, this fully flexible advertising can be\nmodeled as the seller being able to choose any information policy that signals\nthe product quality/characteristic to the customers. Customers observe the\nadvertising signal and infer a Bayesian belief over the products. We aim to\ninvestigate two questions in this work: (1) What is the value of advertising?\nTo what extent can advertising enhance a seller's revenue? (2) Without any\napriori knowledge of the customers' demand function, how can a seller\nadaptively learn and optimize both pricing and advertising strategies using\npast purchase responses?\n  To study the first question, we introduce and study the value of advertising\n- a revenue gap between using advertising vs not advertising, and we provide a\ncrisp tight characterization for this notion for a broad family of problems.\nFor the second question, we study the seller's dynamic pricing and advertising\nproblem with demand uncertainty. Our main result for this question is a\ncomputationally efficient online algorithm that achieves an optimal\n$O(T^{2/3}(m\\log T)^{1/3})$ regret rate when the valuation function is linear\nin the product quality. Here $m$ is the cardinality of the discrete product\nquality domain and $T$ is the time horizon. This result requires some mild\nregularity assumptions on the valuation function, but no Lipschitz or\nsmoothness assumption on the customers' demand function. We also obtain several\nimproved results for the widely considered special case of additive valuations.",

                    "value": "We consider a novel pricing and advertising framework, where a seller not\nonly sets product price but also designs flexible 'advertising schemes' to\ninfluence customers' valuation of the product. We impose no structural\nrestriction on the seller's feasible advertising strategies and allow her to\nadvertise the product by disclosing or concealing any information. Following\nthe literature in information design, this fully flexible advertising can be\nmodeled as the seller being able to choose any information policy that signals\nthe product quality/characteristic to the customers. Customers observe the\nadvertising signal and infer a Bayesian belief over the products. We aim to\ninvestigate two questions in this work: (1) What is the value of advertising?\nTo what extent can advertising enhance a seller's revenue? (2) Without any\napriori knowledge of the customers' demand function, how can a seller\nadaptively learn and optimize both pricing and advertising strategies using\npast purchase responses?\n  To study the first question, we introduce and study the value of advertising\n- a revenue gap between using advertising vs not advertising, and we provide a\ncrisp tight characterization for this notion for a broad family of problems.\nFor the second question, we study the seller's dynamic pricing and advertising\nproblem with demand uncertainty. Our main result for this question is a\ncomputationally efficient online algorithm that achieves an optimal\n$O(T^{2/3}(m\\log T)^{1/3})$ regret rate when the valuation function is linear\nin the product quality. Here $m$ is the cardinality of the discrete product\nquality domain and $T$ is the time horizon. This result requires some mild\nregularity assumptions on the valuation function, but no Lipschitz or\nsmoothness assumption on the customers' demand function. We also obtain several\nimproved results for the widely considered special case of additive valuations."

To address these\nchallenges and improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) in\ngeospatial code generation tasks, we propose a framework for building a\ngeospatial operator knowledge base tailored to the GEE JavaScript API. This\nframework consists of an operator syntax knowledge table, an operator\nrelationship frequency table, an operator frequent pattern knowledge table, and\nan operator relationship chain knowledge table. By leveraging Abstract Syntax\nTree (AST) techniques and frequent itemset mining, we systematically extract\noperator knowledge from 185,236 real GEE scripts and syntax documentation,\nforming a structured knowledge base. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nframework achieves over 90% accuracy, recall, and F1 score in operator\nknowledge extraction. When integrated with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) strategy for LLM-based geospatial code generation tasks, the knowledge\nbase improves performance by 20-30%.

This paper introduces NyayaAnumana, the largest and most diverse\ncorpus of Indian legal cases compiled for LJP, encompassing a total of 7,02,945\npreprocessed cases. NyayaAnumana, which combines the words \"Nyay\" (judgment)\nand \"Anuman\" (prediction or inference) respectively for most major Indian\nlanguages, includes a wide range of cases from the Supreme Court, High Courts,\nTribunal Courts, District Courts, and Daily Orders and, thus, provides\nunparalleled diversity and coverage. Our dataset surpasses existing datasets\nlike PredEx and ILDC, offering a comprehensive foundation for advanced AI\nresearch in the legal domain.\n  In addition to the dataset, we present INLegalLlama, a domain-specific\ngenerative large language model (LLM) tailored to the intricacies of the Indian\nlegal system. It is developed through a two-phase training approach over a base\nLLaMa model. First, Indian legal documents are injected using continual\npretraining. Second, task-specific supervised finetuning is done. This method\nallows the model to achieve a deeper understanding of legal contexts.\n  Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating diverse court data\nsignificantly boosts model accuracy, achieving approximately 90% F1-score in\nprediction tasks. INLegalLlama not only improves prediction accuracy but also\noffers comprehensible explanations, addressing the need for explainability in\nAI-assisted legal decisions.",

Existing approaches optimize dropout rates during\ntraining using labeled data, resulting in fixed inference-time parameters that\ncannot adjust to new data distributions, compromising uncertainty estimates in\nMonte Carlo simulations.\n  In this paper, we propose Rate-In, an algorithm that dynamically adjusts\ndropout rates during inference by quantifying the information loss induced by\ndropout in each layer's feature maps. By treating dropout as controlled noise\ninjection and leveraging information-theoretic principles, Rate-In adapts\ndropout rates per layer and per input instance without requiring ground truth\nlabels. By quantifying the functional information loss in feature maps, we\nadaptively tune dropout rates to maintain perceptual quality across diverse\nmedical imaging tasks and architectural configurations. Our extensive empirical\nstudy on synthetic data and real-world medical imaging tasks demonstrates that\nRate-In improves calibration and sharpens uncertainty estimates compared to\nfixed or heuristic dropout rates without compromising predictive performance.\nRate-In offers a practical, unsupervised, inference-time approach to optimizing\ndropout for more reliable predictive uncertainty estimation in critical\napplications.",

We conduct extensive experiments on 24 image classification tasks\nusing various backbone variants. Experimental results demonstrate that ALoRE\noutperforms the full fine-tuning strategy and other state-of-the-art PETL\nmethods in terms of performance and parameter efficiency.

                "summary": "Large Language Models are increasingly used to build agents to perform more\ncomplex tasks. As LLMs perform more complicated reasoning through longer\ninteractions, self-consistency, i.e., the idea that the answer obtained from\nsampling and marginalising a number of multiple independent inferences is more\nlikely to be correct, has received much attention as a simple validation\ntechnique. This paper aims to empirically verify this intuitive hypothesis by\npredicting the correctness of answers obtained using self-consistency from\nproperties of the samples of reasoning paths.

As LLMs perform more complicated reasoning through longer\ninteractions, self-consistency, i.e., the idea that the answer obtained from\nsampling and marginalising a number of multiple independent inferences is more\nlikely to be correct, has received much attention as a simple validation\ntechnique. This paper aims to empirically verify this intuitive hypothesis by\npredicting the correctness of answers obtained using self-consistency from\nproperties of the samples of reasoning paths.

Recent LLM-based TTS\nworks typically employ complex data processing pipelines to obtain high-quality\ntraining data. These sophisticated pipelines require excellent models at each\nstage (e.g., speech denoising, speech enhancement, speaker diarization, and\npunctuation models), which themselves demand high-quality training data and are\nrarely open-sourced. Even with state-of-the-art models, issues persist, such as\nincomplete background noise removal and misalignment between punctuation and\nactual speech pauses. Moreover, the stringent filtering strategies often retain\nonly 10-30\\% of the original data, significantly impeding data scaling efforts.\nIn this work, we leverage a noise-robust audio tokenizer (S3Tokenizer) to\ndesign a simplified yet effective TTS data processing pipeline that maintains\ndata quality while substantially reducing data acquisition costs, achieving a\ndata retention rate of over 50\\%. Beyond data scaling challenges, LLM-based TTS\nsystems also incur higher deployment costs compared to conventional approaches.\nCurrent systems typically use LLMs solely for text-to-token generation, while\nrequiring separate models (e.g., flow matching models) for token-to-waveform\ngeneration, which cannot be directly executed by LLM inference engines, further\ncomplicating deployment. To address these challenges, we eliminate redundant\nmodules in both LLM and flow components, replacing the flow model backbone with\nan LLM architecture. Building upon this simplified flow backbone, we propose a\nunified architecture for both streaming and non-streaming inference,\nsignificantly reducing deployment costs.

We introduced the Relative Subjective Time Change (RSTC) method to\nexplore the relationship between time perception and user experience.\nAdditionally, we applied a data-driven approach called the Time Perception\nModeling Network (TPM-Net), which integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\nand Transformer architectures to model time perception based on multimodal\nphysiological and zeitgebers data. With 56 participants in a between-subject\nexperiment, our results show that task factors significantly influence time\nperception, with red light and slow-tempo music further contributing to time\nunderestimation. The RSTC method reveals that underestimating time in VR is\nstrongly associated with improved user experience, presence, and engagement.\nFurthermore, TPM-Net shows potential for modeling time perception in VR,\nenabling inference of relative changes in users' time perception and\ncorresponding changes in user experience.

Built on a V-net\nneural network architecture, the emulator enhances the predictions by\nfirst-order Lagrangian perturbation theory to be accurately aligned with full\n$N$-body simulations while significantly reducing evaluation time. We test its\nincorporation in BORG for sampling cosmic initial conditions using mock data\nbased on non-linear large-scale structures from $N$-body simulations and\nGaussian noise. The method efficiently and accurately explores the\nhigh-dimensional parameter space of initial conditions, fully extracting the\ncross-correlation information of the data field binned at a resolution of\n$1.95h^{-1}$ Mpc. Percent-level agreement with the ground truth in the power\nspectrum and bispectrum is achieved up to the Nyquist frequency $k_\\mathrm{N}\n\\approx 2.79h \\; \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. Posterior resimulations - using the\ninferred initial conditions for $N$-body simulations - show that the recovery\nof information in the initial conditions is sufficient to accurately reproduce\nhalo properties. In particular, we show highly accurate $M_{200\\mathrm{c}}$\nhalo mass function and stacked density profiles of haloes in different mass\nbins $[0.853,16]\\times 10^{14}M_{\\odot}h^{-1}$. As all available\ncross-correlation information is extracted, we acknowledge that limitations in\nrecovering the initial conditions stem from the noise level and data grid\nresolution.

Three\npopular SemCom systems enabled by classical GAI models are first introduced,\nincluding variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and\ndiffusion models. For each system, the fundamental concept of the GAI model,\nthe corresponding SemCom architecture, and the associated literature review of\nrecent efforts are elucidated. Then, a novel generative SemCom system is\nproposed by incorporating the cutting-edge GAI technology-large language models\n(LLMs). This system features two LLM-based AI agents at both the transmitter\nand receiver, serving as \"brains\" to enable powerful information understanding\nand content regeneration capabilities, respectively. This innovative design\nallows the receiver to directly generate the desired content, instead of\nrecovering the bit stream, based on the coded semantic information conveyed by\nthe transmitter. Therefore, it shifts the communication mindset from\n\"information recovery\" to \"information regeneration\" and thus ushers in a new\nera of generative SemCom. A case study on point-to-point video retrieval is\npresented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed generative SemCom\nsystem, showcasing a 99.98% reduction in communication overhead and a 53%\nimprovement in retrieval accuracy compared to the traditional communication\nsystem. Furthermore, four typical application scenarios for generative SemCom\nare delineated, followed by a discussion of three open issues warranting future\ninvestigation. In a nutshell, this paper provides a holistic set of guidelines\nfor applying GAI in SemCom, paving the way for the efficient implementation of\ngenerative SemCom in future wireless networks.",

Existing practices rely on powerful but costly\nlarge language models (LLMs) or multimodal language models (MLMs) to produce\ninstruction data. These are often prone to hallucinations, licensing issues and\nthe generation process is often hard to scale and interpret. In this work, we\npresent a programmatic approach that employs scene graphs as symbolic\nrepresentations of images and human-written programs to systematically\nsynthesize vision-centric instruction data. Our approach ensures the\ninterpretability and controllability of the data generation process and scales\nefficiently while maintaining factual accuracy. By implementing a suite of 24\nsingle-image, 14 multi-image instruction generators, and a scene graph\ngeneration pipeline, we build a scalable, cost-effective system: ProVision\nwhich produces diverse question-answer pairs concerning objects, attributes,\nrelations, depth, etc., for any given image. Applied to Visual Genome and\nDataComp datasets, we generate over 10 million instruction data points,\nProVision-10M, and leverage them in both pretraining and instruction tuning\nstages of MLMs. When adopted in the instruction tuning stage, our single-image\ninstruction data yields up to a 7% improvement on the 2D split and 8% on the 3D\nsplit of CVBench, along with a 3% increase in performance on QBench2,\nRealWorldQA, and MMMU. Our multi-image instruction data leads to an 8%\nimprovement on Mantis-Eval. Incorporation of our data in both pre-training and\nfine-tuning stages of xGen-MM-4B leads to an averaged improvement of 1.6%\nacross 11 benchmarks.",

Results show\nthat HASAC consistently outperforms strong baselines in 34 out of 38 tasks,\nexhibiting improved training stability, better sample efficiency and sufficient\nexploration. The robustness of HASAC was further validated when encountering\nuncertainties in rewards, dynamics, states, and actions of 14 magnitudes, and\nreal-world deployment in a multi-robot arena against these four types of\nuncertainties.

                "summary": "To fulfill the low latency requirements of today's applications, deployment\nof RDMA in datacenters has become prevalent over the recent years. However, the\nin-order delivery requirement of RDMAs prevents them from leveraging powerful\ntechniques that help improve the performance of datacenters, ranging from\nfine-grained load balancers to throughput-optimal expander topologies. We\ndemonstrate experimentally that these techniques significantly deteriorate the\nperformance in an RDMA network because they induce packet reordering.\nFurthermore, lifting the in-order delivery constraint enhances the flexibility\nof RDMA networks and enables them to employ these performance-enhancing\ntechniques. To realize this, we propose an ordering layer, Eunomia, to equip\nRDMA NICs to handle packet reordering.

                    "value": "To fulfill the low latency requirements of today's applications, deployment\nof RDMA in datacenters has become prevalent over the recent years. However, the\nin-order delivery requirement of RDMAs prevents them from leveraging powerful\ntechniques that help improve the performance of datacenters, ranging from\nfine-grained load balancers to throughput-optimal expander topologies. We\ndemonstrate experimentally that these techniques significantly deteriorate the\nperformance in an RDMA network because they induce packet reordering.\nFurthermore, lifting the in-order delivery constraint enhances the flexibility\nof RDMA networks and enables them to employ these performance-enhancing\ntechniques. To realize this, we propose an ordering layer, Eunomia, to equip\nRDMA NICs to handle packet reordering.

KV cache is widely adopted as it stores previously generated key and\nvalue tokens, effectively reducing redundant computations during inference.\nHowever, as memory overhead becomes a significant concern, efficient\ncompression of KV cache has gained increasing attention. Most existing methods\nperform compression from two perspectives: identifying important tokens and\ndesigning compression strategies. However, these approaches often produce\nbiased distributions of important tokens due to the influence of accumulated\nattention scores or positional encoding. Furthermore, they overlook the\nsparsity and redundancy across different heads, which leads to difficulties in\npreserving the most effective information at the head level. To this end, we\npropose EMS to overcome these limitations, while achieving better KV cache\ncompression under extreme compression ratios. Specifically, we introduce a\nGlobal-Local score that combines accumulated attention scores from both global\nand local KV tokens to better identify the token importance. For the\ncompression strategy, we design an adaptive and unified Evict-then-Merge\nframework that accounts for the sparsity and redundancy of KV tokens across\ndifferent heads. Additionally, we implement the head-wise parallel compression\nthrough a zero-class mechanism to enhance efficiency. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate our SOTA performance even under extreme compression ratios. EMS\nconsistently achieves the lowest perplexity, improves scores by over 1.28\npoints across four LLMs on LongBench under a 256 cache budget, and preserves\n95% retrieval accuracy with a cache budget less than 2% of the context length\nin the Needle-in-a-Haystack task.",

The LLM composes\nchoreographies for a given piece of music by utilizing a library of motion\nprimitives; the language-based choreographer is augmented with an\noptimization-based safety filter, which certifies the choreography for\nreal-world deployment by making minimal adjustments when feasibility and safety\nconstraints are violated. The overall SwarmGPT-Primitive framework decouples\nchoreographic design from safe motion planning, which allows non-expert users\nto re-prompt and refine compositions without concerns about compliance with\nconstraints such as avoiding collisions or downwash effects or satisfying\nactuation limits. We demonstrate our approach through simulations and\nexperiments with swarms of up to 20 drones performing choreographies designed\nbased on various songs, highlighting the system's ability to generate effective\nand synchronized drone choreographies for real-world deployment.",

While there is an increasing interest in\nmental health care within the natural language processing community, progress\nin tackling manipulation remains limited due to the complexity of detecting\nsubtle, covert tactics in conversations. In this paper, we propose Intent-Aware\nPrompting (IAP), a novel approach for detecting mental manipulations using\nlarge language models (LLMs), providing a deeper understanding of manipulative\ntactics by capturing the underlying intents of participants. Experimental\nresults on the MentalManip dataset demonstrate superior effectiveness of IAP\nagainst other advanced prompting strategies. Notably, our approach\nsubstantially reduces false negatives, helping detect more instances of mental\nmanipulation with minimal misjudgment of positive cases.

To address these\nchallenges and improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) in\ngeospatial code generation tasks, we propose a framework for building a\ngeospatial operator knowledge base tailored to the GEE JavaScript API. This\nframework consists of an operator syntax knowledge table, an operator\nrelationship frequency table, an operator frequent pattern knowledge table, and\nan operator relationship chain knowledge table. By leveraging Abstract Syntax\nTree (AST) techniques and frequent itemset mining, we systematically extract\noperator knowledge from 185,236 real GEE scripts and syntax documentation,\nforming a structured knowledge base. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nframework achieves over 90% accuracy, recall, and F1 score in operator\nknowledge extraction. When integrated with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) strategy for LLM-based geospatial code generation tasks, the knowledge\nbase improves performance by 20-30%.

To refine and stabilize results during\ninteraction, the Multi-Round Result Fusion (MRF) Module selects and merges\noptimal masks from multiple rounds.

The\nproduction of explanation by SpecRover allows for a better \"signal\" to be given\nto the developer, on when the suggested patches can be accepted with\nconfidence. SpecRover also seeks to demonstrate the continued importance of\nspecification inference in automated program repair, even as program repair\ntechnologies enter the LLM era."

Existing methods either optimize prompts to guide LLMs in leveraging\nretrieved information or directly fine-tune LLMs to adapt to RAG scenarios.\nAlthough fine-tuning can yield better performance, it often compromises the\nLLMs' general generation capabilities by modifying their parameters. This\nlimitation poses challenges in practical applications, especially when LLMs are\nalready deployed, as parameter adjustments may affect their original\nfunctionality. To address this, we propose a novel method that involves\nlearning scalable and pluggable virtual tokens for RAG. By maintaining the\nLLMs' original parameters and fine-tuning only the embeddings of these\npluggable tokens, our approach not only enhances LLMs' performance but also\npreserves their general generation capabilities. Furthermore, we design several\ntraining strategies to improve the scalability, flexibility, and\ngeneralizability of our method. Comprehensive experiments across 12\nquestion-answering tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach.",

                    "value": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising way to improve large\nlanguage models (LLMs) for generating more factual, accurate, and up-to-date\ncontent. Existing methods either optimize prompts to guide LLMs in leveraging\nretrieved information or directly fine-tune LLMs to adapt to RAG scenarios.\nAlthough fine-tuning can yield better performance, it often compromises the\nLLMs' general generation capabilities by modifying their parameters. This\nlimitation poses challenges in practical applications, especially when LLMs are\nalready deployed, as parameter adjustments may affect their original\nfunctionality. To address this, we propose a novel method that involves\nlearning scalable and pluggable virtual tokens for RAG. By maintaining the\nLLMs' original parameters and fine-tuning only the embeddings of these\npluggable tokens, our approach not only enhances LLMs' performance but also\npreserves their general generation capabilities. Furthermore, we design several\ntraining strategies to improve the scalability, flexibility, and\ngeneralizability of our method. Comprehensive experiments across 12\nquestion-answering tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach."

While most work has focused on Western-centric AI\ntechnologies, we study Chinese-based tools by investigating social biases\nembedded in the major Chinese search engine, Baidu, and two leading LLMs, Ernie\nand Qwen. Leveraging a dataset of 240 social groups across 13 categories\ndescribing Chinese society, we collect over 30k views encoded in the\naforementioned tools by prompting them for candidate words describing such\ngroups. We find that language models exhibit a larger variety of embedded views\ncompared to the search engine, although Baidu and Qwen generate negative\ncontent more often than Ernie. We also find a moderate prevalence of\nstereotypes embedded in the language models, many of which potentially promote\noffensive and derogatory views.

While most work has focused on Western-centric AI\ntechnologies, we study Chinese-based tools by investigating social biases\nembedded in the major Chinese search engine, Baidu, and two leading LLMs, Ernie\nand Qwen. Leveraging a dataset of 240 social groups across 13 categories\ndescribing Chinese society, we collect over 30k views encoded in the\naforementioned tools by prompting them for candidate words describing such\ngroups. We find that language models exhibit a larger variety of embedded views\ncompared to the search engine, although Baidu and Qwen generate negative\ncontent more often than Ernie. We also find a moderate prevalence of\nstereotypes embedded in the language models, many of which potentially promote\noffensive and derogatory views. Our work highlights the importance of promoting\nfairness and inclusivity in AI technologies with a global perspective."

Recent LLM-based TTS\nworks typically employ complex data processing pipelines to obtain high-quality\ntraining data. These sophisticated pipelines require excellent models at each\nstage (e.g., speech denoising, speech enhancement, speaker diarization, and\npunctuation models), which themselves demand high-quality training data and are\nrarely open-sourced. Even with state-of-the-art models, issues persist, such as\nincomplete background noise removal and misalignment between punctuation and\nactual speech pauses. Moreover, the stringent filtering strategies often retain\nonly 10-30\\% of the original data, significantly impeding data scaling efforts.\nIn this work, we leverage a noise-robust audio tokenizer (S3Tokenizer) to\ndesign a simplified yet effective TTS data processing pipeline that maintains\ndata quality while substantially reducing data acquisition costs, achieving a\ndata retention rate of over 50\\%. Beyond data scaling challenges, LLM-based TTS\nsystems also incur higher deployment costs compared to conventional approaches.\nCurrent systems typically use LLMs solely for text-to-token generation, while\nrequiring separate models (e.g., flow matching models) for token-to-waveform\ngeneration, which cannot be directly executed by LLM inference engines, further\ncomplicating deployment. To address these challenges, we eliminate redundant\nmodules in both LLM and flow components, replacing the flow model backbone with\nan LLM architecture. Building upon this simplified flow backbone, we propose a\nunified architecture for both streaming and non-streaming inference,\nsignificantly reducing deployment costs. Finally, we explore the feasibility of\nunifying TTS and ASR tasks using the same data for training, thanks to the\nsimplified pipeline and the S3Tokenizer that reduces the quality requirements\nfor TTS training data.",

In this work, to address these issues, we leverage\nmulti-modal prompt learning to effectively adapt pre-trained GNN to downstream\ntasks and data, given only a few semantically labeled samples, each with\nextremely weak text supervision. Our new paradigm embeds the graphs directly in\nthe same space as the Large Language Models (LLMs) by learning both graph\nprompts and text prompts simultaneously. To accomplish this, we improve\nstate-of-the-art graph prompt method, and then propose the first graph-language\nmulti-modal prompt learning approach for exploiting the knowledge in\npre-trained models. Notably, due to the insufficient supervision for\nfine-tuning, in our paradigm, the pre-trained GNN and the LLM are kept frozen,\nso the learnable parameters are much fewer than fine-tuning any pre-trained\nmodel. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of our paradigm in few-shot, multi-task-level, and\ncross-domain settings.

To further enhance\nthe performance of non-dominant languages, we propose ShifCon, a Shift-based\nContrastive framework that aligns the internal forward process of other\nlanguages toward that of the dominant one. Specifically, it shifts the\nrepresentations of non-dominant languages into the dominant language subspace,\nallowing them to access relatively rich information encoded in the model\nparameters. The enriched representations are then shifted back into their\noriginal language subspace before generation. Moreover, we introduce a subspace\ndistance metric to pinpoint the optimal layer area for shifting representations\nand employ multilingual contrastive learning to further enhance the alignment\nof representations within this area. Experiments demonstrate that our ShifCon\nframework significantly enhances the performance of non-dominant languages,\nparticularly for low-resource ones.

By leveraging user feedback\nwith interactive prompts at a frame, e.g., a simple click or draw of boxes, TTC\ncould immediately update the corresponding detection results for future\nstreaming inputs, even though the model is deployed with fixed parameters.

To\nachieve such TTC system, we equip existing 3D detectors with Online Adapter\n(OA) module, a prompt-driven query generator for online correction. At the core\nof OA module are visual prompts, images of missed object-of-interest for\nguiding the corresponding detection and subsequent tracking. Those visual\nprompts, belonging to missed objects through online inference, are maintained\nby the visual prompt buffer for continuous error correction in subsequent\nframes. By doing so, TTC consistently detects online missed objects and\nimmediately lowers driving risks. It achieves reliable, versatile, and adaptive\ndriving autonomy. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant gain on instant\nerror rectification over pre-trained 3D detectors, even in challenging\nscenarios with limited labels, zero-shot detection, and adverse conditions.

Recent work introduced IS+, an\nimportance sampling (IS) estimator that uses expert-annotated counterfactual\nsamples to improve behavior dataset coverage.

In this work, we propose a family of OPE estimators\ninspired by the doubly robust (DR) principle.

Previous works leverage Extrinsic Dexterity like walls or table\nedges to grasp such objects. However, they are limited to task-specific\npolicies and lack task planning to find pre-grasp conditions. This makes it\ndifficult to adapt to various environments and extrinsic dexterity constraints.\nTherefore, we present DexDiff, a robust robotic manipulation method for\nlong-horizon planning with extrinsic dexterity. Specifically, we utilize a\nvision-language model (VLM) to perceive the environmental state and generate\nhigh-level task plans, followed by a goal-conditioned action diffusion (GCAD)\nmodel to predict the sequence of low-level actions. This model learns the\nlow-level policy from offline data with the cumulative reward guided by\nhigh-level planning as the goal condition, which allows for improved prediction\nof robot actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only\neffectively performs ungraspable tasks but also generalizes to previously\nunseen objects.
