Although\nlearnable approaches like Q-Former and Perceiver Resampler have been developed\nto reduce the vision token burden, they overlook the context causally modeled\nby LLMs (i.e., key-value cache), potentially leading to missed visual cues when\naddressing user queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to reduce\nvision compute by leveraging redundant vision tokens \"skipping layers\" rather\nthan decreasing the number of vision tokens. Our method, VideoLLM-MoD, is\ninspired by mixture-of-depths LLMs and addresses the challenge of numerous\nvision tokens in long-term or streaming video. Specifically, for each\ntransformer layer, we learn to skip the computation for a high proportion\n(e.g., 80\\%) of vision tokens, passing them directly to the next layer. This\napproach significantly enhances model efficiency, achieving approximately\n\\textasciitilde42\\% time and \\textasciitilde30\\% memory savings for the entire\ntraining. Moreover, our method reduces the computation in the context and avoid\ndecreasing the vision tokens, thus preserving or even improving performance\ncompared to the vanilla model.

However, long-context LLM inference is challenging since the\ninference speed decreases significantly as the sequence length grows. This\nslowdown is primarily caused by loading a large KV cache during self-attention.\nPrevious works have shown that a small portion of critical tokens will dominate\nthe attention outcomes. However, we observe the criticality of a token highly\ndepends on the query. To this end, we propose Quest, a query-aware KV cache\nselection algorithm. Quest keeps track of the minimal and maximal Key values in\nKV cache pages and estimates the criticality of a given page using Query\nvectors. By only loading the Top-K critical KV cache pages for attention, Quest\nsignificantly speeds up self-attention without sacrificing accuracy. We show\nthat Quest can achieve up to 2.23x self-attention speedup, which reduces\ninference latency by 7.03x while performing well on tasks with long\ndependencies with negligible accuracy loss.

RPCool addresses this by falling back to RDMA-based\ncommunication.\n  Overall, RPCool reduces the round-trip latency by 1.93$\\times$ and\n7.2$\\times$ compared to state-of-the-art RDMA and CXL-based RPC mechanisms,\nrespectively. Moreover, RPCool performs either comparably or better than other\nRPC mechanisms across a range of workloads."

Besides, We find that many writes are duplicate, and the duplication\ncan be inter-dup and intra-dup. While inter-dup means different memory blocks\nare identical, and intra-dup means all the 4B elements in a line are the same.\nIn this work, we propose a cache-assisted GPU memory deduplication architecture\nnamed CMD to reduce the off-chip accesses via utilizing the data duplication in\nGPU applications. CMD includes three key design contributions which aim to\nreduce the three kinds of accesses: (1) A novel GPU memory deduplication\narchitecture that removes the inter-dup and inter-dup lines. As for the\ninter-dup detection, we reduce the extra read requests caused by the\ntraditional read-verify hash process. Besides, we design several techniques to\nmanage duplicate blocks. (2) We propose a cache-assisted read scheme to reduce\nthe reads to duplicate data. When an L2 cache miss wants to read the duplicate\nblock, if the reference block has been fetched to L2 and it is clean, we can\ncopy it to the L2 missed block without accessing off-chip DRAM. As for the\nreads to intra-dup data, CMD uses the on-chip metadata cache to get the data.\n(3) When a cache line is evicted, the clean sectors in the line are invalidated\nwhile the dirty sectors are written back. However, most read-only victims are\nre-referenced from DRAM more than twice. Therefore, we add a full-associate\nFIFO to accommodate the read-only (it is also clean) victims to reduce the\nre-reference counts. Experiments show that CMD can decrease the off-chip\naccesses by 31.01%, reduce the energy by 32.78% and improve performance by\n37.79%.

One remedy to this problem is the\npromising paradigm of edge computing. Through collaboration with our industry\npartner, we identify key prohibitive limitations of the current edge mindset:\n(1) servers are not distributed enough and thus, are not close enough to\nvehicles, (2) current proposed edge solutions do not provide substantially\nbetter performance and extra information specific to autonomous vehicles to\nwarrant their cost to the user, and (3) the state-of-the-art solutions are not\ncompatible with popular frameworks used in autonomous systems, particularly the\nRobot Operating System (ROS).\n  To remedy these issues, we provide Genie, an encapsulation technique that can\nenable transparent caching in ROS in a non-intrusive way (i.e., without\nmodifying the source code), can build the cache in a distributed manner (in\ncontrast to traditional central caching methods), and can construct a\ncollective three-dimensional object map to provide substantially better latency\n(even on low-power edge servers) and higher quality data to all vehicles in a\ncertain locality. We fully implement our design on state-of-the-art\nindustry-adopted embedded and edge platforms, using the prominent autonomous\ndriving software Autoware, and find that Genie can enhance the latency of\nAutoware Vision Detector by 82% on average, enable object reusability 31% of\nthe time on average and as much as 67% for the incoming requests, and boost the\nconfidence in its object map considerably over time.",

Despite several works proposing to evict unnecessary\ntokens from the KV Cache, most of them rely on the biased local statistics of\naccumulated attention scores and report performance using unconvincing metric\nlike perplexity on inadequate short-text evaluation. In this paper, we propose\nNACL, a general framework for long-context KV cache eviction that achieves more\noptimal and efficient eviction in a single operation during the encoding phase.\nDue to NACL's efficiency, we combine more accurate attention score statistics\nin PROXY TOKENS EVICTION with the diversified random eviction strategy of\nRANDOM EVICTION, aiming to alleviate the issue of attention bias and enhance\nthe robustness in maintaining pivotal tokens for long-context modeling tasks.\nNotably, our method significantly improves the performance on short- and\nlong-text tasks by 80% and 76% respectively, reducing KV Cache by up to 50%\nwith over 95% performance maintenance.

Despite several works proposing to evict unnecessary\ntokens from the KV Cache, most of them rely on the biased local statistics of\naccumulated attention scores and report performance using unconvincing metric\nlike perplexity on inadequate short-text evaluation. In this paper, we propose\nNACL, a general framework for long-context KV cache eviction that achieves more\noptimal and efficient eviction in a single operation during the encoding phase.\nDue to NACL's efficiency, we combine more accurate attention score statistics\nin PROXY TOKENS EVICTION with the diversified random eviction strategy of\nRANDOM EVICTION, aiming to alleviate the issue of attention bias and enhance\nthe robustness in maintaining pivotal tokens for long-context modeling tasks.\nNotably, our method significantly improves the performance on short- and\nlong-text tasks by 80% and 76% respectively, reducing KV Cache by up to 50%\nwith over 95% performance maintenance. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Research/tree/master/NLP/ACL2024-NACL."

However, these\nstudies only focus on one or several characteristics of NVM, while failing to\nexploit its best practice by putting NVM in the proper position of the whole\nstorage stack. In this paper, we present NVPC, a transparent acceleration to\nexisting kernel file systems with an NVM-enhanced page cache. The acceleration\nlies in two aspects, respectively matching the desperate needs of existing disk\nfile systems: sync writes and cache-missed operations. Besides, the fast DRAM\npage cache is preserved for cache-hit operations. For sync writes, a\nhigh-performance log-based sync absorbing area is provided to redirect data\ndestination from the slow disk to the fast NVM. Meanwhile, the byte-addressable\nfeature of NVM is used to prevent write amplification. For cache-missed\noperations, NVPC makes use of the idle space on NVM to extend the DRAM page\ncache, so that more and larger workloads can fit into the cache. NVPC is\nentirely implemented as a page cache, thus can provide efficient speed-up to\ndisk file systems with full transparency to users and full compatibility to\nlower file systems.\n  In Filebench macro-benchmarks, NVPC achieves at most 3.55x, 2.84x, and 2.64x\nfaster than NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS. In RocksDB workloads with working set larger\nthan DRAM, NVPC achieves 1.12x, 2.59x, and 2.11x faster than NOVA, Ext-4, and\nSPFS. Meanwhile, NVPC gains positive revenue from NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS in\n62.5% of the tested cases in our read/write/sync mixed evaluation,\ndemonstrating that NVPC is more balanced and adaptive to complex real-world\nworkloads.

Here, the e-beam-induced transformation of precursor\nmicroparticles employing a low-energy e-beam with an acceleration voltage of 30\nkV in a scanning electron microscope is developed to increase the versatility\nand efficiency of the technique. Under these conditions, the technique can be\nclassified between e-beam lithography, where the e-beam is used to mill holes\nin or grow some different material onto a substrate, and e-beam welding, where\nmatter can be welded together when overcoming the melting phase. Modifying gold\nmicroparticles on an amorphous SiOx substrate reveals the dominant role of\ninelastic electron-matter interaction and subsequent localized heating for the\nobserved melting and vaporization of the precursor microparticles under the\nelectron beam. Monte-Carlo scattering simulations and thermodynamic modeling\nfurther support the findings.",

Here, the e-beam-induced transformation of precursor\nmicroparticles employing a low-energy e-beam with an acceleration voltage of 30\nkV in a scanning electron microscope is developed to increase the versatility\nand efficiency of the technique. Under these conditions, the technique can be\nclassified between e-beam lithography, where the e-beam is used to mill holes\nin or grow some different material onto a substrate, and e-beam welding, where\nmatter can be welded together when overcoming the melting phase. Modifying gold\nmicroparticles on an amorphous SiOx substrate reveals the dominant role of\ninelastic electron-matter interaction and subsequent localized heating for the\nobserved melting and vaporization of the precursor microparticles under the\nelectron beam. Monte-Carlo scattering simulations and thermodynamic modeling\nfurther support the findings."

Extensive testing across a wide range of\nworkloads reveals up to a 9X speedup in write-heavy workloads and up to 45%\nenergy savings due to reduced read and write I/O. Furthermore, we achieve\nsignificant reductions in median and tail read latencies of up to 89% and 85%\nrespectively."

Mainstream LLMs\ncan be grouped into two categories based on masking strategy: causal LLM and\nprefix LLM. Several works have demonstrated that prefix LLMs tend to outperform\ncausal ones in scenarios that heavily depend on historical context such as\nmulti-turn dialogues or in-context learning, thanks to their bidirectional\nattention on prefix sequences. However, prefix LLMs have an inherent\ninefficient training problem in multi-turn dialogue datasets. In addition, the\nattention mechanism of prefix LLM makes it unable to reuse Key-Value Cache (KV\nCache) across dialogue rounds to reduce generation latency. In this paper, we\npropose a novel masking scheme called Intermittent Semi-working Mask (ISM) to\naddress these problems. Specifically, we apply alternate bidirectional and\nunidirectional attention on queries and answers in the dialogue history. In\nthis way, ISM is able to maintain the high quality of prefix LLM and low\ngeneration latency of causal LLM, simultaneously. Extensive experiments\nillustrate that our ISM achieves significant performance.",

                    "value": "Multi-turn dialogues are a key interaction method between humans and Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), as conversations extend over multiple rounds, keeping\nLLMs' high generation quality and low latency is a challenge. Mainstream LLMs\ncan be grouped into two categories based on masking strategy: causal LLM and\nprefix LLM. Several works have demonstrated that prefix LLMs tend to outperform\ncausal ones in scenarios that heavily depend on historical context such as\nmulti-turn dialogues or in-context learning, thanks to their bidirectional\nattention on prefix sequences. However, prefix LLMs have an inherent\ninefficient training problem in multi-turn dialogue datasets. In addition, the\nattention mechanism of prefix LLM makes it unable to reuse Key-Value Cache (KV\nCache) across dialogue rounds to reduce generation latency. In this paper, we\npropose a novel masking scheme called Intermittent Semi-working Mask (ISM) to\naddress these problems. Specifically, we apply alternate bidirectional and\nunidirectional attention on queries and answers in the dialogue history. In\nthis way, ISM is able to maintain the high quality of prefix LLM and low\ngeneration latency of causal LLM, simultaneously. Extensive experiments\nillustrate that our ISM achieves significant performance."

We also outline the potential of extending our method\nto value cache pruning, demonstrating ThinK's versatility and broad\napplicability in reducing both memory and computational overheads."

The second is\nknowledge-guided cache refinement, which refines pair values (i.e.,\npseudo-labels) and cache weights by leveraging knowledge distillation from\nlarge-scale vision language models.

Our analysis\nreveals that, apart from the fact that different applications may require\ndifferent retention times, the clock frequency, which is typically ignored in\nmost STT-RAM studies, may also significantly impact applications' retention\ntime needs.

KV\nstores frequently consist of heterogeneous clusters, characterized by varying\nhardware specifications of the deployment nodes, with each node potentially\nrunning a distinct version of the KV store software. This heterogeneity is\naccompanied by the diverse metadata that they need to manage. In this study, we\nintroduce MetaHive, a cache-optimized approach to managing metadata in\nheterogeneous KV store clusters. MetaHive disaggregates the original data from\nits associated metadata to promote independence between them, while maintaining\ntheir interconnection during usage. This makes the metadata opaque from the\ndownstream processes and the other KV stores in the cluster. MetaHive also\nensures that the KV and metadata entries are stored in the vicinity of each\nother in memory and storage. This allows MetaHive to optimally utilize the\ncaching mechanism without extra storage read overhead for metadata retrieval.\nWe deploy MetaHive to ensure data integrity in RocksDB and demonstrate its\nrapid data validation with minimal effect on performance.",

                    "value": "Cloud key-value (KV) stores provide businesses with a cost-effective and\nadaptive alternative to traditional on-premise data management solutions. KV\nstores frequently consist of heterogeneous clusters, characterized by varying\nhardware specifications of the deployment nodes, with each node potentially\nrunning a distinct version of the KV store software. This heterogeneity is\naccompanied by the diverse metadata that they need to manage. In this study, we\nintroduce MetaHive, a cache-optimized approach to managing metadata in\nheterogeneous KV store clusters. MetaHive disaggregates the original data from\nits associated metadata to promote independence between them, while maintaining\ntheir interconnection during usage. This makes the metadata opaque from the\ndownstream processes and the other KV stores in the cluster. MetaHive also\nensures that the KV and metadata entries are stored in the vicinity of each\nother in memory and storage. This allows MetaHive to optimally utilize the\ncaching mechanism without extra storage read overhead for metadata retrieval.\nWe deploy MetaHive to ensure data integrity in RocksDB and demonstrate its\nrapid data validation with minimal effect on performance."

In this paper, we introduce a framework\ngrounded in group and symmetry principles, which have played a crucial role in\nfields such as physics and mathematics, and offer another way to evaluate their\ncapabilities.

To\nsupport this critique, we conducted a pre-experiment treating the output\ndistribution from powerful LLMs as efficient world data compression. By\nevaluating the similarity between the $n$-gram distribution and the one-hot\ndistribution with LLMs, we observed that the $n$-gram distributions align more\nclosely with the output distribution of LLMs. Based on this insight, we\nintroduce Next Distribution Prediction (NDP), which uses $n$-gram distributions\nto replace the one-hot targets, enhancing learning without extra online\ntraining time. We conducted experiments across translation, general task,\nlanguage transfer, and medical domain adaptation. Compared to NTP, NDP can\nachieve up to +2.97 COMET improvement in translation tasks, +0.61 average\nimprovement in general tasks, and incredible +10.75 average improvement in the\nmedical domain.

However, its effects on learned policies remain\npuzzling: some studies highlight its importance for achieving strong\nperformance, while others observe detrimental effects. In this paper, we first\ndissect the role of action chunking by analyzing the divergence between the\nlearner and the demonstrator. We find that longer action chunks enable a policy\nto better capture temporal dependencies by taking into account more past states\nand actions within the chunk. However, this advantage comes at the cost of\nexacerbating errors in stochastic environments due to fewer observations of\nrecent states. To address this, we propose Bidirectional Decoding (BID), a\ntest-time inference algorithm that bridges action chunking with closed-loop\noperations. BID samples multiple predictions at each time step and searches for\nthe optimal one based on two criteria: (i) backward coherence, which favors\nsamples aligned with previous decisions, (ii) forward contrast, which favors\nsamples close to outputs of a stronger policy and distant from those of a\nweaker policy. By coupling decisions within and across action chunks, BID\nenhances temporal consistency over extended sequences while enabling adaptive\nreplanning in stochastic environments.

                "summary": "Short-video recommender systems often exhibit a biased preference to recently\nreleased videos. However, not all videos become outdated; certain classic\nvideos can still attract user's attention. Such bias along temporal dimension\ncan be further aggravated by the matching model between users and videos,\nbecause the model learns from preexisting interactions. From real data, we\nobserve that different videos have varying sensitivities to recency in\nattracting users' attention. Our analysis, based on a causal graph modeling\nshort-video recommendation, suggests that the release interval serves as a\nconfounder, establishing a backdoor path between users and videos. To address\nthis confounding effect, we propose a model-agnostic causal architecture called\nLearning to Deconfound the Release Interval Bias (LDRI).

                    "value": "Short-video recommender systems often exhibit a biased preference to recently\nreleased videos. However, not all videos become outdated; certain classic\nvideos can still attract user's attention. Such bias along temporal dimension\ncan be further aggravated by the matching model between users and videos,\nbecause the model learns from preexisting interactions. From real data, we\nobserve that different videos have varying sensitivities to recency in\nattracting users' attention. Our analysis, based on a causal graph modeling\nshort-video recommendation, suggests that the release interval serves as a\nconfounder, establishing a backdoor path between users and videos. To address\nthis confounding effect, we propose a model-agnostic causal architecture called\nLearning to Deconfound the Release Interval Bias (LDRI).

Even in the era of\nlarge-scale language models (LLMs), MoE continues to play a crucial role, as\nsome researchers have indicated that GPT-4 adopts the MoE structure to ensure\ndiverse inference results. However, MoE is susceptible to performance\ndegeneracy, particularly evident in the issues of imbalance and homogeneous\nrepresentation among experts. While previous studies have extensively addressed\nthe problem of imbalance, the challenge of homogeneous representation remains\nunresolved. In this study, we shed light on the homogeneous representation\nproblem, wherein experts in the MoE fail to specialize and lack diversity,\nleading to frustratingly high similarities in their representations (up to 99\\%\nin a well-performed MoE model). This problem restricts the expressive power of\nthe MoE and, we argue, contradicts its original intention. To tackle this\nissue, we propose a straightforward yet highly effective solution: OMoE, an\northogonal expert optimizer. Additionally, we introduce an alternating training\nstrategy that encourages each expert to update in a direction orthogonal to the\nsubspace spanned by other experts. Our algorithm facilitates MoE training in\ntwo key ways: firstly, it explicitly enhances representation diversity, and\nsecondly, it implicitly fosters interaction between experts during orthogonal\nweights computation.

With the\nemergence of jailbreak attack methods exploiting different vulnerabilities in\nLLMs, the corresponding safety alignment measures are also evolving. In this\npaper, we propose a comprehensive and detailed taxonomy of jailbreak attack and\ndefense methods. For instance, the attack methods are divided into black-box\nand white-box attacks based on the transparency of the target model. Meanwhile,\nwe classify defense methods into prompt-level and model-level defenses.\nAdditionally, we further subdivide these attack and defense methods into\ndistinct sub-classes and present a coherent diagram illustrating their\nrelationships. We also conduct an investigation into the current evaluation\nmethods and compare them from different perspectives. Our findings aim to\ninspire future research and practical implementations in safeguarding LLMs\nagainst adversarial attacks. Above all, although jailbreak remains a\nsignificant concern within the community, we believe that our work enhances the\nunderstanding of this domain and provides a foundation for developing more\nsecure LLMs.",

With the\nemergence of jailbreak attack methods exploiting different vulnerabilities in\nLLMs, the corresponding safety alignment measures are also evolving. In this\npaper, we propose a comprehensive and detailed taxonomy of jailbreak attack and\ndefense methods. For instance, the attack methods are divided into black-box\nand white-box attacks based on the transparency of the target model. Meanwhile,\nwe classify defense methods into prompt-level and model-level defenses.\nAdditionally, we further subdivide these attack and defense methods into\ndistinct sub-classes and present a coherent diagram illustrating their\nrelationships. We also conduct an investigation into the current evaluation\nmethods and compare them from different perspectives. Our findings aim to\ninspire future research and practical implementations in safeguarding LLMs\nagainst adversarial attacks. Above all, although jailbreak remains a\nsignificant concern within the community, we believe that our work enhances the\nunderstanding of this domain and provides a foundation for developing more\nsecure LLMs."

Existing approaches commonly utilize multiple\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) blocks to acquire task-specific\nknowledge, yet these methods are inefficient and fail to leverage potential\nknowledge transfer across tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel CL\nframework for language models, named Task Skill Localization and Consolidation\n(TaSL), which boosts knowledge transfer without depending on memory replay.\nTaSL initially segregates the model into 'skill units' based on parameter\ndependencies, allowing for more precise control. Subsequently, it employs a\nnovel group-wise skill localization technique to ascertain the importance\ndistribution of skill units for a new task. By comparing this importance\ndistribution with those from previous tasks, we implement a fine-grained skill\nconsolidation strategy that retains task-specific knowledge, thereby preventing\nforgetting, and updates task-shared knowledge, which facilitates bi-directional\nknowledge transfer. As a result, TaSL achieves an optimal balance between\nretaining prior knowledge and excelling in new tasks. TaSL also demonstrates\nstrong generalizability, making it suitable for various base models and\nadaptable to PEFT methods like LoRA.

While cluster randomized experiments mitigate this bias, they\nencounter limitations in handling network complexity and fail to distinguish\nbetween direct and indirect effects. To address these challenges, we develop a\ndesign-based asymptotic theory for the existing Horvitz--Thompson estimators of\nthe direct, indirect, and global average treatment effects under Bernoulli\ntrials. We assume the heterogeneous additive treatment effect model with a\nhidden network that drives interference. Observing that these estimators are\ninconsistent in dense networks, we introduce novel eigenvector-based regression\nadjustment estimators to ensure consistency. We establish the asymptotic\nnormality of the proposed estimators and provide conservative variance\nestimators under the design-based inference framework, offering robust\nconclusions independent of the underlying stochastic processes of the network\nand model parameters. Our method's adaptability is demonstrated across various\ninterference structures, including partial interference and local interference\nin a two-sided marketplace. Numerical studies further illustrate the efficacy\nof the proposed estimators, offering practical insights into handling network\ninterference.",

                    "value": "Randomized experiments are the gold standard for estimating treatment\neffects, yet network interference challenges the validity of traditional\nestimators by violating the stable unit treatment value assumption and\nintroducing bias. While cluster randomized experiments mitigate this bias, they\nencounter limitations in handling network complexity and fail to distinguish\nbetween direct and indirect effects. To address these challenges, we develop a\ndesign-based asymptotic theory for the existing Horvitz--Thompson estimators of\nthe direct, indirect, and global average treatment effects under Bernoulli\ntrials. We assume the heterogeneous additive treatment effect model with a\nhidden network that drives interference. Observing that these estimators are\ninconsistent in dense networks, we introduce novel eigenvector-based regression\nadjustment estimators to ensure consistency. We establish the asymptotic\nnormality of the proposed estimators and provide conservative variance\nestimators under the design-based inference framework, offering robust\nconclusions independent of the underlying stochastic processes of the network\nand model parameters. Our method's adaptability is demonstrated across various\ninterference structures, including partial interference and local interference\nin a two-sided marketplace. Numerical studies further illustrate the efficacy\nof the proposed estimators, offering practical insights into handling network\ninterference."

The existing research on\naudio LLM has primarily focused on enhancing the architecture and scale of\naudio language models, as well as leveraging larger datasets, and generally,\nacoustic codecs, such as EnCodec, are used for audio tokenization. However,\nthese codecs were originally designed for audio compression, which may lead to\nsuboptimal performance in the context of audio LLM. Our research aims to\naddress the shortcomings of current audio LLM codecs, particularly their\nchallenges in maintaining semantic integrity in generated audio. For instance,\nexisting methods like VALL-E, which condition acoustic token generation on text\ntranscriptions, often suffer from content inaccuracies and elevated word error\nrates (WER) due to semantic misinterpretations of acoustic tokens, resulting in\nword skipping and errors. To overcome these issues, we propose a\nstraightforward yet effective approach called X-Codec. X-Codec incorporates\nsemantic features from a pre-trained semantic encoder before the Residual\nVector Quantization (RVQ) stage and introduces a semantic reconstruction loss\nafter RVQ. By enhancing the semantic ability of the codec, X-Codec\nsignificantly reduces WER in speech synthesis tasks and extends these benefits\nto non-speech applications, including music and sound generation. Our\nexperiments in text-to-speech, music continuation, and text-to-sound tasks\ndemonstrate that integrating semantic information substantially improves the\noverall performance of language models in audio generation.

Their morphologies are disk like, with\nradii of 2.0-4.4 kpc, and exhibit substructures such as clumps and spiral arms.\nThe galaxies have dust extinctions up to Av=5-7 mag extending over several kpc\nwith asymmetric distributions that include off-center regions resembling bent\nspiral arms and clumps. Their NIR dust-attenuation curve deviates from standard\nlaws, possibly implying different dust-star geometries or dust grain properties\nthan commonly assumed in starburst galaxies. The proximity of galaxies with\nconsistent redshifts, strong color gradients, an overall disturbed appearance,\nasymmetric dust obscuration, and widespread star formation collectively favor\ninteractions (minor mergers and flybys) as the mechanism driving the CO\ngalaxies' exceptional SFRs. The galaxies' large masses and rich environment\nhint at membership in two proto-structures, as initially inferred from their\nassociation with a Planck-selected high-z source."

It is likely that there\nwill be an AI/ML Processing Unit onboard the spacecraft running an inference\nengine. The neural-network will have pre-installed parameters that can be\nupdated onboard by uploading, by telecommands, parameters obtained by training\non the ground.

This eliminates the need to reconstruct videos on\nthe edge server while maintaining low latency. Specifically, it derives\ncompact, task-relevant features by employing the deterministic information\nbottleneck (IB) method, which strikes a balance between feature informativeness\nand communication costs. Given the computational challenges caused by IB-based\nobjectives with high-dimensional data, we resort to variational approximations\nfor feasible optimization.

This eliminates the need to reconstruct videos on\nthe edge server while maintaining low latency. Specifically, it derives\ncompact, task-relevant features by employing the deterministic information\nbottleneck (IB) method, which strikes a balance between feature informativeness\nand communication costs. Given the computational challenges caused by IB-based\nobjectives with high-dimensional data, we resort to variational approximations\nfor feasible optimization. Compared to TOCOM-TEM, JPEG, and HEVC, PIB achieves\nan improvement of up to 15.1\\% in mean object detection accuracy (MODA) and\nreduces communication costs by 66.7% when edge cameras experience poor channel\nconditions."

                "summary": "JWST is producing high-quality rest-frame optical and UV spectra of faint\ngalaxies at $z>4$ for the first time, challenging models of galaxy and stellar\npopulations. One galaxy recently observed at $z=5.943$, GS9422, has nebular\nline and UV continuum emission that appears to require a high ionizing photon\nproduction efficiency. This has been explained with an exotic stellar initial\nmass function (IMF), 10-30x more top-heavy than a Salpeter IMF (Cameron et al.\n2023). Here we suggest an alternate explanation to this exotic IMF. We use a\nnew flexible neural net emulator for CLOUDY, Cue, to infer the shape of the\nionizing spectrum directly from the observed emission line fluxes. By\ndescribing the ionizing spectrum with a piece-wise power-law, Cue is agnostic\nto the source of the ionizing photons. Cue finds that the ionizing radiation\nfrom GS9422 can be approximated by a double power law characterized by\n$\\frac{Q_\\mathrm{HeII}}{Q_\\mathrm{H}} = -1.5$, which can be interpreted as a\ncombination of young, metal-poor stars and a low-luminosity active galactic\nnucleus (AGN) with $F_{\\nu} \\propto \\lambda ^ {2}$ in a 65%/35% ratio. This\nsuggests a significantly lower nebular continuum contribution to the observed\nUV flux (24%) than a top-heavy IMF ($\\gtrsim80$%), and hence, necessitates a\ndamped Lyman-$\\alpha$ absorber (DLA) to explain the continuum turnover\nbluewards of $\\sim1400$ Angstrom.

                    "value": "JWST is producing high-quality rest-frame optical and UV spectra of faint\ngalaxies at $z>4$ for the first time, challenging models of galaxy and stellar\npopulations. One galaxy recently observed at $z=5.943$, GS9422, has nebular\nline and UV continuum emission that appears to require a high ionizing photon\nproduction efficiency. This has been explained with an exotic stellar initial\nmass function (IMF), 10-30x more top-heavy than a Salpeter IMF (Cameron et al.\n2023). Here we suggest an alternate explanation to this exotic IMF. We use a\nnew flexible neural net emulator for CLOUDY, Cue, to infer the shape of the\nionizing spectrum directly from the observed emission line fluxes. By\ndescribing the ionizing spectrum with a piece-wise power-law, Cue is agnostic\nto the source of the ionizing photons. Cue finds that the ionizing radiation\nfrom GS9422 can be approximated by a double power law characterized by\n$\\frac{Q_\\mathrm{HeII}}{Q_\\mathrm{H}} = -1.5$, which can be interpreted as a\ncombination of young, metal-poor stars and a low-luminosity active galactic\nnucleus (AGN) with $F_{\\nu} \\propto \\lambda ^ {2}$ in a 65%/35% ratio. This\nsuggests a significantly lower nebular continuum contribution to the observed\nUV flux (24%) than a top-heavy IMF ($\\gtrsim80$%), and hence, necessitates a\ndamped Lyman-$\\alpha$ absorber (DLA) to explain the continuum turnover\nbluewards of $\\sim1400$ Angstrom. While current data cannot rule out either\nscenario, given the immense impact the proposed top-heavy IMF would have on\nmodels of galaxy formation, it is important to propose viable alternative\nexplanations and to further investigate the nature of peculiar high-z nebular\nemitters."

In this paper, we present\nAdaptVision, a multimodal large language model specifically designed to\ndynamically process input images at varying resolutions. We hypothesize that\nthe requisite number of visual tokens for the model is contingent upon both the\nresolution and content of the input image. Generally, natural images with a\nlower information density can be effectively interpreted by the model using\nfewer visual tokens at reduced resolutions. In contrast, images containing\ntextual content, such as documents with rich text, necessitate a higher number\nof visual tokens for accurate text interpretation due to their higher\ninformation density. Building on this insight, we devise a dynamic image\npartitioning module that adjusts the number of visual tokens according to the\nsize and aspect ratio of images. This method mitigates distortion effects that\narise from resizing images to a uniform resolution and dynamically optimizing\nthe visual tokens input to the LLMs. Our model is capable of processing images\nwith resolutions up to $1008\\times 1008$. Extensive experiments across various\ndatasets demonstrate that our method achieves impressive performance in\nhandling vision-language tasks in both natural and text-related scenes.

Extensive experiments across various\ndatasets demonstrate that our method achieves impressive performance in\nhandling vision-language tasks in both natural and text-related scenes. The\nsource code and dataset are now publicly available at\n\\url{https://github.com/harrytea/AdaptVision}."

In this paper, we propose 3D-VLA, a weakly\nsupervised approach for 3D visual grounding based on Visual Linguistic\nAlignment. Our 3D-VLA exploits the superior ability of current large-scale\nvision-language models (VLMs) on aligning the semantics between texts and 2D\nimages, as well as the naturally existing correspondences between 2D images and\n3D point clouds, and thus implicitly constructs correspondences between texts\nand 3D point clouds with no need for fine-grained box annotations in the\ntraining procedure. During the inference stage, the learned text-3D\ncorrespondence will help us ground the text queries to the 3D target objects\neven without 2D images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to\ninvestigate 3D visual grounding in a weakly supervised manner by involving\nlarge scale vision-language models, and extensive experiments on ReferIt3D and\nScanRefer datasets demonstrate that our 3D-VLA achieves comparable and even\nsuperior results over the fully supervised methods.",

The fast cadence, good resolution, and high polarimetric sensitivity of\nViSP data provide a unique opportunity to explore the photospheric magnetic\nfields before and during the flare. We infer the magnetic field vector in the\nphotosphere from the Fe I 6302 line using Milne-Eddington inversions. Combined\nanalysis of the inverted data and VBI images reveals the presence of two\noppositely-polarity pores exhibiting rotational motion both prior to and\nthroughout the flare event. Data-driven simulations further reveal a complex\nmagnetic field topology above the rotating pores, including a null-point-like\nconfiguration. We observed a 30% relative change in the horizontal component\n($\\delta F_h$) of Lorentz force at the flare peak time and roughly no change in\nthe radial component. We find that the changes in $\\delta F_h$ are the most\nlikely driver of the observed pore rotation.

In this paper, we introduce a\ncomputational framework for modeling this emergence of human color vision by\nsimulating both the eye and the cortex. Existing research often overlooks how\nthe cortex develops color vision or represents color space internally, assuming\nthat the color dimensionality is known a priori; however, we argue that the\nvisual cortex has the capability and the challenge of inferring the color\ndimensionality purely from fluctuations in the optic nerve signals. To validate\nour theory, we introduce a simulation engine for biological eyes based on\nestablished vision science and generate optic nerve signals resulting from\nlooking at natural images. Further, we propose a model of cortical learning\nbased on self-supervised principle and show that this model naturally learns to\ngenerate color vision by disentangling retinal invariants from the sensory\nsignals. When the retina contains N types of color photoreceptors, our\nsimulation shows that N-dimensional color vision naturally emerges, verified\nthrough formal colorimetry. Using this framework, we also present the first\nsimulation work that successfully boosts the color dimensionality, as observed\nin gene therapy on squirrel monkeys, and demonstrates the possibility of\nenhancing human color vision from 3D to 4D.",

                    "value": "It is a mystery how the brain decodes color vision purely from the optic\nnerve signals it receives, with a core inferential challenge being how it\ndisentangles internal perception with the correct color dimensionality from the\nunknown encoding properties of the eye. In this paper, we introduce a\ncomputational framework for modeling this emergence of human color vision by\nsimulating both the eye and the cortex. Existing research often overlooks how\nthe cortex develops color vision or represents color space internally, assuming\nthat the color dimensionality is known a priori; however, we argue that the\nvisual cortex has the capability and the challenge of inferring the color\ndimensionality purely from fluctuations in the optic nerve signals. To validate\nour theory, we introduce a simulation engine for biological eyes based on\nestablished vision science and generate optic nerve signals resulting from\nlooking at natural images. Further, we propose a model of cortical learning\nbased on self-supervised principle and show that this model naturally learns to\ngenerate color vision by disentangling retinal invariants from the sensory\nsignals. When the retina contains N types of color photoreceptors, our\nsimulation shows that N-dimensional color vision naturally emerges, verified\nthrough formal colorimetry. Using this framework, we also present the first\nsimulation work that successfully boosts the color dimensionality, as observed\nin gene therapy on squirrel monkeys, and demonstrates the possibility of\nenhancing human color vision from 3D to 4D."

Additionally, we assess the models'\nself-evaluation capabilities by analyzing the calibration of verbalized\nconfidence scores in these text classification tasks. Our findings reveal that\nwhile BERT-based models generally outperform both the LLMs and SLM, the\nperformance of the large generative models is still noteworthy. Furthermore,\nour calibration analysis reveals that although Gemma is well-calibrated in\ninitial tasks, it thereafter produces inconsistent results; Llama is reasonably\ncalibrated, and GPT consistently exhibits strong calibration. Through this\nresearch, we aim to contribute to the ongoing discussion on the utility and\neffectiveness of generative LMs in addressing some of the planet's most urgent\nissues, highlighting their strengths and limitations in the context of ecology\nand CC."

Online Source-Free Domain Adaptation\n(O-SFDA) offers model adaptation using a stream of unlabeled data from a target\ndomain in an online manner.

This paper introduces a novel approach to\nenhance O-SFDA for adaptive object detection through unsupervised data\nacquisition.

Online Source-Free Domain Adaptation\n(O-SFDA) offers model adaptation using a stream of unlabeled data from a target\ndomain in an online manner. However, not all captured frames contain\ninformation beneficial for adaptation, especially in the presence of redundant\ndata and class imbalance issues. This paper introduces a novel approach to\nenhance O-SFDA for adaptive object detection through unsupervised data\nacquisition.

                "summary": "Recent advancements in audio generation have been significantly propelled by\nthe capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The existing research on\naudio LLM has primarily focused on enhancing the architecture and scale of\naudio language models, as well as leveraging larger datasets, and generally,\nacoustic codecs, such as EnCodec, are used for audio tokenization. However,\nthese codecs were originally designed for audio compression, which may lead to\nsuboptimal performance in the context of audio LLM. Our research aims to\naddress the shortcomings of current audio LLM codecs, particularly their\nchallenges in maintaining semantic integrity in generated audio. For instance,\nexisting methods like VALL-E, which condition acoustic token generation on text\ntranscriptions, often suffer from content inaccuracies and elevated word error\nrates (WER) due to semantic misinterpretations of acoustic tokens, resulting in\nword skipping and errors. To overcome these issues, we propose a\nstraightforward yet effective approach called X-Codec. X-Codec incorporates\nsemantic features from a pre-trained semantic encoder before the Residual\nVector Quantization (RVQ) stage and introduces a semantic reconstruction loss\nafter RVQ. By enhancing the semantic ability of the codec, X-Codec\nsignificantly reduces WER in speech synthesis tasks and extends these benefits\nto non-speech applications, including music and sound generation. Our\nexperiments in text-to-speech, music continuation, and text-to-sound tasks\ndemonstrate that integrating semantic information substantially improves the\noverall performance of language models in audio generation.

The existing research on\naudio LLM has primarily focused on enhancing the architecture and scale of\naudio language models, as well as leveraging larger datasets, and generally,\nacoustic codecs, such as EnCodec, are used for audio tokenization. However,\nthese codecs were originally designed for audio compression, which may lead to\nsuboptimal performance in the context of audio LLM. Our research aims to\naddress the shortcomings of current audio LLM codecs, particularly their\nchallenges in maintaining semantic integrity in generated audio. For instance,\nexisting methods like VALL-E, which condition acoustic token generation on text\ntranscriptions, often suffer from content inaccuracies and elevated word error\nrates (WER) due to semantic misinterpretations of acoustic tokens, resulting in\nword skipping and errors. To overcome these issues, we propose a\nstraightforward yet effective approach called X-Codec. X-Codec incorporates\nsemantic features from a pre-trained semantic encoder before the Residual\nVector Quantization (RVQ) stage and introduces a semantic reconstruction loss\nafter RVQ. By enhancing the semantic ability of the codec, X-Codec\nsignificantly reduces WER in speech synthesis tasks and extends these benefits\nto non-speech applications, including music and sound generation. Our\nexperiments in text-to-speech, music continuation, and text-to-sound tasks\ndemonstrate that integrating semantic information substantially improves the\noverall performance of language models in audio generation.

Inspired by professional human interpreters, we\nutilize a novel data-driven read-write strategy to balance the translation\nquality and latency. To address the challenge of translating in-domain\nterminologies, CLASI employs a multi-modal retrieving module to obtain relevant\ninformation to augment the translation. Supported by LLMs, our approach can\ngenerate error-tolerated translation by considering the input audio, historical\ncontext, and retrieved information.

Inspired by professional human interpreters, we\nutilize a novel data-driven read-write strategy to balance the translation\nquality and latency. To address the challenge of translating in-domain\nterminologies, CLASI employs a multi-modal retrieving module to obtain relevant\ninformation to augment the translation. Supported by LLMs, our approach can\ngenerate error-tolerated translation by considering the input audio, historical\ncontext, and retrieved information.

Building on this understanding, we propose\na novel fine-tuning approach, Safely Partial-Parameter Fine-Tuning (SPPFT),\nthat fixes the gradient of the safety layers during fine-tuning to address the\nsecurity degradation. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach\nsignificantly preserves model security while maintaining performance and\nreducing computational resources compared to full fine-tuning."

Generally, natural images with a\nlower information density can be effectively interpreted by the model using\nfewer visual tokens at reduced resolutions. In contrast, images containing\ntextual content, such as documents with rich text, necessitate a higher number\nof visual tokens for accurate text interpretation due to their higher\ninformation density. Building on this insight, we devise a dynamic image\npartitioning module that adjusts the number of visual tokens according to the\nsize and aspect ratio of images. This method mitigates distortion effects that\narise from resizing images to a uniform resolution and dynamically optimizing\nthe visual tokens input to the LLMs. Our model is capable of processing images\nwith resolutions up to $1008\\times 1008$.

However, compiler fuzzing remains challenging: Existing arts\nfocus on black- and grey-box fuzzing, which generates tests without sufficient\nunderstanding of internal compiler behaviors. Meanwhile, traditional white-box\ntechniques, like symbolic execution, are computationally inapplicable to the\ngiant codebase of compilers. Recent advances demonstrate that Large Language\nModels (LLMs) excel in code generation/understanding tasks. Nonetheless,\nguiding LLMs with compiler source-code information remains a missing piece of\nresearch in compiler testing.\n  To this end, we propose WhiteFox, the first white-box compiler fuzzer using\nLLMs with source-code information to test compiler optimization, with a\nspotlight on detecting deep logic bugs in the deep learning (DL) compilers.\nWhiteFox adopts a multi-agent framework: an LLM-based analysis agent examines\nthe low-level optimization source code and produces requirements on the\nhigh-level test programs that can trigger the optimization; an LLM-based\ngeneration agent produces test programs based on the summarized requirements.\nAdditionally, optimization-triggering tests are used as feedback to enhance the\ngeneration on the fly. Our evaluation on the three most popular DL compilers\n(i.e., PyTorch Inductor, TensorFlow-XLA, and TensorFlow Lite) shows WhiteFox\ncan generate high-quality test programs to exercise deep optimizations,\npracticing up to 8X more than state-of-the-art fuzzers. WhiteFox has found 101\nbugs for the DL compilers, with 92 confirmed as previously unknown and 70\nfixed. WhiteFox has been acknowledged by the PyTorch team and is being\nincorporated into its development workflow. Beyond DL compilers, WhiteFox can\nalso be adapted for compilers in different domains.",

                "summary": "A well-known dilemma in large vision-language models (e.g., GPT-4, LLaVA) is\nthat while increasing the number of vision tokens generally enhances visual\nunderstanding, it also significantly raises memory and computational costs,\nespecially in long-term, dense video frame streaming scenarios. Although\nlearnable approaches like Q-Former and Perceiver Resampler have been developed\nto reduce the vision token burden, they overlook the context causally modeled\nby LLMs (i.e., key-value cache), potentially leading to missed visual cues when\naddressing user queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to reduce\nvision compute by leveraging redundant vision tokens \"skipping layers\" rather\nthan decreasing the number of vision tokens. Our method, VideoLLM-MoD, is\ninspired by mixture-of-depths LLMs and addresses the challenge of numerous\nvision tokens in long-term or streaming video. Specifically, for each\ntransformer layer, we learn to skip the computation for a high proportion\n(e.g., 80\\%) of vision tokens, passing them directly to the next layer. This\napproach significantly enhances model efficiency, achieving approximately\n\\textasciitilde42\\% time and \\textasciitilde30\\% memory savings for the entire\ntraining. Moreover, our method reduces the computation in the context and avoid\ndecreasing the vision tokens, thus preserving or even improving performance\ncompared to the vanilla model. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of VideoLLM-MoD, showing its state-of-the-art results on\nmultiple benchmarks, including narration, forecasting, and summarization tasks\nin COIN, Ego4D, and Ego-Exo4D datasets.",

It then\nemploys a low rank matrix to approximate the quantization error, and a sparse\nmatrix to remedy individual errors from outlier entries. By adeptly integrating\nthree techniques, GEAR is able to fully exploit their synergistic potentials.\nOur experiments demonstrate that compared to alternatives, GEAR achieves\nnear-lossless 4-bit KV cache compression with up to 2.38x throughput\nimprovement, while reducing peak-memory size up to 2.29x. Our code is publicly\navailable at https://github.com/HaoKang-Timmy/GEAR."

However, their\nextraction behavior on complex sentences and tasks is unstable, emerging issues\nsuch as false positives and missing elements. We observe that decomposing\ncomplex extraction tasks and extracting them step by step can effectively\nimprove LLMs' performance, and the extraction orders of entities significantly\naffect the final results of LLMs. This paper proposes a two-stage multi-step\nmethod for LLM-based information extraction and adopts the RL framework to\nexecute the multi-step planning. We regard sequential extraction as a Markov\ndecision process, build an LLM-based extraction environment, design a decision\nmodule to adaptively provide the optimal order for sequential entity extraction\non different sentences, and utilize the DDQN algorithm to train the decision\nmodel. We also design the rewards and evaluation metrics suitable for the\nextraction results of LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple public\ndatasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving the\ninformation extraction capabilities of LLMs.",

                    "value": "Existing research on large language models (LLMs) shows that they can solve\ninformation extraction tasks through multi-step planning. However, their\nextraction behavior on complex sentences and tasks is unstable, emerging issues\nsuch as false positives and missing elements. We observe that decomposing\ncomplex extraction tasks and extracting them step by step can effectively\nimprove LLMs' performance, and the extraction orders of entities significantly\naffect the final results of LLMs. This paper proposes a two-stage multi-step\nmethod for LLM-based information extraction and adopts the RL framework to\nexecute the multi-step planning. We regard sequential extraction as a Markov\ndecision process, build an LLM-based extraction environment, design a decision\nmodule to adaptively provide the optimal order for sequential entity extraction\non different sentences, and utilize the DDQN algorithm to train the decision\nmodel. We also design the rewards and evaluation metrics suitable for the\nextraction results of LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple public\ndatasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving the\ninformation extraction capabilities of LLMs."

Further, we analyse the performance of models across\nvarious settings such as varying sizes of graphs as well as different forms of\nk-shot prompting. We highlight various limitations, biases and properties of\nLLMs through this benchmarking process, such as an inverse relation to the\naverage degrees of freedom of traversal per node in graphs, the overall\nnegative impact of k-shot prompting on graph reasoning tasks, and a positive\nresponse bias which prevents LLMs from identifying the absence of a valid\nsolution.

According to automatic evaluation metrics, IKUN-C\nachieved 6 first-place and 3 second-place finishes among all constrained\nsystems, while IKUN secured 1 first-place and 2 second-place finishes across\nboth open and constrained systems. These encouraging results suggest that large\nlanguage models (LLMs) are nearing the level of proficiency required for\neffective multilingual machine translation. The systems are based on a\ntwo-stage approach: first, continuous pre-training on monolingual data in 10\nlanguages, followed by fine-tuning on high-quality parallel data for 11\nlanguage directions. The primary difference between IKUN and IKUN-C lies in\ntheir monolingual pre-training strategy. IKUN-C is pre-trained using\nconstrained monolingual data, whereas IKUN leverages monolingual data from the\nOSCAR dataset. In the second phase, both systems are fine-tuned on parallel\ndata sourced from NTREX, Flores, and WMT16-23 for all 11 language pairs.",

According to automatic evaluation metrics, IKUN-C\nachieved 6 first-place and 3 second-place finishes among all constrained\nsystems, while IKUN secured 1 first-place and 2 second-place finishes across\nboth open and constrained systems. These encouraging results suggest that large\nlanguage models (LLMs) are nearing the level of proficiency required for\neffective multilingual machine translation. The systems are based on a\ntwo-stage approach: first, continuous pre-training on monolingual data in 10\nlanguages, followed by fine-tuning on high-quality parallel data for 11\nlanguage directions. The primary difference between IKUN and IKUN-C lies in\ntheir monolingual pre-training strategy. IKUN-C is pre-trained using\nconstrained monolingual data, whereas IKUN leverages monolingual data from the\nOSCAR dataset. In the second phase, both systems are fine-tuned on parallel\ndata sourced from NTREX, Flores, and WMT16-23 for all 11 language pairs."

We recruited 12 participants to interact with\nan LLM-VA during a cooking task, selected for its complexity and the\nrequirement for continuous interaction. We observed that users show both verbal\nand nonverbal behaviors, though they know that the LLM-VA can not capture those\nnonverbal signals. Despite the prevalence of nonverbal behavior in human-human\ncommunication, there is no established analytical methodology or framework for\nexploring it in human-VA interactions. After analyzing 3 hours and 39 minutes\nof video recordings, we developed an analytical framework with three\ndimensions: 1) behavior characteristics, including both verbal and nonverbal\nbehaviors, 2) interaction stages--exploration, conflict, and integration--that\nillustrate the progression of user interactions, and 3) stage transition\nthroughout the task. This analytical framework identifies key verbal and\nnonverbal behaviors that provide a foundation for future research and practical\napplications in optimizing human and LLM-VA interactions.",

We recruited 12 participants to interact with\nan LLM-VA during a cooking task, selected for its complexity and the\nrequirement for continuous interaction. We observed that users show both verbal\nand nonverbal behaviors, though they know that the LLM-VA can not capture those\nnonverbal signals. Despite the prevalence of nonverbal behavior in human-human\ncommunication, there is no established analytical methodology or framework for\nexploring it in human-VA interactions. After analyzing 3 hours and 39 minutes\nof video recordings, we developed an analytical framework with three\ndimensions: 1) behavior characteristics, including both verbal and nonverbal\nbehaviors, 2) interaction stages--exploration, conflict, and integration--that\nillustrate the progression of user interactions, and 3) stage transition\nthroughout the task. This analytical framework identifies key verbal and\nnonverbal behaviors that provide a foundation for future research and practical\napplications in optimizing human and LLM-VA interactions."

As a promising technology for 6G mobile systems, integrated sensing\nand communication (ISAC) can be used to detect high-mobility UAVs with a low\ndeployment cost. The micro-Doppler signals from UAV rotors can be leveraged to\naddress the detection of low-mobility and hovering UAVs using ISAC signals.\nHowever, determining whether the frame structure of the ISAC system can be used\nto identify UAVs, and how to accurately capture the weak rotor micro-Doppler\nsignals of UAVs in complex environments, remain two challenging problems. This\npaper first proposes a novel frame structure for UAV micro-Doppler extraction\nand the representation of UAV micro-Doppler signals within the channel state\ninformation (CSI). Furthermore, to address complex environments and the\ninterference caused by UAV body vibrations, the rotor micro-Doppler null space\npursuit (rmD-NSP) algorithm and the feature extraction algorithm\nsynchroextracting transform (SET) are designed to effectively separate UAV's\nrotor micro-Doppler signals and enhance their features in the spectrogram.\nFinally, both simulation and hardware testbed demonstrate that the proposed\nrmD-NSP algorithm enables the ISAC base station (BS) to accurately and\ncompletely extract UAV's rotor micro-Doppler signals. Within a 0.1s observation\nperiod, ISAC BS successfully captures eight rotations of the DJI M300 RTK UAV's\nrotor in urban environments.

In this paper, we propose LRP4RAG, a method based on the\nLayer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) algorithm for detecting hallucinations\nin RAG. Specifically, we first utilize LRP to compute the relevance between the\ninput and output of the RAG generator. We then apply further extraction and\nresampling to the relevance matrix. The processed relevance data are input into\nmultiple classifiers to determine whether the output contains hallucinations.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that LRP has been used for\ndetecting RAG hallucinations, and extensive experiments demonstrate that\nLRP4RAG outperforms existing baselines.",

In this paper, we propose LRP4RAG, a method based on the\nLayer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) algorithm for detecting hallucinations\nin RAG. Specifically, we first utilize LRP to compute the relevance between the\ninput and output of the RAG generator. We then apply further extraction and\nresampling to the relevance matrix. The processed relevance data are input into\nmultiple classifiers to determine whether the output contains hallucinations.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that LRP has been used for\ndetecting RAG hallucinations, and extensive experiments demonstrate that\nLRP4RAG outperforms existing baselines."
