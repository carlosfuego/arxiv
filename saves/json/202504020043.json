We further investigate the accuracy performance of\nindividual samples rather than the overall performance, revealing the intrinsic\nlimitations in \\texttt{KV} \\texttt{cache} compression when handling specific\nLLM tasks. Third, we provide tools to shed light on future \\texttt{KV}\n\\texttt{cache} compression studies and facilitate their practical deployment in\nproduction.

While binary search is typically utilized\nfor branch operations, it may lead to inefficient cache utilization in\nmain-memory scenarios. In contrast, trie-based index structures drive branch\noperations through prefix matching. While these structures generally produce\nfewer cache misses and are thus increasingly popular, they may underperform in\nrange scans because of frequent pointer chasing. This paper proposes a new\nhigh-performance B$^+$-tree variant called \\textbf{Feature B$^+$-tree\n(FB$^+$-tree)}. Similar to employing bit or byte for branch operation in tries,\nFB$^+$-tree progressively considers several bytes following the common prefix\non each level of its inner nodes\\textemdash referred to as features, which\nallows FB$^+$-tree to benefit from prefix skewness. FB$^+$-tree blurs the lines\nbetween B$^+$-trees and tries, while still retaining balance. In the best case,\nFB$^+$-tree almost becomes a trie, whereas in the worst case, it continues to\nfunction as a B$^+$-tree. Meanwhile, a crafted synchronization protocol that\ncombines the link technique and optimistic lock is designed to support\nefficient concurrent index access. Distinctively, FB$^+$-tree leverages subtle\natomic operations seamlessly coordinated with optimistic lock to facilitate\nlatch-free updates, which can be easily extended to other structures.

To address these\nlimitations, we propose COSMIC (Clique-Oriented Semantic Multi-space\nIntegration for CLIP), a robust test-time adaptation framework that enhances\nadaptability through multi-granular, cross-modal semantic caching and\ngraph-based querying mechanisms.

The Dual\nSemantics Graph constructs complementary semantic spaces by incorporating\ntextual features, coarse-grained CLIP features, and fine-grained DINOv2\nfeatures to capture rich semantic relationships. Building upon these dual\ngraphs, the Clique Guided Hyper-class component leverages structured class\nrelationships to enhance prediction robustness through correlated class\nselection. Extensive experiments demonstrate COSMIC's superior performance\nacross multiple benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over\nstate-of-the-art methods: 15.81% gain on out-of-distribution tasks and 5.33% on\ncross-domain generation with CLIP RN-50.

Key-Value Cache (KVCache), the\nintermediate representations of tokens within LLM inference, has now become the\nprimary memory bottleneck due to limited GPU memory. Current methods\nselectively determine suitable keys and values for self-attention computation\nin LLMs to address the issue. However, they either fall short in maintaining\nmodel quality or result in high serving latency. Drawing inspiration from\nadvanced embedding retrieval techniques prevalent in the data management\ncommunity, we consider the storage and retrieval of KVCache as a typical\nembedding retrieval problem. We propose PQCache, which employs Product\nQuantization (PQ) to manage KVCache, maintaining model quality while ensuring\nlow serving latency. During the prefilling phase, we apply PQ to tokens' keys\nfor each LLM layer and head. During the autoregressive decoding phase, we use\nPQ codes and centroids to approximately identify important preceding tokens,\nthen fetch the corresponding key-value pairs for self-attention computation.\nThrough meticulous design of overlapping and caching, we minimize any\nadditional computation and communication overhead during both phases. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that PQCache achieves both effectiveness and\nefficiency, with 4.60% score improvement over existing methods on InfiniteBench\nand low system latency in both prefilling and decoding.",

Key-Value Cache (KVCache), the\nintermediate representations of tokens within LLM inference, has now become the\nprimary memory bottleneck due to limited GPU memory. Current methods\nselectively determine suitable keys and values for self-attention computation\nin LLMs to address the issue. However, they either fall short in maintaining\nmodel quality or result in high serving latency. Drawing inspiration from\nadvanced embedding retrieval techniques prevalent in the data management\ncommunity, we consider the storage and retrieval of KVCache as a typical\nembedding retrieval problem. We propose PQCache, which employs Product\nQuantization (PQ) to manage KVCache, maintaining model quality while ensuring\nlow serving latency. During the prefilling phase, we apply PQ to tokens' keys\nfor each LLM layer and head. During the autoregressive decoding phase, we use\nPQ codes and centroids to approximately identify important preceding tokens,\nthen fetch the corresponding key-value pairs for self-attention computation.\nThrough meticulous design of overlapping and caching, we minimize any\nadditional computation and communication overhead during both phases. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that PQCache achieves both effectiveness and\nefficiency, with 4.60% score improvement over existing methods on InfiniteBench\nand low system latency in both prefilling and decoding."

To suppress external\nmagnetic noise the apparatus is enclosed within a cylindrical four-layer\nmu-metal shield with a shielding factor exceeding $10^6$ in one radial\ndirection and $10^5$ in the other.

Using atomic magnetometers to monitor the magnetic field\ninside the shield, we measure noise below 40 fT/$\\sqrt{{\\rm Hz}}$ at 1 Hz and\nabove, rising to 500 fT/$\\sqrt{{\\rm Hz}}$ at 0.1 Hz.

Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used\ntechnique to reduce latency losslessly, but the conventional wisdom suggests\nthat its efficacy is limited to small batch sizes. In MagicDec, we show that\nsurprisingly SD can achieve speedup even for a high throughput inference regime\nfor moderate to long sequences. More interestingly, an intelligent drafting\nstrategy can achieve better speedup with increasing batch size based on our\nrigorous analysis. MagicDec first identifies the bottleneck shifts with\nincreasing batch size and sequence length, and uses these insights to deploy SD\nmore effectively for high throughput inference. We leverage draft model with\nsparse KV cache to address the KV bottleneck, which scales with both sequence\nlength and batch size. Additionally, we propose a theoretical model to select\nthe optimal drafting strategy for maximum speedup. Our work highlights the\nbroad applicability of speculative decoding in long-context serving, as it can\nenhance throughput and reduce latency without compromising accuracy. For\nmoderate to long sequences, we demonstrate up to 2.51x speedup for Llama3.1-8B\nwhen serving batch sizes ranging from 32 to 256 on various types of hardware\nand tasks.",

Challenges exist because of difficulties not only in accelerating\ndiffusion sampling but also VAE decoding in VDM, areas under-explored in\nprevious works. To address these challenges, we present FlashVDM, a systematic\nframework for accelerating both VAE and DiT in VDM. For DiT, FlashVDM enables\nflexible diffusion sampling with as few as 5 inference steps and comparable\nquality, which is made possible by stabilizing consistency distillation with\nour newly introduced Progressive Flow Distillation. For VAE, we introduce a\nlightning vecset decoder equipped with Adaptive KV Selection, Hierarchical\nVolume Decoding, and Efficient Network Design. By exploiting the locality of\nthe vecset and the sparsity of shape surface in the volume, our decoder\ndrastically lowers FLOPs, minimizing the overall decoding overhead. We apply\nFlashVDM to Hunyuan3D-2 to obtain Hunyuan3D-2 Turbo. Through systematic\nevaluation, we show that our model significantly outperforms existing fast 3D\ngeneration methods, achieving comparable performance to the state-of-the-art\nwhile reducing inference time by over 45x for reconstruction and 32x for\ngeneration.

Unlike prior methods, which\nrely heavily on training data (often inaccessible during online inference) and\nare limited to recognizing a fixed set of point cloud classes predefined during\ntraining, we explore a more practical and challenging scenario: adapting the\nmodel solely based on online test data to recognize both previously seen\nclasses and novel, unseen classes at test time. To this end, we develop\n\\textbf{Point-Cache}, a hierarchical cache model that captures essential clues\nof online test samples, particularly focusing on the global structure of point\nclouds and their local-part details. Point-Cache, which serves as a rich 3D\nknowledge base, is dynamically managed to prioritize the inclusion of\nhigh-quality samples. Designed as a plug-and-play module, our method can be\nflexibly integrated into large multimodal 3D models to support open-vocabulary\npoint cloud recognition. Notably, our solution operates with efficiency\ncomparable to zero-shot inference, as it is entirely training-free. Point-Cache\ndemonstrates substantial gains across 8 challenging benchmarks and 4\nrepresentative large 3D models, highlighting its effectiveness.

Unlike prior methods, which\nrely heavily on training data (often inaccessible during online inference) and\nare limited to recognizing a fixed set of point cloud classes predefined during\ntraining, we explore a more practical and challenging scenario: adapting the\nmodel solely based on online test data to recognize both previously seen\nclasses and novel, unseen classes at test time. To this end, we develop\n\\textbf{Point-Cache}, a hierarchical cache model that captures essential clues\nof online test samples, particularly focusing on the global structure of point\nclouds and their local-part details. Point-Cache, which serves as a rich 3D\nknowledge base, is dynamically managed to prioritize the inclusion of\nhigh-quality samples. Designed as a plug-and-play module, our method can be\nflexibly integrated into large multimodal 3D models to support open-vocabulary\npoint cloud recognition. Notably, our solution operates with efficiency\ncomparable to zero-shot inference, as it is entirely training-free. Point-Cache\ndemonstrates substantial gains across 8 challenging benchmarks and 4\nrepresentative large 3D models, highlighting its effectiveness. Code is\navailable at https://github.com/auniquesun/Point-Cache."

To address these issues, we propose\nVivar, a novel system that integrates multi-modal sensor data and presents 3D\nvolumetric content for AR visualization. In particular, we introduce a\ncross-modal embedding approach that maps sensor data into a pre-trained visual\nembedding space through barycentric interpolation.

In addition,\nVivar leverages latent reuse and caching strategies to accelerate 2D and AR\ncontent generation, demonstrating 11x latency reduction without compromising\nquality.

The complexity of applications results in a wide variety of memory\naccess patterns, prompting the development of numerous cache-prefetching\nalgorithms. Consequently, commercial processors often employ a hybrid of these\nalgorithms to enhance the overall prefetching performance. Nonetheless, since\nthese prefetchers share hardware resources, conflicts arising from competing\nprefetching requests can negate the benefits of hardware prefetching. Under\nsuch circumstances, several prefetcher selection algorithms have been proposed\nto mitigate conflicts between prefetchers. However, these prior solutions\nsuffer from two limitations. First, the input demand request allocation is\ninaccurate. Second, the prefetcher selection criteria are coarse-grained.\n  In this paper, we address both limitations by introducing an efficient and\nwidely applicable prefetcher selection algorithm--Alecto, which tailors the\ndemand requests for each prefetcher. Every demand request is first sent to\nAlecto to identify suitable prefetchers before being routed to prefetchers for\ntraining and prefetching. Our analysis shows that Alecto is adept at not only\nharmonizing prefetching accuracy, coverage, and timeliness but also\nsignificantly enhancing the utilization of the prefetcher table, which is vital\nfor temporal prefetching. Alecto outperforms the state-of-the-art RL-based\nprefetcher selection algorithm--Bandit by 2.76% in single-core, and 7.56% in\neight-core. For memory-intensive benchmarks, Alecto outperforms Bandit by\n5.25%. Alecto consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance in scheduling\nvarious types of cache prefetchers. In addition to the performance improvement,\nAlecto can reduce the energy consumption associated with accessing the\nprefetchers' table by 48%, while only adding less than 1 KB of storage\noverhead.",

HERMES focuses on optimizing memory subsystems for RISC-V\narchitectures to meet the computational needs of ML models such as CNNs, RNNs,\nand Transformers. This project explores state-of-the-art techniques such as\nadvanced prefetching, tensor-aware caching, and hybrid memory models. The\ncornerstone of HERMES is the integration of shared L3 caches with fine-grained\ncoherence protocols equipped with specialized pathways to deep-learning\naccelerators such as Gemmini. Simulation tools like Gem5 and DRAMSim2 were used\nto evaluate baseline performance and scalability under representative ML\nworkloads. The findings of this study highlight the design choices, and the\nanticipated challenges, paving the way for low-latency scalable memory\noperations for ML applications.",

HERMES focuses on optimizing memory subsystems for RISC-V\narchitectures to meet the computational needs of ML models such as CNNs, RNNs,\nand Transformers. This project explores state-of-the-art techniques such as\nadvanced prefetching, tensor-aware caching, and hybrid memory models. The\ncornerstone of HERMES is the integration of shared L3 caches with fine-grained\ncoherence protocols equipped with specialized pathways to deep-learning\naccelerators such as Gemmini. Simulation tools like Gem5 and DRAMSim2 were used\nto evaluate baseline performance and scalability under representative ML\nworkloads. The findings of this study highlight the design choices, and the\nanticipated challenges, paving the way for low-latency scalable memory\noperations for ML applications."

To address this, we propose $\\textbf{ReTaKe}$, a\ntraining-free method with two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly\nreduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for video\ncompression. To align with the way of human temporal perception, DPSelect\nidentifies keyframes based on inter-frame distance peaks. To leverage LLMs'\nlearned prior knowledge, PivotKV marks the keyframes as pivots and compress\nnon-pivot frames by pruning low-attention tokens in their KV cache. ReTaKe\nenables VideoLLMs to process 8 times longer frames (up to 2048), outperforming\nsimilar-sized models by 3-5% and even rivaling much larger ones on VideoMME,\nMLVU, LongVideoBench, and LVBench. Moreover, by overlapping compression\noperations with prefilling, ReTaKe introduces only ~10% prefilling latency\noverhead while reducing decoding latency by ~20%.

Cache-aided STNs\nare acknowledged as a promising paradigm for accelerating content delivery to\nusers and alleviating the load of backhaul links. However, the dynamic nature\nof low earth orbit (LEO) satellites and the complex interference among\nsatellite beams and terrestrial base stations pose challenges in effectively\nmanaging limited edge resources. To address these issues, this paper proposes a\nmethod for dynamically scheduling caching and communication resources, aiming\nto reduce network costs in terms of transmission power consumption and backhaul\ntraffic, while meeting user QoS demands and resource constraints. We formulate\na mixed timescale problem to jointly optimize cache placement, LEO satellite\nbeam direction, and cooperative multicast beamforming among satellite beams and\nbase stations. To tackle this intricate problem, we propose a two-stage\nsolution framework, where the primary problem is decoupled into a short-term\ncontent delivery subproblem and a long-term cache placement subproblem. The\nformer subproblem is solved by designing an alternating optimization approach\nwith whale optimization and successive convex approximation methods according\nto the cache placement state, while cache content in STNs is updated using an\niterative algorithm that utilizes historical information. Simulation results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, showcasing their\nconvergence and significantly reducing transmission power consumption and\nbackhaul traffic by up to 52%.",

To address these issues, this paper proposes a\nmethod for dynamically scheduling caching and communication resources, aiming\nto reduce network costs in terms of transmission power consumption and backhaul\ntraffic, while meeting user QoS demands and resource constraints. We formulate\na mixed timescale problem to jointly optimize cache placement, LEO satellite\nbeam direction, and cooperative multicast beamforming among satellite beams and\nbase stations. To tackle this intricate problem, we propose a two-stage\nsolution framework, where the primary problem is decoupled into a short-term\ncontent delivery subproblem and a long-term cache placement subproblem. The\nformer subproblem is solved by designing an alternating optimization approach\nwith whale optimization and successive convex approximation methods according\nto the cache placement state, while cache content in STNs is updated using an\niterative algorithm that utilizes historical information. Simulation results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, showcasing their\nconvergence and significantly reducing transmission power consumption and\nbackhaul traffic by up to 52%."

At the same time, LLMs possess\nlarge parameter sizes and use key-value caches to store context information.\nModern LLMs support context windows with up to 1 million tokens to generate\nversatile text, audio, and video content. A large key-value cache unique to\neach prompt requires a large memory capacity, limiting the inference batch\nsize. Both low operational intensity and limited batch size necessitate a high\nmemory bandwidth. However, contemporary hardware systems for ML model\ndeployment, such as GPUs and TPUs, are primarily optimized for compute\nthroughput. This mismatch challenges the efficient deployment of advanced LLMs\nand makes users pay for expensive compute resources that are poorly utilized\nfor the memory-bound LLM inference tasks.\n  We propose CENT, a CXL-ENabled GPU-Free sysTem for LLM inference, which\nharnesses CXL memory expansion capabilities to accommodate substantial LLM\nsizes, and utilizes near-bank processing units to deliver high memory\nbandwidth, eliminating the need for expensive GPUs. CENT exploits a scalable\nCXL network to support peer-to-peer and collective communication primitives\nacross CXL devices. We implement various parallelism strategies to distribute\nLLMs across these devices. Compared to GPU baselines with maximum supported\nbatch sizes and similar average power, CENT achieves 2.3$\\times$ higher\nthroughput and consumes 2.3$\\times$ less energy. CENT enhances the Total Cost\nof Ownership (TCO), generating 5.2$\\times$ more tokens per dollar than GPUs.",

                    "value": "Large Language Model (LLM) inference uses an autoregressive manner to\ngenerate one token at a time, which exhibits notably lower operational\nintensity compared to earlier Machine Learning (ML) models such as encoder-only\ntransformers and Convolutional Neural Networks. At the same time, LLMs possess\nlarge parameter sizes and use key-value caches to store context information.\nModern LLMs support context windows with up to 1 million tokens to generate\nversatile text, audio, and video content. A large key-value cache unique to\neach prompt requires a large memory capacity, limiting the inference batch\nsize. Both low operational intensity and limited batch size necessitate a high\nmemory bandwidth. However, contemporary hardware systems for ML model\ndeployment, such as GPUs and TPUs, are primarily optimized for compute\nthroughput. This mismatch challenges the efficient deployment of advanced LLMs\nand makes users pay for expensive compute resources that are poorly utilized\nfor the memory-bound LLM inference tasks.\n  We propose CENT, a CXL-ENabled GPU-Free sysTem for LLM inference, which\nharnesses CXL memory expansion capabilities to accommodate substantial LLM\nsizes, and utilizes near-bank processing units to deliver high memory\nbandwidth, eliminating the need for expensive GPUs. CENT exploits a scalable\nCXL network to support peer-to-peer and collective communication primitives\nacross CXL devices. We implement various parallelism strategies to distribute\nLLMs across these devices. Compared to GPU baselines with maximum supported\nbatch sizes and similar average power, CENT achieves 2.3$\\times$ higher\nthroughput and consumes 2.3$\\times$ less energy. CENT enhances the Total Cost\nof Ownership (TCO), generating 5.2$\\times$ more tokens per dollar than GPUs."

To address this critical language gap in\nmedical QA, we propose Multilingual Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval Ranking\n(MKG-Rank), a knowledge graph-enhanced framework that enables English-centric\nLLMs to perform multilingual medical QA. Through a word-level translation\nmechanism, our framework efficiently integrates comprehensive English-centric\nmedical knowledge graphs into LLM reasoning at a low cost, mitigating\ncross-lingual semantic distortion and achieving precise medical QA across\nlanguage barriers. To enhance efficiency, we introduce caching and multi-angle\nranking strategies to optimize the retrieval process, significantly reducing\nresponse times and prioritizing relevant medical knowledge. Extensive\nevaluations on multilingual medical QA benchmarks across Chinese, Japanese,\nKorean, and Swahili demonstrate that MKG-Rank consistently outperforms\nzero-shot LLMs, achieving maximum 35.03% increase in accuracy, while\nmaintaining an average retrieval time of only 0.0009 seconds.",

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in medical\nquestion answering (QA), yet their effectiveness remains predominantly limited\nto English due to imbalanced multilingual training data and scarce medical\nresources for low-resource languages. To address this critical language gap in\nmedical QA, we propose Multilingual Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval Ranking\n(MKG-Rank), a knowledge graph-enhanced framework that enables English-centric\nLLMs to perform multilingual medical QA. Through a word-level translation\nmechanism, our framework efficiently integrates comprehensive English-centric\nmedical knowledge graphs into LLM reasoning at a low cost, mitigating\ncross-lingual semantic distortion and achieving precise medical QA across\nlanguage barriers. To enhance efficiency, we introduce caching and multi-angle\nranking strategies to optimize the retrieval process, significantly reducing\nresponse times and prioritizing relevant medical knowledge. Extensive\nevaluations on multilingual medical QA benchmarks across Chinese, Japanese,\nKorean, and Swahili demonstrate that MKG-Rank consistently outperforms\nzero-shot LLMs, achieving maximum 35.03% increase in accuracy, while\nmaintaining an average retrieval time of only 0.0009 seconds."

However, Diffusion Transformers\n(DiTs) continue to encounter challenges related to low inference speed,\nprimarily due to the iterative denoising process. To address this issue, we\npropose BlockDance, a training-free approach that explores feature similarities\nat adjacent time steps to accelerate DiTs. Unlike previous feature-reuse\nmethods that lack tailored reuse strategies for features at different scales,\nBlockDance prioritizes the identification of the most structurally similar\nfeatures, referred to as Structurally Similar Spatio-Temporal (STSS) features.\nThese features are primarily located within the structure-focused blocks of the\ntransformer during the later stages of denoising. BlockDance caches and reuses\nthese highly similar features to mitigate redundant computation, thereby\naccelerating DiTs while maximizing consistency with the generated results of\nthe original model. Furthermore, considering the diversity of generated content\nand the varying distributions of redundant features, we introduce\nBlockDance-Ada, a lightweight decision-making network tailored for\ninstance-specific acceleration. BlockDance-Ada dynamically allocates resources\nand provides superior content quality. Both BlockDance and BlockDance-Ada have\nproven effective across various generation tasks and models, achieving\naccelerations between 25% and 50% while maintaining generation quality.",

                    "value": "Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive generation capabilities,\nparticularly with recent advancements leveraging transformer architectures to\nimprove both visual and artistic quality. However, Diffusion Transformers\n(DiTs) continue to encounter challenges related to low inference speed,\nprimarily due to the iterative denoising process. To address this issue, we\npropose BlockDance, a training-free approach that explores feature similarities\nat adjacent time steps to accelerate DiTs. Unlike previous feature-reuse\nmethods that lack tailored reuse strategies for features at different scales,\nBlockDance prioritizes the identification of the most structurally similar\nfeatures, referred to as Structurally Similar Spatio-Temporal (STSS) features.\nThese features are primarily located within the structure-focused blocks of the\ntransformer during the later stages of denoising. BlockDance caches and reuses\nthese highly similar features to mitigate redundant computation, thereby\naccelerating DiTs while maximizing consistency with the generated results of\nthe original model. Furthermore, considering the diversity of generated content\nand the varying distributions of redundant features, we introduce\nBlockDance-Ada, a lightweight decision-making network tailored for\ninstance-specific acceleration. BlockDance-Ada dynamically allocates resources\nand provides superior content quality. Both BlockDance and BlockDance-Ada have\nproven effective across various generation tasks and models, achieving\naccelerations between 25% and 50% while maintaining generation quality."

In\nthis work, we introduce a class of block diffusion language models that\ninterpolate between discrete denoising diffusion and autoregressive models.\nBlock diffusion overcomes key limitations of both approaches by supporting\nflexible-length generation and improving inference efficiency with KV caching\nand parallel token sampling. We propose a recipe for building effective block\ndiffusion models that includes an efficient training algorithm, estimators of\ngradient variance, and data-driven noise schedules to minimize the variance.\nBlock diffusion sets a new state-of-the-art performance among diffusion models\non language modeling benchmarks and enables generation of arbitrary-length\nsequences.

In\nthis work, we introduce a class of block diffusion language models that\ninterpolate between discrete denoising diffusion and autoregressive models.\nBlock diffusion overcomes key limitations of both approaches by supporting\nflexible-length generation and improving inference efficiency with KV caching\nand parallel token sampling. We propose a recipe for building effective block\ndiffusion models that includes an efficient training algorithm, estimators of\ngradient variance, and data-driven noise schedules to minimize the variance.\nBlock diffusion sets a new state-of-the-art performance among diffusion models\non language modeling benchmarks and enables generation of arbitrary-length\nsequences.

In this study, we introduce\nTimestep Embedding Aware Cache (TeaCache), a training-free caching approach\nthat estimates and leverages the fluctuating differences among model outputs\nacross timesteps. Rather than directly using the time-consuming model outputs,\nTeaCache focuses on model inputs, which have a strong correlation with the\nmodeloutputs while incurring negligible computational cost. TeaCache first\nmodulates the noisy inputs using the timestep embeddings to ensure their\ndifferences better approximating those of model outputs. TeaCache then\nintroduces a rescaling strategy to refine the estimated differences and\nutilizes them to indicate output caching.

We introduce\npatch-based querying, in contrast to existing pixel-based queries, to reduce\nthe compute required to render a target view. This makes our model highly\nefficient both during training and at inference, capable of rendering at 600\nfps on commercial hardware. Notably, our model is designed to use a learned\nlatent camera pose which allows for training using unposed targets in datasets\nwith sparse or inaccurate ground truth camera pose. We show that our approach\ncan generalize on large real-world data and introduce a new benchmark dataset\n(MSVS-1M) for latent view synthesis using street-view imagery collected from\nMapillary. In contrast to NeRF and Gaussian Splatting, which require dense\nimagery and precise metadata, ERUPT can render novel views of arbitrary scenes\nwith as few as five unposed input images. ERUPT achieves better rendered image\nquality than current state-of-the-art methods for unposed image synthesis\ntasks, reduces labeled data requirements by ~95\\% and decreases computational\nrequirements by an order of magnitude, providing efficient novel view synthesis\nfor diverse real-world scenes.",

This paper introduces a point\ntracking challenge to address this, wherein participants can submit their\nalgorithms for quantification. The submitted algorithms are evaluated using a\ndataset named surgical tattoos in infrared (STIR), with the challenge aptly\nnamed the STIR Challenge 2024. The STIR Challenge 2024 comprises two\nquantitative components: accuracy and efficiency. The accuracy component tests\nthe accuracy of algorithms on in vivo and ex vivo sequences. The efficiency\ncomponent tests the latency of algorithm inference. The challenge was conducted\nas a part of MICCAI EndoVis 2024. In this challenge, we had 8 total teams, with\n4 teams submitting before and 4 submitting after challenge day.

Our approach features two key modules: sound generation and\nsound localization. The sound generation module leverages a conditional\ndiffusion model, which takes multiscale features rendered from a\nfeature-augmented 3DGS to generate realistic hitting sounds. Meanwhile, the\nsound localization module enables querying the 3D scene, represented by the\nfeature-augmented 3DGS, to localize hitting positions based on the sound\nsources. To support this framework, we introduce a novel pipeline for\ncollecting scene-level visual-sound sample pairs, achieving alignment between\ncaptured images, impact locations, and corresponding sounds. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first dataset to connect visual and acoustic signals in\na 3D context.

The research also\ninvestigates the application of synthetic data in fake news classification,\ncomparing traditional machine learning models with transformer based models\nsuch as BERT. Our experiments demonstrate that transformer models, especially\nBERT, effectively leverage synthetic data for fake news detection, showing\nimprovements with smaller proportions of synthetic data. Additionally, we find\nthat fact verification features, which focus on identifying factual\ninconsistencies, provide the most promising results in distinguishing synthetic\nfake news.

In this work, we call for rigorous assessment of agents on\nindividual tasks in a scientific workflow before making bold claims on\nend-to-end automation. To this end, we present ScienceAgentBench, a new\nbenchmark for evaluating language agents for data-driven scientific discovery.\nTo ensure the scientific authenticity and real-world relevance of our\nbenchmark, we extract 102 tasks from 44 peer-reviewed publications in four\ndisciplines and engage nine subject matter experts to validate them. We unify\nthe target output for every task to a self-contained Python program file and\nemploy an array of evaluation metrics to examine the generated programs,\nexecution results, and costs. Each task goes through multiple rounds of manual\nvalidation by annotators and subject matter experts to ensure its annotation\nquality and scientific plausibility. We also propose two effective strategies\nto mitigate data contamination concerns. Using ScienceAgentBench, we evaluate\nfive open-weight and proprietary LLMs, each with three frameworks: direct\nprompting, OpenHands CodeAct, and self-debug. Given three attempts for each\ntask, the best-performing agent can only solve 32.4% of the tasks independently\nand 34.3% with expert-provided knowledge. In addition, we evaluate OpenAI\no1-preview with direct prompting and self-debug, which can boost the\nperformance to 42.2%, demonstrating the effectiveness of increasing\ninference-time compute but with more than 10 times the cost of other LLMs.\nStill, our results underscore the limitations of current language agents in\ngenerating code for data-driven discovery, let alone end-to-end automation for\nscientific research.",

In contrast, we present a\nbenchmark with 594 problems based on the NPR Sunday Puzzle Challenge that\nrequires only general knowledge. Our benchmark is challenging for both humans\nand models; however correct solutions are easy to verify, and models' mistakes\nare easy to spot. As LLMs are more widely deployed in society, we believe it is\nuseful to develop benchmarks for frontier models that humans can understand\nwithout the need for deep domain expertise.\n  Our work reveals capability gaps that are not evident in existing benchmarks:\nOpenAI o1 significantly outperforms other reasoning models on our benchmark,\ndespite being on par with other models when tested on benchmarks that test\nspecialized knowledge. Furthermore, our analysis of reasoning outputs uncovers\nnew kinds of failures. DeepSeek R1, for instance, often concedes with \"I give\nup\" before providing an answer that it knows is wrong. R1 can also be\nremarkably \"uncertain\" in its output and in rare cases, it does not \"finish\nthinking,\" which suggests the need for techniques to \"wrap up\" before the\ncontext window limit is reached. We also quantify the effectiveness of\nreasoning longer to identify the point beyond which more reasoning is unlikely\nto improve accuracy on our benchmark.",

In contrast, we present a\nbenchmark with 594 problems based on the NPR Sunday Puzzle Challenge that\nrequires only general knowledge. Our benchmark is challenging for both humans\nand models; however correct solutions are easy to verify, and models' mistakes\nare easy to spot. As LLMs are more widely deployed in society, we believe it is\nuseful to develop benchmarks for frontier models that humans can understand\nwithout the need for deep domain expertise.\n  Our work reveals capability gaps that are not evident in existing benchmarks:\nOpenAI o1 significantly outperforms other reasoning models on our benchmark,\ndespite being on par with other models when tested on benchmarks that test\nspecialized knowledge. Furthermore, our analysis of reasoning outputs uncovers\nnew kinds of failures. DeepSeek R1, for instance, often concedes with \"I give\nup\" before providing an answer that it knows is wrong. R1 can also be\nremarkably \"uncertain\" in its output and in rare cases, it does not \"finish\nthinking,\" which suggests the need for techniques to \"wrap up\" before the\ncontext window limit is reached. We also quantify the effectiveness of\nreasoning longer to identify the point beyond which more reasoning is unlikely\nto improve accuracy on our benchmark."

                "summary": "The detection of telecom fraud faces significant challenges due to the lack\nof high-quality multimodal training data that integrates audio signals with\nreasoning-oriented textual analysis. To address this gap, we present\nTeleAntiFraud-28k, the first open-source audio-text slow-thinking dataset\nspecifically designed for automated telecom fraud analysis. Our dataset is\nconstructed through three strategies: (1) Privacy-preserved text-truth sample\ngeneration using automatically speech recognition (ASR)-transcribed call\nrecordings (with anonymized original audio), ensuring real-world consistency\nthrough text-to-speech (TTS) model regeneration; (2) Semantic enhancement via\nlarge language model (LLM)-based self-instruction sampling on authentic ASR\noutputs to expand scenario coverage; (3) Multi-agent adversarial synthesis that\nsimulates emerging fraud tactics through predefined communication scenarios and\nfraud typologies. The generated dataset contains 28,511 rigorously processed\nspeech-text pairs, complete with detailed annotations for fraud reasoning. The\ndataset is divided into three tasks: scenario classification, fraud detection,\nfraud type classification. Furthermore, we construct TeleAntiFraud-Bench, a\nstandardized evaluation benchmark comprising proportionally sampled instances\nfrom the dataset, to facilitate systematic testing of model performance on\ntelecom fraud detection tasks. We also contribute a production-optimized\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) model trained on hybrid real/synthetic data, while\nopen-sourcing the data processing framework to enable community-driven dataset\nexpansion. This work establishes a foundational framework for multimodal\nanti-fraud research while addressing critical challenges in data privacy and\nscenario diversity. The project will be released at\nhttps://github.com/JimmyMa99/TeleAntiFraud.",

DANTE-AD sequentially fuses both frame and\nscene level embeddings to improve long-term contextual understanding. We\npropose a novel, state-of-the-art method for sequential cross-attention to\nachieve contextual grounding for fine-grained audio description generation.\nEvaluated on a broad range of key scenes from well-known movie clips, DANTE-AD\noutperforms existing methods across traditional NLP metrics and LLM-based\nevaluations."

To enable reliable yet efficient LLM\ninference, in this paper, we propose a novel algorithm/circuit co-design\nframework, dubbed ReaLM. For the first time, we systematically characterize the\nfault tolerance of LLMs by performing a large-scale error injection study of\nrepresentative LLMs and natural language understanding tasks. Then, we propose\na statistical ABFT algorithm that fully leverages the error robustness to\nminimize error recovery as much as possible. We also customize the error\ndetection circuits to enable a low-cost online collection of error statistics.\nExtensive experiments show that with only 1.42% circuit area and 1.79% power\noverhead, our ReaLM can reduce perplexity degradation from 18.54 to 0.29.\nCompared to existing methods, ReaLM consistently reduces recovery costs across\ndifferent operating voltages and improves energy efficiency by up to 35.83%\nwithout compromising LLM performance.

To address these limitations, we propose\nTestART, a novel unit test generation method. TestART improves LLM-based unit\ntesting via co-evolution of automated generation and repair iteration,\nrepresenting a significant advancement in automated unit test generation.\nTestART leverages the template-based repair strategy to effectively fix bugs in\nLLM-generated test cases for the first time.

To identify potential leakage, we use multiple metrics, including a\nstudy of benchmark membership within commonly used training datasets, as well\nas analyses of negative log-likelihood and n-gram accuracy. Our findings show\nthat certain models, in particular codegen-multi, exhibit significant evidence\nof memorization in widely used benchmarks like Defects4J, while newer models\ntrained on larger datasets like LLaMa 3.1 exhibit limited signs of leakage.\nThese results highlight the need for careful benchmark selection and the\nadoption of robust metrics to adequately assess models capabilities."

Concentrating on the temporal correlation of XL-MIMO channels, we\ndesign a three-layer Markov prior model and hierarchical two-dimensional (2D)\nMarkov model to exploit the dynamic sparsity of sparse channel vectors and VRs,\nrespectively. Then, we formulate the channel tracking problem as a bilinear\nmeasurement process, and a novel dynamic alternating maximum a posteriori\n(DA-MAP) framework is developed to solve the problem. The DA-MAP contains four\nbasic modules: channel estimation module, VR detection module, grid update\nmodule, and temporal correlated module. Specifically, the first module is an\ninverse-free variational Bayesian inference (IF-VBI) estimator that avoids\ncomputational intensive matrix inverse each iteration; the second module is a\nturbo compressive sensing (Turbo-CS) algorithm that only needs small-scale\nmatrix operations in a parallel fashion; the third module refines the\npolar-delay domain grid; and the fourth module can process the temporal prior\ninformation to ensure high-efficiency channel tracking.

To address this issue, we propose the InPK model, which infuses\nclass-specific prior knowledge into the learnable tokens during initialization,\nthus enabling the model to explicitly focus on class-relevant information.\nFurthermore, to mitigate the weakening of class information by multi-layer\nencoders, we continuously reinforce the interaction between learnable tokens\nand prior knowledge across multiple feature levels. This progressive\ninteraction allows the learnable tokens to better capture the fine-grained\ndifferences and universal visual concepts within prior knowledge, enabling the\nmodel to extract more discriminative and generalized text features. Even for\nunseen classes, the learned interaction allows the model to capture their\ncommon representations and infer their appropriate positions within the\nexisting semantic structure. Moreover, we introduce a learnable text-to-vision\nprojection layer to accommodate the text adjustments, ensuring better alignment\nof visual-text semantics.

To address\nthis critical bottleneck, we propose AirCache, a novel KV cache compression\nmethod aimed at accelerating LVLMs inference. This work systematically\ninvestigates the correlations between visual and textual tokens within the\nattention mechanisms of LVLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals considerable\nredundancy in cached visual tokens, wherein strategically eliminating these\ntokens preserves model performance while significantly accelerating context\ngeneration. Inspired by these findings, we introduce an elite observation\nwindow for assessing the importance of visual components in the KV cache,\nfocusing on stable inter-modal relevancy modeling with enhanced\nmulti-perspective consistency. Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise\nbudget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of\ntoken importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to\nuniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the\nfull cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing\ndecoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of\ninputs.

These\nlarge-scale VDMs have demonstrated significant improvements over smaller-scale\nVDMs across multiple dimensions, including enhanced visual quality and more\nnatural motion dynamics. However, these models face two major limitations: (1)\nHigh inference overhead: Large-scale VDMs require approximately 10 minutes to\nsynthesize a 28-step video on a single H100 GPU. (2) Limited in portrait video\nsynthesis: Models like WanX-I2V and HunyuanVideo-I2V often produce unnatural\nfacial expressions and movements in portrait videos. To address these\nchallenges, we propose MagicDistillation, a novel framework designed to reduce\ninference overhead while ensuring the generalization of VDMs for portrait video\nsynthesis. Specifically, we primarily use sufficiently high-quality talking\nvideo to fine-tune Magic141, which is dedicated to portrait video synthesis. We\nthen employ LoRA to effectively and efficiently fine-tune the fake DiT within\nthe step distillation framework known as distribution matching distillation\n(DMD). Following this, we apply weak-to-strong (W2S) distribution matching and\nminimize the discrepancy between the fake data distribution and the ground\ntruth distribution, thereby improving the visual fidelity and motion dynamics\nof the synthesized videos. Experimental results on portrait video synthesis\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of MagicDistillation, as our method surpasses\nEuler, LCM, and DMD baselines in both FID/FVD metrics and VBench. Moreover,\nMagicDistillation, requiring only 4 steps, also outperforms WanX-I2V (14B) and\nHunyuanVideo-I2V (13B) on visualization and VBench.

                "summary": "With the developments of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) from 4G to 5G,\nvehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications are becoming attractive for\nvehicle users (VUEs) to obtain diverse cloud service through base stations\n(BSs). To tackle V2I link deterioration caused by blockage and out-of-coverage\ncases, multi-hop V2X routing with both vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and V2I links\nneeds to be investigated. However, traditional routing reacts to statistical or\nreal-time information, which may suffer link degradation during path switchover\nin fast-changing vehicular networks. Predictive routing protocols take timely\nactions by forecasting link connectivity, but they fail to satisfy specific QoS\nrequirements. Low robustness to link failures is also incurred without\nconsidering imperfect prediction. To build continual paths between VUEs and BSs\nfor QoS provision of cloud service, a robust predictive routing framework\n(ROPE) is proposed with three major components: 1) an early warning scheme\ndetects V2I link deterioration in advance via predicting vehicle mobility and\nlink signal strength to facilitate seamless path switchover; 2) a virtual\nrouting mechanism finds top3 paths that have the highest path strength and\nsatisfy the connectivity and hop count constraints based on the prediction\nresults to fulfill QoS requirements of cloud service; 3) a path verification\nprotocol checks availability and quality of the top3 paths shortly before\nswitchover and activates one qualified path for switchover to ensure routing\nrobustness. We implement ROPE in a simulation framework incorporating\nreal-world urban maps, microscopic traffic generation, geometry-based channel\nmodeling, and offline data analysis as well as online inference. Extensive\nsimulations demonstrate the superiority of ROPE over direct V2I communications\nand a connectivity-based predictive routing protocol under various scenarios.",

                    "value": "With the developments of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) from 4G to 5G,\nvehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications are becoming attractive for\nvehicle users (VUEs) to obtain diverse cloud service through base stations\n(BSs). To tackle V2I link deterioration caused by blockage and out-of-coverage\ncases, multi-hop V2X routing with both vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and V2I links\nneeds to be investigated. However, traditional routing reacts to statistical or\nreal-time information, which may suffer link degradation during path switchover\nin fast-changing vehicular networks. Predictive routing protocols take timely\nactions by forecasting link connectivity, but they fail to satisfy specific QoS\nrequirements. Low robustness to link failures is also incurred without\nconsidering imperfect prediction. To build continual paths between VUEs and BSs\nfor QoS provision of cloud service, a robust predictive routing framework\n(ROPE) is proposed with three major components: 1) an early warning scheme\ndetects V2I link deterioration in advance via predicting vehicle mobility and\nlink signal strength to facilitate seamless path switchover; 2) a virtual\nrouting mechanism finds top3 paths that have the highest path strength and\nsatisfy the connectivity and hop count constraints based on the prediction\nresults to fulfill QoS requirements of cloud service; 3) a path verification\nprotocol checks availability and quality of the top3 paths shortly before\nswitchover and activates one qualified path for switchover to ensure routing\nrobustness. We implement ROPE in a simulation framework incorporating\nreal-world urban maps, microscopic traffic generation, geometry-based channel\nmodeling, and offline data analysis as well as online inference. Extensive\nsimulations demonstrate the superiority of ROPE over direct V2I communications\nand a connectivity-based predictive routing protocol under various scenarios."

SAEs\nare based on the linear representation hypothesis (LRH), which assumes that the\nrepresentations of large language models (LLMs) are linearly encoded, and the\nsuperposition hypothesis (SH), which states that there can be more features in\nthe model than its dimensionality. We show that, based on the formal\ndefinitions of the LRH and SH, the magnitude of sparse feature vectors (the\nlatent representations learned by SAEs of the dense embeddings of LLMs) can be\napproximated using their corresponding dense vector with a closed-form error\nbound. To visualize this, we propose the ZF plot, which reveals a previously\nunknown relationship between LLM hidden embeddings and SAE feature vectors,\nallowing us to make the first empirical measurement of the extent to which\nfeature vectors of pre-trained SAEs are over- or under-activated for a given\ninput. Correspondingly, we introduce Approximate Feature Activation (AFA),\nwhich approximates the magnitude of the ground-truth sparse feature vector, and\npropose a new evaluation metric derived from AFA to assess the alignment\nbetween inputs and activations. We also leverage AFA to introduce a novel SAE\narchitecture, the top-AFA SAE, leading to SAEs that: (a) are more in line with\ntheoretical justifications; and (b) obviate the need to tune SAE sparsity\nhyperparameters. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that top-AFA SAEs achieve\nreconstruction loss comparable to that of state-of-the-art top-k SAEs, without\nrequiring the hyperparameter $k$ to be tuned.

We show that, based on the formal\ndefinitions of the LRH and SH, the magnitude of sparse feature vectors (the\nlatent representations learned by SAEs of the dense embeddings of LLMs) can be\napproximated using their corresponding dense vector with a closed-form error\nbound. To visualize this, we propose the ZF plot, which reveals a previously\nunknown relationship between LLM hidden embeddings and SAE feature vectors,\nallowing us to make the first empirical measurement of the extent to which\nfeature vectors of pre-trained SAEs are over- or under-activated for a given\ninput. Correspondingly, we introduce Approximate Feature Activation (AFA),\nwhich approximates the magnitude of the ground-truth sparse feature vector, and\npropose a new evaluation metric derived from AFA to assess the alignment\nbetween inputs and activations. We also leverage AFA to introduce a novel SAE\narchitecture, the top-AFA SAE, leading to SAEs that: (a) are more in line with\ntheoretical justifications; and (b) obviate the need to tune SAE sparsity\nhyperparameters. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that top-AFA SAEs achieve\nreconstruction loss comparable to that of state-of-the-art top-k SAEs, without\nrequiring the hyperparameter $k$ to be tuned.

The framework leverages a KG to\ncapture structured, domain-specific information about network protocols,\nstandards, and other telecom-related entities, comprehensively representing\ntheir relationships. By integrating KG with RAG, LLMs can dynamically access\nand utilize the most relevant and up-to-date knowledge during response\ngeneration. This hybrid approach bridges the gap between structured knowledge\nrepresentation and the generative capabilities of LLMs, significantly enhancing\naccuracy, adaptability, and domain-specific comprehension. Our results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the KG-RAG framework in addressing complex\ntechnical queries with precision.

We showcase an\ninitial application of our framework for automated agentic A/B testing and\ncompare the findings to human results. Finally, we discuss applications,\nlimitations and challenges setting the stage for impactful future work."

We\nintroduce a novel methodology that extracts key facts from real articles,\nmodifies them, and regenerates content to simulate fake news while maintaining\ncoherence. To assess the quality of the generated content, we propose a set of\nevaluation metrics coherence, dissimilarity, and correctness. The research also\ninvestigates the application of synthetic data in fake news classification,\ncomparing traditional machine learning models with transformer based models\nsuch as BERT. Our experiments demonstrate that transformer models, especially\nBERT, effectively leverage synthetic data for fake news detection, showing\nimprovements with smaller proportions of synthetic data. Additionally, we find\nthat fact verification features, which focus on identifying factual\ninconsistencies, provide the most promising results in distinguishing synthetic\nfake news. The study highlights the potential of synthetic data to enhance fake\nnews detection systems, offering valuable insights for future research and\nsuggesting that targeted improvements in synthetic data generation can further\nstrengthen detection models.",

To address this gap, we present\nTeleAntiFraud-28k, the first open-source audio-text slow-thinking dataset\nspecifically designed for automated telecom fraud analysis. Our dataset is\nconstructed through three strategies: (1) Privacy-preserved text-truth sample\ngeneration using automatically speech recognition (ASR)-transcribed call\nrecordings (with anonymized original audio), ensuring real-world consistency\nthrough text-to-speech (TTS) model regeneration; (2) Semantic enhancement via\nlarge language model (LLM)-based self-instruction sampling on authentic ASR\noutputs to expand scenario coverage; (3) Multi-agent adversarial synthesis that\nsimulates emerging fraud tactics through predefined communication scenarios and\nfraud typologies. The generated dataset contains 28,511 rigorously processed\nspeech-text pairs, complete with detailed annotations for fraud reasoning. The\ndataset is divided into three tasks: scenario classification, fraud detection,\nfraud type classification. Furthermore, we construct TeleAntiFraud-Bench, a\nstandardized evaluation benchmark comprising proportionally sampled instances\nfrom the dataset, to facilitate systematic testing of model performance on\ntelecom fraud detection tasks. We also contribute a production-optimized\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) model trained on hybrid real/synthetic data, while\nopen-sourcing the data processing framework to enable community-driven dataset\nexpansion. This work establishes a foundational framework for multimodal\nanti-fraud research while addressing critical challenges in data privacy and\nscenario diversity.

Large language models (LLMs) are now evolving into\nLLM-based scientific agents that automate critical tasks, ranging from\nhypothesis generation and experiment design to data analysis and simulation.\nUnlike general-purpose LLMs, these specialized agents integrate domain-specific\nknowledge, advanced tool sets, and robust validation mechanisms, enabling them\nto handle complex data types, ensure reproducibility, and drive scientific\nbreakthroughs. This survey provides a focused review of the architectures,\ndesign, benchmarks, applications, and ethical considerations surrounding\nLLM-based scientific agents. We highlight why they differ from general agents\nand the ways in which they advance research across various scientific fields.\nBy examining their development and challenges, this survey offers a\ncomprehensive roadmap for researchers and practitioners to harness these agents\nfor more efficient, reliable, and ethically sound scientific discovery."

Compared to traditional OCT, OCTA provides\nricher microvascular information, but its acquisition requires specialized\nsensors and high-cost equipment, creating significant challenges for the\nclinical deployment of hardware-dependent OCTA imaging methods. Given the\ntechnical complexity of OCTA image acquisition and potential mechanical\nartifacts, this study proposes a bidirectional image conversion framework\ncalled PupiNet, which accurately achieves bidirectional transformation between\n3D OCT and 3D OCTA. The generator module of this framework innovatively\nintegrates wavelet transformation and multi-scale attention mechanisms,\nsignificantly enhancing image conversion quality. Meanwhile, an Adaptive\nDiscriminator Augmentation (ADA) module has been incorporated into the\ndiscriminator to optimize model training stability and convergence efficiency.\nTo ensure clinical accuracy of vascular structures in the converted images, we\ndesigned a Vessel Structure Matcher (VSM) supervision module, achieving precise\nmatching of vascular morphology between generated images and target images.\nAdditionally, the Hierarchical Feature Calibration (HFC) module further\nguarantees high consistency of texture details between generated images and\ntarget images across different depth levels. To rigorously validate the\nclinical effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted a comprehensive\nevaluation on a paired OCT-OCTA image dataset containing 300 eyes with various\nretinal pathologies. Experimental results demonstrate that PupiNet not only\nreliably achieves high-quality bidirectional transformation between the two\nmodalities but also shows significant advantages in image fidelity, vessel\nstructure preservation, and clinical usability.",

Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by\nembedding document into LLMs parameters to perform test-time knowledge\nenhancement, effectively reducing inference costs through offline training.\nHowever, its high training and storage costs, along with limited generalization\nability, significantly restrict its practical adoption.

Our methodology involves leveraging multiple LLMs to generate\ndiverse candidate code solutions for various tasks across different programming\nlanguages. We then evaluate these solutions by directly measuring their\nexecution time and memory usage through local execution. The code solution with\nthe lowest execution time and memory consumption is selected as the final\noutput for each task. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements\nwhen fine-tuning with \\dataset. For instance, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct's\npass@1 score increases from 44.8\\% to 57.7\\%, while the average execution time\nfor correct tasks decreases by 48.4\\%. \\dataset offers a scalable and effective\nsolution for advancing AI-driven code generation, benefiting both software\ndevelopment and computational problem-solving.

                    "value": "As large language models (LLMs) play an increasingly important role in code\ngeneration, enhancing both correctness and efficiency has become crucial.\nCurrent methods primarily focus on correctness, often overlooking efficiency.\nTo address this gap, we introduce \\dataset to improve both aspects by\nfine-tuning LLMs on a high-quality dataset comprising correct and efficient\ncode samples. Our methodology involves leveraging multiple LLMs to generate\ndiverse candidate code solutions for various tasks across different programming\nlanguages. We then evaluate these solutions by directly measuring their\nexecution time and memory usage through local execution. The code solution with\nthe lowest execution time and memory consumption is selected as the final\noutput for each task. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements\nwhen fine-tuning with \\dataset. For instance, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct's\npass@1 score increases from 44.8\\% to 57.7\\%, while the average execution time\nfor correct tasks decreases by 48.4\\%. \\dataset offers a scalable and effective\nsolution for advancing AI-driven code generation, benefiting both software\ndevelopment and computational problem-solving. The source code of Effi-Code was\nreleased in https://github.com/huangd1999/Effi-Code."
