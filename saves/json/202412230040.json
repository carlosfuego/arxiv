DynamicKV\nestablishes global and per-layer maximum KV cache budgets, temporarily\nretaining the maximum budget for the current layer, and periodically updating\nthe KV cache sizes of all preceding layers during inference. Our method retains\nonly 1.7% of the KV cache size while achieving ~85% of the Full KV cache\nperformance on LongBench.

In this paper,\nwe carefully characterize C3 in ML on GPUs, which are most widely deployed for\nML training and inference. We observe that while C3 leads to performance\nuplifts, the uplifts are far lower than ideal speedups (serial computation and\ncommunication versus maximum of computation or communication; all times from\nisolated executions). C3 on average achieves only 21% of ideal speedup, this is\ndue to known challenges of compute and memory interference between concurrent\nGPU kernels (that is, sharing of GPU's compute units, caches and HBM).\n  To attain better performance for C3, first, we evaluate dual strategies of\nschedule prioritization and careful resource partitioning of compute units on\nGPUs to push performance attained with C3 (on average 42% of ideal speedup). We\nalso provide heuristics that can guide a runtime while employing these\nstrategies. To further enhance C3 performance, we propose to mitigate C3\ninterference by offloading communication tasks to the GPU's DMA engines. To\nthis end, we build Concurrent Communication CoLlectives (ConCCL)\nproof-of-concepts that harness DMA engines for communication. We show how\nConCCL considerably closes the gap between realized and ideal speedup for C3\n(on average 72% of ideal speedup is realized, up to 1.67x speedup). Overall,\nour work makes a strong case for GPU DMA engine advancements to better support\nC3 on GPUs.",

We observe that while C3 leads to performance\nuplifts, the uplifts are far lower than ideal speedups (serial computation and\ncommunication versus maximum of computation or communication; all times from\nisolated executions). C3 on average achieves only 21% of ideal speedup, this is\ndue to known challenges of compute and memory interference between concurrent\nGPU kernels (that is, sharing of GPU's compute units, caches and HBM).\n  To attain better performance for C3, first, we evaluate dual strategies of\nschedule prioritization and careful resource partitioning of compute units on\nGPUs to push performance attained with C3 (on average 42% of ideal speedup). We\nalso provide heuristics that can guide a runtime while employing these\nstrategies. To further enhance C3 performance, we propose to mitigate C3\ninterference by offloading communication tasks to the GPU's DMA engines. To\nthis end, we build Concurrent Communication CoLlectives (ConCCL)\nproof-of-concepts that harness DMA engines for communication. We show how\nConCCL considerably closes the gap between realized and ideal speedup for C3\n(on average 72% of ideal speedup is realized, up to 1.67x speedup). Overall,\nour work makes a strong case for GPU DMA engine advancements to better support\nC3 on GPUs."

However, most studies focus on addressing only one of these\nbottlenecks and do not adequately support dynamic adjustment of sparsity\nconcerning distinct layers or tasks. In this paper, we present ZipVL, an\nefficient inference framework designed for LVLMs through a dynamic ratio\nallocation strategy of important tokens. This ratio is adaptively determined\nbased on the layer-specific distribution of attention scores, rather than fixed\nhyper-parameters, thereby improving efficiency for less complex tasks while\nmaintaining high performance for more challenging ones. Then we select\nimportant tokens based on their normalized attention scores and perform sparse\nattention mechanism solely on those important tokens, reducing the latency in\nthe prefill phase. Tokens deemed less important will be discarded to reduce KV\ncache size, alleviating the memory bottleneck in the decoding phase. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that ZipVL can accelerate the prefill phase by\n2.3$\\times$ and improve decoding throughput by 2.8$\\times$, with a minimal\naccuracy reduction of only 0.5\\% on VQAv2 benchmark over LLaVA-Next-13B model,\neffectively enhancing the generation efficiency of LVLMs.",

To address these issues, we develop Vivar, a\nnovel AR system that integrates multi-modal sensor data and presents 3D\nvolumetric content for visualization. In particular, we introduce a cross-modal\nembedding approach that maps sensor data into a pre-trained visual embedding\nspace through barycentric interpolation.

In addition,\nVivar leverages latent reuse and caching strategies to accelerate 2D and AR\ncontent generation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our system\nachieves 11$\\times$ latency reduction without compromising quality.

Meanwhile, throughout the entire generation\nprocess of MLLMs, Dynamic-LLaVA reduces the $\\sim$50\\% computation consumption\nunder decoding without KV cache, while saving $\\sim$50\\% GPU memory overhead\nwhen decoding with KV cache, due to the vision-language context sparsification.\nExtensive experiments also demonstrate that Dynamic-LLaVA achieves efficient\ninference for MLLMs with negligible understanding and generation ability\ndegradation or even performance gains compared to the full-context inference\nbaselines.

To expedite the\nroute-finding process, we present a novel caching strategy that allows the\nproposed algorithm to demonstrate a much-reduced service delay time compared to\nthe recently developed adaptive link weight-based load-balancing RMCSA\nalgorithm."

Owing to these tremendous\npotentials, many big tech companies have released several lightweight Small\nLanguage Models (SLMs) to bridge this gap. However, we still have huge\nmotivations to deploy more powerful (LLMs) AI models on edge devices and\nenhance their smartness level. Unlike the conventional approaches for AI model\ncompression, we investigate activation sparsity. The activation sparsity method\nis orthogonal and combinable with existing techniques to maximize compression\nrate while maintaining great accuracy.

Owing to these tremendous\npotentials, many big tech companies have released several lightweight Small\nLanguage Models (SLMs) to bridge this gap. However, we still have huge\nmotivations to deploy more powerful (LLMs) AI models on edge devices and\nenhance their smartness level. Unlike the conventional approaches for AI model\ncompression, we investigate activation sparsity.

The\neffectiveness of a key-value cache relies on its ability of accommodating the\nneeded data. However, expanding the cache capacity is often more difficult than\ncommonly expected because of many practical constraints, such as server costs,\ncooling issues, rack space, and even human resource expenses. A potential\nsolution is compression, which virtually extends the cache capacity by\ncondensing data in cache. In practice, this seemingly simple idea has not\ngained much traction in key-value cache system design, due to several critical\nissues: the compression-unfriendly index structure, severe read/write\namplification, wasteful decompression operations, and heavy computing cost.\nThis paper presents a hybrid DRAM-SSD cache design to realize a systematic\nintegration of data compression in key-value cache. By treating compression as\nan essential component, we have redesigned the indexing structure, data\nmanagement, and leveraged the emerging computational SSD hardware for\ncollaborative optimizations.

Consequently, the tailored prompts often fail to discern\nclass-specific visual concepts, thereby hindering the transferred performance\nfor classes that share similar or complex visual attributes. Recent advances\nmitigate this challenge by leveraging external knowledge from Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to furnish class descriptions, yet incurring notable inference\ncosts. In this paper, we introduce TextRefiner, a plug-and-play method to\nrefine the text prompts of existing methods by leveraging the internal\nknowledge of VLMs. Particularly, TextRefiner builds a novel local cache module\nto encapsulate fine-grained visual concepts derivedfrom local tokens within the\nimage branch. By aggregating and aligning the cached visual descriptions with\nthe original output of the text branch, TextRefiner can efficiently refine and\nenrich the learned prompts from existing methods without relying on any\nexternal expertise. For example, it improves the performance of CoOp from 71.66\n% to 76.94 % on 11 benchmarks, surpassing CoCoOp which introduces instance-wise\nfeatures for text prompts.

In this paper, we explore an interpolation between\nthe autoregressive modeling and full-parameters diffusion to model visual\ninformation. At its core, we present ACDiT, an Autoregressive blockwise\nConditional Diffusion Transformer, where the block size of diffusion, i.e., the\nsize of autoregressive units, can be flexibly adjusted to interpolate between\ntoken-wise autoregression and full-sequence diffusion. ACDiT is easy to\nimplement, as simple as creating a Skip-Causal Attention Mask (SCAM) during\ntraining.

We verify the\neffectiveness of ACDiT on image and video generation tasks. We also demonstrate\nthat benefitted from autoregressive modeling, ACDiT can be seamlessly used in\nvisual understanding tasks despite being trained on the diffusion objective.\nThe analysis of the trade-off between autoregressive modeling and diffusion\ndemonstrates the potential of ACDiT to be used in long-horizon visual\ngeneration tasks.

Notably, the MLLMs are constrained\nby their limited context lengths and the substantial costs while processing\nlong videos. Although several existing methods attempt to reduce visual tokens,\ntheir strategies encounter severe bottleneck, restricting MLLMs' ability to\nperceive fine-grained visual details. In this work, we propose Video-XL, a\nnovel approach that leverages MLLMs' inherent key-value (KV) sparsification\ncapacity to condense the visual input. Specifically, we introduce a new special\ntoken, the Visual Summarization Token (VST), for each interval of the video,\nwhich summarizes the visual information within the interval as its associated\nKV. The VST module is trained by instruction fine-tuning, where two optimizing\nstrategies are offered. 1.Curriculum learning, where VST learns to make small\n(easy) and large compression (hard) progressively. 2. Composite data curation,\nwhich integrates single-image, multi-image, and synthetic data to overcome the\nscarcity of long-video instruction data. The compression quality is further\nimproved by dynamic compression, which customizes compression granularity based\non the information density of different video intervals. Video-XL's\neffectiveness is verified from three aspects. First, it achieves a superior\nlong-video understanding capability, outperforming state-of-the-art models of\ncomparable sizes across multiple popular benchmarks. Second, it effectively\npreserves video information, with minimal compression loss even at 16x\ncompression ratio. Third, it realizes outstanding cost-effectiveness, enabling\nhigh-quality processing of thousands of frames on a single A100 GPU.",

We use self-supervised and label-supervised\ncontrastive learning to train a joint embedding space between music and video.\nWe show the effectiveness of our approach by using music genre labels for the\nsupervised training component, and our framework can be generalized to other\nmusic annotations (e.g., emotion, instrument, etc.). Furthermore, our method\nenables fine-grained control over how much the retrieval process focuses on\nself-supervised vs. label information at inference time.

While\nsome efforts have optimized attention mechanisms by pruning heads or sharing\nparameters among heads, these methods often lead to performance degradation or\nnecessitate substantial continued pre-training costs to restore performance.\nBased on the analysis of attention redundancy, we design a Decoupled-Head\nAttention (DHA) mechanism. DHA adaptively configures group sharing for key\nheads and value heads across various layers, achieving a better balance between\nperformance and efficiency. Inspired by the observation of clustering similar\nheads, we propose to progressively transform the MHA checkpoint into the DHA\nmodel through linear fusion of similar head parameters step by step, retaining\nthe parametric knowledge of the MHA checkpoint. We construct DHA models by\ntransforming various scales of MHA checkpoints given target head budgets.

These engines reduce latency by using an incremental\nlayout algorithm to redraw the page when the user interacts with it. In such an\nalgorithm, elements that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty; only the dirty\nelements need be processed to draw the next frame, dramatically reducing\nlatency. However, the standard incremental layout algorithm must search the\npage for dirty elements, accessing a number of auxiliary elements in the\nprocess. These auxiliary elements add cache misses and stalled cycles, and are\nresponsible for a sizable fraction of all layout latency. We introduce a new,\nfaster incremental layout algorithm called Spineless Traversal. Spineless\nTraversal uses a more computationally demanding priority queue algorithm to\navoid the need to access auxiliary nodes and thus reduces cache traffic and\nstalls. This leads to dramatic speedups on the most latency-critical\ninteractions such as hovering, typing, or animations. Moreover, thanks to\nnumerous low-level optimizations, we are able to make Spineless Traversal\ncompetitive across the whole spectrum of incremental layout workloads.

The one-hop\nnavigation is from a vertex using either its in-coming or out-going edges with\nselection predicates that filter edges and vertices. Its cache entry identifies\na unique one-hop sub-query (key) and its result set consisting of immutable\nvertex ids (value). When processing a gR-Tx, the query processor identifies its\nsequence of individual one-hop sub-queries and looks up their results in the\ncache. A cache hit fetches less data from the storage manager and eliminates\nthe requirement to process the one-hop sub-query. A cache miss populates the\ncache asynchronously and in a transactional manner, maintaining the separation\nof read and write paths of our transactional storage manager. A graph read and\nwrite transaction, gRW-Tx, identifies the impacted cache entries and either\ndeletes or updates them. Our implementation of the cache is inside the graph\nquery processing engine and transparent to a user application. We evaluate the\ncache using our eCommerce production workload and with rules that re-write\ngraph queries to maximize the performance enhancements observed with the cache.\nObtained results show the cache enhances 95th and 99th percentile of query\nresponse times by at least 2x and 1.63x, respectively. When combined with query\nre-writing, the enhancements are at least 2.33x and 4.48x, respectively. An\ninteresting result is the significant performance enhancement observed by the\nindirect beneficiaries of the cache, gRW-Txs and gR-Txs that do not reference\none-hop sub-queries.

                    "value": "This paper introduces a novel one-hop sub-query result cache for processing\ngraph read transactions, gR-Txs, in a graph database system. The one-hop\nnavigation is from a vertex using either its in-coming or out-going edges with\nselection predicates that filter edges and vertices. Its cache entry identifies\na unique one-hop sub-query (key) and its result set consisting of immutable\nvertex ids (value). When processing a gR-Tx, the query processor identifies its\nsequence of individual one-hop sub-queries and looks up their results in the\ncache. A cache hit fetches less data from the storage manager and eliminates\nthe requirement to process the one-hop sub-query. A cache miss populates the\ncache asynchronously and in a transactional manner, maintaining the separation\nof read and write paths of our transactional storage manager. A graph read and\nwrite transaction, gRW-Tx, identifies the impacted cache entries and either\ndeletes or updates them. Our implementation of the cache is inside the graph\nquery processing engine and transparent to a user application. We evaluate the\ncache using our eCommerce production workload and with rules that re-write\ngraph queries to maximize the performance enhancements observed with the cache.\nObtained results show the cache enhances 95th and 99th percentile of query\nresponse times by at least 2x and 1.63x, respectively. When combined with query\nre-writing, the enhancements are at least 2.33x and 4.48x, respectively. An\ninteresting result is the significant performance enhancement observed by the\nindirect beneficiaries of the cache, gRW-Txs and gR-Txs that do not reference\none-hop sub-queries. The cache frees system resources to expedite their\nprocessing significantly."

The majority of computation stems from the\noverwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer decoder. In\nthis paper, we propose to build efficient MLLMs by leveraging the\nMixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each transformer decoder layer selects\nessential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant ones. However,\nintegrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the challenges of\ntraining and inference stability as well as limited training data, we adapt the\nMoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight normalization (TanhNorm)\nand symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we observe that vision\ntokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layer and thus design a progressive\nratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the token retention ratio\nlayer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This crucial design fully\nunleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the efficiency and\nperformance of our models. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we\nconduct extensive experiments with two baseline models across 14 benchmarks.\nOur model, p-MoD, matches or even surpasses the performance of the baseline\nmodels, with only 55.6% TFLOPs and 53.8% KV cache storage during inference, and\n77.7% GPU hours during training.",

To address this, two critical steps are often required: a\npretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length\nextension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural\nmodifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper\nargues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction\narchitecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but\nalso achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed\nLongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during\nlength extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention\npatterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink\n(initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are\nwell-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their\nGPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just\ntheoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to\nhave direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention\nlayers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency\nand long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data\nis sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.\n  We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its\neffectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts,\nLongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%,\ncompared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV\ncache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding\nspeedup.",

Implemented on\nvLLM, LeanKV compresses the KV cache by $3.0\\times$ to $5.0\\times$ without\naccuracy loss and up to $11.0\\times$ with under 5% accuracy loss, enhancing\nthroughput by $1.9\\times$ to $2.5\\times$, and up to $6.9\\times$."

In this paper, we are among the first to propose a\nCache-Friendly Redundant Video Requesting (cRVR) algorithm for User Devices\n(UDs) and its corresponding caching algorithm for the Edge Cache (EC), which\ncan effectively mitigate the problem of request privacy leakage with minimal\nimpact on the EC's performance. To tackle the problem, we first develop a\nStackelberg game to analyze the dedicated interaction between UDs and EC, and\nobtain their optimal strategies to maximize their respective utility.

The lack of encryption in the resolution process exposes\nit to DNS hijacking and cache poisoning attacks. Additionally, the high\noperational costs limit participation and innovation among small to\nmedium-sized users. To address these issues, this paper proposes a\nDecentralized Domain Name Service (DDNS) based on blockchain (Phicoin) and\ndistributed storage (IPFS). By leveraging the immutability of blockchain and\nthe content verification of IPFS, the system achieves decentralized storage and\ndistribution of domain name records, eliminating the centralized dependencies\nof traditional DNS. With a block time of 15 seconds, the system supports rapid\nbroadcasting of domain name updates, significantly improving resolution\nefficiency.

                    "value": "The current Domain Name System (DNS), as a core infrastructure of the\ninternet, exhibits several shortcomings: its centralized architecture leads to\ncensorship risks and single points of failure, making domain name resolution\nvulnerable to attacks. The lack of encryption in the resolution process exposes\nit to DNS hijacking and cache poisoning attacks. Additionally, the high\noperational costs limit participation and innovation among small to\nmedium-sized users. To address these issues, this paper proposes a\nDecentralized Domain Name Service (DDNS) based on blockchain (Phicoin) and\ndistributed storage (IPFS). By leveraging the immutability of blockchain and\nthe content verification of IPFS, the system achieves decentralized storage and\ndistribution of domain name records, eliminating the centralized dependencies\nof traditional DNS. With a block time of 15 seconds, the system supports rapid\nbroadcasting of domain name updates, significantly improving resolution\nefficiency. The DDNS aims to serve as a complement or backup to the existing\nDNS system, providing a pollution-resistant, censorship-resistant,\nhigh-performance, and low-cost domain name resolution solution, offering a new\ntechnical path for the security and stability of the internet."

Although deeper and larger neural networks\ncan significantly improve performance, their substantial memory requirements\nhinder training on consumer GPUs. In this paper, we explore a memory-efficient\ntraining strategy for deep speaker embedding learning in resource-constrained\nscenarios. Firstly, we conduct a systematic analysis of GPU memory allocation\nduring SV system training. Empirical observations show that activations and\noptimizer states are the main sources of memory consumption. For activations,\nwe design two types of reversible neural networks which eliminate the need to\nstore intermediate activations during back-propagation, thereby significantly\nreducing memory usage without performance loss. For optimizer states, we\nintroduce a dynamic quantization approach that replaces the original 32-bit\nfloating-point values with a dynamic tree-based 8-bit data type. Experimental\nresults on VoxCeleb demonstrate that the reversible variants of ResNets and\nDF-ResNets can perform training without the need to cache activations in GPU\nmemory. In addition, the 8-bit versions of SGD and Adam save 75% of memory\ncosts while maintaining performance compared to their 32-bit counterparts.\nFinally, a detailed comparison of memory usage and performance indicates that\nour proposed models achieve up to 16.2x memory savings, with nearly identical\nparameters and performance compared to the vanilla systems. In contrast to the\nprevious need for multiple high-end GPUs such as the A100, we can effectively\ntrain deep speaker embedding extractors with just one or two consumer-level\n2080Ti GPUs.",

                    "value": "Recent speaker verification (SV) systems have shown a trend toward adopting\ndeeper speaker embedding extractors. Although deeper and larger neural networks\ncan significantly improve performance, their substantial memory requirements\nhinder training on consumer GPUs. In this paper, we explore a memory-efficient\ntraining strategy for deep speaker embedding learning in resource-constrained\nscenarios. Firstly, we conduct a systematic analysis of GPU memory allocation\nduring SV system training. Empirical observations show that activations and\noptimizer states are the main sources of memory consumption. For activations,\nwe design two types of reversible neural networks which eliminate the need to\nstore intermediate activations during back-propagation, thereby significantly\nreducing memory usage without performance loss. For optimizer states, we\nintroduce a dynamic quantization approach that replaces the original 32-bit\nfloating-point values with a dynamic tree-based 8-bit data type. Experimental\nresults on VoxCeleb demonstrate that the reversible variants of ResNets and\nDF-ResNets can perform training without the need to cache activations in GPU\nmemory. In addition, the 8-bit versions of SGD and Adam save 75% of memory\ncosts while maintaining performance compared to their 32-bit counterparts.\nFinally, a detailed comparison of memory usage and performance indicates that\nour proposed models achieve up to 16.2x memory savings, with nearly identical\nparameters and performance compared to the vanilla systems. In contrast to the\nprevious need for multiple high-end GPUs such as the A100, we can effectively\ntrain deep speaker embedding extractors with just one or two consumer-level\n2080Ti GPUs."

This evidence grows to\n$27_{-8}^{+11}$ if the $2.6M_\\odot$ component of GW190814 is a neutron star.\nThe trough in $C_s$ separating the two peaks is inferred to be below\n$0.05^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ (at the $50\\%$ level) if $2.6M_\\odot$ neutron stars\nexist.

This evidence grows to\n$27_{-8}^{+11}$ if the $2.6M_\\odot$ component of GW190814 is a neutron star.\nThe trough in $C_s$ separating the two peaks is inferred to be below\n$0.05^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ (at the $50\\%$ level) if $2.6M_\\odot$ neutron stars\nexist. The second peak above $1/3$ beyond baryon chemical potential\n$\\mu_B=1.6-1.9$ GeV most likely signals non-perturbative effects in cold quark\nmatter, for instance color superconductivity."

During training, the data from each\nmodality is routed to its dedicated modules: modality-specific feedforward\nlayers, query-key-value projections, and normalization layers process each\nmodality independently, while the shared self-attention layers allow\ninteractions across text and image features. By freezing the text-specific\nmodules and only training the image-specific modules, LlamaFusion preserves the\nlanguage capabilities of text-only LLMs while developing strong visual\nunderstanding and generation abilities. Compared to methods that pretrain\nmultimodal generative models from scratch, our experiments demonstrate that,\nLlamaFusion improves image understanding by 20% and image generation by 3.6%\nusing only 50% of the FLOPs while maintaining Llama-3's language capabilities.\nWe also demonstrate that this framework can adapt existing vision-language\nmodels with multimodal generation ability.

We introduce CodeLutra, a\nframework that leverages both correct and incorrect code attempts. Instead of\nusing only correct solutions, CodeLutra applies iterative preference-based\nrefinement, comparing successful and failed outputs to better approximate\ndesired results. This approach narrows the performance gap with\nstate-of-the-art larger models without requiring massive datasets or auxiliary\nmodels. For instance, on a challenging data science coding task, using only 500\nsamples improved Llama-3-8B's accuracy from 28.2% to 48.6%, approaching GPT-4's\nlevel. By learning from both successes and mistakes, CodeLutra provides a\nscalable and efficient path to high-quality code generation, making smaller\nopen-source models more competitive with leading closed-source alternatives.",

We introduce CodeLutra, a\nframework that leverages both correct and incorrect code attempts. Instead of\nusing only correct solutions, CodeLutra applies iterative preference-based\nrefinement, comparing successful and failed outputs to better approximate\ndesired results. This approach narrows the performance gap with\nstate-of-the-art larger models without requiring massive datasets or auxiliary\nmodels. For instance, on a challenging data science coding task, using only 500\nsamples improved Llama-3-8B's accuracy from 28.2% to 48.6%, approaching GPT-4's\nlevel. By learning from both successes and mistakes, CodeLutra provides a\nscalable and efficient path to high-quality code generation, making smaller\nopen-source models more competitive with leading closed-source alternatives."

In this paper, we propose a simple yet\neffective approach for parallelized autoregressive visual generation that\nimproves generation efficiency while preserving the advantages of\nautoregressive modeling. Our key insight is that parallel generation depends on\nvisual token dependencies-tokens with weak dependencies can be generated in\nparallel, while strongly dependent adjacent tokens are difficult to generate\ntogether, as their independent sampling may lead to inconsistencies. Based on\nthis observation, we develop a parallel generation strategy that generates\ndistant tokens with weak dependencies in parallel while maintaining sequential\ngeneration for strongly dependent local tokens. Our approach can be seamlessly\nintegrated into standard autoregressive models without modifying the\narchitecture or tokenizer. Experiments on ImageNet and UCF-101 demonstrate that\nour method achieves a 3.6x speedup with comparable quality and up to 9.5x\nspeedup with minimal quality degradation across both image and video generation\ntasks.

Compared to previous\niterations, Qwen 2.5 has been significantly improved during both the\npre-training and post-training stages. In terms of pre-training, we have scaled\nthe high-quality pre-training datasets from the previous 7 trillion tokens to\n18 trillion tokens. This provides a strong foundation for common sense, expert\nknowledge, and reasoning capabilities. In terms of post-training, we implement\nintricate supervised finetuning with over 1 million samples, as well as\nmultistage reinforcement learning. Post-training techniques enhance human\npreference, and notably improve long text generation, structural data analysis,\nand instruction following. To handle diverse and varied use cases effectively,\nwe present Qwen2.5 LLM series in rich sizes. Open-weight offerings include base\nand instruction-tuned models, with quantized versions available. In addition,\nfor hosted solutions, the proprietary models currently include two\nmixture-of-experts (MoE) variants: Qwen2.5-Turbo and Qwen2.5-Plus, both\navailable from Alibaba Cloud Model Studio. Qwen2.5 has demonstrated top-tier\nperformance on a wide range of benchmarks evaluating language understanding,\nreasoning, mathematics, coding, human preference alignment, etc. Specifically,\nthe open-weight flagship Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct outperforms a number of open and\nproprietary models and demonstrates competitive performance to the\nstate-of-the-art open-weight model, Llama-3-405B-Instruct, which is around 5\ntimes larger. Qwen2.5-Turbo and Qwen2.5-Plus offer superior cost-effectiveness\nwhile performing competitively against GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o respectively.\nAdditionally, as the foundation, Qwen2.5 models have been instrumental in\ntraining specialized models such as Qwen2.5-Math, Qwen2.5-Coder, QwQ, and\nmultimodal models.",

The idea is to compute the Jacobian matrix of\nthe forward map with respect to the contact strengths and project the electrode\nmeasurements and the forward map onto the orthogonal complement of the range of\nthis Jacobian. Using the smoothened complete electrode model as the forward\nmodel, it is demonstrated that inverting the resulting projected equation with\nrespect to only the internal conductivity of the examined body results in good\nquality reconstructions both when resorting to a single step linearization with\na smoothness prior and when combining lagged diffusivity iteration with total\nvariation regularization. The quality of the reconstructions is further\nimproved if the range of the employed projection is also orthogonal to that of\nthe Jacobian with respect to the electrode positions. These results hold even\nif the projections are formed at internal and contact conductivities that\nsignificantly differ from the true ones; it is numerically demonstrated that\nthe orthogonal complement of the range of the contact Jacobian is almost\nindependent of the conductivity parameters at which it is evaluated.

While previous LLM-EPS studies obtained\ngreat performance on various tasks, there is still a gap in understanding the\nproperties of heuristic search spaces and achieving a balance between\nexploration and exploitation, which is a critical factor in large heuristic\nsearch spaces. In this study, we address this gap by proposing two diversity\nmeasurement metrics and perform an analysis on previous LLM-EPS approaches,\nincluding FunSearch, EoH, and ReEvo. Results on black-box AHD problems reveal\nthat while EoH demonstrates higher diversity than FunSearch and ReEvo, its\nobjective score is unstable.

Current\nhallucination detection and mitigation datasets are limited in domains and\nsizes, which struggle to scale due to prohibitive labor costs and insufficient\nreliability of existing hallucination annotators. To facilitate the scalable\noversight of LLM hallucinations, this paper introduces an iterative\nself-training framework that simultaneously and progressively scales up the\nhallucination annotation dataset and improves the accuracy of the hallucination\nannotator. Based on the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, in each\niteration, the framework first applies a hallucination annotation pipeline to\nannotate a scaled dataset and then trains a more accurate hallucination\nannotator on the dataset. This new hallucination annotator is adopted in the\nhallucination annotation pipeline used for the next iteration. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that the finally obtained hallucination\nannotator with only 7B parameters surpasses the performance of GPT-4 and\nobtains new state-of-the-art hallucination detection results on HaluEval and\nHalluQA by zero-shot inference. Such an annotator can not only evaluate the\nhallucination levels of various LLMs on the large-scale dataset but also help\nto mitigate the hallucination of LLMs generations, with the Natural Language\nInference (NLI) metric increasing from 25% to 37% on HaluEval.",

Our theoretical results lead to a new white-box\ninference attack, IHA (Inverse Hessian Attack), that explicitly uses model\nparameters by taking advantage of computing inverse-Hessian vector products.\nOur results show that both auditors and adversaries may be able to benefit from\naccess to model parameters, and we advocate for further research into white-box\nmethods for membership inference."

Specifically, we propose\nSelf-Guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (SG-MCTS), which capitalizes on the\nself-reflection capability of LLMs to reflect on the intermediate states of\nMCTS for guiding the tree expansion process. To provide reliable and\ncomprehensive feedback, we introduce Progress Reward Models to measure the\nprogress of tree search from the root to the current state from two aspects,\ni.e., generation and attribution progress. We conduct extensive experiments on\nthree datasets and the results show that our approach significantly outperforms\nbaseline approaches.",

Accurate segmentation and quantitative\nanalysis of these structures require pixel-level annotation, making automated\nsegmentation techniques essential for the diagnosis and treatment of head and\nneck cancer. In this study, we investigated the effects of multiple strategies\non the segmentation of pre-radiotherapy (pre-RT) and mid-radiotherapy (mid-RT)\nimages. For the segmentation of pre-RT images, we utilized: 1) a fully\nsupervised learning approach, and 2) the same approach enhanced with\npre-trained weights and the MixUp data augmentation technique. For mid-RT\nimages, we introduced a novel computational-friendly network architecture that\nfeatures separate encoders for mid-RT images and registered pre-RT images with\ntheir labels. The mid-RT encoder branch integrates information from pre-RT\nimages and labels progressively during the forward propagation. We selected the\nhighest-performing model from each fold and used their predictions to create an\nensemble average for inference. In the final test, our models achieved a\nsegmentation performance of 82.38% for pre-RT and 72.53% for mid-RT on\naggregated Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) as HiLab.

Next, we assess the models ability to evaluate the generated\ncode, by asking them to detect errors and vulnerabilities. Finally, we test the\nmodels ability to fix the generated code, providing the reports produced during\nthe static analysis and incorrectness evaluation phases as feedback.\n  Our results show that models often produce incorrect code, and that the\ngenerated code can include safety issues.

Based on this insight, we propose DynamicKV, a\nmethod that dynamically optimizes token retention by adjusting the number of\ntokens retained at each layer to adapt to the specific task. DynamicKV\nestablishes global and per-layer maximum KV cache budgets, temporarily\nretaining the maximum budget for the current layer, and periodically updating\nthe KV cache sizes of all preceding layers during inference. Our method retains\nonly 1.7% of the KV cache size while achieving ~85% of the Full KV cache\nperformance on LongBench. Notably, even under extreme compression (0.9%),\nDynamicKV surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 11% in the\nNeedle-in-a-Haystack test using Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2.

While consistency distillation (CD) accelerates\ninference, it introduces errors that compromise action quality. To address\nthese limitations, we propose the Score and Distribution Matching Policy (SDM\nPolicy), which transforms diffusion-based policies into single-step generators\nthrough a two-stage optimization process: score matching ensures alignment with\ntrue action distributions, and distribution matching minimizes KL divergence\nfor consistency. A dual-teacher mechanism integrates a frozen teacher for\nstability and an unfrozen teacher for adversarial training, enhancing\nrobustness and alignment with target distributions. Evaluated on a 57-task\nsimulation benchmark, SDM Policy achieves a 6x inference speedup while having\nstate-of-the-art action quality, providing an efficient and reliable framework\nfor high-frequency robotic tasks.",

While consistency distillation (CD) accelerates\ninference, it introduces errors that compromise action quality. To address\nthese limitations, we propose the Score and Distribution Matching Policy (SDM\nPolicy), which transforms diffusion-based policies into single-step generators\nthrough a two-stage optimization process: score matching ensures alignment with\ntrue action distributions, and distribution matching minimizes KL divergence\nfor consistency. A dual-teacher mechanism integrates a frozen teacher for\nstability and an unfrozen teacher for adversarial training, enhancing\nrobustness and alignment with target distributions. Evaluated on a 57-task\nsimulation benchmark, SDM Policy achieves a 6x inference speedup while having\nstate-of-the-art action quality, providing an efficient and reliable framework\nfor high-frequency robotic tasks."

Unlike RCTs, which\ndirectly allocate treatments, EDs randomly assign encouragement policies that\npositively motivate individuals to engage in a specific treatment. These random\nencouragements act as instrumental variables (IVs), facilitating the\nidentification of causal effects through leveraging exogenous perturbations in\ndiscrete treatment scenarios. However, real-world applications of encouragement\ndesigns often face challenges such as incomplete randomization, limited\nexperimental data, and significantly fewer encouragements compared to\ntreatments, hindering precise causal effect estimation. To address this, this\npaper introduces novel theories and algorithms for identifying the Conditional\nAverage Treatment Effect (CATE) using variations in encouragement. Further, by\nleveraging both observational and encouragement data, we propose a generalized\nIV estimator, named Encouragement-based Counterfactual Regression (EnCounteR),\nto effectively estimate the causal effects.

To estimate the uncertainty in a response, internal\ntoken logits, task-specific proxy models, or sampling of multiple responses are\ncommonly used. This work focuses on asking the LLM itself to verbalize its\nuncertainty with a confidence score as part of its output tokens, which is a\npromising way for prompt- and model-agnostic uncertainty quantification with\nlow overhead. Using an extensive benchmark, we assess the reliability of\nverbalized confidence scores with respect to different datasets, models, and\nprompt methods. Our results reveal that the reliability of these scores\nstrongly depends on how the model is asked, but also that it is possible to\nextract well-calibrated confidence scores with certain prompt methods.

Traditional models of child growth\nprimarily focus on physical metrics, often overlooking multidimensional aspects\nsuch as emotional, social, and cognitive development. In this paper, we\nintroduce a Bayesian artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that leverages\ndigital phenotyping to create a Multidimensional Index of Child Growth (MICG).\nThis index integrates data from various dimensions of child development,\nincluding physical, emotional, cognitive, and environmental factors. By\nincorporating probabilistic modeling, the proposed algorithm dynamically\nupdates its learning based on data collected by the mobile app used by mothers\nand children. The app also infers uncertainty from response times, adjusting\nthe importance of each dimension of child growth accordingly. Our contribution\napplies state-of-the-art technology to track multidimensional child\ndevelopment, enabling families and healthcare providers to make more informed\ndecisions in real time.",

From this perspective, we\ndesign an end-to-end tracking decoder to achieve a CC-based method dispensing\nwith post-processing entirely. Additionally, we observe that there is an\ninconsistency between classification confidence and localization quality, so we\npropose a Polygon Monte-Carlo method to quickly and accurately evaluate the\nlocalization quality. Based on this, we introduce a position-supervised\nclassification loss to guide the task-aligned learning of ERRNet. Experiments\non challenging benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our ERRNet. It\nconsistently achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while holding highly\ncompetitive inference speed."

LongBench v2 consists of 503\nchallenging multiple-choice questions, with contexts ranging from 8k to 2M\nwords, across six major task categories: single-document QA, multi-document QA,\nlong in-context learning, long-dialogue history understanding, code repository\nunderstanding, and long structured data understanding. To ensure the breadth\nand the practicality, we collect data from nearly 100 highly educated\nindividuals with diverse professional backgrounds. We employ both automated and\nmanual review processes to maintain high quality and difficulty, resulting in\nhuman experts achieving only 53.7% accuracy under a 15-minute time constraint.\nOur evaluation reveals that the best-performing model, when directly answers\nthe questions, achieves only 50.1% accuracy. In contrast, the o1-preview model,\nwhich includes longer reasoning, achieves 57.7%, surpassing the human baseline\nby 4%. These results highlight the importance of enhanced reasoning ability and\nscaling inference-time compute to tackle the long-context challenges in\nLongBench v2.

During training, the data from each\nmodality is routed to its dedicated modules: modality-specific feedforward\nlayers, query-key-value projections, and normalization layers process each\nmodality independently, while the shared self-attention layers allow\ninteractions across text and image features. By freezing the text-specific\nmodules and only training the image-specific modules, LlamaFusion preserves the\nlanguage capabilities of text-only LLMs while developing strong visual\nunderstanding and generation abilities. Compared to methods that pretrain\nmultimodal generative models from scratch, our experiments demonstrate that,\nLlamaFusion improves image understanding by 20% and image generation by 3.6%\nusing only 50% of the FLOPs while maintaining Llama-3's language capabilities.\nWe also demonstrate that this framework can adapt existing vision-language\nmodels with multimodal generation ability.

The\nresults seem to suggest that LLMs still work as (highly advanced) data pattern\nidentifiers, scoring poorly when attempting to generalise and solve reasoning\nproblems the models have never previously seen or that are not close to samples\npresented in their training data. To address this compelling concern, this\npaper makes use of the notion of critical questions from the literature on\nargumentation theory, focusing in particular on Toulmin's model of\nargumentation. We show that employing these critical questions can improve the\nreasoning capabilities of LLMs. By probing the rationale behind the models'\nreasoning process, the LLM can assess whether some logical mistake is occurring\nand correct it before providing the final reply to the user prompt. The\nunderlying idea is drawn from the gold standard of any valid argumentative\nprocedure: the conclusion is valid if it is entailed by accepted premises. Or,\nto paraphrase such Aristotelian principle in a real-world approximation,\ncharacterised by incomplete information and presumptive logic, the conclusion\nis valid if not proved otherwise. This approach successfully steers the models'\noutput through a reasoning pipeline, resulting in better performance against\nthe baseline and its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementation. To this end, an\nextensive evaluation of the proposed approach on the MT-Bench Reasoning and\nMath tasks across a range of LLMs is provided.",

The\nresults seem to suggest that LLMs still work as (highly advanced) data pattern\nidentifiers, scoring poorly when attempting to generalise and solve reasoning\nproblems the models have never previously seen or that are not close to samples\npresented in their training data. To address this compelling concern, this\npaper makes use of the notion of critical questions from the literature on\nargumentation theory, focusing in particular on Toulmin's model of\nargumentation. We show that employing these critical questions can improve the\nreasoning capabilities of LLMs. By probing the rationale behind the models'\nreasoning process, the LLM can assess whether some logical mistake is occurring\nand correct it before providing the final reply to the user prompt. The\nunderlying idea is drawn from the gold standard of any valid argumentative\nprocedure: the conclusion is valid if it is entailed by accepted premises. Or,\nto paraphrase such Aristotelian principle in a real-world approximation,\ncharacterised by incomplete information and presumptive logic, the conclusion\nis valid if not proved otherwise. This approach successfully steers the models'\noutput through a reasoning pipeline, resulting in better performance against\nthe baseline and its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementation. To this end, an\nextensive evaluation of the proposed approach on the MT-Bench Reasoning and\nMath tasks across a range of LLMs is provided."

This\ntraining paradigm with autonomous data construction not only reduces the\nreliance on human experts or external models but also ensures that the data\naligns with human values and preferences, paving the way for the development of\nfuture superintelligent systems that can exceed human capabilities."

Compared to previous\niterations, Qwen 2.5 has been significantly improved during both the\npre-training and post-training stages. In terms of pre-training, we have scaled\nthe high-quality pre-training datasets from the previous 7 trillion tokens to\n18 trillion tokens. This provides a strong foundation for common sense, expert\nknowledge, and reasoning capabilities. In terms of post-training, we implement\nintricate supervised finetuning with over 1 million samples, as well as\nmultistage reinforcement learning. Post-training techniques enhance human\npreference, and notably improve long text generation, structural data analysis,\nand instruction following. To handle diverse and varied use cases effectively,\nwe present Qwen2.5 LLM series in rich sizes. Open-weight offerings include base\nand instruction-tuned models, with quantized versions available. In addition,\nfor hosted solutions, the proprietary models currently include two\nmixture-of-experts (MoE) variants: Qwen2.5-Turbo and Qwen2.5-Plus, both\navailable from Alibaba Cloud Model Studio. Qwen2.5 has demonstrated top-tier\nperformance on a wide range of benchmarks evaluating language understanding,\nreasoning, mathematics, coding, human preference alignment, etc. Specifically,\nthe open-weight flagship Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct outperforms a number of open and\nproprietary models and demonstrates competitive performance to the\nstate-of-the-art open-weight model, Llama-3-405B-Instruct, which is around 5\ntimes larger. Qwen2.5-Turbo and Qwen2.5-Plus offer superior cost-effectiveness\nwhile performing competitively against GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o respectively.\nAdditionally, as the foundation, Qwen2.5 models have been instrumental in\ntraining specialized models such as Qwen2.5-Math, Qwen2.5-Coder, QwQ, and\nmultimodal models.",

While previous LLM-EPS studies obtained\ngreat performance on various tasks, there is still a gap in understanding the\nproperties of heuristic search spaces and achieving a balance between\nexploration and exploitation, which is a critical factor in large heuristic\nsearch spaces. In this study, we address this gap by proposing two diversity\nmeasurement metrics and perform an analysis on previous LLM-EPS approaches,\nincluding FunSearch, EoH, and ReEvo. Results on black-box AHD problems reveal\nthat while EoH demonstrates higher diversity than FunSearch and ReEvo, its\nobjective score is unstable. Conversely, ReEvo's reflection mechanism yields\ngood objective scores but fails to optimize diversity effectively. With this\nfinding in mind, we introduce HSEvo, an adaptive LLM-EPS framework that\nmaintains a balance between diversity and convergence with a harmony search\nalgorithm. Through experimentation, we find that HSEvo achieved high diversity\nindices and good objective scores while remaining cost-effective.

However, these\nabilities are primarily concentrated in high-resource languages, leaving\nlow-resource languages with weaker generative capabilities and relatively\nlimited knowledge. Enhancing the multilingual capabilities of LLMs is therefore\ncrucial for serving over 100 linguistic communities worldwide. An intuitive\napproach to enhance the multilingual capabilities would be to construct\ninstruction data for various languages, but constructing instruction data for\nover 100 languages is prohibitively costly. In this paper, we introduce BayLing\n2, which efficiently transfers generative capabilities and knowledge from\nhigh-resource languages to low-resource languages through language alignment.\nTo achieve this, we constructed a dataset of 3.2 million instructions,\ncomprising high-resource language instructions (Chinese and English) and\ncross-lingual instructions for 100+ languages and performed instruction tuning\nbased on the dataset to facilitate the capability transfer between languages.\nUsing Llama as the foundation model, we developed BayLing-2-7B, BayLing-2-13B,\nand BayLing-2-8B, and conducted a comprehensive evaluation of BayLing. For\nmultilingual translation across 100+ languages, BayLing shows superior\nperformance compared to open-source models of similar scale. For multilingual\nknowledge and understanding benchmarks, BayLing achieves significant\nimprovements across over 20 low-resource languages, demonstrating its\ncapability of effective knowledge transfer from high-resource to low-resource\nlanguages. Furthermore, results on English benchmarks indicate that BayLing\nmaintains high performance in highresource languages while enhancing the\nperformance in low-resource languages.

                "summary": "The advent of large language models (LLMs) has spurred considerable interest\nin advancing autonomous LLMs-based agents, particularly in intriguing\napplications within smartphone graphical user interfaces (GUIs). When presented\nwith a task goal, these agents typically emulate human actions within a GUI\nenvironment until the task is completed. However, a key challenge lies in\ndevising effective plans to guide action prediction in GUI tasks, though\nplanning have been widely recognized as effective for decomposing complex tasks\ninto a series of steps. Specifically, given the dynamic nature of environmental\nGUIs following action execution, it is crucial to dynamically adapt plans based\non environmental feedback and action history.We show that the widely-used ReAct\napproach fails due to the excessively long historical dialogues. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel approach called Dynamic Planning of Thoughts\n(D-PoT) for LLM-based GUI agents.D-PoT involves the dynamic adjustment of\nplanning based on the environmental feedback and execution history.\nExperimental results reveal that the proposed D-PoT significantly surpassed the\nstrong GPT-4V baseline by +12.7% (34.66% $\\rightarrow$ 47.36%) in accuracy. The\nanalysis highlights the generality of dynamic planning in different backbone\nLLMs, as well as the benefits in mitigating hallucinations and adapting to\nunseen tasks.

                    "value": "The advent of large language models (LLMs) has spurred considerable interest\nin advancing autonomous LLMs-based agents, particularly in intriguing\napplications within smartphone graphical user interfaces (GUIs). When presented\nwith a task goal, these agents typically emulate human actions within a GUI\nenvironment until the task is completed. However, a key challenge lies in\ndevising effective plans to guide action prediction in GUI tasks, though\nplanning have been widely recognized as effective for decomposing complex tasks\ninto a series of steps. Specifically, given the dynamic nature of environmental\nGUIs following action execution, it is crucial to dynamically adapt plans based\non environmental feedback and action history.We show that the widely-used ReAct\napproach fails due to the excessively long historical dialogues. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel approach called Dynamic Planning of Thoughts\n(D-PoT) for LLM-based GUI agents.D-PoT involves the dynamic adjustment of\nplanning based on the environmental feedback and execution history.\nExperimental results reveal that the proposed D-PoT significantly surpassed the\nstrong GPT-4V baseline by +12.7% (34.66% $\\rightarrow$ 47.36%) in accuracy. The\nanalysis highlights the generality of dynamic planning in different backbone\nLLMs, as well as the benefits in mitigating hallucinations and adapting to\nunseen tasks.

In few-shot\naspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), previous efforts have explored data\naugmentation techniques, which prompt LLMs to generate new samples by modifying\nexisting ones.

We propose a robust multi-layered\nlocalization framework that combines shadow edge localization techniques with\nthe strategic deployment of UAVs. This approach not only addresses the\nchallenges associated with nonrigid and poorly connected graphs but also\nenhances the convergence rate of the localization process. We introduce two key\nconcepts: the S1-Edge approach in our distributed protocol to address the\nrigidity problem of sparse graphs and the concept of a powerful UAV node to\nincrease the sensing and localization capability of the multi-robot system. Our\napproach leverages the advantages of the distributed localization methods,\nenhancing scalability and adaptability in large robot networks.

                    "value": "This paper presents a novel approach to range-based cooperative localization\nfor robot swarms in GPS-denied environments, addressing the limitations of\ncurrent methods in noisy and sparse settings. We propose a robust multi-layered\nlocalization framework that combines shadow edge localization techniques with\nthe strategic deployment of UAVs. This approach not only addresses the\nchallenges associated with nonrigid and poorly connected graphs but also\nenhances the convergence rate of the localization process. We introduce two key\nconcepts: the S1-Edge approach in our distributed protocol to address the\nrigidity problem of sparse graphs and the concept of a powerful UAV node to\nincrease the sensing and localization capability of the multi-robot system. Our\napproach leverages the advantages of the distributed localization methods,\nenhancing scalability and adaptability in large robot networks.

Practical compression techniques like quantization and pruning\nrequire dedicated hardware or kernel support to achieve measured inference\nspeedup.

However, conventional task-specific adaptation\napproaches do not show simultaneous memory saving and inference speedup at\ndeployment time. Practical compression techniques like quantization and pruning\nrequire dedicated hardware or kernel support to achieve measured inference\nspeedup. We develop TrimLLM based on the layer-wise specialization phenomenon\nwe empirically observed and verified on contemporary LLMs. TrimLLM reduces the\ndepth of LLMs via progressive layer dropping. We show it retains LLMs' capacity\nin specific domains and achieves inference speedup irrespective of hardware and\ndeep learning frameworks. We evaluated TrimLLM on LLMs of various sizes for\ninference; models adapted on medical, legal, and financial datasets all\ndemonstrate $2.1-5.7\\times$ inference speedup on consumer GPUs and up to\n$3.1\\times$ speedup on A100 when compared to state-of-the-art model compression\nalgorithms, with no loss in accuracy at 50$\\sim$60\\% model compression ratio."

When asked to diagnose the source of disagreement in a conversation, both\nLLMs, compared to humans, exhibit a tendency to overestimate the extent of\ncausal disagreement and underestimate the extent of moral disagreement in the\nmoral misalignment condition. This tendency is especially pronounced for GPT 4\nwhen using a proximate scale that relies on concrete language specific to an\nissue. GPT 3.5 does not perform as well as GPT4 or humans when using either the\nproximate or the distal scale. The study provides a first test of the potential\nfor using LLMs to mediate conflict by diagnosing the root of disagreements in\ncausal and evaluative codes."

Despite these advancements, challenges persist in the\nimplementation of RALMs, particularly concerning their reliability and\ntraceability. To be specific, the irrelevant document retrieval may result in\nunhelpful response generation or even deteriorate the performance of LLMs,\nwhile the lack of proper citations in generated outputs complicates efforts to\nverify the trustworthiness of the models. To this end, we propose a novel\nself-reasoning framework aimed at improving the reliability and traceability of\nRALMs, whose core idea is to leverage reasoning trajectories generated by the\nLLM itself. The framework involves constructing self-reason trajectories with\nthree processes: a relevance-aware process, an evidence-aware selective\nprocess, and a trajectory analysis process. We have evaluated our framework\nacross four public datasets (two short-form QA datasets, one long-form QA\ndataset, and one fact verification dataset) to demonstrate the superiority of\nour method, which can outperform existing state-of-the-art models and can\nachieve comparable performance with GPT-4, while only using 2,000 training\nsamples.",

                    "value": "The Retrieval-Augmented Language Model (RALM) has shown remarkable\nperformance on knowledge-intensive tasks by incorporating external knowledge\nduring inference, which mitigates the factual hallucinations inherited in large\nlanguage models (LLMs). Despite these advancements, challenges persist in the\nimplementation of RALMs, particularly concerning their reliability and\ntraceability. To be specific, the irrelevant document retrieval may result in\nunhelpful response generation or even deteriorate the performance of LLMs,\nwhile the lack of proper citations in generated outputs complicates efforts to\nverify the trustworthiness of the models. To this end, we propose a novel\nself-reasoning framework aimed at improving the reliability and traceability of\nRALMs, whose core idea is to leverage reasoning trajectories generated by the\nLLM itself. The framework involves constructing self-reason trajectories with\nthree processes: a relevance-aware process, an evidence-aware selective\nprocess, and a trajectory analysis process. We have evaluated our framework\nacross four public datasets (two short-form QA datasets, one long-form QA\ndataset, and one fact verification dataset) to demonstrate the superiority of\nour method, which can outperform existing state-of-the-art models and can\nachieve comparable performance with GPT-4, while only using 2,000 training\nsamples."

Fuzz testing, a highly effective\ntechnique, plays a key role in enhancing software reliability and detecting\nvulnerabilities.

To address this challenge, we propose an automated fuzz testing\nmethod driven by a code knowledge graph and powered by an LLM-based intelligent\nagent system, referred to as CKGFuzzer. We approach fuzz driver creation as a\ncode generation task, leveraging the knowledge graph of the code repository to\nautomate the generation process within the fuzzing loop, while continuously\nrefining both the fuzz driver and input seeds. The code knowledge graph is\nconstructed through interprocedural program analysis, where each node in the\ngraph represents a code entity, such as a function or a file. The knowledge\ngraph-enhanced CKGFuzzer not only effectively resolves compilation errors in\nfuzz drivers and generates input seeds tailored to specific API usage\nscenarios, but also analyzes fuzz driver crash reports, assisting developers in\nimproving code quality. By querying the knowledge graph of the code repository\nand learning from API usage scenarios, we can better identify testing targets\nand understand the specific purpose of each fuzz driver. We evaluated our\napproach using eight open-source software projects.

However, despite their promising performance in numerous\nreal-world applications, most of these algorithms lack fairness considerations.\nConsequently, they may lead to discriminatory outcomes against certain\ncommunities, particularly marginalized populations, prompting extensive study\nin fair LLMs. On the other hand, fairness in LLMs, in contrast to fairness in\ntraditional machine learning, entails exclusive backgrounds, taxonomies, and\nfulfillment techniques. To this end, this survey presents a comprehensive\noverview of recent advances in the existing literature concerning fair LLMs.\nSpecifically, a brief introduction to LLMs is provided, followed by an analysis\nof factors contributing to bias in LLMs. Additionally, the concept of fairness\nin LLMs is discussed categorically, summarizing metrics for evaluating bias in\nLLMs and existing algorithms for promoting fairness. Furthermore, resources for\nevaluating bias in LLMs, including toolkits and datasets, are summarized.\nFinally, existing research challenges and open questions are discussed.",

However, despite their promising performance in numerous\nreal-world applications, most of these algorithms lack fairness considerations.\nConsequently, they may lead to discriminatory outcomes against certain\ncommunities, particularly marginalized populations, prompting extensive study\nin fair LLMs. On the other hand, fairness in LLMs, in contrast to fairness in\ntraditional machine learning, entails exclusive backgrounds, taxonomies, and\nfulfillment techniques. To this end, this survey presents a comprehensive\noverview of recent advances in the existing literature concerning fair LLMs.\nSpecifically, a brief introduction to LLMs is provided, followed by an analysis\nof factors contributing to bias in LLMs. Additionally, the concept of fairness\nin LLMs is discussed categorically, summarizing metrics for evaluating bias in\nLLMs and existing algorithms for promoting fairness. Furthermore, resources for\nevaluating bias in LLMs, including toolkits and datasets, are summarized.\nFinally, existing research challenges and open questions are discussed."

When a\ngeneral-purpose LLM serves as the RAG generator, it often suffers from\ninadequate response informativeness, response robustness, and citation quality.\nPast approaches to tackle these limitations, either by incorporating additional\nsteps beyond generating responses or optimizing the generator through\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT), still failed to align with the RAG requirement\nthoroughly. Consequently, optimizing the RAG generator from multiple preference\nperspectives while maintaining its end-to-end LLM form remains a challenge. To\nbridge this gap, we propose Multiple Perspective Preference Alignment for\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (PA-RAG), a method for optimizing the generator\nof RAG systems to align with RAG requirements comprehensively. Specifically, we\nconstruct high-quality instruction fine-tuning data and multi-perspective\npreference data by sampling varied quality responses from the generator across\ndifferent prompt documents quality scenarios. Subsequently, we optimize the\ngenerator using SFT and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Extensive\nexperiments conducted on four question-answer datasets across three LLMs\ndemonstrate that PA-RAG can significantly enhance the performance of RAG\ngenerators.
