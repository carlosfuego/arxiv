For instance, generating an 8-second 720p\nvideo (110K tokens) with HunyuanVideo takes about 600 PFLOPs, with around 500\nPFLOPs consumed by attention computations. To address this issue, we propose\nAdaSpa, the first Dynamic Pattern and Online Precise Search sparse attention\nmethod. Firstly, to realize the Dynamic Pattern, we introduce a blockified\npattern to efficiently capture the hierarchical sparsity inherent in DiTs. This\nis based on our observation that sparse characteristics of DiTs exhibit\nhierarchical and blockified structures between and within different modalities.\nThis blockified approach significantly reduces the complexity of attention\ncomputation while maintaining high fidelity in the generated videos. Secondly,\nto enable Online Precise Search, we propose the Fused LSE-Cached Search with\nHead-adaptive Hierarchical Block Sparse Attention. This method is motivated by\nour finding that DiTs' sparse pattern and LSE vary w.r.t. inputs, layers, and\nheads, but remain invariant across denoising steps. By leveraging this\ninvariance across denoising steps, it adapts to the dynamic nature of DiTs and\nallows for precise, real-time identification of sparse indices with minimal\noverhead. AdaSpa is implemented as an adaptive, plug-and-play solution and can\nbe integrated seamlessly with existing DiTs, requiring neither additional\nfine-tuning nor a dataset-dependent profiling. Extensive experiments validate\nthat AdaSpa delivers substantial acceleration across various models while\npreserving video quality, establishing itself as a robust and scalable approach\nto efficient video generation.",

Secondly,\nto enable Online Precise Search, we propose the Fused LSE-Cached Search with\nHead-adaptive Hierarchical Block Sparse Attention. This method is motivated by\nour finding that DiTs' sparse pattern and LSE vary w.r.t. inputs, layers, and\nheads, but remain invariant across denoising steps. By leveraging this\ninvariance across denoising steps, it adapts to the dynamic nature of DiTs and\nallows for precise, real-time identification of sparse indices with minimal\noverhead. AdaSpa is implemented as an adaptive, plug-and-play solution and can\nbe integrated seamlessly with existing DiTs, requiring neither additional\nfine-tuning nor a dataset-dependent profiling. Extensive experiments validate\nthat AdaSpa delivers substantial acceleration across various models while\npreserving video quality, establishing itself as a robust and scalable approach\nto efficient video generation."

However, the computational overhead of long-context\ninference, particularly in managing key-value (KV) caches, presents significant\nefficiency challenges. While Speculative Decoding (SD) traditionally\naccelerates inference using smaller draft models, its effectiveness diminishes\nsubstantially in long-context scenarios due to memory-bound KV cache\noperations. We present Retrieval-Augmented Speculative Decoding (RAPID), which\nleverages RAG for both accelerating and enhancing generation quality in\nlong-context inference. RAPID introduces the RAG drafter-a draft LLM operating\non shortened retrieval contexts-to speculate on the generation of long-context\ntarget LLMs. Our approach enables a new paradigm where same-scale or even\nlarger LLMs can serve as RAG drafters while maintaining computational\nefficiency. To fully leverage the potentially superior capabilities from\nstronger RAG drafters, we develop an inference-time knowledge transfer dynamic\nthat enriches the target distribution by RAG. Extensive experiments on the\nLLaMA-3.1 and Qwen2.5 backbones demonstrate that RAPID effectively integrates\nthe strengths of both approaches, achieving significant performance\nimprovements (e.g., from 39.33 to 42.83 on InfiniteBench for LLaMA-3.1-8B) with\nmore than 2x speedups.

KV cache is widely adopted as it stores previously generated key and\nvalue tokens, effectively reducing redundant computations during inference.\nHowever, as memory overhead becomes a significant concern, efficient\ncompression of KV cache has gained increasing attention. Most existing methods\nperform compression from two perspectives: identifying important tokens and\ndesigning compression strategies.

To this end, we\npropose EMS to overcome these limitations, while achieving better KV cache\ncompression under extreme compression ratios. Specifically, we introduce a\nGlobal-Local score that combines accumulated attention scores from both global\nand local KV tokens to better identify the token importance.

Recent advancements that leverage target\nLLM's contextual information, such as hidden states and KV cache, have shown\nsignificant practical improvements. However, these approaches suffer from\ninconsistent context between training and decoding. We also observe another\ndiscrepancy between the training and decoding objectives in existing\nspeculative sampling methods. In this work, we propose a solution named\nHArmonized Speculative Sampling (HASS) that learns harmonized representations\nto address these issues. HASS accelerates the decoding stage without adding\ninference overhead through harmonized objective distillation and harmonized\ncontext alignment.

                    "value": "Speculative sampling is a promising approach to accelerate the decoding stage\nfor Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent advancements that leverage target\nLLM's contextual information, such as hidden states and KV cache, have shown\nsignificant practical improvements. However, these approaches suffer from\ninconsistent context between training and decoding. We also observe another\ndiscrepancy between the training and decoding objectives in existing\nspeculative sampling methods. In this work, we propose a solution named\nHArmonized Speculative Sampling (HASS) that learns harmonized representations\nto address these issues. HASS accelerates the decoding stage without adding\ninference overhead through harmonized objective distillation and harmonized\ncontext alignment.

                "summary": "User-facing applications running in modern datacenters exhibit irregular\nrequest patterns and are implemented using a multitude of services with tight\nlatency requirements. These characteristics render ineffective existing energy\nconserving techniques when processors are idle due to the long transition time\nfrom a deep idle power state (C-state). While prior works propose management\ntechniques to mitigate this inefficiency, we tackle it at its root with\nAgileWatts (AW): a new deep C-state architecture optimized for datacenter\nserver processors targeting latency-sensitive applications. AW is based on\nthree key ideas. First, AW eliminates the latency overhead of saving/restoring\nthe core context (i.e., micro-architectural state) when powering-off/-on the\ncore in a deep idle power state by i) implementing medium-grained power-gates,\ncarefully distributed across the CPU core, and ii) retaining context in the\npower-ungated domain. Second, AW eliminates the flush latency overhead (several\ntens of microseconds) of the L1/L2 caches when entering a deep idle power state\nby keeping L1/L2 cache content power-ungated. A minimal control logic also\nremains power-ungated to serve cache coherence traffic (i.e., snoops)\nseamlessly. AW implements sleep-mode in caches to reduce caches leakage power\nconsumption and lowers a core voltage to the minimum operational voltage level\nto minimize the leakage power of the power-ungated domain. Third, using a\nstate-of-the-art power efficient all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) clock\ngenerator, AW keeps the PLL active and locked during the idle state, further\ncutting precious microseconds of wake-up latency at a negligible power cost.\nOur evaluation with an accurate simulator calibrated against an Intel Skylake\nserver shows that AW reduces the energy consumption of Memcached by up to 71%\n(35% on average) with up to 1% performance degradation.",

These characteristics render ineffective existing energy\nconserving techniques when processors are idle due to the long transition time\nfrom a deep idle power state (C-state). While prior works propose management\ntechniques to mitigate this inefficiency, we tackle it at its root with\nAgileWatts (AW): a new deep C-state architecture optimized for datacenter\nserver processors targeting latency-sensitive applications. AW is based on\nthree key ideas. First, AW eliminates the latency overhead of saving/restoring\nthe core context (i.e., micro-architectural state) when powering-off/-on the\ncore in a deep idle power state by i) implementing medium-grained power-gates,\ncarefully distributed across the CPU core, and ii) retaining context in the\npower-ungated domain. Second, AW eliminates the flush latency overhead (several\ntens of microseconds) of the L1/L2 caches when entering a deep idle power state\nby keeping L1/L2 cache content power-ungated. A minimal control logic also\nremains power-ungated to serve cache coherence traffic (i.e., snoops)\nseamlessly. AW implements sleep-mode in caches to reduce caches leakage power\nconsumption and lowers a core voltage to the minimum operational voltage level\nto minimize the leakage power of the power-ungated domain. Third, using a\nstate-of-the-art power efficient all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) clock\ngenerator, AW keeps the PLL active and locked during the idle state, further\ncutting precious microseconds of wake-up latency at a negligible power cost.\nOur evaluation with an accurate simulator calibrated against an Intel Skylake\nserver shows that AW reduces the energy consumption of Memcached by up to 71%\n(35% on average) with up to 1% performance degradation."

In embedded systems running a\ngeneral-purpose OS, accelerators access data via dedicated, physically\naddressed memory regions.

However, RAG introduces challenges such as retrieval latency,\npotential errors in document selection, and increased system complexity. With\nthe advent of large language models (LLMs) featuring significantly extended\ncontext windows, this paper proposes an alternative paradigm, cache-augmented\ngeneration (CAG) that bypasses real-time retrieval. Our method involves\npreloading all relevant resources, especially when the documents or knowledge\nfor retrieval are of a limited and manageable size, into the LLM's extended\ncontext and caching its runtime parameters. During inference, the model\nutilizes these preloaded parameters to answer queries without additional\nretrieval steps.

                    "value": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained traction as a powerful\napproach for enhancing language models by integrating external knowledge\nsources. However, RAG introduces challenges such as retrieval latency,\npotential errors in document selection, and increased system complexity. With\nthe advent of large language models (LLMs) featuring significantly extended\ncontext windows, this paper proposes an alternative paradigm, cache-augmented\ngeneration (CAG) that bypasses real-time retrieval. Our method involves\npreloading all relevant resources, especially when the documents or knowledge\nfor retrieval are of a limited and manageable size, into the LLM's extended\ncontext and caching its runtime parameters. During inference, the model\nutilizes these preloaded parameters to answer queries without additional\nretrieval steps.

                "summary": "Text indexing is a fundamental and well-studied problem. Classic solutions\neither replace the original text with a compressed representation, e.g., the\nFM-index and its variants, or keep it uncompressed but attach some redundancy -\nan index - to accelerate matching. The former solutions thus retain excellent\ncompressed space, but areslow in practice. The latter approaches, like the\nsuffix array, instead sacrifice space for speed.\n  We show that efficient text indexing can be achieved using just a small extra\nspace on top of the original text, provided that the query patterns are\nsufficiently long. More specifically, we develop a new indexing paradigm in\nwhich a sketch of a query pattern is first matched against a sketch of the\ntext. Once candidate matches are retrieved, they are verified using the\noriginal text.

Classic solutions\neither replace the original text with a compressed representation, e.g., the\nFM-index and its variants, or keep it uncompressed but attach some redundancy -\nan index - to accelerate matching.

The latter approaches, like the\nsuffix array, instead sacrifice space for speed.\n  We show that efficient text indexing can be achieved using just a small extra\nspace on top of the original text, provided that the query patterns are\nsufficiently long. More specifically, we develop a new indexing paradigm in\nwhich a sketch of a query pattern is first matched against a sketch of the\ntext. Once candidate matches are retrieved, they are verified using the\noriginal text.

With the same total KV bit budget, this approach effectively mitigates\nerror propagation across transformer layers while achieving significant memory\nsavings. Our extensive experiments on multiple LLMs (1B--70B) demonstrate that\nour mixed-precision quantization scheme maintains high model accuracy even\nunder aggressive compression. For instance, using 4-bit for Key and 2-bit for\nValue achieves an accuracy of 75.2%, whereas reversing the assignment (2-bit\nfor Key and 4-bit for Value) yields only 54.7% accuracy.

With the same total KV bit budget, this approach effectively mitigates\nerror propagation across transformer layers while achieving significant memory\nsavings. Our extensive experiments on multiple LLMs (1B--70B) demonstrate that\nour mixed-precision quantization scheme maintains high model accuracy even\nunder aggressive compression. For instance, using 4-bit for Key and 2-bit for\nValue achieves an accuracy of 75.2%, whereas reversing the assignment (2-bit\nfor Key and 4-bit for Value) yields only 54.7% accuracy.

While rotary position embeddings (RoPEs) enhance length generalization,\neffective length extrapolation remains challenging and often requires costly\nfine-tuning. In contrast, recent training-free approaches suffer from the\nattention sink phenomenon, leading to severe performance degradation. In this\npaper, we introduce ParallelComp, a novel training-free method for long-context\nextrapolation that extends LLMs' context length from 4K to 128K while\nmaintaining high throughput and preserving perplexity, and integrates\nseamlessly with Flash Attention. Our analysis offers new insights into\nattention biases in parallel attention mechanisms and provides practical\nsolutions to tackle these challenges. To mitigate the attention sink issue, we\npropose an attention calibration strategy that reduces biases, ensuring more\nstable long-range attention. Additionally, we introduce a chunk eviction\nstrategy to efficiently manage ultra-long contexts on a single A100 80GB GPU.\nTo further enhance efficiency, we propose a parallel KV cache eviction\ntechnique, which improves chunk throughput by 1.76x, thereby achieving a 23.50x\nacceleration in the prefilling stage with negligible performance loss due to\nattention calibration. Furthermore, ParallelComp achieves 91.17% of GPT-4's\nperformance on long-context tasks using an 8B model trained on 8K-length\ncontext, outperforming powerful closed-source models such as Claude-2 and\nKimi-Chat.",

                "summary": "Near-Data Processing (NDP) has been a promising architectural paradigm to\naddress the memory wall problem for data-intensive applications. Practical\nimplementation of NDP architectures calls for system support for better\nprogrammability, where having virtual memory (VM) is critical. Modern computing\nsystems incorporate a 4-level page table design to support address translation\nin VM. However, simply adopting an existing 4-level page table in NDP systems\ncauses significant address translation overhead because (1) NDP applications\ngenerate a lot of address translations, and (2) the limited L1 cache in NDP\nsystems cannot cover the accesses to page table entries (PTEs). We extensively\nanalyze the 4-level page table design in the NDP scenario and observe that (1)\nthe memory access to page table entries is highly irregular, thus cannot\nbenefit from the L1 cache, and (2) the last two levels of page tables are\nnearly fully occupied. Based on our observations, we propose NDPage, an\nefficient page table design tailored for NDP systems. The key mechanisms of\nNDPage are (1) an L1 cache bypass mechanism for PTEs that not only accelerates\nthe memory accesses of PTEs but also prevents the pollution of PTEs in the\ncache system, and (2) a flattened page table design that merges the last two\nlevels of page tables, allowing the page table to enjoy the flexibility of a\n4KB page while reducing the number of PTE accesses. We evaluate NDPage using a\nvariety of data-intensive workloads. Our evaluation shows that in a single-core\nNDP system, NDPage improves the end-to-end performance over the\nstate-of-the-art address translation mechanism of 14.3\\%; in 4-core and 8-core\nNDP systems, NDPage enhances the performance of 9.8\\% and 30.5\\%, respectively.",

                    "value": "Near-Data Processing (NDP) has been a promising architectural paradigm to\naddress the memory wall problem for data-intensive applications. Practical\nimplementation of NDP architectures calls for system support for better\nprogrammability, where having virtual memory (VM) is critical. Modern computing\nsystems incorporate a 4-level page table design to support address translation\nin VM. However, simply adopting an existing 4-level page table in NDP systems\ncauses significant address translation overhead because (1) NDP applications\ngenerate a lot of address translations, and (2) the limited L1 cache in NDP\nsystems cannot cover the accesses to page table entries (PTEs). We extensively\nanalyze the 4-level page table design in the NDP scenario and observe that (1)\nthe memory access to page table entries is highly irregular, thus cannot\nbenefit from the L1 cache, and (2) the last two levels of page tables are\nnearly fully occupied. Based on our observations, we propose NDPage, an\nefficient page table design tailored for NDP systems. The key mechanisms of\nNDPage are (1) an L1 cache bypass mechanism for PTEs that not only accelerates\nthe memory accesses of PTEs but also prevents the pollution of PTEs in the\ncache system, and (2) a flattened page table design that merges the last two\nlevels of page tables, allowing the page table to enjoy the flexibility of a\n4KB page while reducing the number of PTE accesses. We evaluate NDPage using a\nvariety of data-intensive workloads. Our evaluation shows that in a single-core\nNDP system, NDPage improves the end-to-end performance over the\nstate-of-the-art address translation mechanism of 14.3\\%; in 4-core and 8-core\nNDP systems, NDPage enhances the performance of 9.8\\% and 30.5\\%, respectively."

In this paper, we present NPU\nVector Runahead (NVR), a prefetching mechanism tailored for NPUs to address\ncache miss problems in sparse DNN workloads. Rather than optimising memory\npatterns with high overhead and poor portability, NVR adapts runahead execution\nto the unique architecture of NPUs. NVR provides a general micro-architectural\nsolution for sparse DNN workloads without requiring compiler or algorithmic\nsupport, operating as a decoupled, speculative, lightweight hardware sub-thread\nalongside the NPU, with minimal hardware overhead (under 5%). NVR achieves an\naverage 90% reduction in cache misses compared to SOTA prefetching in\ngeneral-purpose processors, delivering 4x average speedup on sparse workloads\nversus NPUs without prefetching. Moreover, we investigate the advantages of\nincorporating a small cache (16KB) into the NPU combined with NVR.

One promising approach\nfor test-time compute scaling is search against a process reward model, where a\nmodel generates multiple potential candidates at each step of the search, and\nthese partial trajectories are then scored by a separate reward model in order\nto guide the search process. The diversity of trajectories in the tree search\nprocess affects the accuracy of the search, since increasing diversity promotes\nmore exploration.

Previous search methods either do not perform\nsufficient exploration, or else explore diverse trajectories but have high\nlatency. We address this challenge by proposing Efficient Tree Search (ETS),\nwhich promotes KV sharing by pruning redundant trajectories while maintaining\nnecessary diverse trajectories. ETS incorporates a linear programming cost\nmodel to promote KV cache sharing by penalizing the number of nodes retained,\nwhile incorporating a semantic coverage term into the cost model to ensure that\nwe retain trajectories which are semantically different. We demonstrate how ETS\ncan achieve 1.8$\\times$ reduction in average KV cache size during the search\nprocess, leading to 1.4$\\times$ increased throughput relative to prior\nstate-of-the-art methods, with minimal accuracy degradation and without\nrequiring any custom kernel implementation.

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are critical for a wide range of applications,\nbut serving them efficiently becomes increasingly challenging as inputs become\nmore complex. Context caching improves serving performance by exploiting\ninter-request dependency and reusing key-value (KV) cache across requests, thus\nimproving time-to-first-token (TTFT). However, existing prefix-based context\ncaching requires exact token prefix matches, limiting cache reuse in few-shot\nlearning, multi-document QA, or retrieval-augmented generation, where prefixes\nmay vary. In this paper, we present EPIC, an LLM serving system that introduces\nposition-independent context caching (PIC), enabling modular KV cache reuse\nregardless of token chunk position (or prefix). EPIC features two key designs:\nAttnLink, which leverages static attention sparsity to minimize recomputation\nfor accuracy recovery, and KVSplit, a customizable chunking method that\npreserves semantic coherence. Our experiments demonstrate that Epic delivers up\nto 8x improvements in TTFT and 7x throughput over existing systems, with\nnegligible or no accuracy loss. By addressing the limitations of traditional\ncaching approaches, Epic enables more scalable and efficient LLM inference.",

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are critical for a wide range of applications,\nbut serving them efficiently becomes increasingly challenging as inputs become\nmore complex. Context caching improves serving performance by exploiting\ninter-request dependency and reusing key-value (KV) cache across requests, thus\nimproving time-to-first-token (TTFT). However, existing prefix-based context\ncaching requires exact token prefix matches, limiting cache reuse in few-shot\nlearning, multi-document QA, or retrieval-augmented generation, where prefixes\nmay vary. In this paper, we present EPIC, an LLM serving system that introduces\nposition-independent context caching (PIC), enabling modular KV cache reuse\nregardless of token chunk position (or prefix). EPIC features two key designs:\nAttnLink, which leverages static attention sparsity to minimize recomputation\nfor accuracy recovery, and KVSplit, a customizable chunking method that\npreserves semantic coherence. Our experiments demonstrate that Epic delivers up\nto 8x improvements in TTFT and 7x throughput over existing systems, with\nnegligible or no accuracy loss. By addressing the limitations of traditional\ncaching approaches, Epic enables more scalable and efficient LLM inference."

In particular, by conducting graph sampling\nbeforehand, DiskGNN acquires the node features that will be accessed by model\ncomputation, and such information is utilized to pack the target node features\ncontiguously on disk to avoid read amplification. Besides, \\name{} also adopts\ndesigns including four-level feature store to fully utilize the memory\nhierarchy to cache node features and reduce disk access, batched packing to\naccelerate the feature packing process, and pipelined training to overlap disk\naccess with other operations. We compare DiskGNN with Ginex and MariusGNN,\nwhich are state-of-the-art systems for out-of-core GNN training. The results\nshow that DiskGNN can speed up the baselines by over 8x while matching their\nbest model accuracy."

                "summary": "Persuasive dialogue plays a pivotal role in human communication, influencing\nvarious domains. Recent persuasive dialogue datasets often fail to align with\nreal-world interpersonal interactions, leading to unfaithful representations.\nFor instance, unrealistic scenarios may arise, such as when the persuadee\nexplicitly instructs the persuader on which persuasion strategies to employ,\nwith each of the persuadee's questions corresponding to a specific strategy for\nthe persuader to follow. This issue can be attributed to a violation of the\n\"Double Blind\" condition, where critical information is fully shared between\nparticipants. In actual human interactions, however, key information such as\nthe mental state of the persuadee and the persuasion strategies of the\npersuader is not directly accessible. The persuader must infer the persuadee's\nmental state using Theory of Mind capabilities and construct arguments that\nalign with the persuadee's motivations. To address this gap, we introduce\nToMMA, a novel multi-agent framework for dialogue generation that is guided by\ncausal Theory of Mind. This framework ensures that information remains\nundisclosed between agents, preserving \"double-blind\" conditions, while causal\nToM directs the persuader's reasoning, enhancing alignment with human-like\npersuasion dynamics. Consequently, we present CToMPersu, a multi-domain,\nmulti-turn persuasive dialogue dataset that tackles both double-blind and\nlogical coherence issues, demonstrating superior performance across multiple\nmetrics and achieving better alignment with real human dialogues. Our dataset\nand prompts are available at https://github.com/DingyiZhang/ToMMA-CToMPersu .",

                    "value": "Persuasive dialogue plays a pivotal role in human communication, influencing\nvarious domains. Recent persuasive dialogue datasets often fail to align with\nreal-world interpersonal interactions, leading to unfaithful representations.\nFor instance, unrealistic scenarios may arise, such as when the persuadee\nexplicitly instructs the persuader on which persuasion strategies to employ,\nwith each of the persuadee's questions corresponding to a specific strategy for\nthe persuader to follow. This issue can be attributed to a violation of the\n\"Double Blind\" condition, where critical information is fully shared between\nparticipants. In actual human interactions, however, key information such as\nthe mental state of the persuadee and the persuasion strategies of the\npersuader is not directly accessible. The persuader must infer the persuadee's\nmental state using Theory of Mind capabilities and construct arguments that\nalign with the persuadee's motivations. To address this gap, we introduce\nToMMA, a novel multi-agent framework for dialogue generation that is guided by\ncausal Theory of Mind. This framework ensures that information remains\nundisclosed between agents, preserving \"double-blind\" conditions, while causal\nToM directs the persuader's reasoning, enhancing alignment with human-like\npersuasion dynamics. Consequently, we present CToMPersu, a multi-domain,\nmulti-turn persuasive dialogue dataset that tackles both double-blind and\nlogical coherence issues, demonstrating superior performance across multiple\nmetrics and achieving better alignment with real human dialogues. Our dataset\nand prompts are available at https://github.com/DingyiZhang/ToMMA-CToMPersu ."

However, when the visual input changes from a single\nimage to a long video, the above paradigm encounters difficulty because the\nvast amount of video tokens has significantly exceeded the maximal capacity of\nMLLMs. Therefore, existing video-based MLLMs are mostly established upon\nsampling a small portion of tokens from input data, which can cause key\ninformation to be lost and thus produce incorrect answers.

While most\nmethodologies extend features in the latent space, few leverage text-driven\ngeneration to create realistic and diverse samples.

Motivated by this, this paper proposes\nTxt2HSI-LDM(VAE), a novel language-informed hyperspectral image synthesis\nmethod to address the ISSD in HSIC. The proposed approach uses a denoising\ndiffusion model, which iteratively removes Gaussian noise to generate\nhyperspectral samples conditioned on textual descriptions. First, to address\nthe high-dimensionality of hyperspectral data, a universal variational\nautoencoder (VAE) is designed to map the data into a low-dimensional latent\nspace, which provides stable features and reduces the inference complexity of\ndiffusion model. Second, a semi-supervised diffusion model is designed to fully\ntake advantage of unlabeled data. Random polygon spatial clipping (RPSC) and\nuncertainty estimation of latent feature (LF-UE) are used to simulate the\nvarying degrees of mixing. Third, the VAE decodes HSI from latent space\ngenerated by the diffusion model with the language conditions as input.

Finally,\nwe propose Continuous Depth-wise Batching, a promising new inference paradigm\nenabled by the Recursive Transformer when paired with early exiting.

We show that our recursive\nmodels (e.g., recursive Gemma 1B) outperform both similar-sized vanilla\npretrained models (such as TinyLlama 1.1B and Pythia 1B) and knowledge\ndistillation baselines -- and can even recover most of the performance of the\noriginal \"full-size\" model (e.g., Gemma 2B with no shared parameters). Finally,\nwe propose Continuous Depth-wise Batching, a promising new inference paradigm\nenabled by the Recursive Transformer when paired with early exiting. In a\ntheoretical analysis, we show that this has the potential to lead to\nsignificant (2-3x) gains in inference throughput."

In this paper, we try\nto examine the implicit assumption about the performance comparison of EMO\nalgorithms in LLMs. For this purpose, we ask LLMs to design a benchmarking\nexperiment of EMO algorithms. Our experiments show that LLMs often suggest\nclassical benchmark settings: Performance examination of NSGA-II, MOEA/D and\nNSGA-III on ZDT, DTLZ and WFG by HV and IGD under the standard parameter\nspecifications."

Instead of following mainstream diffusion-based methods, we explore\nand extend the potential of the implicit-keypoint-based framework, which\neffectively balances computational efficiency and controllability. Building\nupon this, we develop a video-driven portrait animation framework named\nLivePortrait with a focus on better generalization, controllability, and\nefficiency for practical usage. To enhance the generation quality and\ngeneralization ability, we scale up the training data to about 69 million\nhigh-quality frames, adopt a mixed image-video training strategy, upgrade the\nnetwork architecture, and design better motion transformation and optimization\nobjectives. Additionally, we discover that compact implicit keypoints can\neffectively represent a kind of blendshapes and meticulously propose a\nstitching and two retargeting modules, which utilize a small MLP with\nnegligible computational overhead, to enhance the controllability. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the efficacy of our framework even compared to\ndiffusion-based methods. The generation speed remarkably reaches 12.8ms on an\nRTX 4090 GPU with PyTorch.

Second, a neural recognition model\nthat is trained offline, to map the generated time series onto the spaces of\ninitial conditions and time derivatives of the (hidden) ODE solutions, which we\nthen integrate to impute the missing data. We empirically demonstrate that one\nand the same (pretrained) recognition model can perform zero-shot imputation\nacross 63 distinct time series with missing values, each sampled from widely\ndifferent dynamical systems. Likewise, we demonstrate that it can perform\nzero-shot imputation of missing high-dimensional data in 10 vastly different\nsettings, spanning human motion, air quality, traffic and electricity studies,\nas well as Navier-Stokes simulations -- without requiring any fine-tuning. What\nis more, our proposal often outperforms state-of-the-art methods, which are\ntrained on the target datasets.\n  Our pretrained model, repository and tutorials are available online."

However, recent research has revealed their\nvulnerability to multimodal jailbreak attacks, whereby the model can be induced\nto generate harmful content, leading to safety risks. Although most LVLMs have\nundergone safety alignment, recent research shows that the visual modality is\nstill vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. In our work, we discover that by using\nflowcharts with partially harmful information, LVLMs can be induced to provide\nadditional harmful details. Based on this, we propose a jailbreak attack method\nbased on auto-generated flowcharts, FC-Attack. Specifically, FC-Attack first\nfine-tunes a pre-trained LLM to create a step-description generator based on\nbenign datasets. The generator is then used to produce step descriptions\ncorresponding to a harmful query, which are transformed into flowcharts in 3\ndifferent shapes (vertical, horizontal, and S-shaped) as visual prompts. These\nflowcharts are then combined with a benign textual prompt to execute a\njailbreak attack on LVLMs. Our evaluations using the Advbench dataset show that\nFC-Attack achieves over 90% attack success rates on Gemini-1.5, Llaval-Next,\nQwen2-VL, and InternVL-2.5 models, outperforming existing LVLM jailbreak\nmethods. Additionally, we investigate factors affecting the attack performance,\nincluding the number of steps and the font styles in the flowcharts. Our\nevaluation shows that FC-Attack can improve the jailbreak performance from 4%\nto 28% in Claude-3.5 by changing the font style. To mitigate the attack, we\nexplore several defenses and find that AdaShield can largely reduce the\njailbreak performance but with the cost of utility drop.",

We developed TILLMI as a\npsychometric scale, prototyped with a novel protocol we called LLM-simulated\nvalidity. The LLM-based scale was then validated in a sample of 1,000 US\nrespondents. Exploratory Factor Analysis identified a two-factor structure. Two\nitems were then removed due to redundancy, yielding a final 6-item scale with a\n2-factor structure.

Based on these findings, we interpreted TILLMI's\nfactors as \"closeness with LLMs\" (affective dimension) and \"reliance on LLMs\"\n(cognitive dimension).

To mitigate this gap, we\npropose PersuasiveToM, a benchmark designed to evaluate the ToM abilities of\nLLMs in persuasive dialogues. Our framework introduces two categories of\nquestions: (1) ToM Reasoning, assessing the capacity of LLMs to track evolving\nmental states (e.g., desire shifts in persuadees), and (2) ToM Application,\nevaluating whether LLMs can take advantage of inferred mental states to select\neffective persuasion strategies (e.g., emphasize rarity) and evaluate the\neffectiveness of persuasion strategies. Experiments across eight\nstate-of-the-art LLMs reveal that while models excel on multiple questions,\nthey struggle to answer questions that need tracking the dynamics and shifts of\nmental states and understanding the mental states in the whole dialogue\ncomprehensively. Our aim with PersuasiveToM is to allow an effective evaluation\nof the ToM reasoning ability of LLMs with more focus on complex psychological\nactivities.

Our framework introduces two categories of\nquestions: (1) ToM Reasoning, assessing the capacity of LLMs to track evolving\nmental states (e.g., desire shifts in persuadees), and (2) ToM Application,\nevaluating whether LLMs can take advantage of inferred mental states to select\neffective persuasion strategies (e.g., emphasize rarity) and evaluate the\neffectiveness of persuasion strategies. Experiments across eight\nstate-of-the-art LLMs reveal that while models excel on multiple questions,\nthey struggle to answer questions that need tracking the dynamics and shifts of\nmental states and understanding the mental states in the whole dialogue\ncomprehensively. Our aim with PersuasiveToM is to allow an effective evaluation\nof the ToM reasoning ability of LLMs with more focus on complex psychological\nactivities.

In this paper, we propose Dropping Backward\nPropagation (DropBP), a novel approach designed to reduce computational costs\nand activation memory while maintaining accuracy. DropBP randomly drops layers\nduring backward propagation, which is essentially equivalent to training\nshallow submodules generated by undropped layers and residual connections.\nAdditionally, DropBP calculates the sensitivity of each layer to assign an\nappropriate drop rate, thereby stabilizing the training process. DropBP is not\nonly applicable to full fine-tuning but can also be orthogonally integrated\nwith all types of PEFT by dropping layers during backward propagation.\nSpecifically, DropBP can reduce training time by 44% with comparable accuracy\nto the baseline, accelerate convergence to the same perplexity by 1.5x, and\nenable training with a sequence length 6.2x larger on a single NVIDIA-A100 GPU.\nFurthermore, our DropBP enabled a throughput increase of 79% on a NVIDIA A100\nGPU and 117% on an Intel Gaudi2 HPU.

Using a\ncombination of human evaluators and automatic metrics, this research project\ninvestigates the model's performance in translating Arabizi into both Modern\nStandard Arabic and English.

In particular, since the\nring intensity and radius at a given time depend on the amount of dust and on\nits distance, respectively XMM-Newton and Swift images allowed us to map the\nISM around the direction of the GRB with better resolution than in the existing\noptical and infrared-based 3D dust maps, both in the plane of the sky (few\narcminutes) and along the line of sight (from $\\simeq 1$ pc for dust clouds\nwithin 1 kpc to $\\simeq 100$ pc for structures at distances larger than 10\nkpc). As a consequence, we can revise prior estimates of the GRB soft X-ray\nfluence, obtaining a $\\sim$35\\% lower value, which, however, still indicates a\nsubstantial excess with respect to the extrapolation of the spectral models\nconstrained by hard X-ray observations.\n  Additionally, we detect significant spectral variability in two azimuthal\nsectors of the X-ray rings, which can be fully attributed to different Galactic\nabsorption in these two directions. The comparison of the total hydrogen column\ndensity inferred from spectral fitting, with the Galactic contribution derived\nfrom the intensity of the X-ray rings, in the same sectors, allowed us to more\nrobustly constrain the absorption in the host galaxy to $N_{\\rm{H,z=0.151}}=\n(3.7\\pm0.3)\\,\\times\\,10^{21}\\,\\rm{cm^{-2}}$.

A key contribution is OpenMedQA, a novel\nbenchmark for open-ended medical question answering that overcomes the\nlimitations of multiple-choice formats - formats that we show lead to\nperformance degradation in open-ended settings and often lack clinical realism.\nFurther contributions include: (1) practical guidelines for implementing\noptimized context retrieval; (2) empirical validation of enhanced\ncost-effectiveness via the improved Pareto frontier; (3) the introduction of\nOpenMedQA for rigorous evaluation of open-ended medical QA; and (4) the release\nof prompt_engine alongside CoT/ToT/Thinking databases as community resources\nfor cost-effective healthcare AI.

This study demonstrates that optimized context retrieval\nunlocks cost-effective, high-performance healthcare AI using open-source LLMs,\nachieving a significantly improved cost-accuracy Pareto frontier for medical\nquestion answering and showcasing that open models can rival proprietary\nsystems at a fraction of the cost. A key contribution is OpenMedQA, a novel\nbenchmark for open-ended medical question answering that overcomes the\nlimitations of multiple-choice formats - formats that we show lead to\nperformance degradation in open-ended settings and often lack clinical realism.\nFurther contributions include: (1) practical guidelines for implementing\noptimized context retrieval; (2) empirical validation of enhanced\ncost-effectiveness via the improved Pareto frontier; (3) the introduction of\nOpenMedQA for rigorous evaluation of open-ended medical QA; and (4) the release\nof prompt_engine alongside CoT/ToT/Thinking databases as community resources\nfor cost-effective healthcare AI. Advancing optimized retrieval and open-ended\nQA benchmarking, we pave the way for more accessible and impactful LLM-powered\nhealthcare solutions. All the materials have been made public."

To tackle this challenge, we study a specific model within this\nproblem domain--contextual dueling bandits with adversarial feedback, where the\ntrue preference label can be flipped by an adversary. We propose an algorithm\nnamely robust contextual dueling bandits (RCDB), which is based on\nuncertainty-weighted maximum likelihood estimation. Our algorithm achieves an\n$\\tilde O(d\\sqrt{T}/\\kappa+dC/\\kappa)$ regret bound, where $T$ is the number of\nrounds, $d$ is the dimension of the context, $\\kappa$ is the lower bound of the\nderivative of the link function, and $ 0 \\le C \\le T$ is the total number of\nadversarial feedback. We also prove a lower bound to show that our regret bound\nis nearly optimal, both in scenarios with and without ($C=0$) adversarial\nfeedback. Our work is the first to achieve nearly minimax optimal regret for\ndueling bandits in the presence of adversarial preference feedback.\nAdditionally, for the sigmoid link function, we develop a novel algorithm that\ntakes into account the effect of local derivatives into maximum likelihood\nestimation (MLE) analysis through a refined method for estimating the link\nfunction's derivative. This method helps us to eliminate the $\\kappa$\ndependence in the leading term with respect to $T$, which reduces the\nexponential dependence on the parameter radius $B$ to a polynomial dependence.",

Data Parallelism) and intra-data\npartitioning (a.k.a. Context Parallelism) are commonly used. Current training\nframeworks predominantly treat the two techniques as orthogonal, and establish\nstatic communication groups to organize the devices as a static mesh (e.g., a\n2D mesh). However, the sequences for LLM training typically vary in lengths, no\nmatter for texts, multi-modalities or reinforcement learning. The mismatch\nbetween data heterogeneity and static mesh causes redundant communication and\nimbalanced computation, degrading the training efficiency.\n  In this work, we introduce ByteScale, an efficient, flexible, and scalable\nLLM training framework for large-scale mixed training of long and short\nsequences. The core of ByteScale is a novel parallelism strategy, namely Hybrid\nData Parallelism (HDP), which unifies the inter- and intra-data partitioning\nwith a dynamic mesh design. In particular, we build a communication optimizer,\nwhich eliminates the redundant communication for short sequences by data-aware\nsharding and dynamic communication, and further compresses the communication\ncost for long sequences by selective offloading. Besides, we also develop a\nbalance scheduler to mitigate the imbalanced computation by parallelism-aware\ndata assignment. We evaluate ByteScale with the model sizes ranging from 7B to\n141B, context lengths from 256K to 2048K, on a production cluster with more\nthan 12,000 GPUs.

This allows for the use of\nhigh-level modulation formats and large-scale Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)\nprocessing, maximizing spectral efficiency in CO-OFDM systems. By eliminating\nthe need for complex traditional techniques, this approach offers a potentially\nmore efficient and streamlined solution for CO-OFDM systems. The most\nsignificant achievement of this study is the demonstration that the proposed\nAE-based model can enhance system performance by reducing the bit error rate\n(BER) to below the threshold of forward error correction (FEC), even under\nsevere phase noise conditions, thus proving its effectiveness and efficiency in\npractical deployment scenarios."

Since large language models (LLMs) have been trained on a large\namount of public information, including these documents, they can be employed\nto generate tests for GURI. Thus, we propose an LLM-based test generation and\ndifferential testing approach (LLMeDiff) to test GURI. We experimented with\nfour different LLMs, two medical rule engine implementations, and 58 real\nmedical rules to investigate the hallucination, success, time efficiency, and\nrobustness of the LLMs to generate tests, and these tests' ability to find\npotential issues in GURI. Our results showed that GPT-3.5 hallucinates the\nleast, is the most successful, and is generally the most robust; however, it\nhas the worst time efficiency.

A predominant\nsource of this instability stems from gradient and loss spikes, which disrupt\nthe learning process, often leading to costly interventions like checkpoint\nrecovery and experiment restarts, further amplifying inefficiencies. This paper\npresents a comprehensive investigation into gradient spikes observed during LLM\ntraining, revealing their prevalence across multiple architectures and\ndatasets. Our analysis shows that these spikes can be up to $1000\\times$ larger\nthan typical gradients, substantially deteriorating model performance. To\naddress this issue, we propose Spike-Aware Adam with Momentum Reset SPAM, a\nnovel optimizer designed to counteract gradient spikes through momentum reset\nand spike-aware gradient clipping. Extensive experiments, including both\npre-training and fine-tuning, demonstrate that SPAM consistently surpasses Adam\nand its variants across various tasks, including (1) LLM pre-training from 60M\nto 1B, (2) 4-bit LLM pre-training,(3) reinforcement learning, and (4) Time\nSeries Forecasting. Additionally, SPAM facilitates memory-efficient training by\nenabling sparse momentum, where only a subset of momentum terms are maintained\nand updated. When operating under memory constraints, SPAM outperforms\nstate-of-the-art memory-efficient optimizers such as GaLore and Adam-Mini.

Furthermore, the report outlines the\nmethodologies utilized during the post-training of the Kanana models,\nencompassing supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization, aimed at\nenhancing their capability for seamless interaction with users. Lastly, the\nreport elaborates on plausible approaches used for language model adaptation to\nspecific scenarios, such as embedding, retrieval augmented generation, and\nfunction calling. The Kanana model series spans from 2.1B to 32.5B parameters\nwith 2.1B models (base, instruct, embedding) publicly released to promote\nresearch on Korean language models."

While GUI prototyping has a positive impact on\nthe software development process, it simultaneously demands significant effort\nand resources. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with their\nimpressive code generation capabilities offers a promising approach for\nautomating GUI prototyping. Despite their potential, there is a gap between\ncurrent LLM-based prototyping solutions and traditional user-based GUI\nprototyping approaches which provide visual representations of the GUI\nprototypes and direct editing functionality. In contrast, LLMs and related\ngenerative approaches merely produce text sequences or non-editable image\noutput, which lacks both mentioned aspects and therefore impede supporting GUI\nprototyping. Moreover, minor changes requested by the user typically lead to an\ninefficient regeneration of the entire GUI prototype when using LLMs directly.\nIn this work, we propose GUIDE, a novel LLM-driven GUI generation decomposition\napproach seamlessly integrated into the popular prototyping framework Figma.\nOur approach initially decomposes high-level GUI descriptions into\nfine-granular GUI requirements, which are subsequently translated into Material\nDesign GUI prototypes, enabling higher controllability and more efficient\nadaption of changes. To efficiently conduct prompting-based generation of\nMaterial Design GUI prototypes, we propose a retrieval-augmented generation\napproach to integrate the component library. Our preliminary evaluation\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of GUIDE in bridging the gap between LLM\ngeneration capabilities and traditional GUI prototyping workflows, offering a\nmore effective and controlled user-based approach to LLM-driven GUI\nprototyping.

Moreover, minor changes requested by the user typically lead to an\ninefficient regeneration of the entire GUI prototype when using LLMs directly.\nIn this work, we propose GUIDE, a novel LLM-driven GUI generation decomposition\napproach seamlessly integrated into the popular prototyping framework Figma.\nOur approach initially decomposes high-level GUI descriptions into\nfine-granular GUI requirements, which are subsequently translated into Material\nDesign GUI prototypes, enabling higher controllability and more efficient\nadaption of changes. To efficiently conduct prompting-based generation of\nMaterial Design GUI prototypes, we propose a retrieval-augmented generation\napproach to integrate the component library. Our preliminary evaluation\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of GUIDE in bridging the gap between LLM\ngeneration capabilities and traditional GUI prototyping workflows, offering a\nmore effective and controlled user-based approach to LLM-driven GUI\nprototyping.

These\nflowcharts are then combined with a benign textual prompt to execute a\njailbreak attack on LVLMs. Our evaluations using the Advbench dataset show that\nFC-Attack achieves over 90% attack success rates on Gemini-1.5, Llaval-Next,\nQwen2-VL, and InternVL-2.5 models, outperforming existing LVLM jailbreak\nmethods. Additionally, we investigate factors affecting the attack performance,\nincluding the number of steps and the font styles in the flowcharts. Our\nevaluation shows that FC-Attack can improve the jailbreak performance from 4%\nto 28% in Claude-3.5 by changing the font style.

By\nimplementing adaptive scaling and frequency adjustments, this model shows to\ncapture complex temporal patterns in building energy dynamics. Experiments on\nthe ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III dataset reveal that S4ConvD outperforms\ncurrent benchmarks. Additionally, S4ConvD benefits from significant\nimprovements in GPU runtime through the use of Block Tiling optimization\ntechniques. Thus, S4ConvD has the potential for practical deployment in\nreal-time energy modeling. Furthermore, the complete codebase and dataset are\naccessible on GitHub, fostering open-source contributions and facilitating\nfurther research. Our method also promotes resource-efficient model execution,\nenhancing both energy forecasting and the potential integration of renewable\nenergy sources into smart grid systems."

Although conversations can elicit trust between users and LLMs,\nscarce empirical research has examined trust formation in human-LLM contexts,\nbeyond LLMs' trustworthiness or human trust in AI in general. Here, we\nintroduce the Trust-In-LLMs Index (TILLMI) as a new framework to measure\nindividuals' trust in LLMs, extending McAllister's cognitive and affective\ntrust dimensions to LLM-human interactions. We developed TILLMI as a\npsychometric scale, prototyped with a novel protocol we called LLM-simulated\nvalidity. The LLM-based scale was then validated in a sample of 1,000 US\nrespondents. Exploratory Factor Analysis identified a two-factor structure. Two\nitems were then removed due to redundancy, yielding a final 6-item scale with a\n2-factor structure. Confirmatory Factor Analysis on a separate subsample showed\nstrong model fit ($CFI = .995$, $TLI = .991$, $RMSEA = .046$, $p_{X^2} > .05$).\nConvergent validity analysis revealed that trust in LLMs correlated positively\nwith openness to experience, extraversion, and cognitive flexibility, but\nnegatively with neuroticism. Based on these findings, we interpreted TILLMI's\nfactors as \"closeness with LLMs\" (affective dimension) and \"reliance on LLMs\"\n(cognitive dimension).

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can engage in human-looking conversational\nexchanges. Although conversations can elicit trust between users and LLMs,\nscarce empirical research has examined trust formation in human-LLM contexts,\nbeyond LLMs' trustworthiness or human trust in AI in general. Here, we\nintroduce the Trust-In-LLMs Index (TILLMI) as a new framework to measure\nindividuals' trust in LLMs, extending McAllister's cognitive and affective\ntrust dimensions to LLM-human interactions. We developed TILLMI as a\npsychometric scale, prototyped with a novel protocol we called LLM-simulated\nvalidity. The LLM-based scale was then validated in a sample of 1,000 US\nrespondents. Exploratory Factor Analysis identified a two-factor structure. Two\nitems were then removed due to redundancy, yielding a final 6-item scale with a\n2-factor structure. Confirmatory Factor Analysis on a separate subsample showed\nstrong model fit ($CFI = .995$, $TLI = .991$, $RMSEA = .046$, $p_{X^2} > .05$).\nConvergent validity analysis revealed that trust in LLMs correlated positively\nwith openness to experience, extraversion, and cognitive flexibility, but\nnegatively with neuroticism. Based on these findings, we interpreted TILLMI's\nfactors as \"closeness with LLMs\" (affective dimension) and \"reliance on LLMs\"\n(cognitive dimension). Younger males exhibited higher closeness with- and\nreliance on LLMs compared to older women. Individuals with no direct experience\nwith LLMs exhibited lower levels of trust compared to LLMs' users. These\nfindings offer a novel empirical foundation for measuring trust in AI-driven\nverbal communication, informing responsible design, and fostering balanced\nhuman-AI collaboration."

                "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant success across various\ndomains. However, training these LLMs typically involves substantial memory and\ncomputational costs during both forward and backward propagation. While\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) considerably reduces the training memory\nassociated with parameters, it does not address the significant computational\ncosts and activation memory. In this paper, we propose Dropping Backward\nPropagation (DropBP), a novel approach designed to reduce computational costs\nand activation memory while maintaining accuracy. DropBP randomly drops layers\nduring backward propagation, which is essentially equivalent to training\nshallow submodules generated by undropped layers and residual connections.\nAdditionally, DropBP calculates the sensitivity of each layer to assign an\nappropriate drop rate, thereby stabilizing the training process. DropBP is not\nonly applicable to full fine-tuning but can also be orthogonally integrated\nwith all types of PEFT by dropping layers during backward propagation.\nSpecifically, DropBP can reduce training time by 44% with comparable accuracy\nto the baseline, accelerate convergence to the same perplexity by 1.5x, and\nenable training with a sequence length 6.2x larger on a single NVIDIA-A100 GPU.\nFurthermore, our DropBP enabled a throughput increase of 79% on a NVIDIA A100\nGPU and 117% on an Intel Gaudi2 HPU.

To mitigate these severe impacts, early fire\ndetection and warning systems are crucial. Current systems rely primarily on\nfixed CCTV cameras with a limited field of view, restricting their\neffectiveness in large outdoor environments. The fusion of intelligent fire\ndetection with remote sensing improves coverage and mobility, enabling\nmonitoring in remote and challenging areas. Existing approaches predominantly\nutilize convolutional neural networks and vision transformer models. While\nthese architectures provide high accuracy in fire detection, their\ncomputational complexity limits real-time performance on edge devices such as\nUAVs. In our work, we present a lightweight fire detection model based on\nMobileViT-S, compressed through the distillation of knowledge from a stronger\nteacher model. The ablation study highlights the impact of a teacher model and\nthe chosen distillation technique on the model's performance improvement. We\ngenerate activation map visualizations using Grad-CAM to confirm the model's\nability to focus on relevant fire regions. The high accuracy and efficiency of\nthe proposed model make it well-suited for deployment on satellites, UAVs, and\nIoT devices for effective fire detection. Experiments on common fire benchmarks\ndemonstrate that our model suppresses the state-of-the-art model by 0.44%,\n2.00% while maintaining a compact model size. Our model delivers the highest\nprocessing speed among existing works, achieving real-time performance on\nresource-constrained devices.",

                    "value": "Wildfire catastrophes cause significant environmental degradation, human\nlosses, and financial damage. To mitigate these severe impacts, early fire\ndetection and warning systems are crucial. Current systems rely primarily on\nfixed CCTV cameras with a limited field of view, restricting their\neffectiveness in large outdoor environments. The fusion of intelligent fire\ndetection with remote sensing improves coverage and mobility, enabling\nmonitoring in remote and challenging areas. Existing approaches predominantly\nutilize convolutional neural networks and vision transformer models. While\nthese architectures provide high accuracy in fire detection, their\ncomputational complexity limits real-time performance on edge devices such as\nUAVs. In our work, we present a lightweight fire detection model based on\nMobileViT-S, compressed through the distillation of knowledge from a stronger\nteacher model. The ablation study highlights the impact of a teacher model and\nthe chosen distillation technique on the model's performance improvement. We\ngenerate activation map visualizations using Grad-CAM to confirm the model's\nability to focus on relevant fire regions. The high accuracy and efficiency of\nthe proposed model make it well-suited for deployment on satellites, UAVs, and\nIoT devices for effective fire detection. Experiments on common fire benchmarks\ndemonstrate that our model suppresses the state-of-the-art model by 0.44%,\n2.00% while maintaining a compact model size. Our model delivers the highest\nprocessing speed among existing works, achieving real-time performance on\nresource-constrained devices."

The core\ninnovation of TeleRAG is lookahead retrieval, a prefetching mechanism that\nanticipates required data and transfers it from CPU to GPU in parallel with LLM\ngeneration.

This paper introduces Agentic\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) as a method for topic modeling\nwith LLMs. It integrates three key components: (1) retrieval, enabling\nautomatized access to external data beyond an LLM's pre-trained knowledge; (2)\ngeneration, leveraging LLM capabilities for text synthesis; and (3)\nagent-driven learning, iteratively refining retrieval and query formulation\nprocesses. To empirically validate Agentic RAG for topic modeling, we reanalyze\na Twitter/X dataset, previously examined by Mu et al. (2024a). Our findings\ndemonstrate that the approach is more efficient, interpretable and at the same\ntime achieves higher reliability and validity in comparison to the standard\nmachine learning approach but also in comparison to LLM prompting for topic\nmodeling.

In particular,\n\\textit{(i)} fine-tuning often leads to catastrophic forgetting, where\nimprovements on a target domain degrade generalization on other tasks, and\n\\textit{(ii)} merging fine-tuned checkpoints from disparate tasks can lead to\nsignificant performance loss. To address these challenges, we introduce LiNeS,\nLayer-increasing Network Scaling, a post-training editing technique designed to\npreserve pre-trained generalization while enhancing fine-tuned task\nperformance. LiNeS scales parameter updates linearly based on their layer depth\nwithin the network, maintaining shallow layers close to their pre-trained\nvalues to preserve general features while allowing deeper layers to retain\ntask-specific representations. In multi-task model merging scenarios,\nlayer-wise scaling of merged parameters reduces negative task interference.\nLiNeS demonstrates significant improvements in both single-task and multi-task\nsettings across various benchmarks in vision and natural language processing.\nIt mitigates forgetting, enhances out-of-distribution generalization,\nintegrates seamlessly with existing multi-task model merging baselines\nimproving their performance across benchmarks and model sizes, and can boost\ngeneralization when merging LLM policies aligned with different rewards via\nRLHF. Our method is simple to implement, computationally efficient and\ncomplementary to many existing techniques. Our source code is available at\nhttps://github.com/wang-kee/LiNeS",

                "summary": "The integration of vision-language models into robotic systems constitutes a\nsignificant advancement in enabling machines to interact with their\nsurroundings in a more intuitive manner. While VLMs offer rich multimodal\nreasoning, existing approaches lack user-specific adaptability, often relying\non generic interaction paradigms that fail to account for individual\nbehavioral, contextual, or socio-emotional nuances. When customization is\nattempted, ethical concerns arise from unmitigated biases in user data, risking\nexclusion or unfair treatment. To address these dual challenges, we propose\nUser-VLM 360{\\deg}, a holistic framework integrating multimodal user modeling\nwith bias-aware optimization. Our approach features: (1) user-aware tuning that\nadapts interactions in real time using visual-linguistic signals; (2) bias\nmitigation via preference optimization; and (3) curated 360{\\deg} socio-emotive\ninteraction datasets annotated with demographic, emotion, and relational\nmetadata. Evaluations across eight benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art\nresults: +35.3% F1 in personalized VQA, +47.5% F1 in facial features\nunderstanding, 15% bias reduction, and 30X speedup over baselines. Ablation\nstudies confirm component efficacy, and deployment on the Pepper robot\nvalidates real-time adaptability across diverse users. We open-source\nparameter-efficient 3B/10B models and an ethical verification framework for\nresponsible adaptation.",

                    "value": "The integration of vision-language models into robotic systems constitutes a\nsignificant advancement in enabling machines to interact with their\nsurroundings in a more intuitive manner. While VLMs offer rich multimodal\nreasoning, existing approaches lack user-specific adaptability, often relying\non generic interaction paradigms that fail to account for individual\nbehavioral, contextual, or socio-emotional nuances. When customization is\nattempted, ethical concerns arise from unmitigated biases in user data, risking\nexclusion or unfair treatment. To address these dual challenges, we propose\nUser-VLM 360{\\deg}, a holistic framework integrating multimodal user modeling\nwith bias-aware optimization. Our approach features: (1) user-aware tuning that\nadapts interactions in real time using visual-linguistic signals; (2) bias\nmitigation via preference optimization; and (3) curated 360{\\deg} socio-emotive\ninteraction datasets annotated with demographic, emotion, and relational\nmetadata. Evaluations across eight benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art\nresults: +35.3% F1 in personalized VQA, +47.5% F1 in facial features\nunderstanding, 15% bias reduction, and 30X speedup over baselines. Ablation\nstudies confirm component efficacy, and deployment on the Pepper robot\nvalidates real-time adaptability across diverse users. We open-source\nparameter-efficient 3B/10B models and an ethical verification framework for\nresponsible adaptation."

Our system is also compatible\nwith off-the-shelf deep 3D generators to enrich scene assets. Through\nevaluations and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate the\nversatility of WorldCraft, ranging from single-object customization to\nintricate, large-scale interior and exterior scene designs.

Existing detection\nmethods, such as token-level perplexity analysis, fail to effectively identify\ndead code due to the structural and contextual characteristics of programming\nlanguages. In this paper, we propose DePA (Dead Code Perplexity Analysis), a\nnovel line-level detection and cleansing method tailored to the structural\nproperties of code. DePA computes line-level perplexity by leveraging the\ncontextual relationships between code lines and identifies anomalous lines by\ncomparing their perplexity to the overall distribution within the file. Our\nexperiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DePA significantly\noutperforms existing methods, achieving 0.14-0.19 improvement in detection\nF1-score and a 44-65% increase in poisoned segment localization precision.\nFurthermore, DePA enhances detection speed by 0.62-23x, making it practical for\nlarge-scale dataset cleansing. Overall, by addressing the unique challenges of\ndead code poisoning, DePA provides a robust and efficient solution for\nsafeguarding the integrity of code generation model training datasets.",

(2) LLMs\npartially recall knowledge or show a cut-off at temporal boundaries rather than\nrecalling all aspects of knowledge correctly.

Existing\nbenchmarks often focus on a narrow range of tasks or those that do not demand\ncomplex reasoning. To address this gap and enable a more comprehensive\nevaluation of the long-context reasoning capabilities of current LLMs, we\npropose a new synthetic benchmark, LongReason, which is constructed by\nsynthesizing long-context reasoning questions from a varied set of\nshort-context reasoning questions through context expansion. LongReason\nconsists of 794 multiple-choice reasoning questions with diverse reasoning\npatterns across three task categories: reading comprehension, logical\ninference, and mathematical word problems. We evaluate 21 LLMs on LongReason,\nrevealing that most models experience significant performance drops as context\nlength increases. Our further analysis shows that even state-of-the-art LLMs\nstill have significant room for improvement in providing robust reasoning\nacross different tasks. We have open-sourced LongReason under\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets/lz1bytedance/LongReason to support the\ncomprehensive evaluation of LLMs' long-context reasoning capabilities.",
