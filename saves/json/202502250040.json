Classic solutions\neither replace the original text with a compressed representation, e.g., the\nFM-index and its variants, or keep it uncompressed but attach some redundancy -\nan index - to accelerate matching.

The latter approaches, like the\nsuffix array, instead sacrifice space for speed.\n  We show that efficient text indexing can be achieved using just a small extra\nspace on top of the original text, provided that the query patterns are\nsufficiently long. More specifically, we develop a new indexing paradigm in\nwhich a sketch of a query pattern is first matched against a sketch of the\ntext. Once candidate matches are retrieved, they are verified using the\noriginal text. This paradigm is thus universal in the sense that it allows us\nto use any solution to index the sketched text, like a suffix array, FM-index,\nor r-index.\n  We explore both the theory and the practice of this universal framework. With\nan extensive experimental analysis, we show that, surprisingly, universal\nindexes can be constructed much faster than their unsketched counterparts and\ntake a fraction of the space, as a direct consequence of (i) having a lower\nbound on the length of patterns and (ii) working in sketch space. Furthermore,\nthese data structures have the potential of retaining or even improving query\ntime, because matching against the sketched text is faster and verifying\ncandidates can be theoretically done in constant time per occurrence (or, in\npractice, by short and cache-friendly scans of the text).

However, as the\nconversation rounds continue, it is required to store a large amount of KV\ncache in GPU memory, which significantly affects the efficiency and even\navailability of the model serving systems. This paper analyzes dialogue data\nfrom real users and discovers that the LLM inference manifests a watershed\nlayer, after which the distribution of round-level attention shows notable\nsimilarity.

However, as the\nconversation rounds continue, it is required to store a large amount of KV\ncache in GPU memory, which significantly affects the efficiency and even\navailability of the model serving systems. This paper analyzes dialogue data\nfrom real users and discovers that the LLM inference manifests a watershed\nlayer, after which the distribution of round-level attention shows notable\nsimilarity.

Furthermore, our theoretical\nanalysis shows that matrices with higher spectral norms amplify quantization\nerrors more significantly. Motivated by these insights, we propose a\nmixed-precision quantization strategy, KV-AdaQuant, which allocates more\nbit-width for keys and fewer for values since key matrices have higher norm\nvalues. With the same total KV bit budget, this approach effectively mitigates\nerror propagation across transformer layers while achieving significant memory\nsavings. Our extensive experiments on multiple LLMs (1B--70B) demonstrate that\nour mixed-precision quantization scheme maintains high model accuracy even\nunder aggressive compression. For instance, using 4-bit for Key and 2-bit for\nValue achieves an accuracy of 75.2%, whereas reversing the assignment (2-bit\nfor Key and 4-bit for Value) yields only 54.7% accuracy.

Enabling well-trained LLMs (e.g., Llama) to rapidly adapt to MLA\nwithout pre-training from scratch is both meaningful and challenging. This\npaper proposes the first data-efficient fine-tuning method for transitioning\nfrom MHA to MLA (MHA2MLA), which includes two key components: for partial-RoPE,\nwe remove RoPE from dimensions of queries and keys that contribute less to the\nattention scores, for low-rank approximation, we introduce joint SVD\napproximations based on the pre-trained parameters of keys and values. These\ncarefully designed strategies enable MHA2MLA to recover performance using only\na small fraction (0.3% to 0.6%) of the data, significantly reducing inference\ncosts while seamlessly integrating with compression techniques such as KV cache\nquantization. For example, the KV cache size of Llama2-7B is reduced by 92.19%,\nwith only a 0.5% drop in LongBench performance.",

Enabling well-trained LLMs (e.g., Llama) to rapidly adapt to MLA\nwithout pre-training from scratch is both meaningful and challenging. This\npaper proposes the first data-efficient fine-tuning method for transitioning\nfrom MHA to MLA (MHA2MLA), which includes two key components: for partial-RoPE,\nwe remove RoPE from dimensions of queries and keys that contribute less to the\nattention scores, for low-rank approximation, we introduce joint SVD\napproximations based on the pre-trained parameters of keys and values. These\ncarefully designed strategies enable MHA2MLA to recover performance using only\na small fraction (0.3% to 0.6%) of the data, significantly reducing inference\ncosts while seamlessly integrating with compression techniques such as KV cache\nquantization. For example, the KV cache size of Llama2-7B is reduced by 92.19%,\nwith only a 0.5% drop in LongBench performance."

Motivated by the\nVision Token Re-attention phenomenon across decoder layers, we dynamically\nadjust token retention rates layer by layer. Layers that exhibit stronger\nattention to visual information preserve more vision tokens, while layers with\nlower vision attention are aggressively pruned. Furthermore, PLPHP applies\npruning at the attention head level, enabling different heads within the same\nlayer to independently retain critical context. Experiments on multiple\nbenchmarks demonstrate that PLPHP delivers an 18% faster decoding speed and\nreduces the Key-Value Cache (KV Cache) size by over 50%, all at the cost of\n0.46% average performance drop, while also achieving notable performance\nimprovements in multi-image tasks.

Our approach enables the direct conversion of trained decoder-only\nMLLMs to linear-complexity architectures without requiring pre-trained\nRNN-based LLM or vision encoders. We propose an seeding strategy to carve Mamba\nfrom trained Transformer and a three-stage distillation recipe, which can\neffectively transfer the knowledge from Transformer to Mamba while preserving\nmultimodal capabilities. Our method also supports flexible hybrid architectures\nthat combine Transformer and Mamba layers for customizable\nefficiency-performance trade-offs. Distilled from the Transformer-based\ndecoder-only HoVLE, mmMamba-linear achieves competitive performance against\nexisting linear and quadratic-complexity VLMs, while mmMamba-hybrid further\nimproves performance significantly, approaching HoVLE's capabilities.

In this paper, we propose HEADINFER, which offloads\nthe KV cache to CPU RAM while avoiding the need to fully store the KV cache for\nany transformer layer on the GPU. HEADINFER employs a fine-grained, head-wise\noffloading strategy, maintaining only selective attention heads KV cache on the\nGPU while computing attention output dynamically. Through roofline analysis, we\ndemonstrate that HEADINFER maintains computational efficiency while\nsignificantly reducing memory footprint. We evaluate HEADINFER on the\nLlama-3-8B model with a 1-million-token sequence, reducing the GPU memory\nfootprint of the KV cache from 128 GB to 1 GB and the total GPU memory usage\nfrom 207 GB to 17 GB, achieving a 92% reduction compared to BF16 baseline\ninference. Notably, HEADINFER enables 4-million-token inference with an 8B\nmodel on a single consumer GPU with 24GB memory (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090) without\napproximation methods.",

Extending the context length has\ndisproportionately shifted the memory footprint of LLMs during inference to the\nkey-value cache (KV cache). In this paper, we propose HEADINFER, which offloads\nthe KV cache to CPU RAM while avoiding the need to fully store the KV cache for\nany transformer layer on the GPU. HEADINFER employs a fine-grained, head-wise\noffloading strategy, maintaining only selective attention heads KV cache on the\nGPU while computing attention output dynamically. Through roofline analysis, we\ndemonstrate that HEADINFER maintains computational efficiency while\nsignificantly reducing memory footprint. We evaluate HEADINFER on the\nLlama-3-8B model with a 1-million-token sequence, reducing the GPU memory\nfootprint of the KV cache from 128 GB to 1 GB and the total GPU memory usage\nfrom 207 GB to 17 GB, achieving a 92% reduction compared to BF16 baseline\ninference. Notably, HEADINFER enables 4-million-token inference with an 8B\nmodel on a single consumer GPU with 24GB memory (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090) without\napproximation methods."

Recently, abundant works have been proposed to solve this\nproblem with token pruning, which identifies the redundant tokens in MLLMs and\nthen prunes them to reduce the computation and KV storage costs, leading to\nsignificant acceleration without training. While these methods claim efficiency\ngains, critical questions about their fundamental design and evaluation remain\nunanswered: Why do many existing approaches underperform even compared to naive\nrandom token selection? Are attention-based scoring sufficient for reliably\nidentifying redundant tokens? Is language information really helpful during\ntoken pruning? What makes a good trade-off between token importance and\nduplication? Are current evaluation protocols comprehensive and unbiased? The\nignorance of previous research on these problems hinders the long-term\ndevelopment of token pruning. In this paper, we answer these questions one by\none, providing insights into the design of future token pruning methods.",

                    "value": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance\nfor cross-modal understanding and generation, yet still suffer from severe\ninference costs. Recently, abundant works have been proposed to solve this\nproblem with token pruning, which identifies the redundant tokens in MLLMs and\nthen prunes them to reduce the computation and KV storage costs, leading to\nsignificant acceleration without training. While these methods claim efficiency\ngains, critical questions about their fundamental design and evaluation remain\nunanswered: Why do many existing approaches underperform even compared to naive\nrandom token selection? Are attention-based scoring sufficient for reliably\nidentifying redundant tokens? Is language information really helpful during\ntoken pruning? What makes a good trade-off between token importance and\nduplication? Are current evaluation protocols comprehensive and unbiased? The\nignorance of previous research on these problems hinders the long-term\ndevelopment of token pruning. In this paper, we answer these questions one by\none, providing insights into the design of future token pruning methods."

                "summary": "Diffusion models (DMs) have become the leading choice for generative tasks\nacross diverse domains. However, their reliance on multiple sequential forward\npasses significantly limits real-time performance. Previous acceleration\nmethods have primarily focused on reducing the number of sampling steps or\nreusing intermediate results, failing to leverage variations across spatial\nregions within the image due to the constraints of convolutional U-Net\nstructures. By harnessing the flexibility of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) in\nhandling variable number of tokens, we introduce RAS, a novel, training-free\nsampling strategy that dynamically assigns different sampling ratios to regions\nwithin an image based on the focus of the DiT model. Our key observation is\nthat during each sampling step, the model concentrates on semantically\nmeaningful regions, and these areas of focus exhibit strong continuity across\nconsecutive steps. Leveraging this insight, RAS updates only the regions\ncurrently in focus, while other regions are updated using cached noise from the\nprevious step.

                    "value": "Diffusion models (DMs) have become the leading choice for generative tasks\nacross diverse domains. However, their reliance on multiple sequential forward\npasses significantly limits real-time performance. Previous acceleration\nmethods have primarily focused on reducing the number of sampling steps or\nreusing intermediate results, failing to leverage variations across spatial\nregions within the image due to the constraints of convolutional U-Net\nstructures. By harnessing the flexibility of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) in\nhandling variable number of tokens, we introduce RAS, a novel, training-free\nsampling strategy that dynamically assigns different sampling ratios to regions\nwithin an image based on the focus of the DiT model. Our key observation is\nthat during each sampling step, the model concentrates on semantically\nmeaningful regions, and these areas of focus exhibit strong continuity across\nconsecutive steps.

First, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that\nachieves exact optimality in terms of average latency in the semi-online prompt\narrival model. Second, in the fully online case with a stochastic prompt\narrival, we introduce an efficient online scheduling algorithm with constant\nregret. Third, we prove that no algorithm (deterministic or randomized) can\nachieve a constant competitive ratio in fully online adversarial settings. Our\nempirical evaluations on a public LLM inference dataset, using the Llama-70B\nmodel on A100 GPUs, show that our approach significantly outperforms benchmark\nalgorithms used currently in practice, achieving lower latency while reducing\nenergy consumption. Overall, our results offer a path toward more sustainable\nand cost-effective LLM deployment."

It also scales\nto many-shot CAG, effectively encoding hundreds of contexts in parallel.\nEfficiency evaluation shows that APE can achieve an end-to-end 4.5$\\times$\nspeedup by reducing 28$\\times$ prefilling time for a 128K-length context."

GPUs are known for their strong\narithmetic computing capabilities and are highly suited for BLAS operations.\nHowever, porting code to GPUs often requires significant effort, especially for\nlarge, complex codes or legacy codes, even for BLAS-heavy applications. While\nvarious tools exist to automatically offload BLAS to GPUs, they are often\nimpractical due to the high costs associated with mandatory data transfers. The\nadvent of unified memory architectures in recent GPU designs, such as the\nNVIDIA Grace-Hopper, allows cache-coherent memory access across all types of\nmemory for both CPU and GPU, potentially eliminating the bottlenecks faced in\nconventional architectures. This breakthrough paves the way for innovative\napplication developments and porting strategies. Building on our preliminary\nwork demonstrating the potential of automatic *gemm offload, this paper extends\nthe framework to all level-3 BLAS operations and introduces SCILIB-Accel, a\nnovel tool for automatic BLAS offload. SCILIB-Accel leverages the memory\ncoherency in Grace-Hopper and introduces a Device First-Use data movement\npolicy inspired by the OpenMP First-Touch approach in multi-socket CPU\nprogramming, minimizing CPU-GPU data transfers for typical scientific computing\ncodes. Additionally, utilizing dynamic binary instrumentation, the tool\nintercepts BLAS symbols directly from a CPU binary, requiring no code\nmodifications or recompilation. SCILIB-Accel has been evaluated using multiple\nquantum physics codes on up to a few hundred GPU nodes, yielding promising\nspeedups. Notably, for the LSMS method in the MuST suite, a 3x speedup was\nachieved on Grace-Hopper compared to Grace-Grace.",

Based on this control circuit, along with a\ncommercial miniature high-voltage power converter, we construct an untethered\ncrawling robot driven by a cylindrical DEA. The 42-g untethered robots\nsuccessfully obtained crawling locomotion on a bench and within a pipeline at a\ndriving frequency of 15 Hz, while simultaneously transmitting real-time video\ndata via an onboard camera and antenna. Our work provides a practical way to\nuse low-voltage control electronics to achieve the untethered driving of DEAs,\nand therefore portable and wearable devices."

To tackle\nthese concerns, we present SphereFusion, an end-to-end framework that combines\nthe strengths of various projection methods. Specifically, SphereFusion\ninitially employs 2D image convolution and mesh operations to extract two\ndistinct types of features from the panorama image in both equirectangular and\nspherical projection domains. These features are then projected onto the\nspherical domain, where a gate fusion module selects the most reliable features\nfor fusion. Finally, SphereFusion estimates panorama depth within the spherical\ndomain. Meanwhile, SphereFusion employs a cache strategy to improve the\nefficiency of mesh operation. Extensive experiments on three public panorama\ndatasets demonstrate that SphereFusion achieves competitive results with other\nstate-of-the-art methods, while presenting the fastest inference speed at only\n17 ms on a 512$\\times$1024 panorama image.",

To bridge this gap, we propose a unified evaluation taxonomy\nwith eight pedagogical dimensions based on key learning sciences principles,\nwhich is designed to assess the pedagogical value of LLM-powered AI tutor\nresponses grounded in student mistakes or confusions in the mathematical\ndomain. We release MRBench - a new evaluation benchmark containing 192\nconversations and 1,596 responses from seven state-of-the-art LLM-based and\nhuman tutors, providing gold annotations for eight pedagogical dimensions. We\nassess reliability of the popular Prometheus2 and Llama-3.1-8B LLMs as\nevaluators and analyze each tutor's pedagogical abilities, highlighting which\nLLMs are good tutors and which ones are more suitable as question-answering\nsystems. We believe that the presented taxonomy, benchmark, and human-annotated\nlabels will streamline the evaluation process and help track the progress in AI\ntutors' development.",

To bridge this gap, we propose a unified evaluation taxonomy\nwith eight pedagogical dimensions based on key learning sciences principles,\nwhich is designed to assess the pedagogical value of LLM-powered AI tutor\nresponses grounded in student mistakes or confusions in the mathematical\ndomain. We release MRBench - a new evaluation benchmark containing 192\nconversations and 1,596 responses from seven state-of-the-art LLM-based and\nhuman tutors, providing gold annotations for eight pedagogical dimensions. We\nassess reliability of the popular Prometheus2 and Llama-3.1-8B LLMs as\nevaluators and analyze each tutor's pedagogical abilities, highlighting which\nLLMs are good tutors and which ones are more suitable as question-answering\nsystems. We believe that the presented taxonomy, benchmark, and human-annotated\nlabels will streamline the evaluation process and help track the progress in AI\ntutors' development."

Adaptive\nattention techniques can dynamically reduce computational redundancy and thus\nimprove efficiency. Although current adaptive attention methods significantly\nreduce the memory requirements of Transformer-based language models, they are\nnot tailored for LVLMs. We observe that LVLMs generate responses from both\nremote image tokens and local text tokens, and different modalities have\ndifferent attention patterns. This observation inspires us to manage the\nattention for each modality separately. Specifically, for visual input, we\nstore the cache of potentially useful information but only compute the most\ncritical parts. For language input, we care more about local information. Based\non our observation and analysis of vision-language attention patterns, we\ndevelop A-VL, a plug-and-play adaptive attention tailored for LVLM inference.\nExtensive evaluations on three vision-language tasks and five datasets show the\neffectiveness of our designs.

                    "value": "The Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) integrates computer vision and natural\nlanguage processing techniques, offering substantial application potential.\nHowever, these models demand extensive resources during inference. Adaptive\nattention techniques can dynamically reduce computational redundancy and thus\nimprove efficiency. Although current adaptive attention methods significantly\nreduce the memory requirements of Transformer-based language models, they are\nnot tailored for LVLMs. We observe that LVLMs generate responses from both\nremote image tokens and local text tokens, and different modalities have\ndifferent attention patterns. This observation inspires us to manage the\nattention for each modality separately. Specifically, for visual input, we\nstore the cache of potentially useful information but only compute the most\ncritical parts. For language input, we care more about local information. Based\non our observation and analysis of vision-language attention patterns, we\ndevelop A-VL, a plug-and-play adaptive attention tailored for LVLM inference.\nExtensive evaluations on three vision-language tasks and five datasets show the\neffectiveness of our designs. Our approach A-VL outperforms existing adaptive\nattention methods in reducing memory usage and computational load without\ncompromising performance."

Therefore, we thoroughly analyze the inherent\ncorrelation of layer-wise transformer attention patterns to KV cache\nquantization errors and study why key cache is more important than value cache\nfor quantization error reduction.

To reduce the computational cost of\noffline calibration, we utilize the intra-layer KV precision pair pruning and\ninter-layer clustering to reduce the search space. Experimental results show\nthat we can achieve nearly lossless 3.25-bit mixed precision KV cache\nquantization for LLMs like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and 4.0-bit for sensitive\nmodels like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning tasks.

To address\nthese challenges, we introduce Federated Locate-then-Edit Knowledge Editing\n(FLEKE), a novel task that enables multiple clients to collaboratively perform\nLEKE while preserving privacy and reducing computational overhead. To achieve\nthis, we propose FedEdit, a two-stage framework that optimizes MKV selection\nand reuse. In the first stage, clients locally apply LEKE and upload the\ncomputed MKVs. In the second stage, rather than relying solely on server-based\nMKV sharing, FLEKE allows clients retrieve relevant MKVs based on cosine\nsimilarity, enabling knowledge re-edit and minimizing redundant computations.\nExperimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedEdit retains\nover 96% of the performance of non-federated LEKE while significantly\noutperforming a FedAvg-based baseline by approximately twofold.

However, recent studies have found that there are still\nsignificant challenges to the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs. This paper\nsummarizes and categorizes the main challenges into two aspects: (1) Logical\nquestion answering, LLMs often fail to generate the correct answer within\ncomplex logical problem which requires sophisticated deductive, inductive or\nabductive reasoning given a collection of premises and constrains.

PP leverages the insight that not all samples and tokens contribute\nequally to the model's output, and probing a small portion of each batch\neffectively identifies crucial weights, enabling tailored dynamic pruning for\ndifferent batches. It comprises three main stages: probing, history-informed\npruning, and full inference. In the probing stage, PP selects a small yet\ncrucial set of hidden states, based on residual importance, to run a few model\nlayers ahead. During the history-informed pruning stage, PP strategically\nintegrates the probing states with historical states. Subsequently, it\nstructurally prunes weights based on the integrated states and the PP\nimportance score, a metric developed specifically to assess the importance of\neach weight channel in maintaining performance. In the final stage, full\ninference is conducted on the remaining weights. A major advantage of PP is its\ncompatibility with existing models, as it operates without requiring additional\nneural network modules or fine-tuning. Comprehensive evaluations of PP on\nLLaMA-2/3 and OPT models reveal that even minimal probing-using just 1.5% of\nFLOPs-can substantially enhance the efficiency of structured pruning of LLMs.\nFor instance, when evaluated on LLaMA-2-7B with WikiText2, PP achieves a 2.56\ntimes lower ratio of performance degradation per unit of runtime reduction\ncompared to the state-of-the-art method at a 40% pruning ratio.

Having a CDSS is important because of the\nhigh complexity of diagnostic manuals used by mental health professionals and\nthe danger of diagnostic errors. Our CDSS is a software tool that uses an LLM\nto translate diagnostic manuals to a logic program and solves the program using\nan off-the-shelf CLP engine to query a patient's diagnosis based on the encoded\nrules and provided data. By giving domain experts the opportunity to inspect\nthe LLM-generated logic program, and making modifications when needed, our CDSS\nensures that the diagnosis is not only accurate but also interpretable. We\nexperimentally compare it with two baseline approaches of using LLMs:\ndiagnosing patients using the LLM-only approach, and using the LLM-generated\nlogic program but without expert inspection. The results show that, while LLMs\nare extremely useful in generating candidate logic programs, these programs\nstill require expert inspection and modification to guarantee faithfulness to\nthe official diagnostic manuals. Additionally, ethical concerns arise from the\ndirect use of patient data in LLMs, underscoring the need for a safer hybrid\napproach like our proposed method.",

                    "value": "We propose a clinical decision support system (CDSS) for mental health\ndiagnosis that combines the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and\nconstraint logic programming (CLP). Having a CDSS is important because of the\nhigh complexity of diagnostic manuals used by mental health professionals and\nthe danger of diagnostic errors. Our CDSS is a software tool that uses an LLM\nto translate diagnostic manuals to a logic program and solves the program using\nan off-the-shelf CLP engine to query a patient's diagnosis based on the encoded\nrules and provided data. By giving domain experts the opportunity to inspect\nthe LLM-generated logic program, and making modifications when needed, our CDSS\nensures that the diagnosis is not only accurate but also interpretable. We\nexperimentally compare it with two baseline approaches of using LLMs:\ndiagnosing patients using the LLM-only approach, and using the LLM-generated\nlogic program but without expert inspection. The results show that, while LLMs\nare extremely useful in generating candidate logic programs, these programs\nstill require expert inspection and modification to guarantee faithfulness to\nthe official diagnostic manuals. Additionally, ethical concerns arise from the\ndirect use of patient data in LLMs, underscoring the need for a safer hybrid\napproach like our proposed method."

                "summary": "While machine learning (ML) models are becoming mainstream, especially in\nsensitive application areas, the risk of data leakage has become a growing\nconcern. Attacks like membership inference (MIA) have shown that trained models\ncan reveal sensitive data, jeopardizing confidentiality. While traditional\nArtificial Neural Networks (ANNs) dominate ML applications, neuromorphic\narchitectures, specifically Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), are emerging as\npromising alternatives due to their low power consumption and event-driven\nprocessing, akin to biological neurons. Privacy in ANNs is well-studied;\nhowever, little work has explored the privacy-preserving properties of SNNs.\nThis paper examines whether SNNs inherently offer better privacy. Using MIAs,\nwe assess the privacy resilience of SNNs versus ANNs across diverse datasets.\nWe analyze the impact of learning algorithms (surrogate gradient and\nevolutionary), frameworks (snnTorch, TENNLab, LAVA), and parameters on SNN\nprivacy. Our findings show that SNNs consistently outperform ANNs in privacy\npreservation, with evolutionary algorithms offering additional resilience.

                    "value": "While machine learning (ML) models are becoming mainstream, especially in\nsensitive application areas, the risk of data leakage has become a growing\nconcern. Attacks like membership inference (MIA) have shown that trained models\ncan reveal sensitive data, jeopardizing confidentiality. While traditional\nArtificial Neural Networks (ANNs) dominate ML applications, neuromorphic\narchitectures, specifically Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), are emerging as\npromising alternatives due to their low power consumption and event-driven\nprocessing, akin to biological neurons. Privacy in ANNs is well-studied;\nhowever, little work has explored the privacy-preserving properties of SNNs.\nThis paper examines whether SNNs inherently offer better privacy. Using MIAs,\nwe assess the privacy resilience of SNNs versus ANNs across diverse datasets.\nWe analyze the impact of learning algorithms (surrogate gradient and\nevolutionary), frameworks (snnTorch, TENNLab, LAVA), and parameters on SNN\nprivacy. Our findings show that SNNs consistently outperform ANNs in privacy\npreservation, with evolutionary algorithms offering additional resilience. For\ninstance, on CIFAR-10, SNNs achieve an AUC of 0.59, significantly lower than\nANNs' 0.82, and on CIFAR-100, SNNs maintain an AUC of 0.58 compared to ANNs'\n0.88.

                "summary": "In computational cognitive modeling, capturing the full spectrum of human\njudgment and decision-making processes, beyond just optimal behaviors, is a\nsignificant challenge. This study explores whether Large Language Models (LLMs)\ncan emulate the breadth of human reasoning by predicting both intuitive, fast\nSystem 1 and deliberate, slow System 2 processes. We investigate the potential\nof AI to mimic diverse reasoning behaviors across a human population,\naddressing what we call the \"full reasoning spectrum problem\". We designed\nreasoning tasks using a novel generalization of the Natural Language Inference\n(NLI) format to evaluate LLMs' ability to replicate human reasoning. The\nquestions were crafted to elicit both System 1 and System 2 responses. Human\nresponses were collected through crowd-sourcing and the entire distribution was\nmodeled, rather than just the majority of the answers. We used\npersonality-based prompting inspired by the Big Five personality model to\nelicit AI responses reflecting specific personality traits, capturing the\ndiversity of human reasoning, and exploring how personality traits influence\nLLM outputs. Combined with genetic algorithms to optimize the weighting of\nthese prompts, this method was tested alongside traditional machine learning\nmodels. The results show that LLMs can mimic human response distributions, with\nopen-source models like Llama and Mistral outperforming proprietary GPT models.\nPersonality-based prompting, especially when optimized with genetic algorithms,\nsignificantly enhanced LLMs' ability to predict human response distributions,\nsuggesting that capturing suboptimal, naturalistic reasoning may require\nmodeling techniques incorporating diverse reasoning styles and psychological\nprofiles. The study concludes that personality-based prompting combined with\ngenetic algorithms is promising for enhancing AI's 'human-ness' in reasoning.",

                    "value": "In computational cognitive modeling, capturing the full spectrum of human\njudgment and decision-making processes, beyond just optimal behaviors, is a\nsignificant challenge. This study explores whether Large Language Models (LLMs)\ncan emulate the breadth of human reasoning by predicting both intuitive, fast\nSystem 1 and deliberate, slow System 2 processes. We investigate the potential\nof AI to mimic diverse reasoning behaviors across a human population,\naddressing what we call the \"full reasoning spectrum problem\". We designed\nreasoning tasks using a novel generalization of the Natural Language Inference\n(NLI) format to evaluate LLMs' ability to replicate human reasoning. The\nquestions were crafted to elicit both System 1 and System 2 responses. Human\nresponses were collected through crowd-sourcing and the entire distribution was\nmodeled, rather than just the majority of the answers. We used\npersonality-based prompting inspired by the Big Five personality model to\nelicit AI responses reflecting specific personality traits, capturing the\ndiversity of human reasoning, and exploring how personality traits influence\nLLM outputs. Combined with genetic algorithms to optimize the weighting of\nthese prompts, this method was tested alongside traditional machine learning\nmodels. The results show that LLMs can mimic human response distributions, with\nopen-source models like Llama and Mistral outperforming proprietary GPT models.\nPersonality-based prompting, especially when optimized with genetic algorithms,\nsignificantly enhanced LLMs' ability to predict human response distributions,\nsuggesting that capturing suboptimal, naturalistic reasoning may require\nmodeling techniques incorporating diverse reasoning styles and psychological\nprofiles. The study concludes that personality-based prompting combined with\ngenetic algorithms is promising for enhancing AI's 'human-ness' in reasoning."

                "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for natural language\nunderstanding and text generation. An LLM model relies on a time-consuming step\ncalled LLM decoding to generate output tokens. Several prior works focus on\nimproving the performance of LLM decoding using parallelism techniques, such as\nbatching and speculative decoding. State-of-the-art LLM decoding has both\ncompute-bound and memory-bound kernels. Some prior works statically identify\nand map these different kernels to a heterogeneous architecture consisting of\nboth processing-in-memory (PIM) units and computation-centric accelerators. We\nobserve that characteristics of LLM decoding kernels (e.g., whether or not a\nkernel is memory-bound) can change dynamically due to parameter changes to meet\nuser and/or system demands, making (1) static kernel mapping to PIM units and\ncomputation-centric accelerators suboptimal, and (2) one-size-fits-all approach\nof designing PIM units inefficient due to a large degree of heterogeneity even\nin memory-bound kernels.\n  In this paper, we aim to accelerate LLM decoding while considering the\ndynamically changing characteristics of the kernels involved. We propose PAPI\n(PArallel Decoding with PIM), a PIM-enabled heterogeneous architecture that\nexploits dynamic scheduling of compute-bound or memory-bound kernels to\nsuitable hardware units. PAPI has two key mechanisms: (1) online kernel\ncharacterization to dynamically schedule kernels to the most suitable hardware\nunits at runtime and (2) a PIM-enabled heterogeneous computing system that\nharmoniously orchestrates both computation-centric processing units and hybrid\nPIM units with different computing capabilities. Our experimental results on\nthree broadly-used LLMs show that PAPI achieves 1.8$\\times$ and 11.1$\\times$\nspeedups over a state-of-the-art heterogeneous LLM accelerator and a\nstate-of-the-art PIM-only LLM accelerator, respectively.",

Fed-SB achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across commonsense reasoning, arithmetic\nreasoning, and language inference tasks while reducing communication costs by\nup to 230x. In private settings, Fed-SB further improves performance by (1)\nreducing trainable parameters, thereby lowering the noise required for\ndifferential privacy and (2) avoiding noise amplification introduced by other\nmethods. Overall, Fed-SB establishes a new Pareto frontier in the tradeoff\nbetween communication and performance, offering an efficient and scalable\nsolution for both private and non-private federated fine-tuning.

In private settings, Fed-SB further improves performance by (1)\nreducing trainable parameters, thereby lowering the noise required for\ndifferential privacy and (2) avoiding noise amplification introduced by other\nmethods. Overall, Fed-SB establishes a new Pareto frontier in the tradeoff\nbetween communication and performance, offering an efficient and scalable\nsolution for both private and non-private federated fine-tuning.

We show that, across all modes,\nPub-Guard-LLM consistently surpasses the performance of various baselines and\nprovides more reliable explanations, namely explanations which are deemed more\nrelevant and coherent than those generated by the baselines when evaluated by\nmultiple assessment methods.

Although the annotation cost of VidSGG can be alleviated by adopting\na weakly supervised approach commonly used for ImgSGG (WS-ImgSGG) that uses\nimage captions, there are two key reasons that hinder such a naive adoption: 1)\nTemporality within video captions, i.e., unlike image captions, video captions\ninclude temporal markers (e.g., before, while, then, after) that indicate time\nrelated details, and 2) Variability in action duration, i.e., unlike human\nactions in image captions, human actions in video captions unfold over varying\nduration. To address these issues, we propose a Natural Language-based Video\nScene Graph Generation (NL-VSGG) framework that only utilizes the readily\navailable video captions for training a VidSGG model. NL-VSGG consists of two\nkey modules: Temporality-aware Caption Segmentation (TCS) module and Action\nDuration Variability-aware caption-frame alignment (ADV) module. Specifically,\nTCS segments the video captions into multiple sentences in a temporal order\nbased on a Large Language Model (LLM), and ADV aligns each segmented sentence\nwith appropriate frames considering the variability in action duration. Our\napproach leads to a significant enhancement in performance compared to simply\napplying the WS-ImgSGG pipeline to VidSGG on the Action Genome dataset. As a\nfurther benefit of utilizing the video captions as weak supervision, we show\nthat the VidSGG model trained by NL-VSGG is able to predict a broader range of\naction classes that are not included in the training data, which makes our\nframework practical in reality.",

Using regression\nand clustering analyses, we investigated how these features influence\nparticipants' perceptions of AI consciousness. The results reveal that\nmetacognitive self-reflection and the AI's expression of its own emotions\nsignificantly increased perceived consciousness, while a heavy emphasis on\nknowledge reduced it. Participants clustered into seven subgroups, each showing\ndistinct feature-weighting patterns. Additionally, higher prior knowledge of\nLLMs and more frequent usage of LLM-based chatbots were associated with greater\noverall likelihood assessments of AI consciousness. This study underscores the\nmultidimensional and individualized nature of perceived AI consciousness and\nprovides a foundation for better understanding the psychosocial implications of\nhuman-AI interaction.",

Initially, K\ncache is transformed into latent channels using SVD basis representations.\nSince the values in latent channels decay rapidly and become negligible after\nonly a few latent channels, our method then incorporates importance-aware\nquantization and compression for latent channels. This enables the effective\nallocation of higher precision to more significant channels. Theoretically, we\nprove that SVDq results in quantization errors (x0.1 or even lower) that are\nmuch lower than those of per-channel key quantization in the original space.\nOur findings based on RULER and LongBench benchmarks demonstrate that SVDq can\nachieve an equivalent key cache precision as low as 1.25-bit. When combined\nwith key sparsity, it can reach a key compression ratio of up to 410x for\nattention computation, all while maintaining comparable model performance.\nNotably, our method is nearly lossless for LongBench datasets.

                "summary": "Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to understand people's mental variables\nbased on their behavior, is key to developing socially intelligent agents.\nCurrent approaches to Theory of Mind reasoning either rely on prompting Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), which are prone to systematic errors, or use rigid,\nhandcrafted Bayesian Theory of Mind (BToM) models, which are more robust but\ncannot generalize across different domains. In this work, we introduce AutoToM,\nan automated Bayesian Theory of Mind method for achieving open-ended machine\nTheory of Mind. AutoToM can operate in any domain, infer any mental variable,\nand conduct robust Theory of Mind reasoning of any order. Given a Theory of\nMind inference problem, AutoToM first proposes an initial BToM model.

                    "value": "Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to understand people's mental variables\nbased on their behavior, is key to developing socially intelligent agents.\nCurrent approaches to Theory of Mind reasoning either rely on prompting Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), which are prone to systematic errors, or use rigid,\nhandcrafted Bayesian Theory of Mind (BToM) models, which are more robust but\ncannot generalize across different domains. In this work, we introduce AutoToM,\nan automated Bayesian Theory of Mind method for achieving open-ended machine\nTheory of Mind. AutoToM can operate in any domain, infer any mental variable,\nand conduct robust Theory of Mind reasoning of any order. Given a Theory of\nMind inference problem, AutoToM first proposes an initial BToM model. It then\nconducts automated Bayesian inverse planning based on the proposed model,\nleveraging an LLM as the backend. Based on the uncertainty of the inference, it\niteratively refines the model, by introducing additional mental variables\nand/or incorporating more timesteps in the context. Empirical evaluations\nacross multiple Theory of Mind benchmarks demonstrate that AutoToM consistently\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a scalable, robust, and\ninterpretable approach to machine Theory of Mind."

While reduced-order models like the Hybrid Linear\nInverted Pendulum (HLIP) are simple and computationally efficient, they lose\nwhole-body expressiveness. Meanwhile, recent advances in Contact-Implicit Model\nPredictive Control (CI-MPC) enable robots to plan through multiple hybrid\ncontact modes, but remain vulnerable to local minima and require significant\ntuning. We propose a control framework that combines the strengths of HLIP and\nCI-MPC. The reduced-order model generates a nominal gait, while CI-MPC manages\nthe whole-body dynamics and modifies the contact schedule as needed. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in simulation with a novel 24\ndegree-of-freedom humanoid robot: Achilles.

                    "value": "Humanoid robots have great potential for real-world applications due to their\nability to operate in environments built for humans, but their deployment is\nhindered by the challenge of controlling their underlying high-dimensional\nnonlinear hybrid dynamics. While reduced-order models like the Hybrid Linear\nInverted Pendulum (HLIP) are simple and computationally efficient, they lose\nwhole-body expressiveness. Meanwhile, recent advances in Contact-Implicit Model\nPredictive Control (CI-MPC) enable robots to plan through multiple hybrid\ncontact modes, but remain vulnerable to local minima and require significant\ntuning. We propose a control framework that combines the strengths of HLIP and\nCI-MPC. The reduced-order model generates a nominal gait, while CI-MPC manages\nthe whole-body dynamics and modifies the contact schedule as needed. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in simulation with a novel 24\ndegree-of-freedom humanoid robot: Achilles. Our proposed framework achieves\nrough terrain walking, disturbance recovery, robustness under model and state\nuncertainty, and allows the robot to interact with obstacles in the\nenvironment, all while running online in real-time at 50 Hz."

PP leverages the insight that not all samples and tokens contribute\nequally to the model's output, and probing a small portion of each batch\neffectively identifies crucial weights, enabling tailored dynamic pruning for\ndifferent batches. It comprises three main stages: probing, history-informed\npruning, and full inference. In the probing stage, PP selects a small yet\ncrucial set of hidden states, based on residual importance, to run a few model\nlayers ahead. During the history-informed pruning stage, PP strategically\nintegrates the probing states with historical states. Subsequently, it\nstructurally prunes weights based on the integrated states and the PP\nimportance score, a metric developed specifically to assess the importance of\neach weight channel in maintaining performance. In the final stage, full\ninference is conducted on the remaining weights. A major advantage of PP is its\ncompatibility with existing models, as it operates without requiring additional\nneural network modules or fine-tuning. Comprehensive evaluations of PP on\nLLaMA-2/3 and OPT models reveal that even minimal probing-using just 1.5% of\nFLOPs-can substantially enhance the efficiency of structured pruning of LLMs.\nFor instance, when evaluated on LLaMA-2-7B with WikiText2, PP achieves a 2.56\ntimes lower ratio of performance degradation per unit of runtime reduction\ncompared to the state-of-the-art method at a 40% pruning ratio.

Having a CDSS is important because of the\nhigh complexity of diagnostic manuals used by mental health professionals and\nthe danger of diagnostic errors. Our CDSS is a software tool that uses an LLM\nto translate diagnostic manuals to a logic program and solves the program using\nan off-the-shelf CLP engine to query a patient's diagnosis based on the encoded\nrules and provided data. By giving domain experts the opportunity to inspect\nthe LLM-generated logic program, and making modifications when needed, our CDSS\nensures that the diagnosis is not only accurate but also interpretable. We\nexperimentally compare it with two baseline approaches of using LLMs:\ndiagnosing patients using the LLM-only approach, and using the LLM-generated\nlogic program but without expert inspection. The results show that, while LLMs\nare extremely useful in generating candidate logic programs, these programs\nstill require expert inspection and modification to guarantee faithfulness to\nthe official diagnostic manuals. Additionally, ethical concerns arise from the\ndirect use of patient data in LLMs, underscoring the need for a safer hybrid\napproach like our proposed method.",

                "summary": "Knowledge-Augmented Generation (KAG) has shown great promise in updating the\ninternal memory of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external\nknowledge. However, KAG inevitably faces knowledge conflicts when the internal\nmemory contradicts external information. Current approaches to mitigating these\nconflicts mainly focus on improving external knowledge utilization. However,\nthese methods have shown only limited effectiveness in mitigating the knowledge\nconflict problem, as internal knowledge continues to influence the generation\nprocess of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a ParametrIc Pruning-based\nKnowledge-Augmented Generation (PIP-KAG) approach, which prunes internal\nknowledge of LLMs and incorporates a plug-and-play adaptation module to help\nLLMs better leverage external sources. Additionally, we construct the\nCoConflictQA benchmark based on the hallucination of LLMs to better evaluate\ncontextual faithfulness during answering questions. Experimental results on\nCoConflictQA demonstrate that PIP-KAG significantly reduces knowledge conflicts\nand improves context fidelity. Notably, PIP-KAG reduces LLM's parameters by\n13%, enhancing parameter efficiency in LLMs within the KAG framework. All codes\nare available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/PIP-KAG.",

                    "value": "Knowledge-Augmented Generation (KAG) has shown great promise in updating the\ninternal memory of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external\nknowledge. However, KAG inevitably faces knowledge conflicts when the internal\nmemory contradicts external information. Current approaches to mitigating these\nconflicts mainly focus on improving external knowledge utilization. However,\nthese methods have shown only limited effectiveness in mitigating the knowledge\nconflict problem, as internal knowledge continues to influence the generation\nprocess of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a ParametrIc Pruning-based\nKnowledge-Augmented Generation (PIP-KAG) approach, which prunes internal\nknowledge of LLMs and incorporates a plug-and-play adaptation module to help\nLLMs better leverage external sources. Additionally, we construct the\nCoConflictQA benchmark based on the hallucination of LLMs to better evaluate\ncontextual faithfulness during answering questions. Experimental results on\nCoConflictQA demonstrate that PIP-KAG significantly reduces knowledge conflicts\nand improves context fidelity. Notably, PIP-KAG reduces LLM's parameters by\n13%, enhancing parameter efficiency in LLMs within the KAG framework. All codes\nare available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/PIP-KAG."

In this\npaper, we propose Scale-Distribution Decoupling (SDD), a novel approach that\nstabilizes training by explicitly decoupling the scale and distribution of the\nweight matrix in fully-connected layers. SDD applies a normalization mechanism\nto regulate activations and a learnable scaling vector to maintain\nwell-conditioned gradients, effectively preventing $\\textbf{gradient explosion\nand dissipation}$. This separation improves optimization efficiency,\nparticularly in deep networks, by ensuring stable gradient propagation.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method stabilizes training across\nvarious LLM architectures and outperforms existing techniques in different\nnormalization configurations. Furthermore, the proposed method is lightweight\nand compatible with existing frameworks, making it a practical solution for\nstabilizing LLM training.

SDD applies a normalization mechanism\nto regulate activations and a learnable scaling vector to maintain\nwell-conditioned gradients, effectively preventing $\\textbf{gradient explosion\nand dissipation}$. This separation improves optimization efficiency,\nparticularly in deep networks, by ensuring stable gradient propagation.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method stabilizes training across\nvarious LLM architectures and outperforms existing techniques in different\nnormalization configurations. Furthermore, the proposed method is lightweight\nand compatible with existing frameworks, making it a practical solution for\nstabilizing LLM training.

Existing solutions either incur prohibitively high\ncommunication cost that scales linearly with the number of clients or suffer\nfrom performance degradation due to limited expressivity. We introduce\nFederated Silver Bullet (Fed-SB), a novel approach for federated fine-tuning of\nLLMs using LoRA-SB, a recently proposed low-rank adaptation method. LoRA-SB\noptimally aligns the optimization trajectory with the ideal low-rank full\nfine-tuning projection by learning a small square matrix (R) between adapters B\nand A, keeping other components fixed. Direct averaging of R guarantees exact\nupdates, substantially reducing communication cost, which remains independent\nof the number of clients, and enables scalability. Fed-SB achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across commonsense reasoning, arithmetic\nreasoning, and language inference tasks while reducing communication costs by\nup to 230x. In private settings, Fed-SB further improves performance by (1)\nreducing trainable parameters, thereby lowering the noise required for\ndifferential privacy and (2) avoiding noise amplification introduced by other\nmethods. Overall, Fed-SB establishes a new Pareto frontier in the tradeoff\nbetween communication and performance, offering an efficient and scalable\nsolution for both private and non-private federated fine-tuning.

Through qualitative interviews with heavy LLM users (n=7) who\nemploy these systems for both intuitive and analytical thinking tasks, our\nfindings show that participants use LLMs for social validation,\nself-regulation, and interpersonal guidance, seeking to build self-confidence\nand optimize cognitive resources. These users viewed LLMs either as rational,\nconsistent entities or average human decision-makers. Our findings suggest that\nheavy LLM users develop nuanced interaction patterns beyond simple delegation,\nhighlighting the need to reconsider how we study LLM integration in\ndecision-making processes.",

While HCI research focuses on domain-specific applications,\nlittle is known about how heavy users integrate LLMs into everyday\ndecision-making. Through qualitative interviews with heavy LLM users (n=7) who\nemploy these systems for both intuitive and analytical thinking tasks, our\nfindings show that participants use LLMs for social validation,\nself-regulation, and interpersonal guidance, seeking to build self-confidence\nand optimize cognitive resources. These users viewed LLMs either as rational,\nconsistent entities or average human decision-makers. Our findings suggest that\nheavy LLM users develop nuanced interaction patterns beyond simple delegation,\nhighlighting the need to reconsider how we study LLM integration in\ndecision-making processes."

The content of the drawings heavily relies on the\ntask, and the ecological validity of the conclusions is low; 2. The\ninterpretation of drawings relies too much on the subjective feelings of the\nresearchers. To address this issue, this study uses the Large Language Model\n(LLM) to identify 1420 children's scientific drawings (covering 9 scientific\nthemes/concepts), and uses the word2vec algorithm to calculate their semantic\nsimilarity. The study explores whether there are consistent drawing\nrepresentations for children on the same theme, and attempts to establish a\nnorm for children's scientific drawings, providing a baseline reference for\nfollow-up children's drawing research. The results show that the representation\nof most drawings has consistency, manifested as most semantic similarity\ngreater than 0.8. At the same time, it was found that the consistency of the\nrepresentation is independent of the accuracy (of LLM's recognition),\nindicating the existence of consistency bias. In the subsequent exploration of\ninfluencing factors, we used Kendall rank correlation coefficient to\ninvestigate the effects of Sample Size, Abstract Degree, and Focus Points on\ndrawings, and used word frequency statistics to explore whether children\nrepresented abstract themes/concepts by reproducing what was taught in class.",

                    "value": "The use of children's drawings to examining their conceptual understanding\nhas been proven to be an effective method, but there are two major problems\nwith previous research: 1. The content of the drawings heavily relies on the\ntask, and the ecological validity of the conclusions is low; 2. The\ninterpretation of drawings relies too much on the subjective feelings of the\nresearchers. To address this issue, this study uses the Large Language Model\n(LLM) to identify 1420 children's scientific drawings (covering 9 scientific\nthemes/concepts), and uses the word2vec algorithm to calculate their semantic\nsimilarity. The study explores whether there are consistent drawing\nrepresentations for children on the same theme, and attempts to establish a\nnorm for children's scientific drawings, providing a baseline reference for\nfollow-up children's drawing research. The results show that the representation\nof most drawings has consistency, manifested as most semantic similarity\ngreater than 0.8. At the same time, it was found that the consistency of the\nrepresentation is independent of the accuracy (of LLM's recognition),\nindicating the existence of consistency bias. In the subsequent exploration of\ninfluencing factors, we used Kendall rank correlation coefficient to\ninvestigate the effects of Sample Size, Abstract Degree, and Focus Points on\ndrawings, and used word frequency statistics to explore whether children\nrepresented abstract themes/concepts by reproducing what was taught in class."
