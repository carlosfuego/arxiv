To address this, we propose a\ntraining-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight\nis to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has\nbeen overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into\nmulti-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree\nstructure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal\ndimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token\nreduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a\n2$\\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and\na 3$\\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is\nquery-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same\nvideo. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.",

In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves\nstrong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME.

However, a key bottleneck remains: existing schedulers\nfail to effectively overlap CPU-offloaded tasks with GPU execution during the\nlatency-critical, bandwidth-bound decode phase. This particularly penalizes\nreal-time, decode-heavy applications (e.g., chat, Chain-of-Thought reasoning)\nwhich are currently underserved by existing systems, especially under memory\npressure typical of edge or low-cost deployments.\n  We present APEX, a novel, profiling-informed scheduling strategy that\nmaximizes CPU-GPU parallelism during hybrid LLM inference. Unlike systems\nrelying on static rules or purely heuristic approaches, APEX dynamically\ndispatches compute across heterogeneous resources by predicting execution times\nof CPU and GPU subtasks to maximize overlap while avoiding scheduling\noverheads. We evaluate APEX on diverse workloads and GPU architectures (NVIDIA\nT4, A10), using LLaMa-2-7B and LLaMa-3.1-8B models. Compared to GPU-only\nschedulers like VLLM, APEX improves throughput by 84% - 96% on T4 and 11% - 89%\non A10 GPUs, while preserving latency. Against the best existing hybrid\nschedulers, it delivers up to 49% (T4) and 37% (A10) higher throughput in\nlong-output settings.

In this\nwork, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their\nattention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small\nsubset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively\ncontribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these\nheads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies\nhead-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on\nthis discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that\nallocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual\nscores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference\nof MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the\nparticularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual\nsemantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal\nbenchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency\ntrade-offs. Notably, SparseMM delivers 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52%\nmemory reduction during generation while maintaining performance parity on\nefficiency test.

In this\nwork, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their\nattention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small\nsubset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively\ncontribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these\nheads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies\nhead-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on\nthis discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that\nallocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual\nscores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference\nof MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the\nparticularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual\nsemantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal\nbenchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency\ntrade-offs. Notably, SparseMM delivers 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52%\nmemory reduction during generation while maintaining performance parity on\nefficiency test.

Pre-trained on 16T high-quality tokens, it supports a 256K context\nlength and is the first industry-deployed large-scale Mamba model. Our\ncomprehensive post-training strategy enhances capabilities via Supervised\nFine-Tuning (3M instructions), a novel Adaptive Long-short CoT Fusion method,\nMulti-round Deliberation Learning for iterative improvement, and a two-stage\nLarge-scale Reinforcement Learning process targeting STEM and general\ninstruction-following.

Fine-tuning LLMs with\nparameter-efficient adapters, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enables these\nmodels to efficiently adapt to downstream tasks without extensive retraining.\nDeploying fine-tuned LLMs on multi-tenant edge devices offers substantial\nbenefits, such as reduced latency, enhanced privacy, and personalized\nresponses.

This paper introduces EdgeLoRA, an efficient\nsystem for serving LLMs on edge devices in multi-tenant environments. EdgeLoRA\nincorporates three key innovations: (1) an adaptive adapter selection mechanism\nto streamline the adapter configuration process; (2) heterogeneous memory\nmanagement, leveraging intelligent adapter caching and pooling to mitigate\nmemory operation overhead; and (3) batch LoRA inference, enabling efficient\nbatch processing to significantly reduce computational latency. Comprehensive\nevaluations using the Llama3.1-8B model demonstrate that EdgeLoRA significantly\noutperforms the status quo (i.e., llama.cpp) in terms of both latency and\nthroughput. The results demonstrate that EdgeLoRA can achieve up to a 4 times\nboost in throughput. Even more impressively, it can serve several orders of\nmagnitude more adapters simultaneously. These results highlight EdgeLoRA's\npotential to transform edge deployment of LLMs in multi-tenant scenarios,\noffering a scalable and efficient solution for resource-constrained\nenvironments.",

EdgeLoRA\nincorporates three key innovations: (1) an adaptive adapter selection mechanism\nto streamline the adapter configuration process; (2) heterogeneous memory\nmanagement, leveraging intelligent adapter caching and pooling to mitigate\nmemory operation overhead; and (3) batch LoRA inference, enabling efficient\nbatch processing to significantly reduce computational latency. Comprehensive\nevaluations using the Llama3.1-8B model demonstrate that EdgeLoRA significantly\noutperforms the status quo (i.e., llama.cpp) in terms of both latency and\nthroughput. The results demonstrate that EdgeLoRA can achieve up to a 4 times\nboost in throughput. Even more impressively, it can serve several orders of\nmagnitude more adapters simultaneously. These results highlight EdgeLoRA's\npotential to transform edge deployment of LLMs in multi-tenant scenarios,\noffering a scalable and efficient solution for resource-constrained\nenvironments."

Current explicit methods, such as Opacus,\nnecessitate extensive storage for per-sample gradients, significantly inflating\nmemory requirements.

Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have emerged as a\npromising technology for realizing wave-domain signal processing, with mobile\nSIMs offering superior communication performance compared to their fixed\ncounterparts. In this paper, we investigate a novel unmanned aerial vehicle\n(UAV)-mounted SIMs (UAV-SIMs) assisted communication system within the\nlow-altitude economy (LAE) networks paradigm, where UAVs function as both base\nstations that cache SIM-processed data and mobile platforms that flexibly\ndeploy SIMs to enhance uplink communications from ground users. To maximize\nnetwork capacity, we formulate a UAV-SIM-based joint optimization problem\n(USBJOP) that comprehensively addresses three critical aspects: the association\nbetween UAV-SIMs and users, the three-dimensional positioning of UAV-SIMs, and\nthe phase shifts across multiple SIM layers. Due to the inherent non-convexity\nand NP-hardness of USBJOP, we decompose it into three sub-optimization\nproblems, \\textit{i.e.}, association between UAV-SIMs and users optimization\nproblem (AUUOP), UAV location optimization problem (ULOP), and UAV-SIM phase\nshifts optimization problem (USPSOP), and solve them using an alternating\noptimization strategy. Specifically, we transform AUUOP and ULOP into convex\nforms solvable by the CVX tool, while addressing USPSOP through a generative\nartificial intelligence (GAI)-based hybrid optimization algorithm. Simulations\ndemonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms benchmark\nschemes, achieving approximately 1.5 times higher network capacity compared to\nsuboptimal alternatives.

In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly\npreserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two\nkey operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the\nMLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs:\nlow-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and\nhigh-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second\none is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage,\nVideo-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while\nusing H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully\nutilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness.\nVideo-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and\ndirectly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L\nwith a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU,\nLongVideoBench, and VNBench.

During the\nMLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs:\nlow-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and\nhigh-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second\none is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage,\nVideo-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while\nusing H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully\nutilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness.\nVideo-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and\ndirectly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L\nwith a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU,\nLongVideoBench, and VNBench. Our experiment result shows that Video-X^2L\noutperforms existing KV-compression methods by a huge advantage while\nsubstantially saving the computation cost."

However, processing a large number of visual\ntokens and generating long-context outputs impose substantial computational\noverhead, leading to excessive demands for key-value (KV) cache. To address\nthis critical bottleneck, we propose AirCache, a novel KV cache compression\nmethod aimed at accelerating LVLMs inference. This work systematically\ninvestigates the correlations between visual and textual tokens within the\nattention mechanisms of LVLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals considerable\nredundancy in cached visual tokens, wherein strategically eliminating these\ntokens preserves model performance while significantly accelerating context\ngeneration. Inspired by these findings, we introduce an elite observation\nwindow for assessing the importance of visual components in the KV cache,\nfocusing on stable inter-modal relevancy modeling with enhanced\nmulti-perspective consistency. Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise\nbudget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of\ntoken importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to\nuniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the\nfull cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing\ndecoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of\ninputs.

In a recent study, differences of up to a factor\nof 2 were found between the predicted survival of floating and adherent cells.\nThe present work aims to quantify the biases introduced by the simulation setup\nand the use of voxelized geometry in conjunction with the local effect model\nfor cell survival. The results show that simulated irradiation of a cell near\nthe surface with an incident beam matched to the cell dimensions results in\ndose values that are by a factor of about 50 lower than the dose to cells\ndeeper in the medium when irradiated with a Co-60 spectrum and lateral beam\ndimensions in the centimeter range. Furthermore, the number of ionizing photon\ninteractions in gold nanoparticles in a cell near the surface is lower by a\nfactor of about 2 than for cells at 5 mm and 1 cm depth. Using the average dose\nin voxels of size in the order of 200 nm for assessing cell survival with the\nlocal effect model (LEM) leads to an underestimation of the number of lesions\nfrom a single ionized AuNP by roughly two orders of magnitude and thus to an\noverestimation of cell survival. The effect of cell geometry on the survival\nrate was examined for approximate cell geometries and 100 kV x-ray irradiation,\nfor which the probability of photon interaction in gold nanoparticles is by\nmore than two orders of magnitude higher than for Co-60 irradiation. The\nresults show that the effects are negligible for 5 nm nanoparticles at the\nconcentration of AuNPs considered in preceding work. For 50 nm nanoparticles\nand thus a thousand times higher mass fraction of gold, significant reduction\nin cell survival is found, with a clear additional reduction predicted by the\nLEM as compared to the prediction based on mean dose to the nucleus.",

We propose CronusVLA, a unified framework that extends\nsingle-frame VLA models to the multi-frame paradigm through an efficient\npost-training stage. CronusVLA comprises three key components: (1) single-frame\npretraining on large-scale embodied datasets with autoregressive action tokens\nprediction, which establishes an embodied vision-language foundation; (2)\nmulti-frame encoding, adapting the prediction of vision-language backbones from\ndiscrete action tokens to motion features during post-training, and aggregating\nmotion features from historical frames into a feature chunking; (3) cross-frame\ndecoding, which maps the feature chunking to accurate actions via a shared\ndecoder with cross-attention. By reducing redundant token computation and\ncaching past motion features, CronusVLA achieves efficient inference. As an\napplication of motion features, we further propose an action adaptation\nmechanism based on feature-action retrieval to improve model performance during\nfinetuning.

We observe that quantizing\nthe KV cache of different tokens has varying impacts on the quality of\nattention outputs. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we perform\nforward error propagation analysis on attention and propose the Anchor Score\n(AnS) that quantifies the sensitivity of each token's KV cache to\nquantization-induced error. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in AnS\nacross tokens, suggesting that preserving a small subset with full precision\n(FP16) of high-AnS tokens can greatly mitigate accuracy loss in aggressive\nquantization scenarios. Based on this insight, we introduce AnTKV, a novel\nframework that leverages Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization to compress the\nKV cache. Furthermore, to support efficient deployment, we design and develop a\ntriton kernel that is fully compatible with FlashAttention, enabling fast\nonline Anchor Token selection. AnTKV enables LLaMA-3-8B to handle context\nlengths up to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100 GPU, while achieving up to 3.5x\nhigher decoding throughput compared to the FP16 baseline. Our experiment\nresults demonstrate that AnTKV matches or outperforms prior works such as KIVI,\nSKVQ, KVQuant, and CQ under 4-bit settings. More importantly, AnTKV achieves\nsignificantly lower perplexity under ultra-low-bit quantization on Mistral-7B,\nwith only 6.32 at 1-bit and 8.87 at 0.375-bit, compared to the FP16 baseline of\n4.73.",

Our key insight\nis to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has\nbeen overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into\nmulti-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree\nstructure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal\ndimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token\nreduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a\n2$\\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and\na 3$\\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is\nquery-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same\nvideo. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.",

To address this, we introduce\nMedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable\nassessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging\nquestions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted\nstep-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel\nevaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge\nmechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while\nmaintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong\npositive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve\nstate-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can\nsurpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3).

Towards a fundamental understanding\nof the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate\nthe root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments,\nis that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently,\nthey often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts,\nas well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against\nalternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge\nthe intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder\nthan verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator.\nTaken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can\nsubstantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.",

Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments,\nis that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently,\nthey often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts,\nas well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against\nalternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge\nthe intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder\nthan verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator.\nTaken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can\nsubstantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models."

This paper presents a systematic\nanalysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these\ncore alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two\ndistinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness\nundermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution\nreduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts\nin token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between\nalignment objectives.\n  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an\ninference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore\nalignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in\nexpected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically\ndemonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers\nor surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited\nresponse diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation\nsacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,\nensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR\nsuccessfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while\nmaintaining strong watermark detectability.

While traditional\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) fails to generate coherent reasoning paths in\ncross-view settings, sparse-reward Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from\ninefficient exploration and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we\npropose STAR-R1, a novel framework that integrates a single-stage RL paradigm\nwith a fine-grained reward mechanism tailored for TVR. Specifically, STAR-R1\nrewards partial correctness while penalizing excessive enumeration and passive\ninaction, enabling efficient exploration and precise reasoning. Comprehensive\nevaluations demonstrate that STAR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance\nacross all 11 metrics, outperforming SFT by 23% in cross-view scenarios.\nFurther analysis reveals STAR-R1's anthropomorphic behavior and highlights its\nunique ability to compare all objects for improving spatial reasoning.

                "summary": "Logical rule learning, a prominent category of knowledge graph (KG) reasoning\nmethods, constitutes a critical research area aimed at learning explicit rules\nfrom observed facts to infer missing knowledge. However, like all KG reasoning\nmethods, rule learning suffers from a critical weakness-its dependence on the\nI.I.D. assumption. This assumption can easily be violated due to selection bias\nduring training or agnostic distribution shifts during testing (e.g., as in\nquery shift scenarios), ultimately undermining model performance and\nreliability. To enable robust KG reasoning in wild environments, this study\ninvestigates logical rule learning in the presence of agnostic test-time\ndistribution shifts. We formally define this challenge as out-of-distribution\n(OOD) KG reasoning-a previously underexplored problem, and propose the Stable\nRule Learning (StableRule) framework as a solution.

                    "value": "Logical rule learning, a prominent category of knowledge graph (KG) reasoning\nmethods, constitutes a critical research area aimed at learning explicit rules\nfrom observed facts to infer missing knowledge. However, like all KG reasoning\nmethods, rule learning suffers from a critical weakness-its dependence on the\nI.I.D. assumption. This assumption can easily be violated due to selection bias\nduring training or agnostic distribution shifts during testing (e.g., as in\nquery shift scenarios), ultimately undermining model performance and\nreliability. To enable robust KG reasoning in wild environments, this study\ninvestigates logical rule learning in the presence of agnostic test-time\ndistribution shifts. We formally define this challenge as out-of-distribution\n(OOD) KG reasoning-a previously underexplored problem, and propose the Stable\nRule Learning (StableRule) framework as a solution.

DTECT provides a unified workflow that supports data preprocessing,\nmultiple model architectures, and dedicated evaluation metrics to analyze the\ntopic quality of temporal topic models. It significantly enhances\ninterpretability by introducing LLM-driven automatic topic labeling, trend\nanalysis via temporally salient words, interactive visualizations with\ndocument-level summarization, and a natural language chat interface for\nintuitive data querying. By integrating these features into a single, cohesive\nplatform, DTECT empowers users to more effectively track and understand\nthematic dynamics.

This automated framework paves the way for broader\napplication of LLMs in computational structural biology, offering a robust and\nadaptable platform for future developments in simulation automation."

We systematically evaluate model performances (i.e., accuracy,\nmemory I/O and bit operations) across seven diverse datasets from the open ASR\nleaderboard, analyzing the impact of quantization and various configurations on\nboth weights and activations.

The strong performance of Skywork-R1V3 primarily\nstems from our elaborate post-training RL framework, which effectively\nactivates and enhances the model's reasoning ability, without the need for\nadditional continue pre-training. Through this framework, we further uncover\nthe fundamental role of the connector module in achieving robust cross-modal\nalignment for multimodal reasoning models. In addition, we introduce a unique\nindicator of reasoning capability, the entropy of critical reasoning tokens,\nwhich has proven highly effective for checkpoint selection during RL training.\nSkywork-R1V3 achieves state-of-the-art results on MMMU, significantly improving\nfrom 64.3% to 76.0%. This performance matches entry-level human capabilities.\nRemarkably, our RL-powered post-training approach enables even the 38B\nparameter model to rival top closed-source VLMs. The implementation\nsuccessfully transfers mathematical reasoning to other subject-related\nreasoning tasks. We also include an analysis of curriculum learning and\nreinforcement finetuning strategies, along with a broader discussion on\nmultimodal reasoning.

With a 2.4 hour period, it is known to be variable in\nboth the infrared and the radio, which has been attributed to changes in the\ncloud coverage and the presence of an aurora respectively. To quantify the\nchanges in the atmospheric state that drive this variability, we obtained\ntime-series spectra of SIMP-0136 covering one full rotation with both\nNIRSpec/PRISM and the MIRI/LRS on board JWST. We performed a series of\ntime-resolved atmospheric retrievals using petitRADTRANS in order to measure\nchanges in the temperature structure, chemistry, and cloudiness. We inferred\nthe presence of a ~250 K thermal inversion above 10 mbar of SIMP-0136 at all\nphases, and propose that this inversion is due to the deposition of energy into\nthe upper atmosphere by an aurora. Statistical tests were performed in order to\ndetermine which parameters drive the observed spectroscopic variability. The\nprimary contribution was due to changes in the temperature profile at pressures\ndeeper than 10 mbar, which resulted in variation of the effective temperature\nfrom 1243 K to 1248 K. This changing effective temperature was also correlated\nto observed changes in the abundances of CO2 and H2S, while all other chemical\nspecies were consistent with being homogeneous throughout the atmosphere.\nPatchy silicate clouds were required to fit the observed spectra, but the cloud\nproperties were not found to systematically vary with longitude.

It pioneers an innovative dual\nlens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional\nontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary\nbreakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such\nas contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional\nlimitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence\nreasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning\nformalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text\nprocessing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical\ninnovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts\narchitectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical\nchallenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation\ndifficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that\nmaps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin\nargumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval,\nprediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including\nlow-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal\nhandling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for\nresearchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the\nalgorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal\nartificial intelligence. We have created a GitHub repository to index the\nrelevant papers: https://github.com/Kilimajaro/LLMs_Meet_Law.",

Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such\nas contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional\nlimitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence\nreasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning\nformalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text\nprocessing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical\ninnovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts\narchitectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical\nchallenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation\ndifficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that\nmaps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin\nargumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval,\nprediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including\nlow-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal\nhandling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for\nresearchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the\nalgorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal\nartificial intelligence. We have created a GitHub repository to index the\nrelevant papers: https://github.com/Kilimajaro/LLMs_Meet_Law."

Existing\ndeblurring methods face significant challenges in addressing this problem due\nto their inefficient allocation of computational resources and inadequate\nhandling of spatially varying blur patterns. To overcome these limitations, we\nfirst propose a trainable mask predictor that identifies blurred regions in the\nimage. During training, we employ blur masks to exclude sharp regions. For\ninference optimization, we implement structural reparameterization by\nconverting $3\\times 3$ convolutions to computationally efficient $1\\times 1$\nconvolutions, enabling pixel-level pruning of sharp areas to reduce\ncomputation. Second, we develop an intra-frame motion analyzer that translates\nrelative pixel displacements into motion trajectories, establishing adaptive\nguidance for region-specific blur restoration. Our method is trained end-to-end\nusing a combination of reconstruction loss, reblur loss, and mask loss guided\nby annotated blur masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance\nover state-of-the-art methods on both local and global blur datasets while\nreducing FLOPs by 49\\% compared to SOTA models (e.g., LMD-ViT).

Existing\ndeblurring methods face significant challenges in addressing this problem due\nto their inefficient allocation of computational resources and inadequate\nhandling of spatially varying blur patterns. To overcome these limitations, we\nfirst propose a trainable mask predictor that identifies blurred regions in the\nimage. During training, we employ blur masks to exclude sharp regions. For\ninference optimization, we implement structural reparameterization by\nconverting $3\\times 3$ convolutions to computationally efficient $1\\times 1$\nconvolutions, enabling pixel-level pruning of sharp areas to reduce\ncomputation. Second, we develop an intra-frame motion analyzer that translates\nrelative pixel displacements into motion trajectories, establishing adaptive\nguidance for region-specific blur restoration. Our method is trained end-to-end\nusing a combination of reconstruction loss, reblur loss, and mask loss guided\nby annotated blur masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance\nover state-of-the-art methods on both local and global blur datasets while\nreducing FLOPs by 49\\% compared to SOTA models (e.g., LMD-ViT).

However, deploying LLMs also presents diverse ethical challenges,\nand their mitigation strategies remain complex and domain-dependent.\n[Objective] This paper aims to identify and categorize the key ethical concerns\nassociated with using LLMs, examine existing mitigation strategies, and assess\nthe outstanding challenges in implementing these strategies across various\ndomains.

We verify this\nrelationship by using both experiments and simulations for different power-law\nfluids. As the predictions are independent from flow-specific details, this\napproach provides a robust tool for inferring rheological properties from the\nspreading dynamics."

                "summary": "When large language model (LLM) systems interact with external data to\nperform complex tasks, a new attack, namely prompt injection, becomes a\nsignificant threat. By injecting instructions into the data accessed by the\nsystem, the attacker is able to override the initial user task with an\narbitrary task directed by the attacker. To secure the system, test-time\ndefenses, e.g., defensive prompting, have been proposed for system developers\nto attain security only when needed in a flexible manner. However, they are\nmuch less effective than training-time defenses that change the model\nparameters. Motivated by this, we propose DefensiveToken, a test-time defense\nwith prompt injection robustness comparable to training-time alternatives.\nDefensiveTokens are newly inserted as special tokens, whose embeddings are\noptimized for security. In security-sensitive cases, system developers can\nappend a few DefensiveTokens before the LLM input to achieve security with a\nminimal utility drop. In scenarios where security is less of a concern,\ndevelopers can simply skip DefensiveTokens; the LLM system remains the same as\nthere is no defense, generating high-quality responses.

                    "value": "When large language model (LLM) systems interact with external data to\nperform complex tasks, a new attack, namely prompt injection, becomes a\nsignificant threat. By injecting instructions into the data accessed by the\nsystem, the attacker is able to override the initial user task with an\narbitrary task directed by the attacker. To secure the system, test-time\ndefenses, e.g., defensive prompting, have been proposed for system developers\nto attain security only when needed in a flexible manner. However, they are\nmuch less effective than training-time defenses that change the model\nparameters. Motivated by this, we propose DefensiveToken, a test-time defense\nwith prompt injection robustness comparable to training-time alternatives.\nDefensiveTokens are newly inserted as special tokens, whose embeddings are\noptimized for security. In security-sensitive cases, system developers can\nappend a few DefensiveTokens before the LLM input to achieve security with a\nminimal utility drop. In scenarios where security is less of a concern,\ndevelopers can simply skip DefensiveTokens; the LLM system remains the same as\nthere is no defense, generating high-quality responses. Thus, DefensiveTokens,\nif released alongside the model, allow a flexible switch between the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) utility and almost-SOTA security at test time.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel multi-agent framework XpandA (Expand-Agent) coupled with\nquestion-driven workflow and dynamic partitioning for robust long-context\nprocessing. XpandA overcomes these limitations through: 1) dynamic partitioning\nof long texts, which adaptively modulates the filling rate of context windows\nfor input sequences of vastly varying lengths; 2) question-guided protocol to\nupdate flat information ensembles within centralized shared memory,\nconstructing consistent inter-agent knowledge across partitions; and 3)\nselectively replaying specific partitions based on the state-tracking of\nquestion-information couples to promote the resolution of inverted-order\nstructures across partitions (e.g., flashbacks). We perform a comprehensive\nevaluation of XpandA on multiple long-context benchmarks with length varying\nfrom 1k to 1M, demonstrating XpandA's feasibility for processing ultra-long\nsequences and its significant effectiveness in enhancing the long-context\ncapabilities of various LLMs by achieving 20\\% improvements and 1.5x inference\nspeedup over baselines of full-context, RAG and previous agent-based methods.",

XpandA overcomes these limitations through: 1) dynamic partitioning\nof long texts, which adaptively modulates the filling rate of context windows\nfor input sequences of vastly varying lengths; 2) question-guided protocol to\nupdate flat information ensembles within centralized shared memory,\nconstructing consistent inter-agent knowledge across partitions; and 3)\nselectively replaying specific partitions based on the state-tracking of\nquestion-information couples to promote the resolution of inverted-order\nstructures across partitions (e.g., flashbacks). We perform a comprehensive\nevaluation of XpandA on multiple long-context benchmarks with length varying\nfrom 1k to 1M, demonstrating XpandA's feasibility for processing ultra-long\nsequences and its significant effectiveness in enhancing the long-context\ncapabilities of various LLMs by achieving 20\\% improvements and 1.5x inference\nspeedup over baselines of full-context, RAG and previous agent-based methods."

We present\nthe Nanda Unified Architecture, a decentralized framework built around three\ncore innovations: fast DID-based agent discovery through distributed\nregistries, semantic agent cards with verifiable credentials and composability\nprofiles, and a dynamic trust layer that integrates behavioral attestations\nwith policy compliance. The system introduces X42/H42 micropayments for\neconomic coordination and MAESTRO, a security framework incorporating\nSynergetics' patented AgentTalk protocol (US Patent 12,244,584 B1) and secure\ncontainerization. Real-world deployments demonstrate 99.9 percent compliance in\nhealthcare applications and substantial monthly transaction volumes with strong\nprivacy guarantees.

                    "value": "The fragmentation of AI agent ecosystems has created urgent demands for\ninteroperability, trust, and economic coordination that current protocols --\nincluding MCP (Hou et al., 2025), A2A (Habler et al., 2025), ACP (Liu et al.,\n2025), and Cisco's AGP (Edwards, 2025) -- cannot address at scale. We present\nthe Nanda Unified Architecture, a decentralized framework built around three\ncore innovations: fast DID-based agent discovery through distributed\nregistries, semantic agent cards with verifiable credentials and composability\nprofiles, and a dynamic trust layer that integrates behavioral attestations\nwith policy compliance. The system introduces X42/H42 micropayments for\neconomic coordination and MAESTRO, a security framework incorporating\nSynergetics' patented AgentTalk protocol (US Patent 12,244,584 B1) and secure\ncontainerization. Real-world deployments demonstrate 99.9 percent compliance in\nhealthcare applications and substantial monthly transaction volumes with strong\nprivacy guarantees.

                "summary": "Recent studies show large language models (LLMs) and vision language models\n(VLMs) trained using web-scale data can empower end-to-end autonomous driving\nsystems for a better generalization and interpretation. Specifically, by\ndynamically routing inputs to specialized subsets of parameters, the\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique enables general LLMs or VLMs to achieve\nsubstantial performance improvements while maintaining computational\nefficiency. However, general MoE models usually demands extensive training data\nand complex optimization. In this work, inspired by the learning process of\nhuman drivers, we propose a skill-oriented MoE, called MoSE, which mimics human\ndrivers' learning process and reasoning process, skill-by-skill and\nstep-by-step. We propose a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with\ndefining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the\nnecessary driving competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks,\nthereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. Further align the driving process\nto multi-step planning in human reasoning and end-to-end driving models, we\nbuild a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the\nmodel to think step-by-step.

                    "value": "Recent studies show large language models (LLMs) and vision language models\n(VLMs) trained using web-scale data can empower end-to-end autonomous driving\nsystems for a better generalization and interpretation. Specifically, by\ndynamically routing inputs to specialized subsets of parameters, the\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique enables general LLMs or VLMs to achieve\nsubstantial performance improvements while maintaining computational\nefficiency. However, general MoE models usually demands extensive training data\nand complex optimization. In this work, inspired by the learning process of\nhuman drivers, we propose a skill-oriented MoE, called MoSE, which mimics human\ndrivers' learning process and reasoning process, skill-by-skill and\nstep-by-step. We propose a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with\ndefining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the\nnecessary driving competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks,\nthereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. Further align the driving process\nto multi-step planning in human reasoning and end-to-end driving models, we\nbuild a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the\nmodel to think step-by-step. Unlike multi-round dialogs, MoSE integrates\nvaluable auxiliary tasks (e.g.\\ description, reasoning, planning) in one single\nforward process without introducing any extra computational cost.

As part of this\nupgrade, scintillator detectors are added to the existing water-Cherenkov\nsurface detector stations. By making use of the differences in detector\nresponse to the electromagnetic particles and muons between scintillator and\nwater-Cherenkov detectors, the electromagnetic and muonic components of\ncosmic-ray air showers can be disentangled. Since the muonic component is\nsensitive to the primary mass, such combination of detectors provides a\npowerful way to improve primary mass composition measurements over the original\nAuger surface detector design. In this paper, the so-called Scintillator\nSurface Detectors are discussed, including their design characteristics,\nproduction process, testing procedure and deployment in the field.",

                    "value": "Data collected so far by the Pierre Auger Observatory have enabled major\nadvances in ultra-high energy cosmic ray physics and demonstrated that improved\ndetermination of masses of primary cosmic-ray particles, preferably on an\nevent-by-event basis, is necessary for understanding their origin and nature.\nImprovement in primary mass measurements was the main motivation for the\nupgrade of the Pierre Auger Observatory, called AugerPrime. As part of this\nupgrade, scintillator detectors are added to the existing water-Cherenkov\nsurface detector stations. By making use of the differences in detector\nresponse to the electromagnetic particles and muons between scintillator and\nwater-Cherenkov detectors, the electromagnetic and muonic components of\ncosmic-ray air showers can be disentangled. Since the muonic component is\nsensitive to the primary mass, such combination of detectors provides a\npowerful way to improve primary mass composition measurements over the original\nAuger surface detector design. In this paper, the so-called Scintillator\nSurface Detectors are discussed, including their design characteristics,\nproduction process, testing procedure and deployment in the field."

Evaluating\nthese threats is particularly challenging due to the evolving nature of LLMs\nand the sophistication required in effectively probing their vulnerabilities.\nCurrent benchmarks and evaluation methods struggle to fully address these\nchallenges, leaving gaps in the assessment of LLM vulnerabilities. In this\npaper, we review existing jailbreak evaluation practices and identify three\nassumed desiderata for an effective jailbreak evaluation protocol. To address\nthese challenges, we introduce GuardVal, a new evaluation protocol that\ndynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's\nstate, providing a more accurate assessment of defender LLMs' capacity to\nhandle safety-critical situations. Moreover, we propose a new optimization\nmethod that prevents stagnation during prompt refinement, ensuring the\ngeneration of increasingly effective jailbreak prompts that expose deeper\nweaknesses in the defender LLMs. We apply this protocol to a diverse set of\nmodels, from Mistral-7b to GPT-4, across 10 safety domains. Our findings\nhighlight distinct behavioral patterns among the models, offering a\ncomprehensive view of their robustness. Furthermore, our evaluation process\ndeepens the understanding of LLM behavior, leading to insights that can inform\nfuture research and drive the development of more secure models.",

RED harmonizes\nvisual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and\nrationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that\nRED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and\nother decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a\npractical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy\nof CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded\nmulti-modal systems.",

While CoT is\nassumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a\nkey challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales\nin CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as\na KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional\nlog-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding\n(RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes\nvisual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and\nrationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that\nRED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and\nother decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a\npractical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy\nof CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded\nmulti-modal systems."

Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial\nLLMs show that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to\nsimulate physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, or generalize under\nlayout perturbation. PlanQA uncovers a clear blind spot in today's LLMs: they\ndo not consistently reason about real-world layouts.

On one hand, these\nsystems can enhance personalization and appeal through dynamic explanations and\nmulti-turn dialogues. On the other hand, they might venture into unknown\nterritory-hallucinating nonexistent items, amplifying bias, or leaking private\ninformation. Traditional accuracy metrics cannot fully capture these\nchallenges, as they fail to measure factual correctness, content safety, or\nalignment with user intent.\n  This paper makes two main contributions. First, we categorize the evaluation\nchallenges of Gen-RecSys into two groups: (i) existing concerns that are\nexacerbated by generative outputs (e.g., bias, privacy) and (ii) entirely new\nrisks (e.g., item hallucinations, contradictory explanations). Second, we\npropose a holistic evaluation approach that includes scenario-based assessments\nand multi-metric checks-incorporating relevance, factual grounding, bias\ndetection, and policy compliance. Our goal is to provide a guiding framework so\nresearchers and practitioners can thoroughly assess Gen-RecSys, ensuring\neffective personalization and responsible deployment.",

                    "value": "Recommender systems powered by generative models (Gen-RecSys) extend beyond\nclassical item ranking by producing open-ended content, which simultaneously\nunlocks richer user experiences and introduces new risks. On one hand, these\nsystems can enhance personalization and appeal through dynamic explanations and\nmulti-turn dialogues. On the other hand, they might venture into unknown\nterritory-hallucinating nonexistent items, amplifying bias, or leaking private\ninformation. Traditional accuracy metrics cannot fully capture these\nchallenges, as they fail to measure factual correctness, content safety, or\nalignment with user intent.\n  This paper makes two main contributions. First, we categorize the evaluation\nchallenges of Gen-RecSys into two groups: (i) existing concerns that are\nexacerbated by generative outputs (e.g., bias, privacy) and (ii) entirely new\nrisks (e.g., item hallucinations, contradictory explanations). Second, we\npropose a holistic evaluation approach that includes scenario-based assessments\nand multi-metric checks-incorporating relevance, factual grounding, bias\ndetection, and policy compliance. Our goal is to provide a guiding framework so\nresearchers and practitioners can thoroughly assess Gen-RecSys, ensuring\neffective personalization and responsible deployment."

To address these issues, we propose the\nlearnable Retrieval Enhanced Visual-Text Alignment and Fusion (REVTAF)\nframework, which effectively tackles both class imbalance and visual-text\nfusion in report generation. REVTAF incorporates two core components: (1) a\nLearnable Retrieval Enhancer (LRE) that utilizes semantic hierarchies from\nhyperbolic space and intra-batch context through a ranking-based metric. LRE\nadaptively retrieves the most relevant reference reports, enhancing image\nrepresentations, particularly for underrepresented (tail) class inputs; and (2)\na fine-grained visual-text alignment and fusion strategy that ensures\nconsistency across multi-source cross-attention maps for precise alignment.\nThis component further employs an optimal transport-based cross-attention\nmechanism to dynamically integrate task-relevant textual knowledge for improved\nreport generation. By combining adaptive retrieval with multi-source alignment\nand fusion, REVTAF achieves fine-grained visual-text integration under weak\nimage-report level supervision while effectively mitigating data imbalance\nissues. The experiments demonstrate that REVTAF outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving an average improvement of 7.4% on the MIMIC-CXR dataset and\n2.9% on the IU X-Ray dataset.

These guidelines cover all the necessary steps\nfor ML development, from data acquisition to model deployment. Additionally,\nthe present perspective provides practical resources for the implementation of\nthe outlined guidelines. These recommendations are also intended to support\neditors and scientific journals in enforcing good practices in ML-based protein\nengineering publications, promoting high standards across the community.

This perspective presents the\nelements necessary to develop effective, reliable, and reproducible ML models,\nand a set of guidelines for ML developments for protein engineering. This\nincludes a critical discussion of software engineering good practices for\ndevelopment and evaluation of ML-based protein engineering projects,\nemphasizing supervised learning. These guidelines cover all the necessary steps\nfor ML development, from data acquisition to model deployment. Additionally,\nthe present perspective provides practical resources for the implementation of\nthe outlined guidelines. These recommendations are also intended to support\neditors and scientific journals in enforcing good practices in ML-based protein\nengineering publications, promoting high standards across the community. With\nthis, the aim is to further contribute to improved ML transparency and\ncredibility by easing the adoption of software engineering best practices into\nML development for protein engineering. We envision that the wide adoption and\ncontinuous update of best practices will encourage informed use of ML on\nreal-world problems related to protein engineering."

Existing RAG solutions do not\nfocus on queries that may require fetching multiple documents with\nsubstantially different contents. Such queries occur frequently, but are\nchallenging because the embeddings of these documents may be distant in the\nembedding space, making it hard to retrieve them all. This paper introduces\nMulti-Head RAG (MRAG), a novel scheme designed to address this gap with a\nsimple yet powerful idea: leveraging activations of Transformer's multi-head\nattention layer, instead of the decoder layer, as keys for fetching\nmulti-aspect documents. The driving observation is that different attention\nheads learn to capture different data aspects. Harnessing the corresponding\nactivations results in embeddings that represent various facets of data items\nand queries, improving the retrieval accuracy for complex queries. We provide\nan evaluation methodology and metrics, multi-aspect datasets, and real-world\nuse cases to demonstrate MRAG's effectiveness. We show MRAG's design advantages\nover 18 RAG baselines, empirical improvements of up to 20% in retrieval success\nratios, and benefits for downstream LLM generation. MRAG can be seamlessly\nintegrated with existing RAG frameworks and benchmarks.",

We show that LLMs, when paired with carefully designed prompts, can\nmatch or outperform fine-tuned smaller language models (SLMs), particularly in\nnoisy or low-quality data settings. Despite experimenting with advanced prompt\nengineering techniques, such as debating LLMs and various example selection\nstrategies, we found limited benefit beyond well-crafted standard few-shot\nprompts. Our system achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the\nCheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic\nand Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual\ntracks. Notably, our method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset,\nlikely due to its resilience to annotation inconsistencies. These findings\nhighlight the effectiveness and adaptability of LLM-based few-shot learning for\nmultilingual sentiment tasks, offering a strong alternative to traditional\nfine-tuning, particularly when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent.",

Despite experimenting with advanced prompt\nengineering techniques, such as debating LLMs and various example selection\nstrategies, we found limited benefit beyond well-crafted standard few-shot\nprompts. Our system achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the\nCheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic\nand Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual\ntracks. Notably, our method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset,\nlikely due to its resilience to annotation inconsistencies. These findings\nhighlight the effectiveness and adaptability of LLM-based few-shot learning for\nmultilingual sentiment tasks, offering a strong alternative to traditional\nfine-tuning, particularly when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent."

Recent studies have typically focused on fusing\ncross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models.\nHowever, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high\nmemory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired\nby the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we\nexplore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction.

This is primarily due to\nspatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden\nstate updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for\nefficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear\ncomplexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to\nheterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a\ndomain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation\nspace into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and\nindependent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain\ndiscriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as\ndomain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate\nthe alignment of cross-domain commonalities.
