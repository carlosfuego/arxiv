To address these\nchallenges, xLLM builds a novel decoupled service-engine architecture. At the\nservice layer, xLLM-Service features an intelligent scheduling module that\nefficiently processes multimodal requests and co-locates online and offline\ntasks through unified elastic scheduling to maximize cluster utilization. This\nmodule also relies on a workload-adaptive dynamic Prefill-Decode (PD)\ndisaggregation policy and a novel Encode-Prefill-Decode (EPD) disaggregation\npolicy designed for multimodal inputs. Furthermore, it incorporates a\ndistributed architecture to provide global KV Cache management and robust\nfault-tolerant capabilities for high availability. At the engine layer,\nxLLM-Engine co-optimizes system and algorithm designs to fully saturate\ncomputing resources. This is achieved through comprehensive multi-layer\nexecution pipeline optimizations, an adaptive graph mode and an xTensor memory\nmanagement. xLLM-Engine also further integrates algorithmic enhancements such\nas optimized speculative decoding and dynamic EPLB, collectively serving to\nsubstantially boost throughput and inference efficiency. Extensive evaluations\ndemonstrate that xLLM delivers significantly superior performance and resource\nefficiency. Under identical TPOT constraints, xLLM achieves throughput up to\n1.7x that of MindIE and 2.2x that of vLLM-Ascend with Qwen-series models, while\nmaintaining an average throughput of 1.7x that of MindIE with Deepseek-series\nmodels. xLLM framework is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/jd-opensource/xllm and\nhttps://github.com/jd-opensource/xllm-service.",

At the\nservice layer, xLLM-Service features an intelligent scheduling module that\nefficiently processes multimodal requests and co-locates online and offline\ntasks through unified elastic scheduling to maximize cluster utilization. This\nmodule also relies on a workload-adaptive dynamic Prefill-Decode (PD)\ndisaggregation policy and a novel Encode-Prefill-Decode (EPD) disaggregation\npolicy designed for multimodal inputs. Furthermore, it incorporates a\ndistributed architecture to provide global KV Cache management and robust\nfault-tolerant capabilities for high availability. At the engine layer,\nxLLM-Engine co-optimizes system and algorithm designs to fully saturate\ncomputing resources. This is achieved through comprehensive multi-layer\nexecution pipeline optimizations, an adaptive graph mode and an xTensor memory\nmanagement. xLLM-Engine also further integrates algorithmic enhancements such\nas optimized speculative decoding and dynamic EPLB, collectively serving to\nsubstantially boost throughput and inference efficiency. Extensive evaluations\ndemonstrate that xLLM delivers significantly superior performance and resource\nefficiency. Under identical TPOT constraints, xLLM achieves throughput up to\n1.7x that of MindIE and 2.2x that of vLLM-Ascend with Qwen-series models, while\nmaintaining an average throughput of 1.7x that of MindIE with Deepseek-series\nmodels. xLLM framework is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/jd-opensource/xllm and\nhttps://github.com/jd-opensource/xllm-service."

However, current disaggregated\nsystems face three key limitations: (i) static resource allocation cannot adapt\nto highly dynamic workloads, causing over-provisioning that wastes resources or\nunder-provisioning that violates service level objectives (SLOs); (ii) inherent\nload imbalance between prefill and decode stages, where prefill is\ncompute-bound and decode is memory-bound, causes under-utilization in one tier\nwhile the other becomes a bottleneck; and (iii) prefix cache aware routing\nskews load distribution, as high cache hit rate prefill nodes attract\ndisproportionately more requests, further degrading balance and efficiency. To\naddress these issues, we present BanaServe, a dynamic orchestration framework\nthat continuously rebalances computational and memory resources across prefill\nand decode instances while eliminating hotspots induced by cache. BanaServe\nintroduces layer level weight migration, attention level Key Value Cache (KV\nCache) migration, and Global KV Cache Store sharing with layer wise overlapped\ntransmission, enabling both coarse grained (layer level) and fine grained\n(attention level) load redistribution with minimal latency overhead. These\nmechanisms allow routers to perform purely load aware scheduling, unconstrained\nby cache placement. Compared to vLLM, BanaServe achieves 1.2x-3.9x higher\nthroughput with 3.9%-78.4% lower total processing time, and outperforms\nDistServe by 1.1x-2.8x in throughput with 1.4%-70.1% latency reduction.",

However, current disaggregated\nsystems face three key limitations: (i) static resource allocation cannot adapt\nto highly dynamic workloads, causing over-provisioning that wastes resources or\nunder-provisioning that violates service level objectives (SLOs); (ii) inherent\nload imbalance between prefill and decode stages, where prefill is\ncompute-bound and decode is memory-bound, causes under-utilization in one tier\nwhile the other becomes a bottleneck; and (iii) prefix cache aware routing\nskews load distribution, as high cache hit rate prefill nodes attract\ndisproportionately more requests, further degrading balance and efficiency. To\naddress these issues, we present BanaServe, a dynamic orchestration framework\nthat continuously rebalances computational and memory resources across prefill\nand decode instances while eliminating hotspots induced by cache. BanaServe\nintroduces layer level weight migration, attention level Key Value Cache (KV\nCache) migration, and Global KV Cache Store sharing with layer wise overlapped\ntransmission, enabling both coarse grained (layer level) and fine grained\n(attention level) load redistribution with minimal latency overhead. These\nmechanisms allow routers to perform purely load aware scheduling, unconstrained\nby cache placement. Compared to vLLM, BanaServe achieves 1.2x-3.9x higher\nthroughput with 3.9%-78.4% lower total processing time, and outperforms\nDistServe by 1.1x-2.8x in throughput with 1.4%-70.1% latency reduction."

Dodoor leverages advanced\nresearch on the weighted balls-into-bins model with b-batched setting. Unlike\nother decentralized schedulers that rely on real-time probing of remote\nservers, Dodoor makes scheduling decisions based on cached server information,\nwhich is updated in batches, to reduce communication overheads. To schedule\ntasks with dynamic, multidimensional resource requirements in heterogeneous\ncluster, Dodoor uses a novel load score to measure servers' loads for each\nscheduled task. This score captures the anti-affinity between servers and tasks\nin contrast to the commonly used heuristic of counting pending tasks to balance\nload. On a 101-node heterogeneous cluster, Dodoor is evaluated using two\nworkloads: (i) simulated Azure virtual machines placements and (ii) real\nserverless Python functions executions in Docker. The evaluation shows that\nDodoor reduces scheduling messages by 55--66% on both workloads. Dodoor can\nalso increase throughput by up to 33.2% and 21.5%, reduce mean makespan latency\nby 12.1% and 7.2%, and improve tail latency by 21.9% and 24.6% across the two\nworkloads.",

Despite being a highly parallel algorithm, it was previously believed\nto be unsuitable for GPU computation because it is memory bandwidth-bound.\nRecent developments in GPU hardware, including larger L1 memory per Streaming\nMultiprocessor/Compute Unit, have changed that. We present the first GPU\nalgorithm for reducing a banded matrix to bidiagonal form as part of the\nNextLA$.$jl open-source software package. Our algorithm is based on previous\nCPU-based multicore parallel cache-efficient bulge chasing algorithms and\nadapted to optimize for GPU throughput.

This paper considers offloading most\nof such data structures from the costly host DRAM to secondary memory whose\nlatency is in the microsecond range, an order of magnitude longer than those of\ncurrently available DIMM-mounted or CXL memory devices. While emerging\nmicrosecond-latency memory is likely to cost much less than DRAM, it can\nsignificantly slow down SSD-based KV stores if naively employed. This paper\nanalyzes and evaluates the impact of microsecond-level memory latency on the KV\noperation throughput. Our analysis finds that a well-known latency-hiding\ntechnique of software prefetching for long-latency memory from user-level\nthreads is effective. The novelty of our analysis lies in modeling how the\ninterplay between prefetching and IO affects performance, from which we derive\nan equation that well explains the throughput degradation due to long memory\nlatency. The model tells us that the presence of IO significantly enhances the\ntolerance to memory latency, leading to a finding that SSD-based KV stores can\nbe made latency-tolerant without devising new techniques for\nmicrosecond-latency memory. To confirm this, we design a microbenchmark as well\nas modify existing SSD-based KV stores so that they issue prefetches from\nuser-level threads, and run them while placing most of in-memory data\nstructures on FPGA-based memory with adjustable microsecond latency. The\nresults demonstrate that their KV operation throughputs can be well explained\nby our model, and the modified KV stores achieve near-DRAM throughputs for up\nto a memory latency of 5 microseconds. This suggests the possibility that\nSSD-based KV stores can use microsecond-latency memory as a cost-effective\nalternative to the host DRAM.",

This paper considers offloading most\nof such data structures from the costly host DRAM to secondary memory whose\nlatency is in the microsecond range, an order of magnitude longer than those of\ncurrently available DIMM-mounted or CXL memory devices. While emerging\nmicrosecond-latency memory is likely to cost much less than DRAM, it can\nsignificantly slow down SSD-based KV stores if naively employed. This paper\nanalyzes and evaluates the impact of microsecond-level memory latency on the KV\noperation throughput. Our analysis finds that a well-known latency-hiding\ntechnique of software prefetching for long-latency memory from user-level\nthreads is effective. The novelty of our analysis lies in modeling how the\ninterplay between prefetching and IO affects performance, from which we derive\nan equation that well explains the throughput degradation due to long memory\nlatency. The model tells us that the presence of IO significantly enhances the\ntolerance to memory latency, leading to a finding that SSD-based KV stores can\nbe made latency-tolerant without devising new techniques for\nmicrosecond-latency memory. To confirm this, we design a microbenchmark as well\nas modify existing SSD-based KV stores so that they issue prefetches from\nuser-level threads, and run them while placing most of in-memory data\nstructures on FPGA-based memory with adjustable microsecond latency. The\nresults demonstrate that their KV operation throughputs can be well explained\nby our model, and the modified KV stores achieve near-DRAM throughputs for up\nto a memory latency of 5 microseconds. This suggests the possibility that\nSSD-based KV stores can use microsecond-latency memory as a cost-effective\nalternative to the host DRAM."

Long video generation presents\nchallenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing\nmodels can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to\nbidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for\nfaster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory\nchallenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based\ngeneration, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are\ncritical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in\nreal time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,\nespecially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt\ntransitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level\nAR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states\nwith new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable\nlong video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);\nand short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as\nframe sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.\nWith these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model\nto minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains\n20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both\nshort and long videos.

With the emergence of large reasoning\nmodels, efficiently handling such scenarios has become increasingly important.\nTo address this issue, we present two key observations: (1) critical KVs\nexhibit strong temporal locality during decoding, and (2) these KVs exhibit\ndistinct distribution patterns across the input prompt and generated output.\nBuilding on these observations, we propose LouisKV, an efficient KV cache\nretrieval framework designed for various long-sequence scenarios. Specifically,\nLouisKV introduces a semantic-aware retrieval strategy leveraging temporal\nlocality to trigger retrieval only at semantic boundaries, drastically reducing\ncomputation and data transfer overhead. LouisKV also designs a decoupled,\nfine-grained management scheme that tailors differentiated strategies for input\nand output sequences to create retrieval units that better match the model's\nattention patterns, enabling precise identification of critical KVs.\nFurthermore, to boost efficiency, LouisKV incorporates several kernel-level\noptimizations, including custom Triton and CUDA kernels to accelerate the KV\nclustering and retrieval.

Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models\nemerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a\nstandardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient\nand extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference\npipeline into four modular components--model, diffusion iteration manager,\ndecoding strategy, and KV-cache manager--and integrates novel algorithms for\neach component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination\nof algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial\nefficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE.

Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models\nemerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a\nstandardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient\nand extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference\npipeline into four modular components--model, diffusion iteration manager,\ndecoding strategy, and KV-cache manager--and integrates novel algorithms for\neach component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination\nof algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial\nefficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE.

On out-of-distribution evaluation using MRQA, SAC achieves\n1 EM improvement at 5x compression over strong baselines, with increasing\nadvantages at higher compression ratios."

While lightweight LLMs\nhave been developed to fit mobile environments, they suffer from degraded model\naccuracy. In contrast, sparsity-based techniques minimize DRAM usage by\nselectively transferring only relevant neurons to DRAM while retaining the full\nmodel in external storage, such as flash. However, such approaches are\ncritically limited by numerous I/O operations, particularly on smartphones with\nsevere IOPS constraints.\n  In this paper, we propose Neuralink, a novel approach that accelerates LLM\ninference on smartphones by optimizing neuron placement in flash memory.\nNeuralink leverages the concept of Neuron Co-Activation, where neurons\nfrequently activated together are linked to facilitate continuous read access\nand optimize I/O efficiency. Our approach incorporates a two-stage solution: an\noffline stage that reorganizes neuron placement based on co-activation\npatterns, and an online stage that employs tailored data access and caching\nstrategies to align well with hardware characteristics. Evaluations conducted\non a variety of smartphones and LLMs demonstrate that Neuralink achieves on\naverage $1.49\\times$ improvements in end-to-end latency compared to the\nstate-of-the-art. As the first solution to optimize storage placement under\nsparsity, Neuralink explores a new optimization space at the intersection of\nsparsity-driven algorithm and storage-level system co-design for LLM inference.",

However, such approaches are\ncritically limited by numerous I/O operations, particularly on smartphones with\nsevere IOPS constraints.\n  In this paper, we propose Neuralink, a novel approach that accelerates LLM\ninference on smartphones by optimizing neuron placement in flash memory.\nNeuralink leverages the concept of Neuron Co-Activation, where neurons\nfrequently activated together are linked to facilitate continuous read access\nand optimize I/O efficiency. Our approach incorporates a two-stage solution: an\noffline stage that reorganizes neuron placement based on co-activation\npatterns, and an online stage that employs tailored data access and caching\nstrategies to align well with hardware characteristics. Evaluations conducted\non a variety of smartphones and LLMs demonstrate that Neuralink achieves on\naverage $1.49\\times$ improvements in end-to-end latency compared to the\nstate-of-the-art. As the first solution to optimize storage placement under\nsparsity, Neuralink explores a new optimization space at the intersection of\nsparsity-driven algorithm and storage-level system co-design for LLM inference."

We present PANTHER, a hybrid generative-discriminative framework that\nunifies user behavior pretraining and downstream adaptation, enabling\nlarge-scale sequential user representation learning and real-time inference.\nPANTHER introduces: (1) Structured Tokenization to compress multi-dimensional\ntransaction attributes into an interpretable vocabulary; (2) Sequence Pattern\nRecognition Module (SPRM) for modeling periodic transaction motifs; (3) a\nUnified User-Profile Embedding that fuses static demographics with dynamic\ntransaction histories; and (4) Real-time scalability enabled by offline caching\nof pretrained embeddings for millisecond-level inference. Fully deployed and\noperational online at WeChat Pay, PANTHER delivers a 25.6 percent boost in\nnext-transaction prediction HitRate@1 and a 38.6 percent relative improvement\nin fraud detection recall over baselines. Cross-domain evaluations on public\nbenchmarks show strong generalization, achieving up to 21 percent HitRate@1\ngains over transformer baselines, establishing PANTHER as a scalable,\nhigh-performance framework for industrial sequential user behavior modeling."

We observe that the C910 processor exhibits more distinct timing\ntypes than the other processors, leading to the assumption that code running on\nthe C910 would be exposed to more microarchitectural vulnerability sources. In\naddition, our evaluation reveals that $65.9\\%$ of the vulnerabilities covered\nby the benchmark exist in all processors, while only $6.8\\%$ are absent from\nall cores. Our work, in particular the ported benchmark, aims to support RISC-V\nprocessor designers to identify leakage sources early in their designs and to\nsupport the development of countermeasures."

Our oVDA method\noutperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in both\naccuracy and VRAM usage. Low VRAM usage is particularly important for\ndeployment on edge devices. We demonstrate that oVDA runs at 42 FPS on an\nNVIDIA A100 and at 20 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson edge device.

The mainstream sequence\nparallelism (SP) method, Ring Attention, attempts to solve this by distributing\nthe query into multiple query chunks across accelerators and enable each Q\ntensor to access all KV tensors from other accelerators via the Ring AllGather\ncommunication primitive. However, it exhibits low communication efficiency,\nrestricting its practical applicability. This inefficiency stems from the\nmismatch between the Ring AllGather communication primitive it adopts and the\nAlltoAll topology of modern accelerators. A Ring AllGather primitive is\ncomposed of iterations of ring-styled data transfer, which can only utilize a\nvery limited fraction of an AlltoAll topology.\n  Inspired by the Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs, we\nidentify that modern accelerator topology can be decomposed into multiple\northogonal ring datapaths which can concurrently transfer data without\ninterference. Based on this, we further observe that the Ring AllGather\nprimitive can also be decomposed into the same number of concurrent ring-styled\ndata transfer at every iteration. Based on these insights, we propose TASP, a\ntopology-aware SP method for long-context LLMs that fully utilizes the\ncommunication capacity of modern accelerators via topology decomposition and\nprimitive decomposition. Experimental results on both single-node and\nmulti-node NVIDIA H100 systems and a single-node AMD MI300X system demonstrate\nthat TASP achieves higher communication efficiency than Ring Attention on these\nmodern accelerator topologies and achieves up to 3.58 speedup than Ring\nAttention and its variant Zigzag-Ring Attention.

Due to the non-convexity and NP-hardness of\nUSBJOP, we decompose it into three subproblems, which are the association\nbetween UAV-SIMs and users optimization problem (AUUOP), the UAV location\noptimization problem (ULOP), and the UAV-SIM phase shifts optimization problem\n(USPSOP). Then, we solve them through an alternating optimization strategy.\nSpecifically, AUUOP and ULOP are transformed into convex forms solvable via the\nCVX tool, while USPSOP is addressed by a generative artificial intelligence\n(GAI)-based hybrid optimization algorithm.

Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all\ntokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little\nacross most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial\nredundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\\bf MASK}$ tokens\nprimarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active\nprediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that\nselective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the\nmost-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative\nlower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose\n${\\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that\njointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the\nmost-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that\nrecomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and\noff-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs\nadaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant\ncomputation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation\nquality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across\nmathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent\nspeedups: $8.7\\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\\times$ on longer sequences,\nand $4.8\\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy\nthan the baseline.

Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this\nframework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on\nMathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math\nbenchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and\nbenchmark-to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs. Project\nPage: https://mathcanvas.github.io/"

In primary care settings, studies show that providers misidentify\ndepression or anxiety in over 60% of cases, highlighting the urgent need for\nscalable, accessible, and context-aware diagnostic tools that can support early\ndetection and intervention. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of\nmachine learning models for mental health screening using a unique dataset of\n553 real-world, semistructured interviews, each paried with ground-truth\ndiagnoses for major depressive episodes (MDE), anxiety disorders, and PTSD. We\nbenchmark multiple model classes, including zero-shot prompting with GPT-4.1\nMini and MetaLLaMA, as well as fine-tuned RoBERTa models using LowRank\nAdaptation (LoRA). Our models achieve over 80% accuracy across diagnostic\ncategories, with especially strongperformance on PTSD (up to 89% accuracy and\n98% recall). We also find that using shorter context, focused context segments\nimproves recall, suggesting that focused narrative cues enhance detection\nsensitivity. LoRA fine-tuning proves both efficient and effective, with\nlower-rank configurations (e.g., rank 8 and 16) maintaining competitive\nperformance across evaluation metrics. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based\nmodels can offer substantial improvements over traditional self-report\nscreening tools, providing a path toward low-barrier, AI-powerd early\ndiagnosis. This work lays the groundwork for integrating machine learning into\nreal-world clinical workflows, particularly in low-resource or high-stigma\nenvironments where access to timely mental health care is most limited.",

By querying an MLLM with visual inputs of object pairs\nat different moments, we generate textual descriptions of the activity and\ninteractions from nominal videos. These textual descriptions serve as a\nhigh-level representation of the activity and interactions of objects in a\nvideo. They are used to detect anomalies during test time by comparing them to\ntextual descriptions found in nominal training videos. Our approach inherently\nprovides explainability and can be combined with many traditional VAD methods\nto further enhance their interpretability. Extensive experiments on benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that our method not only detects complex interaction-based\nanomalies effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on\ndatasets without interaction anomalies."

To mitigate flicker and ensure continuity, AvatarSync leverages an\nautoregressive pipeline that enhances temporal modeling.

Our proposed task improves average accuracy\nfrom 25.6% to 27.3% for Qwen2.5-1.5B, and from 45.9% to 51.0% for\nDeepSeek-R1-Qwen-1.5B. Notably, for Qwen2.5-1.5B, the Fast Thinking mode alone\nachieves 25.2% accuracy using fewer than 1000 tokens, demonstrating substantial\ninference efficiency gains. These findings suggest that intuition and\ndeliberative reasoning are distinct, complementary systems benefiting from\ntargeted training. Additionally, we have open-sourced both the trained models\nand the source code."

This is\nparticularly relevant to the cooling flow problem--the lack of star formation\nrelative to X-ray-inferred ICM cooling rates. Using ZwCl 3146, a relaxed CC\nsystem at $z = 0.291$, we compare pressure profiles derived via X-rays and the\nthermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. While SZ measurements probe only\nthermal ICM electrons, additional CR-IC emission would appear to boost the\nX-ray-inferred pressure. Relative to unity, we measure a $\\simeq30\\%$ decrement\nin $P_{SZ}/P_X$ within 100 kpc of the ZwCl 3146 center at a statistical\nsignificance of $\\simeq 3.3\\sigma$, consistent with predicted deficits from\nCR-IC contamination in reasonable models of central AGN-driven CR injection.\nX-ray spectral fits of a two-component model with thermal ICM and CR-IC\nemission are consistent with CR-IC as the cause of this deficit. We test\nalternative explanations and systematics that could drive such a decrement,\nwith the leading order systematics associated with halo triaxiality.\nCollectively, these systematics are unlikely to produce a $P_{SZ}/P_X$\ndecrement $\\gtrsim10\\%$. While our results establish that non-negligible CR-IC\nemission is plausible in ZwCl 3146, we stress that more detailed studies of\nlarger cluster samples are required to robustly assess whether CR-IC is\nrelevant to the cooling flow problem.",

Given the extensive\ntraining of Large Language Models and their reliance upon naturalness of code,\nthey should expertly recommend which methods are misplaced in a given class and\nwhich classes are better hosts. Our formative study of 2016 LLM recommendations\nrevealed that LLMs give expert suggestions, yet they are unreliable: up to 80%\nof the suggestions are hallucinations. We introduce the first LLM fully powered\nassistant for MOVEMETHOD refactoring that automates its whole end-to-end\nlifecycle, from recommendation to execution. We designed novel solutions that\nautomatically filter LLM hallucinations using static analysis from IDEs and a\nnovel workflow that requires LLMs to be self-consistent, critique, and rank\nrefactoring suggestions. As MOVEMETHOD refactoring requires global,\nprojectlevel reasoning, we solved the limited context size of LLMs by employing\nrefactoring-aware retrieval augment generation (RAG). Our approach, MM-assist,\nsynergistically combines the strengths of the LLM, IDE, static analysis, and\nsemantic relevance. In our thorough, multi-methodology empirical evaluation, we\ncompare MM-assist with the previous state-of-the-art approaches. MM-assist\nsignificantly outperforms them: (i) on a benchmark widely used by other\nresearchers, our Recall@1 and Recall@3 show a 1.7x improvement; (ii) on a\ncorpus of 210 recent refactorings from Open-source software, our Recall rates\nimprove by at least 2.4x. Lastly, we conducted a user study with 30 experienced\nparticipants who used MM-assist to refactor their own code for one week. They\nrated 82.8% of MM-assist recommendations positively. This shows that MM-assist\nis both effective and useful.",

Our formative study of 2016 LLM recommendations\nrevealed that LLMs give expert suggestions, yet they are unreliable: up to 80%\nof the suggestions are hallucinations. We introduce the first LLM fully powered\nassistant for MOVEMETHOD refactoring that automates its whole end-to-end\nlifecycle, from recommendation to execution. We designed novel solutions that\nautomatically filter LLM hallucinations using static analysis from IDEs and a\nnovel workflow that requires LLMs to be self-consistent, critique, and rank\nrefactoring suggestions. As MOVEMETHOD refactoring requires global,\nprojectlevel reasoning, we solved the limited context size of LLMs by employing\nrefactoring-aware retrieval augment generation (RAG). Our approach, MM-assist,\nsynergistically combines the strengths of the LLM, IDE, static analysis, and\nsemantic relevance. In our thorough, multi-methodology empirical evaluation, we\ncompare MM-assist with the previous state-of-the-art approaches. MM-assist\nsignificantly outperforms them: (i) on a benchmark widely used by other\nresearchers, our Recall@1 and Recall@3 show a 1.7x improvement; (ii) on a\ncorpus of 210 recent refactorings from Open-source software, our Recall rates\nimprove by at least 2.4x. Lastly, we conducted a user study with 30 experienced\nparticipants who used MM-assist to refactor their own code for one week. They\nrated 82.8% of MM-assist recommendations positively. This shows that MM-assist\nis both effective and useful."

We propose future summary prediction (FSP),\nwhich trains an auxiliary head to predict a compact representation of the\nlong-term future, preserving information relevant for long-form generations. We\nexplore two variants of FSP: handcrafted summaries, for example, a bag of words\nsummary of the future of the sequence, and learned summaries, which use\nembeddings produced by a reverse language model trained from right to left.\nLarge-scale pretraining experiments (3B and 8B-parameter models) demonstrate\nthat FSP provides improvements over both NTP and MTP across math, reasoning,\nand coding benchmarks."

LAGER produces fine-grained judgment scores by aggregating\ncross-layer score-token logits and computing the expected score from a\nsoftmax-based distribution, while keeping the LLM backbone frozen and ensuring\nno impact on the inference process. LAGER fully leverages the complementary\ninformation across different layers, overcoming the limitations of relying\nsolely on the final layer.

Although\npioneering CL approaches using orthogonal subspaces can mitigate task\ninterference, they typically employ fixed budget allocation, neglecting the\nvarying complexity across tasks and layers. Besides, recent budget-adaptive\ntuning methods for LLMs often adopt multi-stage paradigms that decouple\noptimization and budget allocation. Such decoupling results in potential\nmisalignment, which hinders those approaches' practical application in CL\nscenarios. To address these limitations, we propose OA-Adapter, a novel\nparameter-efficient approach for continual learning in LLMs that unifies\ndynamic budget adaptation with orthogonal subspace learning in an end-to-end\ntraining stage. Specifically, OA-Adapter introduces a dynamic bottleneck\ndimension adaptation mechanism that simultaneously allocates an efficient\nparameter budget and optimizes task objectives without misalignment.To\neffectively preserve previously acquired knowledge while coordinating with the\ndynamic budget allocation, orthogonal constraints are applied specifically\nbetween the parameter subspace of the current task and the dynamically\nallocated parameter subspaces of historical tasks. Experimental results on\ncontinual learning benchmarks demonstrate that OA-Adapter outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and parameter efficiency.

To address these\nchallenges, xLLM builds a novel decoupled service-engine architecture. At the\nservice layer, xLLM-Service features an intelligent scheduling module that\nefficiently processes multimodal requests and co-locates online and offline\ntasks through unified elastic scheduling to maximize cluster utilization. This\nmodule also relies on a workload-adaptive dynamic Prefill-Decode (PD)\ndisaggregation policy and a novel Encode-Prefill-Decode (EPD) disaggregation\npolicy designed for multimodal inputs. Furthermore, it incorporates a\ndistributed architecture to provide global KV Cache management and robust\nfault-tolerant capabilities for high availability. At the engine layer,\nxLLM-Engine co-optimizes system and algorithm designs to fully saturate\ncomputing resources. This is achieved through comprehensive multi-layer\nexecution pipeline optimizations, an adaptive graph mode and an xTensor memory\nmanagement. xLLM-Engine also further integrates algorithmic enhancements such\nas optimized speculative decoding and dynamic EPLB, collectively serving to\nsubstantially boost throughput and inference efficiency. Extensive evaluations\ndemonstrate that xLLM delivers significantly superior performance and resource\nefficiency. Under identical TPOT constraints, xLLM achieves throughput up to\n1.7x that of MindIE and 2.2x that of vLLM-Ascend with Qwen-series models, while\nmaintaining an average throughput of 1.7x that of MindIE with Deepseek-series\nmodels. xLLM framework is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/jd-opensource/xllm and\nhttps://github.com/jd-opensource/xllm-service.",

In\nparticular, the bottleneck of SOTA decompilers lies in inaccurate method\nidentification, incorrect variable type recovery, and missing contract\nattributes. These deficiencies hinder downstream tasks and understanding of the\nprogram logic. To address these challenges, we propose SmartHalo, a new\nframework that enhances decompiler output by combining static analysis (SA) and\nlarge language models (LLM). SmartHalo leverages the complementary strengths of\nSA's accuracy in control and data flow analysis and LLM's capability in\nsemantic prediction. More specifically, \\system{} constructs a new data\nstructure - Dependency Graph (DG), to extract semantic dependencies via static\nanalysis. Then, it takes DG to create prompts for LLM optimization. Finally,\nthe correctness of LLM outputs is validated through symbolic execution and\nformal verification. Evaluation on a dataset consisting of 465 randomly\nselected smart contract methods shows that SmartHalo significantly improves the\nquality of the decompiled code, compared to SOTA decompilers (e.g., Gigahorse).\nNotably, integrating GPT-4o with SmartHalo further enhances its performance,\nachieving precision rates of 87.39% for method boundaries, 90.39% for variable\ntypes, and 80.65% for contract attributes.",

Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often\nlimited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity,\nstrategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow\nunified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for\nmathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation\nstage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M\ncaption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing\ntrajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing.\nSecond, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on\nMathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual\nreasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To\nfacilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging\nbenchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved\nvisual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this\nframework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on\nMathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math\nbenchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and\nbenchmark-to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs. Project\nPage: https://mathcanvas.github.io/",

To systematically\nevaluate LLM capabilities in this domain, we introduce MetaBench, the first\nbenchmark for metabolomics assessment. Curated from authoritative public\nresources, MetaBench evaluates five capabilities essential for metabolomics\nresearch: knowledge, understanding, grounding, reasoning, and research. Our\nevaluation of 25 open- and closed-source LLMs reveals distinct performance\npatterns across metabolomics tasks: while models perform well on text\ngeneration tasks, cross-database identifier grounding remains challenging even\nwith retrieval augmentation. Model performance also decreases on long-tail\nmetabolites with sparse annotations.

To systematically\nevaluate LLM capabilities in this domain, we introduce MetaBench, the first\nbenchmark for metabolomics assessment. Curated from authoritative public\nresources, MetaBench evaluates five capabilities essential for metabolomics\nresearch: knowledge, understanding, grounding, reasoning, and research. Our\nevaluation of 25 open- and closed-source LLMs reveals distinct performance\npatterns across metabolomics tasks: while models perform well on text\ngeneration tasks, cross-database identifier grounding remains challenging even\nwith retrieval augmentation. Model performance also decreases on long-tail\nmetabolites with sparse annotations.

In primary care settings, studies show that providers misidentify\ndepression or anxiety in over 60% of cases, highlighting the urgent need for\nscalable, accessible, and context-aware diagnostic tools that can support early\ndetection and intervention. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of\nmachine learning models for mental health screening using a unique dataset of\n553 real-world, semistructured interviews, each paried with ground-truth\ndiagnoses for major depressive episodes (MDE), anxiety disorders, and PTSD. We\nbenchmark multiple model classes, including zero-shot prompting with GPT-4.1\nMini and MetaLLaMA, as well as fine-tuned RoBERTa models using LowRank\nAdaptation (LoRA). Our models achieve over 80% accuracy across diagnostic\ncategories, with especially strongperformance on PTSD (up to 89% accuracy and\n98% recall). We also find that using shorter context, focused context segments\nimproves recall, suggesting that focused narrative cues enhance detection\nsensitivity. LoRA fine-tuning proves both efficient and effective, with\nlower-rank configurations (e.g., rank 8 and 16) maintaining competitive\nperformance across evaluation metrics. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based\nmodels can offer substantial improvements over traditional self-report\nscreening tools, providing a path toward low-barrier, AI-powerd early\ndiagnosis. This work lays the groundwork for integrating machine learning into\nreal-world clinical workflows, particularly in low-resource or high-stigma\nenvironments where access to timely mental health care is most limited.",

However,\nvendor documentation is often unavailable at test time. It is either misplaced,\nmismatched, poorly formatted, or incomplete, which makes schema mapping\nchallenging. We introduce a reinforcement learning agent that can self-improve\nwithout labeled examples or model weight updates.

Monolithic SoC designs struggle\nwith this complex balance mainly due to low manufacturing yields (below 16%) at\nadvanced 360 mm^2 process nodes. This paper presents a novel chiplet-based\nRISC-V SoC architecture that addresses these limitations through modular AI\nacceleration and intelligent system level optimization. Our proposed design\nintegrates 4 different key innovations in a 30mm x 30mm silicon interposer:\nadaptive cross-chiplet Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS); AI-aware\nUniversal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCIe) protocol extensions featuring\nstreaming flow control units and compression-aware transfers; distributed\ncryptographic security across heterogeneous chiplets; and intelligent\nsensor-driven load migration. The proposed architecture integrates a 7nm RISC-V\nCPU chiplet with dual 5nm AI accelerators (15 TOPS INT8 each), 16GB HBM3 memory\nstacks, and dedicated power management controllers. Experimental results across\nindustry standard benchmarks like MobileNetV2, ResNet-50 and real-time video\nprocessing demonstrate significant performance improvements. The AI-optimized\nconfiguration achieves ~14.7% latency reduction, 17.3% throughput improvement,\nand 16.2% power reduction compared to previous basic chiplet implementations.\nThese improvements collectively translate to a 40.1% efficiency gain\ncorresponding to ~3.5 mJ per MobileNetV2 inference (860 mW/244 images/s), while\nmaintaining sub-5ms real-time capability across all experimented workloads.\nThese performance upgrades demonstrate that modular chiplet designs can achieve\nnear-monolithic computational density while enabling cost efficiency,\nscalability and upgradeability, crucial for next-generation edge AI device\napplications.",

To mitigate flicker and ensure continuity, AvatarSync leverages an\nautoregressive pipeline that enhances temporal modeling.

Additionally, to further\naccelerate inference, we adopt a two-stage generation strategy that decouples\nsemantic modeling from visual dynamics, and incorporate a customized\nPhoneme-Frame Causal Attention Mask to support multi-step parallel\nacceleration.

                "summary": "In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two\ntypes of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the\npredicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary\nlabel prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders,\nvarious studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective\nthan discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language\nmodels (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts\n''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears\nmore promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This\ndivergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better\nsuited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In\nthis work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and\nSFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the\nexperimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components:\nweight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which\nguides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding\ntheir interactions.

                    "value": "In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two\ntypes of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the\npredicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary\nlabel prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders,\nvarious studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective\nthan discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language\nmodels (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts\n''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears\nmore promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This\ndivergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better\nsuited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In\nthis work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and\nSFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the\nexperimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components:\nweight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which\nguides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding\ntheir interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a\nsubstantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring\ndirection shows no clear winner.

We discovered prompting to\nbe a useful but undervalued skill for knowledge engineers working with LLMs,\nand note that natural language processing skills may become more relevant\nacross more roles in KG construction. Integrating LLMs into KE tasks needs to\nbe mindful of potential risks and harms related to responsible AI. Given the\nlimited ethical training, most knowledge engineers receive solutions such as\nour suggested `KG cards' based on data cards could be a useful guide for KG\nconstruction. Our findings can support designers of KE AI copilots, KE\nresearchers, and practitioners using advanced AI to develop trustworthy\napplications, propose new methodologies for KE and operate new technologies\nresponsibly."

                "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from catastrophic forgetting in\ncontinual learning (CL) scenarios, where performance on previously learned\ntasks degrades severely while training on sequentially arriving tasks. Although\npioneering CL approaches using orthogonal subspaces can mitigate task\ninterference, they typically employ fixed budget allocation, neglecting the\nvarying complexity across tasks and layers. Besides, recent budget-adaptive\ntuning methods for LLMs often adopt multi-stage paradigms that decouple\noptimization and budget allocation. Such decoupling results in potential\nmisalignment, which hinders those approaches' practical application in CL\nscenarios. To address these limitations, we propose OA-Adapter, a novel\nparameter-efficient approach for continual learning in LLMs that unifies\ndynamic budget adaptation with orthogonal subspace learning in an end-to-end\ntraining stage. Specifically, OA-Adapter introduces a dynamic bottleneck\ndimension adaptation mechanism that simultaneously allocates an efficient\nparameter budget and optimizes task objectives without misalignment.To\neffectively preserve previously acquired knowledge while coordinating with the\ndynamic budget allocation, orthogonal constraints are applied specifically\nbetween the parameter subspace of the current task and the dynamically\nallocated parameter subspaces of historical tasks. Experimental results on\ncontinual learning benchmarks demonstrate that OA-Adapter outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and parameter efficiency. OA-Adapter\nachieves higher average accuracy while using 58.5% fewer parameters on the\nstandard CL benchmark, and maintains its advantages on two larger benchmarks\ncomprising 15 tasks.",

Such decoupling results in potential\nmisalignment, which hinders those approaches' practical application in CL\nscenarios. To address these limitations, we propose OA-Adapter, a novel\nparameter-efficient approach for continual learning in LLMs that unifies\ndynamic budget adaptation with orthogonal subspace learning in an end-to-end\ntraining stage. Specifically, OA-Adapter introduces a dynamic bottleneck\ndimension adaptation mechanism that simultaneously allocates an efficient\nparameter budget and optimizes task objectives without misalignment.To\neffectively preserve previously acquired knowledge while coordinating with the\ndynamic budget allocation, orthogonal constraints are applied specifically\nbetween the parameter subspace of the current task and the dynamically\nallocated parameter subspaces of historical tasks. Experimental results on\ncontinual learning benchmarks demonstrate that OA-Adapter outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and parameter efficiency. OA-Adapter\nachieves higher average accuracy while using 58.5% fewer parameters on the\nstandard CL benchmark, and maintains its advantages on two larger benchmarks\ncomprising 15 tasks."

Evaluation on a dataset consisting of 465 randomly\nselected smart contract methods shows that SmartHalo significantly improves the\nquality of the decompiled code, compared to SOTA decompilers (e.g., Gigahorse).\nNotably, integrating GPT-4o with SmartHalo further enhances its performance,\nachieving precision rates of 87.39% for method boundaries, 90.39% for variable\ntypes, and 80.65% for contract attributes.",

Recent efforts aim to reduce KV cache size by evicting vast\nnon-critical cache elements during runtime while preserving generation quality.\nHowever, these methods typically allocate compression budgets uniformly across\nall attention heads, ignoring the unique attention patterns of each head. In\nthis paper, we establish a theoretical loss upper bound between pre- and\npost-eviction attention output, explaining the optimization target of prior\ncache eviction methods, while guiding the optimization of adaptive budget\nallocation. Base on this, we propose {\\it Ada-KV}, the first head-wise adaptive\nbudget allocation strategy. It offers plug-and-play benefits, enabling seamless\nintegration with prior cache eviction methods. Extensive evaluations on 13\ndatasets from Ruler and 16 datasets from LongBench, all conducted under both\nquestion-aware and question-agnostic scenarios, demonstrate substantial quality\nimprovements over existing methods.

                    "value": "Large Language Models have excelled in various domains but face efficiency\nchallenges due to the growing Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-sequence\ninference. Recent efforts aim to reduce KV cache size by evicting vast\nnon-critical cache elements during runtime while preserving generation quality.\nHowever, these methods typically allocate compression budgets uniformly across\nall attention heads, ignoring the unique attention patterns of each head. In\nthis paper, we establish a theoretical loss upper bound between pre- and\npost-eviction attention output, explaining the optimization target of prior\ncache eviction methods, while guiding the optimization of adaptive budget\nallocation. Base on this, we propose {\\it Ada-KV}, the first head-wise adaptive\nbudget allocation strategy. It offers plug-and-play benefits, enabling seamless\nintegration with prior cache eviction methods. Extensive evaluations on 13\ndatasets from Ruler and 16 datasets from LongBench, all conducted under both\nquestion-aware and question-agnostic scenarios, demonstrate substantial quality\nimprovements over existing methods.

                "summary": "The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommender systems faces\nkey challenges in delivering deep personalization and intelligent reasoning,\nespecially for interactive scenarios. Current methods are often constrained by\nlimited context windows and single-turn reasoning, hindering their ability to\ncapture dynamic user preferences and proactively reason over recommendation\ncontexts. To address these limitations, we propose MR.Rec, a novel framework\nthat synergizes memory and reasoning for LLM-based recommendations. To achieve\npersonalization, we develop a comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) system that efficiently indexes and retrieves relevant external memory to\nenhance LLM personalization capabilities. Furthermore, to enable the synergy\nbetween memory and reasoning, our RAG system goes beyond conventional\nquery-based retrieval by integrating reasoning enhanced memory retrieval.\nFinally, we design a reinforcement learning framework that trains the LLM to\nautonomously learn effective strategies for both memory utilization and\nreasoning refinement.

                    "value": "The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommender systems faces\nkey challenges in delivering deep personalization and intelligent reasoning,\nespecially for interactive scenarios. Current methods are often constrained by\nlimited context windows and single-turn reasoning, hindering their ability to\ncapture dynamic user preferences and proactively reason over recommendation\ncontexts. To address these limitations, we propose MR.Rec, a novel framework\nthat synergizes memory and reasoning for LLM-based recommendations. To achieve\npersonalization, we develop a comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) system that efficiently indexes and retrieves relevant external memory to\nenhance LLM personalization capabilities. Furthermore, to enable the synergy\nbetween memory and reasoning, our RAG system goes beyond conventional\nquery-based retrieval by integrating reasoning enhanced memory retrieval.\nFinally, we design a reinforcement learning framework that trains the LLM to\nautonomously learn effective strategies for both memory utilization and\nreasoning refinement. By combining dynamic memory retrieval with adaptive\nreasoning, this approach ensures more accurate, context-aware, and highly\npersonalized recommendations.

For each\ntarget structure, we also collect data for their matched baseline without the\ndifficult structure. Comparing performance on the target vs. baseline\nsentences, the performance gap observed in humans holds for LLMs, with two\nexceptions: for models that are too weak performance is uniformly low across\nboth sentence types, and for models that are too strong the performance is\nuniformly high.
