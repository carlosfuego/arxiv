In this work, we propose a novel task called zero-shot\nremote sensing instance segmentation, aimed at identifying aerial objects that\nare absent from training data. Challenges arise when classifying aerial\ncategories with high inter-class similarity and intra-class variance. Besides,\nthe domain gap between vision-language models' pretraining datasets and remote\nsensing datasets hinders the zero-shot capabilities of the pretrained model\nwhen it is directly applied to remote sensing images.

Most inference services today expose a coarse-grained request-level\nAPI with a pre-configured coordination strategy, limiting the ability to\ncustomize and dynamically reconfigure the coordination. In this paper, we\npropose LLM microserving, a multi-level architecture for structuring and\nprogramming LLM inference services. We introduces simple yet effective\nmicroserving APIs to support fine-grained sub-request level actions. A\nprogrammable router transforms user requests into sub-request calls, enabling\nthe dynamic reconfiguration of serving patterns. To support diverse execution\npatterns, we develop a unified KV cache interface that handles various KV\ncompute, transfer, and reuse scenarios. Our evaluation shows that LLM\nmicroserving can be reconfigured to support multiple disaggregation\norchestration strategies in a few lines of Python code while maintaining\nstate-of-the-art performance for LLM inference tasks.

In addition, we provide a new UHD benchmark to evaluate the\neffectiveness of our method.

The dynamic arrival and departure of connection requests in\noptical networks result in particular central links experiencing more traffic\nand congestion than non-central links. The occurrence of congested links leads\nto service blocking despite the availability of resources within the network,\nrestricting the efficient utilization of network resources. The available\nalgorithms in the literature that aim to balance load among network links offer\na trade-off between blocking performance and algorithmic complexity, thus\nincreasing service provisioning time. This work proposes a dynamic\nrouting-based congestion-aware routing, modulation, core, and spectrum\nassignment (RMCSA) algorithm for space division multiplexing elastic optical\nnetworks (SDM-EONs). The algorithm finds alternative candidate paths based on\nreal-time link occupancy metrics to minimize blocking due to link congestion\nunder dynamic traffic scenarios. As a result, the algorithm reduces the\nformation of congestion hotspots in the network owing to link-betweenness\ncentrality. We have performed extensive simulations using two realistic network\ntopologies to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with relevant\nRMCSA algorithms available in the literature. The simulation results verify the\nsuperior performance of our proposed algorithm compared to the benchmark Yen's\nK-shortest paths and K-Disjoint shortest paths RMCSA algorithms in connection\nblocking ratio and spectrum utilization efficiency. To expedite the\nroute-finding process, we present a novel caching strategy that allows the\nproposed algorithm to demonstrate a much-reduced service delay time compared to\nthe recently developed adaptive link weight-based load-balancing RMCSA\nalgorithm.",

While still building on the ESP32 microcontroller, this\nversion improves the overall performance by switching to an SD card caching\nsystem and upgrading the analog-digital converter to an AD7606C-18, which has a\nhigher resolution, provides eight channels, oversampling, and\nsoftware-adjustable voltage ranges. Also improved is the IEPE front-end and\npower supply, as well as the firmware of the acquisition system, which can now\nachieve a sample rate of up to 36 kHz while sampling all eight channels. This\npaper documents the hardware and software of OASIS-UROS and provides all\nmaterials required to reproduce the open acquisition system. Lastly, the system\nwas validated against commercial hardware and software in an experimental modal\nanalysis context. This showed that the system performs close to the commercial\none in some aspects with respect to the utilized test case.

While still building on the ESP32 microcontroller, this\nversion improves the overall performance by switching to an SD card caching\nsystem and upgrading the analog-digital converter to an AD7606C-18, which has a\nhigher resolution, provides eight channels, oversampling, and\nsoftware-adjustable voltage ranges. Also improved is the IEPE front-end and\npower supply, as well as the firmware of the acquisition system, which can now\nachieve a sample rate of up to 36 kHz while sampling all eight channels. This\npaper documents the hardware and software of OASIS-UROS and provides all\nmaterials required to reproduce the open acquisition system. Lastly, the system\nwas validated against commercial hardware and software in an experimental modal\nanalysis context. This showed that the system performs close to the commercial\none in some aspects with respect to the utilized test case. While OASIS-UROS\ncannot match the full performance of the commercial system, the developed\nsystem can be a viable alternative for students, people in academia, or smaller\ncompanies that have a constrained budget or require complete insight as well as\nadaptability of the hardware and software."

The\neffectiveness of a key-value cache relies on its ability of accommodating the\nneeded data. However, expanding the cache capacity is often more difficult than\ncommonly expected because of many practical constraints, such as server costs,\ncooling issues, rack space, and even human resource expenses. A potential\nsolution is compression, which virtually extends the cache capacity by\ncondensing data in cache. In practice, this seemingly simple idea has not\ngained much traction in key-value cache system design, due to several critical\nissues: the compression-unfriendly index structure, severe read/write\namplification, wasteful decompression operations, and heavy computing cost.\nThis paper presents a hybrid DRAM-SSD cache design to realize a systematic\nintegration of data compression in key-value cache. By treating compression as\nan essential component, we have redesigned the indexing structure, data\nmanagement, and leveraged the emerging computational SSD hardware for\ncollaborative optimizations. We have developed a prototype, called ZipCache.\nOur experimental results show that ZipCache can achieve up to 72.4% higher\nthroughput and 42.4% lower latency, while reducing the write amplification by\nup to 26.2 times.",

As\ndeep learning models and GPUs evolve, access to newer GPUs is often limited,\nraising questions about the performance of new model architectures on existing\nGPUs, existing models on new GPUs, and new model architectures on new GPUs. To\naddress these questions, we introduce NeuSight, a framework to predict the\nperformance of various deep learning models, for both training and inference,\non unseen GPUs without requiring actual execution. The framework leverages both\nGPU hardware behavior and software library optimizations to estimate end-to-end\nperformance. Previous work uses regression models that capture linear trends or\nmultilayer perceptrons to predict the overall latency of deep learning kernels\non GPUs. These approaches suffer from higher error percentages when forecasting\nperformance on unseen models and new GPUs. Instead, NeuSight decomposes the\nprediction problem into smaller problems, bounding the prediction through\nfundamental performance laws. NeuSight decomposes a single deep learning kernel\nprediction into smaller working sets called tiles, which are executed\nindependently on the GPU. Tile-granularity predictions are determined using a\nmachine learning approach and aggregated to estimate end-to-end latency.\nNeuSight outperforms prior work across various deep learning workloads and the\nlatest GPUs. It reduces the percentage error from 121.4% and 30.8% to 2.3% in\npredicting the latency of GPT3 model for training and inference on H100,\ncompared to state-of-the-art prior work, where both GPT3 and H100 were not used\nto train the framework.",

                    "value": "Deep learning kernels exhibit predictable memory accesses and compute\npatterns, making GPUs' parallel architecture well-suited for their execution.\nSoftware and runtime systems for GPUs are optimized to better utilize the\nstream multiprocessors, on-chip cache, and off-chip high-bandwidth memory. As\ndeep learning models and GPUs evolve, access to newer GPUs is often limited,\nraising questions about the performance of new model architectures on existing\nGPUs, existing models on new GPUs, and new model architectures on new GPUs. To\naddress these questions, we introduce NeuSight, a framework to predict the\nperformance of various deep learning models, for both training and inference,\non unseen GPUs without requiring actual execution. The framework leverages both\nGPU hardware behavior and software library optimizations to estimate end-to-end\nperformance. Previous work uses regression models that capture linear trends or\nmultilayer perceptrons to predict the overall latency of deep learning kernels\non GPUs. These approaches suffer from higher error percentages when forecasting\nperformance on unseen models and new GPUs. Instead, NeuSight decomposes the\nprediction problem into smaller problems, bounding the prediction through\nfundamental performance laws. NeuSight decomposes a single deep learning kernel\nprediction into smaller working sets called tiles, which are executed\nindependently on the GPU. Tile-granularity predictions are determined using a\nmachine learning approach and aggregated to estimate end-to-end latency.\nNeuSight outperforms prior work across various deep learning workloads and the\nlatest GPUs. It reduces the percentage error from 121.4% and 30.8% to 2.3% in\npredicting the latency of GPT3 model for training and inference on H100,\ncompared to state-of-the-art prior work, where both GPT3 and H100 were not used\nto train the framework."

Recent advances\nmitigate this challenge by leveraging external knowledge from Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to furnish class descriptions, yet incurring notable inference\ncosts.

These are important for\ntime-series tasks and logical reasoning. Traditional RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs,\nas well as modern variants like sLSTM do have these capabilities at the cost of\nstrictly sequential processing. While this is often seen as a strong\nlimitation, we show how fast these networks can get with our\nhardware-optimization FlashRNN in Triton and CUDA, optimizing kernels to the\nregister level on modern GPUs. We extend traditional RNNs with a\nparallelization variant that processes multiple RNNs of smaller hidden state in\nparallel, similar to the head-wise processing in Transformers. To enable\nflexibility on different GPU variants, we introduce a new optimization\nframework for hardware-internal cache sizes, memory and compute handling.

                    "value": "While Transformers and other sequence-parallelizable neural network\narchitectures seem like the current state of the art in sequence modeling, they\nspecifically lack state-tracking capabilities. These are important for\ntime-series tasks and logical reasoning. Traditional RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs,\nas well as modern variants like sLSTM do have these capabilities at the cost of\nstrictly sequential processing. While this is often seen as a strong\nlimitation, we show how fast these networks can get with our\nhardware-optimization FlashRNN in Triton and CUDA, optimizing kernels to the\nregister level on modern GPUs. We extend traditional RNNs with a\nparallelization variant that processes multiple RNNs of smaller hidden state in\nparallel, similar to the head-wise processing in Transformers. To enable\nflexibility on different GPU variants, we introduce a new optimization\nframework for hardware-internal cache sizes, memory and compute handling.

                "summary": "Recently the generative Large Language Model (LLM) has achieved remarkable\nsuccess in numerous applications. Notably its inference generates output tokens\none-by-one, leading to many redundant computations. The widely-used KV-Cache\nframework makes a compromise between time and space complexities. However,\ncaching data generates the increasingly growing memory demand, that can quickly\nexhaust the limited memory capacity of the modern accelerator like GPUs,\nparticularly in long-context inference tasks. Existing studies reduce memory\nconsumption by evicting some of cached data that have less important impact on\ninference accuracy. But the benefit in practice is far from ideal due to the\nstatic cache allocation across different LLM network layers. This paper\nobserves that the layer-specific cached data have very different impacts on\naccuracy. We quantify this difference, and give experimental and theoretical\nvalidation. We accordingly make a formal analysis and shows that customizing\nthe cache size for each layer in a personalized manner can yield a significant\nmemory reduction, while still providing comparable accuracy. We simulate the\ncache allocation as a combinatorial optimization problem and give a global\noptimal solution. In particular, we devise a mini- and sampling-based inference\nover a lightweight variant of the LLM model, so as to quickly capture the\ndifference and then feed it into the personalized algorithms. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposals can reduce KV\ncache memory consumption by 61.6% on average, improve computational efficiency\nby 2.1x and then increase the throughput by up to 5.5x.",

                    "value": "Recently the generative Large Language Model (LLM) has achieved remarkable\nsuccess in numerous applications. Notably its inference generates output tokens\none-by-one, leading to many redundant computations. The widely-used KV-Cache\nframework makes a compromise between time and space complexities. However,\ncaching data generates the increasingly growing memory demand, that can quickly\nexhaust the limited memory capacity of the modern accelerator like GPUs,\nparticularly in long-context inference tasks. Existing studies reduce memory\nconsumption by evicting some of cached data that have less important impact on\ninference accuracy. But the benefit in practice is far from ideal due to the\nstatic cache allocation across different LLM network layers. This paper\nobserves that the layer-specific cached data have very different impacts on\naccuracy. We quantify this difference, and give experimental and theoretical\nvalidation. We accordingly make a formal analysis and shows that customizing\nthe cache size for each layer in a personalized manner can yield a significant\nmemory reduction, while still providing comparable accuracy. We simulate the\ncache allocation as a combinatorial optimization problem and give a global\noptimal solution. In particular, we devise a mini- and sampling-based inference\nover a lightweight variant of the LLM model, so as to quickly capture the\ndifference and then feed it into the personalized algorithms. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposals can reduce KV\ncache memory consumption by 61.6% on average, improve computational efficiency\nby 2.1x and then increase the throughput by up to 5.5x."

Its cache entry identifies\na unique one-hop sub-query (key) and its result set consisting of immutable\nvertex ids (value). When processing a gR-Tx, the query processor identifies its\nsequence of individual one-hop sub-queries and looks up their results in the\ncache. A cache hit fetches less data from the storage manager and eliminates\nthe requirement to process the one-hop sub-query. A cache miss populates the\ncache asynchronously and in a transactional manner, maintaining the separation\nof read and write paths of our transactional storage manager. A graph read and\nwrite transaction, gRW-Tx, identifies the impacted cache entries and either\ndeletes or updates them. Our implementation of the cache is inside the graph\nquery processing engine and transparent to a user application. We evaluate the\ncache using our eCommerce production workload and with rules that re-write\ngraph queries to maximize the performance enhancements observed with the cache.\nObtained results show the cache enhances 95th and 99th percentile of query\nresponse times by at least 2x and 1.63x, respectively. When combined with query\nre-writing, the enhancements are at least 2.33x and 4.48x, respectively.

The majority of computation stems from the\noverwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer decoder. In\nthis paper, we propose to build efficient MLLMs by leveraging the\nMixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each transformer decoder layer selects\nessential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant ones. However,\nintegrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the challenges of\ntraining and inference stability as well as limited training data, we adapt the\nMoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight normalization (TanhNorm)\nand symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we observe that vision\ntokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layer and thus design a progressive\nratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the token retention ratio\nlayer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This crucial design fully\nunleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the efficiency and\nperformance of our models. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we\nconduct extensive experiments with two baseline models across 14 benchmarks.\nOur model, p-MoD, matches or even surpasses the performance of the baseline\nmodels, with only 55.6% TFLOPs and 53.8% KV cache storage during inference, and\n77.7% GPU hours during training.",

                "summary": "Training and serving long-context large language models (LLMs) incurs\nsubstantial overhead. To address this, two critical steps are often required: a\npretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length\nextension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural\nmodifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper\nargues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction\narchitecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but\nalso achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed\nLongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during\nlength extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention\npatterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink\n(initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are\nwell-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their\nGPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just\ntheoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to\nhave direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention\nlayers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency\nand long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data\nis sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.\n  We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its\neffectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts,\nLongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%,\ncompared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV\ncache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding\nspeedup.",

Existing KV cache compression methods,\nincluding quantization and pruning, struggle with limitations such as uniform\ntreatment of keys and values and static memory allocation across attention\nheads. To address these challenges, we introduce LeanKV, a unified KV cache\ncompression framework that enhances LLM serving efficiency without compromising\naccuracy through three innovations: (1) Hetero-KV quantization, which stores\nkeys at a higher precision than values to reflect their greater impact on\nattention computations; (2) per-head dynamic sparsity, which allocates memory\nbased on token importance per head and per request; and (3) unified KV\ncompression, integrating mixed-precision quantization and selective pruning to\nenable a smooth tradeoff between model accuracy and memory efficiency. To\nefficiently support these techniques, LeanKV introduces systems optimizations\nincluding unified paging and on-GPU parallel memory management. Implemented on\nvLLM, LeanKV compresses the KV cache by $3.0\\times$ to $5.0\\times$ without\naccuracy loss and up to $11.0\\times$ with under 5% accuracy loss, enhancing\nthroughput by $1.9\\times$ to $2.5\\times$, and up to $6.9\\times$.",

However, stacking multiple\nattention layers leads to attention concentration. One natural way to address\nthis issue is to use cross-layer attention, allowing information from earlier\nlayers to be directly accessible to later layers. However, this approach is\ncomputationally expensive. To address this problem, we propose Transformer with\nresidual value (ResFormer) which approximates cross-layer attention through\nadding a residual connection from the values of the the first layer to all\nsubsequent layers. Based on this method, one variant is the Transformer with\nsingle layer value (SVFormer), where all layers share the same value embedding\nfrom first layer. Comprehensive empirical evidence demonstrates ResFormer\nachieves equivalent validation loss with 10.4% fewer model parameters and 13.6%\nless training data compared to Transformer, while maintaining similar memory\nusage and computational cost. Besides, SVFormer reduces KV cache size by nearly\nhalf with only a small performance penalty and can be integrated with other\nKV-efficient methods, yielding further reductions in KV cache, with performance\ninfluenced by sequence length and cumulative learning rate. Further\nvisualization results suggest that Resformer and SVFormer alleviate attention\nconcentration in deeper layers through avoiding value-state drains and enhance\nrepresentation across most layers.",

One natural way to address\nthis issue is to use cross-layer attention, allowing information from earlier\nlayers to be directly accessible to later layers. However, this approach is\ncomputationally expensive. To address this problem, we propose Transformer with\nresidual value (ResFormer) which approximates cross-layer attention through\nadding a residual connection from the values of the the first layer to all\nsubsequent layers. Based on this method, one variant is the Transformer with\nsingle layer value (SVFormer), where all layers share the same value embedding\nfrom first layer. Comprehensive empirical evidence demonstrates ResFormer\nachieves equivalent validation loss with 10.4% fewer model parameters and 13.6%\nless training data compared to Transformer, while maintaining similar memory\nusage and computational cost. Besides, SVFormer reduces KV cache size by nearly\nhalf with only a small performance penalty and can be integrated with other\nKV-efficient methods, yielding further reductions in KV cache, with performance\ninfluenced by sequence length and cumulative learning rate. Further\nvisualization results suggest that Resformer and SVFormer alleviate attention\nconcentration in deeper layers through avoiding value-state drains and enhance\nrepresentation across most layers."

This novel transformer-based\nreal-time OVD model features an innovative Efficient Fusion Head (EFH) module\ndesigned to alleviate the bottlenecks observed in OmDet and Grounding-DINO.\nNotably, OmDet-Turbo-Base achieves a 100.2 frames per second (FPS) with\nTensorRT and language cache techniques applied. Notably, in zero-shot scenarios\non COCO and LVIS datasets, OmDet-Turbo achieves performance levels nearly on\npar with current state-of-the-art supervised models. Furthermore, it\nestablishes new state-of-the-art benchmarks on ODinW and OVDEval, boasting an\nAP of 30.1 and an NMS-AP of 26.86, respectively.

Although deeper and larger neural networks\ncan significantly improve performance, their substantial memory requirements\nhinder training on consumer GPUs. In this paper, we explore a memory-efficient\ntraining strategy for deep speaker embedding learning in resource-constrained\nscenarios. Firstly, we conduct a systematic analysis of GPU memory allocation\nduring SV system training. Empirical observations show that activations and\noptimizer states are the main sources of memory consumption. For activations,\nwe design two types of reversible neural networks which eliminate the need to\nstore intermediate activations during back-propagation, thereby significantly\nreducing memory usage without performance loss. For optimizer states, we\nintroduce a dynamic quantization approach that replaces the original 32-bit\nfloating-point values with a dynamic tree-based 8-bit data type. Experimental\nresults on VoxCeleb demonstrate that the reversible variants of ResNets and\nDF-ResNets can perform training without the need to cache activations in GPU\nmemory. In addition, the 8-bit versions of SGD and Adam save 75% of memory\ncosts while maintaining performance compared to their 32-bit counterparts.\nFinally, a detailed comparison of memory usage and performance indicates that\nour proposed models achieve up to 16.2x memory savings, with nearly identical\nparameters and performance compared to the vanilla systems. In contrast to the\nprevious need for multiple high-end GPUs such as the A100, we can effectively\ntrain deep speaker embedding extractors with just one or two consumer-level\n2080Ti GPUs.",

In this article, we present a comprehensive survey of the\nemerging DT-enabled services and applications across industries, beginning with\nan overview of DT fundamentals and its components to a discussion of key\nenabling technologies for DT. Different from literature works, we investigate\nand analyze the capabilities of DT across a wide range of industrial services,\nincluding data sharing, data offloading, integrated sensing and communication,\ncontent caching, resource allocation, wireless networking, and metaverse. In\nparticular, we present an in-depth technical discussion of the roles of DT in\nindustrial applications across various domains, including manufacturing,\nhealthcare, transportation, energy, agriculture, space, oil and gas, as well as\nrobotics. Throughout the technical analysis, we delve into real-time data\ncommunications between physical and virtual platforms to enable industrial DT\nnetworking. Subsequently, we extensively explore and analyze a wide range of\nmajor privacy and security issues in DT-based industry. Taxonomy tables and the\nkey research findings from the survey are also given, emphasizing important\ninsights into the significance of DT in industries. Finally, we point out\nfuture research directions to spur further research in this promising area."

                "summary": "As a fundamental backbone for video generation, diffusion models are\nchallenged by low inference speed due to the sequential nature of denoising.\nPrevious methods speed up the models by caching and reusing model outputs at\nuniformly selected timesteps. However, such a strategy neglects the fact that\ndifferences among model outputs are not uniform across timesteps, which hinders\nselecting the appropriate model outputs to cache, leading to a poor balance\nbetween inference efficiency and visual quality. In this study, we introduce\nTimestep Embedding Aware Cache (TeaCache), a training-free caching approach\nthat estimates and leverages the fluctuating differences among model outputs\nacross timesteps.

                    "value": "As a fundamental backbone for video generation, diffusion models are\nchallenged by low inference speed due to the sequential nature of denoising.\nPrevious methods speed up the models by caching and reusing model outputs at\nuniformly selected timesteps. However, such a strategy neglects the fact that\ndifferences among model outputs are not uniform across timesteps, which hinders\nselecting the appropriate model outputs to cache, leading to a poor balance\nbetween inference efficiency and visual quality. In this study, we introduce\nTimestep Embedding Aware Cache (TeaCache), a training-free caching approach\nthat estimates and leverages the fluctuating differences among model outputs\nacross timesteps.

                "summary": "Adaptive optimizers such as Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015) have been central to the\nsuccess of large language models. However, they maintain additional moving\naverage states throughout training, which results in memory requirements\nseveral times greater than the model. This overhead imposes constraints on\nscalability and computational efficiency. On the other hand, while stochastic\ngradient descent (SGD) is optimal in terms of memory efficiency, their\ncapability in LLM training is limited (Zhao et al., 2024b).\n  To address this dilemma, we show that pre-processing SGD is sufficient to\nreach Adam-level performance on LLMs. Specifically, we propose to preprocess\nthe instantaneous stochastic gradients with two simple operators:\n$\\mathtt{GradNorm}$ and $\\mathtt{GradWhitening}$. $\\mathtt{GradNorm}$\nstabilizes gradient distributions, and $\\mathtt{GradWhitening}$ counteracts the\nlocal curvature of the loss landscape, respectively. This results in SWAN (SGD\nwith Whitening And Normalization), a stochastic optimizer that eliminates the\nneed to store any accumulative state variables. Empirically, SWAN has the same\nmemory footprint as SGD, achieving $\\approx 50\\%$ reduction on total end-to-end\nmemory compared to Adam.

                    "value": "Adaptive optimizers such as Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015) have been central to the\nsuccess of large language models. However, they maintain additional moving\naverage states throughout training, which results in memory requirements\nseveral times greater than the model. This overhead imposes constraints on\nscalability and computational efficiency. On the other hand, while stochastic\ngradient descent (SGD) is optimal in terms of memory efficiency, their\ncapability in LLM training is limited (Zhao et al., 2024b).\n  To address this dilemma, we show that pre-processing SGD is sufficient to\nreach Adam-level performance on LLMs. Specifically, we propose to preprocess\nthe instantaneous stochastic gradients with two simple operators:\n$\\mathtt{GradNorm}$ and $\\mathtt{GradWhitening}$. $\\mathtt{GradNorm}$\nstabilizes gradient distributions, and $\\mathtt{GradWhitening}$ counteracts the\nlocal curvature of the loss landscape, respectively. This results in SWAN (SGD\nwith Whitening And Normalization), a stochastic optimizer that eliminates the\nneed to store any accumulative state variables. Empirically, SWAN has the same\nmemory footprint as SGD, achieving $\\approx 50\\%$ reduction on total end-to-end\nmemory compared to Adam. In language modeling tasks, SWAN demonstrates the same\nor even a substantial improvement over Adam. Specifically, when pre-training\nthe LLaMa model with 350M and 1.3B parameters, SWAN achieves a 2x speedup by\nreaching the same evaluation perplexity in less than half tokens seen."

We propose a strategy for\ninference and learning that scales on sequential settings, and that combines\napproximate Bayesian inference, automated reasoning, and gradient estimation.\nOur experiments show that NeSy-MMs can solve problems beyond the current\nstate-of-the-art in neurosymbolic AI and still provide strong guarantees with\nrespect to desired properties. Moreover, we show that our models are more\ninterpretable and that constraints can be adapted at test time to\nout-of-distribution scenarios."

All models are\ntrained at 1.5{\\deg} resolution, with a training budget of $\\sim$9 V100 days\nfor ArchesWeather and $\\sim$45 V100 days for ArchesWeatherGen. For inference,\nArchesWeatherGen generates 15-day weather trajectories at a rate of 1 minute\nper ensemble member on a A100 GPU card. To make our work fully reproducible,\nour code and models are open source, including the complete pipeline for data\npreparation, training, and evaluation, at https://github.com/INRIA/geoarches ."

Documents are now treated as multimodal entities, incorporating\nboth textual and visual information for downstream analysis. However, works in\nthis space are often focused on the textual aspect, using the visual space as\nauxiliary information. While some works have explored pure vision based\ntechniques for document image understanding, they require OCR identified text\nas input during inference, or do not align with text in their learning\nprocedure. Therefore, we present a novel image-text alignment technique\nspecially designed for leveraging the textual information in document images to\nimprove performance on visual tasks. Our document encoder model DoPTA - trained\nwith this technique demonstrates strong performance on a wide range of document\nimage understanding tasks, without requiring OCR during inference. Combined\nwith an auxiliary reconstruction objective, DoPTA consistently outperforms\nlarger models, while using significantly lesser pre-training compute.

                    "value": "The advent of multimodal learning has brought a significant improvement in\ndocument AI. Documents are now treated as multimodal entities, incorporating\nboth textual and visual information for downstream analysis. However, works in\nthis space are often focused on the textual aspect, using the visual space as\nauxiliary information. While some works have explored pure vision based\ntechniques for document image understanding, they require OCR identified text\nas input during inference, or do not align with text in their learning\nprocedure. Therefore, we present a novel image-text alignment technique\nspecially designed for leveraging the textual information in document images to\nimprove performance on visual tasks. Our document encoder model DoPTA - trained\nwith this technique demonstrates strong performance on a wide range of document\nimage understanding tasks, without requiring OCR during inference. Combined\nwith an auxiliary reconstruction objective, DoPTA consistently outperforms\nlarger models, while using significantly lesser pre-training compute. DoPTA\nalso sets new state-of-the art results on D4LA, and FUNSD, two challenging\ndocument visual analysis benchmarks."

The results demonstrate that O1's repair\ncapability exceeds that of prior GPT-family models, successfully fixing all 40\nbugs in the benchmark.

This function can be reduced to the objective\nfunction of a traditional data assimilation method, namely the\nthree-dimensional variational (3D-Var) formalism. Similar to 3D-Var, it is\nessential to use a non-diagonal background error covariance matrix to\nassimilate distant observations. Instead of using such a non-diagonal matrix,\nwe extend the proposed theory by using the non-locality of super-resolution\n(SR). For linear SR, SR operators serve as background error covariance\nmatrices. For nonlinear SR, error backpropagation through SR neural networks\ninduces covariance structures in inference. SRDA can be performed using CVAEs\nbecause the loss function for CVAEs is generally an evidence lower bound. By\nincorporating the SR neural network into the CVAE, the encoder estimates the\nhigh-resolution (HR) analysis from HR observations and low-resolution (LR)\nforecasts. The decoder acts as the observation operator and reconstructs the HR\nobservations from the estimated HR analysis. The effectiveness of SRDA was\nevaluated through numerical experiments using an idealized barotropic ocean jet\nsystem. Compared to inference with an ensemble Kalman filter, SRDA demonstrated\nsuperior accuracy in HR inference.

However, one major issue is that LLMs pre-trained on\ngeneral domain corpus might not generalize well to specific domains due to the\nlack of domain-specific knowledge. To address this issue, this paper focuses on\nenhancing the domain-specific MT capability of LLMs, by providing high-quality\ntraining datasets and proposing a novel fine-tuning framework denoted by\nDragFT. DragFT augments LLMs via three techniques: (i) Dictionary-enhanced\nprompting integrates dictionary information into prompts to improve the\ntranslation of domain-specific terminology.; (ii) RAG-based few-shot example\nselection provides high-quality examples that simulate both the domain and\nstyle characteristics; (iii) Fine-tuning with few-shot examples further\nenhances performance when using in-domain examples. We deploy DragFT on three\nwell-known LLM backbones with 13B training parameters to validate its\neffectiveness. The results on three domain-specific datasets show that DragFT\nachieves a significant performance boost and shows superior performance\ncompared to advanced models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o. The drastic performance\nimprovement of DragFT over existing LLMs can be attributed to incorporating\nrelevant knowledge while mitigating noise.",

                    "value": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in domain-specific\nmachine translation (MT). However, one major issue is that LLMs pre-trained on\ngeneral domain corpus might not generalize well to specific domains due to the\nlack of domain-specific knowledge. To address this issue, this paper focuses on\nenhancing the domain-specific MT capability of LLMs, by providing high-quality\ntraining datasets and proposing a novel fine-tuning framework denoted by\nDragFT. DragFT augments LLMs via three techniques: (i) Dictionary-enhanced\nprompting integrates dictionary information into prompts to improve the\ntranslation of domain-specific terminology.; (ii) RAG-based few-shot example\nselection provides high-quality examples that simulate both the domain and\nstyle characteristics; (iii) Fine-tuning with few-shot examples further\nenhances performance when using in-domain examples. We deploy DragFT on three\nwell-known LLM backbones with 13B training parameters to validate its\neffectiveness. The results on three domain-specific datasets show that DragFT\nachieves a significant performance boost and shows superior performance\ncompared to advanced models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o. The drastic performance\nimprovement of DragFT over existing LLMs can be attributed to incorporating\nrelevant knowledge while mitigating noise."

Unfortunately, current artificial\nneural network (ANN)-based segmentation methods suffer from high computational\ndemands, the requirements for image frames, and massive energy consumption,\nlimiting their efficiency and application on resource-constrained edge/mobile\nplatforms. To address these problems, we introduce SLTNet, a spike-driven\nlightweight transformer-based network designed for event-based semantic\nsegmentation. Specifically, SLTNet is built on efficient spike-driven\nconvolution blocks (SCBs) to extract rich semantic features while reducing the\nmodel's parameters. Then, to enhance the long-range contextural feature\ninteraction, we propose novel spike-driven transformer blocks (STBs) with\nbinary mask operations. Based on these basic blocks, SLTNet employs a\nhigh-efficiency single-branch architecture while maintaining the low energy\nconsumption of the Spiking Neural Network (SNN). Finally, extensive experiments\non DDD17 and DSEC-Semantic datasets demonstrate that SLTNet outperforms\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) SNN-based methods by at least 7.30% and 3.30% mIoU,\nrespectively, with extremely 5.48x lower energy consumption and 1.14x faster\ninference speed.",

                    "value": "Event-based semantic segmentation has great potential in autonomous driving\nand robotics due to the advantages of event cameras, such as high dynamic\nrange, low latency, and low power cost. Unfortunately, current artificial\nneural network (ANN)-based segmentation methods suffer from high computational\ndemands, the requirements for image frames, and massive energy consumption,\nlimiting their efficiency and application on resource-constrained edge/mobile\nplatforms. To address these problems, we introduce SLTNet, a spike-driven\nlightweight transformer-based network designed for event-based semantic\nsegmentation. Specifically, SLTNet is built on efficient spike-driven\nconvolution blocks (SCBs) to extract rich semantic features while reducing the\nmodel's parameters. Then, to enhance the long-range contextural feature\ninteraction, we propose novel spike-driven transformer blocks (STBs) with\nbinary mask operations. Based on these basic blocks, SLTNet employs a\nhigh-efficiency single-branch architecture while maintaining the low energy\nconsumption of the Spiking Neural Network (SNN). Finally, extensive experiments\non DDD17 and DSEC-Semantic datasets demonstrate that SLTNet outperforms\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) SNN-based methods by at least 7.30% and 3.30% mIoU,\nrespectively, with extremely 5.48x lower energy consumption and 1.14x faster\ninference speed."

Therefore, this\npaper proposes a comprehensive circuit to model the inference dynamics and try\nto explain the observed phenomena of ICL. In detail, we divide ICL inference\ninto 3 major operations: (1) Input Text Encode: LMs encode every input text\n(demonstrations and queries) into linear representation in the hidden states\nwith sufficient information to solve ICL tasks. (2) Semantics Merge: LMs merge\nthe encoded representations of demonstrations with their corresponding label\ntokens to produce joint representations of labels and demonstrations. (3)\nFeature Retrieval and Copy: LMs search the joint representations similar to the\nquery representation on a task subspace, and copy the searched representations\ninto the query. Then, language model heads capture these copied label\nrepresentations to a certain extent and decode them into predicted labels. The\nproposed inference circuit successfully captured many phenomena observed during\nthe ICL process, making it a comprehensive and practical explanation of the ICL\ninference process. Moreover, ablation analysis by disabling the proposed steps\nseriously damages the ICL performance, suggesting the proposed inference\ncircuit is a dominating mechanism. Additionally, we confirm and list some\nbypass mechanisms that solve ICL tasks in parallel with the proposed circuit.",

This platform aims to combine model-based engineering,\ngraph modeling, data containers, and documents, along with tools for handling\ncomputational elements. HyperGraphOS functions as an Operating System offering\nto users an infinite workspace for creating and managing complex models\nrepresented as graphs with customizable semantics. By leveraging a web-based\narchitecture, it requires only a modern web browser for access, allowing\norganization of knowledge, documents, and content into models represented in a\nnetwork of workspaces. Elements of the workspace are defined in terms of\ndomain-specific languages (DSLs). These DSLs are pivotal for navigating\nworkspaces, generating code, triggering AI components, and organizing\ninformation and processes. The models' dual nature as both visual drawings and\ndata structures allows dynamic modifications and inspections both interactively\nas well as programaticaly. We evaluated HyperGraphOS's efficiency and\napplicability across a large set of diverse domains, including the design and\ndevelopment of a virtual Avatar dialog system, a robotic task planner based on\nlarge language models (LLMs), a new meta-model for feature-based code\ndevelopment and many others. Our findings show that HyperGraphOS offers\nsubstantial benefits in the interaction with a computer as information system,\nas platoform for experiments and data analysis, as streamlined engineering\nprocesses, demonstrating enhanced flexibility in managing data, computation and\ndocuments, showing an innovative approaches to persistent desktop environments.",

HyperGraphOS functions as an Operating System offering\nto users an infinite workspace for creating and managing complex models\nrepresented as graphs with customizable semantics. By leveraging a web-based\narchitecture, it requires only a modern web browser for access, allowing\norganization of knowledge, documents, and content into models represented in a\nnetwork of workspaces. Elements of the workspace are defined in terms of\ndomain-specific languages (DSLs). These DSLs are pivotal for navigating\nworkspaces, generating code, triggering AI components, and organizing\ninformation and processes. The models' dual nature as both visual drawings and\ndata structures allows dynamic modifications and inspections both interactively\nas well as programaticaly. We evaluated HyperGraphOS's efficiency and\napplicability across a large set of diverse domains, including the design and\ndevelopment of a virtual Avatar dialog system, a robotic task planner based on\nlarge language models (LLMs), a new meta-model for feature-based code\ndevelopment and many others. Our findings show that HyperGraphOS offers\nsubstantial benefits in the interaction with a computer as information system,\nas platoform for experiments and data analysis, as streamlined engineering\nprocesses, demonstrating enhanced flexibility in managing data, computation and\ndocuments, showing an innovative approaches to persistent desktop environments."

While numerous studies have explored\ncalibration techniques, they primarily focus on White-Box LLMs with accessible\nparameters. Black-Box LLMs, despite their superior performance, pose heightened\nrequirements for calibration techniques due to their API-only interaction\nconstraints. Although recent researches have achieved breakthroughs in\nblack-box LLMs calibration, a systematic survey of these methodologies is still\nlacking. To bridge this gap, we presents the first comprehensive survey on\ncalibration techniques for black-box LLMs. We first define the Calibration\nProcess of LLMs as comprising two interrelated key steps: Confidence Estimation\nand Calibration. Second, we conduct a systematic review of applicable methods\nwithin black-box settings, and provide insights on the unique challenges and\nconnections in implementing these key steps. Furthermore, we explore typical\napplications of Calibration Process in black-box LLMs and outline promising\nfuture research directions, providing new perspectives for enhancing\nreliability and human-machine alignment.

For evaluation, we integrate systematic metrics and\nLLM-based metrics to assess the verifiability, organization, and other aspects\naligned with real-world scenarios. Based on this benchmark, we conduct\nextensive experiments using various models within three commonly used\nframeworks: direct RAG, hierarchical structure-based RAG, and RAG with a\nfine-tuned generation model. Experimental results show that hierarchical-based\nmethods can generate more comprehensive content, while fine-tuned methods\nachieve better verifiability. However, even the best methods still show a\nsignificant gap compared to existing Wikipedia content, indicating that further\nresearch is necessary."

Our\nfindings further reveal that the LLM performs better for supporters of\nleft-leaning parties like The Greens and The Left compared to other parties,\nand matches the least with the right-party AfD. Additionally, the inclusion or\nexclusion of specific variables in the prompts can significantly impact the\nmodels' predictions. These findings underscore the importance of aligning LLMs\nto more effectively model diverse public opinions while minimizing political\nbiases and enhancing robustness in representativeness."

This\npaper proposes GPS Intrusion Detection System, or GPS-IDS, an Anomaly-based\nintrusion detection framework to detect GPS spoofing attacks on AVs. The\nframework uses a novel physics-based vehicle behavior model where a GPS\nnavigation model is integrated into the conventional dynamic bicycle model for\naccurate AV behavior representation. Temporal features derived from this\nbehavior model are analyzed using machine learning to detect normal and\nabnormal navigation behaviors. The performance of the GPS-IDS framework is\nevaluated on the AV-GPS-Dataset -- a GPS security dataset for AVs comprising\nreal-world data collected using an AV testbed, and simulated data representing\nurban traffic environments.

While recent mainstream efforts in the LLM community mainly\nfocus on scaling data and compute for improved capabilities of LLMs, we argue\nthat it is also very important to enable LLM systems, or language agents, to\ncontinuously adapt to the diverse and ever-changing profiles of every distinct\nuser and provide up-to-date personalized assistance. We provide a clear task\nformulation and introduce a simple, general, effective, and scalable framework\nfor life-long personalization of LLM systems and language agents.

While recent mainstream efforts in the LLM community mainly\nfocus on scaling data and compute for improved capabilities of LLMs, we argue\nthat it is also very important to enable LLM systems, or language agents, to\ncontinuously adapt to the diverse and ever-changing profiles of every distinct\nuser and provide up-to-date personalized assistance. We provide a clear task\nformulation and introduce a simple, general, effective, and scalable framework\nfor life-long personalization of LLM systems and language agents. To facilitate\nfuture research on LLM personalization, we also introduce methods to synthesize\nrealistic benchmarks and robust evaluation metrics. We will release all codes\nand data for building and benchmarking life-long personalized LLM systems."

                "summary": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in\ngenerating psychotherapeutic dialogues, particularly in the context of\nmotivational interviewing (MI). However, the inherent lack of transparency in\nLLM outputs presents significant challenges given the sensitive nature of\npsychotherapy. Applying MI strategies, a set of MI skills, to generate more\ncontrollable therapeutic-adherent conversations with explainability provides a\npossible solution.

To\navoid reliability concerns with prior approaches, we propose to eliminate\nprompt engineering when probing LLMs for factual knowledge. Our approach,\ncalled Zero-Prompt Latent Knowledge Estimator (ZP-LKE), leverages the\nin-context learning ability of LLMs to communicate both the factual knowledge\nquestion as well as the expected answer format. Our knowledge estimator is both\nconceptually simpler (i.e., doesn't depend on meta-linguistic judgments of\nLLMs) and easier to apply (i.e., is not LLM-specific), and we demonstrate that\nit can surface more of the latent knowledge embedded in LLMs. We also\ninvestigate how different design choices affect the performance of ZP-LKE.\nUsing the proposed estimator, we perform a large-scale evaluation of the\nfactual knowledge of a variety of open-source LLMs, like OPT, Pythia, Llama(2),\nMistral, Gemma, etc. over a large set of relations and facts from the Wikidata\nknowledge base. We observe differences in the factual knowledge between\ndifferent model families and models of different sizes, that some relations are\nconsistently better known than others but that models differ in the precise\nfacts they know, and differences in the knowledge of base models and their\nfinetuned counterparts.

To\navoid reliability concerns with prior approaches, we propose to eliminate\nprompt engineering when probing LLMs for factual knowledge. Our approach,\ncalled Zero-Prompt Latent Knowledge Estimator (ZP-LKE), leverages the\nin-context learning ability of LLMs to communicate both the factual knowledge\nquestion as well as the expected answer format. Our knowledge estimator is both\nconceptually simpler (i.e., doesn't depend on meta-linguistic judgments of\nLLMs) and easier to apply (i.e., is not LLM-specific), and we demonstrate that\nit can surface more of the latent knowledge embedded in LLMs. We also\ninvestigate how different design choices affect the performance of ZP-LKE.\nUsing the proposed estimator, we perform a large-scale evaluation of the\nfactual knowledge of a variety of open-source LLMs, like OPT, Pythia, Llama(2),\nMistral, Gemma, etc. over a large set of relations and facts from the Wikidata\nknowledge base. We observe differences in the factual knowledge between\ndifferent model families and models of different sizes, that some relations are\nconsistently better known than others but that models differ in the precise\nfacts they know, and differences in the knowledge of base models and their\nfinetuned counterparts.

In this work, inspired by the\nrecent public release of the GPT-o1 models, we conduct the first study to\ncompare the effectiveness of different versions of the GPT-family models in\nAPR. We evaluate the performance of the latest version of the GPT-family models\n(i.e., O1-preview and O1-mini), GPT-4o, and the historical version of ChatGPT\non APR. We conduct an empirical study of the four GPT-family models against\nother LLMs and APR techniques on the QuixBugs benchmark from multiple\nevaluation perspectives, including repair success rate, repair cost, response\nlength, and behavior patterns. The results demonstrate that O1's repair\ncapability exceeds that of prior GPT-family models, successfully fixing all 40\nbugs in the benchmark.

This paper presents\nLLMLight, a novel framework employing Large Language Models (LLMs) as\ndecision-making agents for TSC.

Existing detection benchmarks are constrained by their\nreliance on static datasets, scenario-specific tasks (e.g., question answering\nand text refinement), and a primary focus on English, overlooking the diverse\nlinguistic and operational subtleties of LLMs. To address these gaps, we\npropose CUDRT, a comprehensive evaluation framework and bilingual benchmark in\nChinese and English, categorizing LLM activities into five key operations:\nCreate, Update, Delete, Rewrite, and Translate. CUDRT provides extensive\ndatasets tailored to each operation, featuring outputs from state-of-the-art\nLLMs to assess the reliability of LLM-generated text detectors. This framework\nsupports scalable, reproducible experiments and enables in-depth analysis of\nhow operational diversity, multilingual training sets, and LLM architectures\ninfluence detection performance. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the\nframework's capacity to optimize detection systems, providing critical insights\nto enhance reliability, cross-linguistic adaptability, and detection accuracy.\nBy advancing robust methodologies for identifying LLM-generated texts, this\nwork contributes to the development of intelligent systems capable of meeting\nreal-world multilingual detection challenges.

Existing detection benchmarks are constrained by their\nreliance on static datasets, scenario-specific tasks (e.g., question answering\nand text refinement), and a primary focus on English, overlooking the diverse\nlinguistic and operational subtleties of LLMs. To address these gaps, we\npropose CUDRT, a comprehensive evaluation framework and bilingual benchmark in\nChinese and English, categorizing LLM activities into five key operations:\nCreate, Update, Delete, Rewrite, and Translate. CUDRT provides extensive\ndatasets tailored to each operation, featuring outputs from state-of-the-art\nLLMs to assess the reliability of LLM-generated text detectors. This framework\nsupports scalable, reproducible experiments and enables in-depth analysis of\nhow operational diversity, multilingual training sets, and LLM architectures\ninfluence detection performance. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the\nframework's capacity to optimize detection systems, providing critical insights\nto enhance reliability, cross-linguistic adaptability, and detection accuracy.\nBy advancing robust methodologies for identifying LLM-generated texts, this\nwork contributes to the development of intelligent systems capable of meeting\nreal-world multilingual detection challenges. Source code and dataset are\navailable at GitHub."

Traditional quadrotor control approaches are limited by\ntheir reliance on flat trajectories or time-consuming optimization, which\nrestricts their flexibility. Recently, RL-based policy has emerged as a\npromising alternative due to its ability to directly map observations to\nactions, reducing the need for detailed system knowledge and actuation\nconstraints. However, a significant challenge remains in bridging the\nsim-to-real gap, where RL-based policies often experience instability when\ndeployed in real world. In this paper, we investigate key factors for learning\nrobust RL-based control policies that are capable of zero-shot deployment in\nreal-world quadrotors. We identify five critical factors and we develop a\nPPO-based training framework named SimpleFlight, which integrates these five\ntechniques. We validate the efficacy of SimpleFlight on Crazyflie quadrotor,\ndemonstrating that it achieves more than a 50% reduction in trajectory tracking\nerror compared to state-of-the-art RL baselines, and achieves 70% improvement\nover the traditional MPC. The policy derived by SimpleFlight consistently\nexcels across both smooth polynominal trajectories and challenging infeasible\nzigzag trajectories on small thrust-to-weight quadrotors. In contrast, baseline\nmethods struggle with high-speed or infeasible trajectories. To support further\nresearch and reproducibility, we integrate SimpleFlight into a GPU-based\nsimulator Omnidrones and provide open-source access to the code and model\ncheckpoints. We hope SimpleFlight will offer valuable insights for advancing\nRL-based quadrotor control. For more details, visit our project website at\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/simpleflight/.",

In this study, we propose a novel evaluation framework for\nGEC models, DSGram, integrating Semantic Coherence, Edit Level, and Fluency,\nand utilizing a dynamic weighting mechanism. Our framework employs the Analytic\nHierarchy Process (AHP) in conjunction with large language models to ascertain\nthe relative importance of various evaluation criteria. Additionally, we\ndevelop a dataset incorporating human annotations and LLM-simulated sentences\nto validate our algorithms and fine-tune more cost-effective models.\nExperimental results indicate that our proposed approach enhances the\neffectiveness of GEC model evaluations."

While numerous studies have explored\ncalibration techniques, they primarily focus on White-Box LLMs with accessible\nparameters. Black-Box LLMs, despite their superior performance, pose heightened\nrequirements for calibration techniques due to their API-only interaction\nconstraints. Although recent researches have achieved breakthroughs in\nblack-box LLMs calibration, a systematic survey of these methodologies is still\nlacking. To bridge this gap, we presents the first comprehensive survey on\ncalibration techniques for black-box LLMs. We first define the Calibration\nProcess of LLMs as comprising two interrelated key steps: Confidence Estimation\nand Calibration. Second, we conduct a systematic review of applicable methods\nwithin black-box settings, and provide insights on the unique challenges and\nconnections in implementing these key steps. Furthermore, we explore typical\napplications of Calibration Process in black-box LLMs and outline promising\nfuture research directions, providing new perspectives for enhancing\nreliability and human-machine alignment.

To tackle these, we\npropose Trigger$^3$, a large-small model collaboration framework that\nintegrates the traditional correction model and LLM for query correction,\ncapable of adaptively choosing the appropriate correction method based on the\nquery and the correction results from the traditional correction model and LLM.\nTrigger$^3$ first employs a correction trigger to filter out correct queries.\nIncorrect queries are then corrected by the traditional correction model. If\nthis fails, an LLM trigger is activated to call the LLM for correction.\nFinally, for queries that no model can correct, a fallback trigger decides to\nreturn the original query. Extensive experiments demonstrate Trigger$^3$\noutperforms correction baselines while maintaining efficiency."

This has paved\nthe way for a new generation of LLM-brained GUI agents capable of interpreting\ncomplex GUI elements and autonomously executing actions based on natural\nlanguage instructions. These agents represent a paradigm shift, enabling users\nto perform intricate, multi-step tasks through simple conversational commands.\nTheir applications span across web navigation, mobile app interactions, and\ndesktop automation, offering a transformative user experience that\nrevolutionizes how individuals interact with software. This emerging field is\nrapidly advancing, with significant progress in both research and industry.\n  To provide a structured understanding of this trend, this paper presents a\ncomprehensive survey of LLM-brained GUI agents, exploring their historical\nevolution, core components, and advanced techniques. We address research\nquestions such as existing GUI agent frameworks, the collection and utilization\nof data for training specialized GUI agents, the development of large action\nmodels tailored for GUI tasks, and the evaluation metrics and benchmarks\nnecessary to assess their effectiveness. Additionally, we examine emerging\napplications powered by these agents. Through a detailed analysis, this survey\nidentifies key research gaps and outlines a roadmap for future advancements in\nthe field.

This has paved\nthe way for a new generation of LLM-brained GUI agents capable of interpreting\ncomplex GUI elements and autonomously executing actions based on natural\nlanguage instructions. These agents represent a paradigm shift, enabling users\nto perform intricate, multi-step tasks through simple conversational commands.\nTheir applications span across web navigation, mobile app interactions, and\ndesktop automation, offering a transformative user experience that\nrevolutionizes how individuals interact with software. This emerging field is\nrapidly advancing, with significant progress in both research and industry.\n  To provide a structured understanding of this trend, this paper presents a\ncomprehensive survey of LLM-brained GUI agents, exploring their historical\nevolution, core components, and advanced techniques. We address research\nquestions such as existing GUI agent frameworks, the collection and utilization\nof data for training specialized GUI agents, the development of large action\nmodels tailored for GUI tasks, and the evaluation metrics and benchmarks\nnecessary to assess their effectiveness. Additionally, we examine emerging\napplications powered by these agents. Through a detailed analysis, this survey\nidentifies key research gaps and outlines a roadmap for future advancements in\nthe field. By consolidating foundational knowledge and state-of-the-art\ndevelopments, this work aims to guide both researchers and practitioners in\novercoming challenges and unlocking the full potential of LLM-brained GUI\nagents."
