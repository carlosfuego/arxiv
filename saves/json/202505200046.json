                "summary": "KV cache has become a de facto technique for the inference of large language\nmodels (LLMs), where tensors of shape (layer number, head number, sequence\nlength, feature dimension) are introduced to cache historical information for\nself-attention. As the size of the model and data grows, the KV cache can\nquickly become a bottleneck within the system in both storage and memory\ntransfer. To address this, prior studies usually focus on the first three axes\nof the cache tensors for compression. This paper supplements them, focusing on\nthe feature dimension axis, by utilizing low-rank projection matrices to\ntransform the cache features into spaces with reduced dimensions. We begin by\ninvestigating the canonical orthogonal projection method for data compression\nthrough principal component analysis (PCA). We observe the issue with PCA\nprojection where significant performance degradation is observed at low\ncompression rates. To bridge the gap, we propose to directly tune the\northogonal projection matrices with a distillation objective using an elaborate\nMatryoshka training strategy.

                    "value": "KV cache has become a de facto technique for the inference of large language\nmodels (LLMs), where tensors of shape (layer number, head number, sequence\nlength, feature dimension) are introduced to cache historical information for\nself-attention. As the size of the model and data grows, the KV cache can\nquickly become a bottleneck within the system in both storage and memory\ntransfer. To address this, prior studies usually focus on the first three axes\nof the cache tensors for compression. This paper supplements them, focusing on\nthe feature dimension axis, by utilizing low-rank projection matrices to\ntransform the cache features into spaces with reduced dimensions. We begin by\ninvestigating the canonical orthogonal projection method for data compression\nthrough principal component analysis (PCA). We observe the issue with PCA\nprojection where significant performance degradation is observed at low\ncompression rates. To bridge the gap, we propose to directly tune the\northogonal projection matrices with a distillation objective using an elaborate\nMatryoshka training strategy. After training, we adaptively search for the\noptimal compression rates for various layers and heads given varying\ncompression budgets. Compared to previous works, our method can easily embrace\npre-trained LLMs and hold a smooth tradeoff between performance and compression\nrate.

We also discuss the generalization of\nLASP on other linear sequence modeling methods.

Yet, learning effective long-context policies from\ndemonstrations remains challenging.

Recent methods\ntypically sidestep these issues by truncating context length, discarding\nhistorical information that may be critical for subsequent decisions. In this\npaper, we propose an alternative approach that explicitly regularizes the\nretention of past information. We first revisit the copycat problem in\nimitation learning and identify an opposite challenge in recent diffusion\npolicies: rather than over-relying on prior actions, they often fail to capture\nessential dependencies between past and future actions. To address this, we\nintroduce Past-Token Prediction (PTP), an auxiliary task in which the policy\nlearns to predict past action tokens alongside future ones. This regularization\nsignificantly improves temporal modeling in the policy head, with minimal\nreliance on visual representations. Building on this observation, we further\nintroduce a multistage training strategy: pre-train the visual encoder with\nshort contexts, and fine-tune the policy head using cached long-context\nembeddings. This strategy preserves the benefits of PTP while greatly reducing\nmemory and computational overhead. Finally, we extend PTP into a\nself-verification mechanism at test time, enabling the policy to score and\nselect candidates consistent with past actions during inference.

In this paper, we unveil novel side-channel vulnerabilities in\nlocal LLM inference: token value and token position leakage, which can expose\nboth the victim's input and output text, thereby compromising user privacy.\nSpecifically, we found that adversaries can infer the token values from the\ncache access patterns of the token embedding operation, and deduce the token\npositions from the timing of autoregressive decoding phases. To demonstrate the\npotential of these leaks, we design a novel eavesdropping attack framework\ntargeting both open-source and proprietary LLM inference systems. The attack\nframework does not directly interact with the victim's LLM and can be executed\nwithout privilege.\n  We evaluate the attack on a range of practical local LLM deployments (e.g.,\nLlama, Falcon, and Gemma), and the results show that our attack achieves\npromising accuracy.

The community relies on\nhigh-end GPUs with multiple high-bandwidth memory channels. Unfortunately,\nHBM's high bandwidth often comes at the expense of limited memory capacity,\nwhich reduces core utilization and increases costs. Recent advancements\nenabling longer contexts for LLMs have substantially increased the key-value\ncache size, further intensifying the pressures on memory capacity. The\nliterature has explored KV cache quantization techniques, which commonly use\nlow bitwidth for most values, selectively using higher bitwidth for outlier\nvalues. While this approach helps achieve high accuracy and low bitwidth\nsimultaneously, it comes with the limitation that cost for online outlier\ndetection is excessively high, negating the advantages. We propose Oaken, an\nacceleration solution that achieves high accuracy and high performance\nsimultaneously through co-designing algorithm and hardware. To effectively find\na sweet spot in the accuracy-performance trade-off space of KV cache\nquantization, Oaken employs an online-offline hybrid approach, setting outlier\nthresholds offline, which are then used to determine the quantization scale\nonline. To translate the proposed algorithmic technique into tangible\nperformance gains, Oaken also comes with custom quantization engines and memory\nmanagement units that can be integrated with any LLM accelerators. We built an\nOaken accelerator on top of an LLM accelerator, LPU, and conducted a\ncomprehensive evaluation. Our experiments show that for a batch size of 256,\nOaken achieves up to 1.58x throughput improvement over NVIDIA A100 GPU,\nincurring a minimal accuracy loss of only 0.54\\% on average, compared to\nstate-of-the-art KV cache quantization techniques.",

Based\non our practical observations, we have identified three crucial challenges: (1)\nthe impact of caching on performance isolation, as cache hits alter request\nexecution and resource consumption, leading to inaccurate traffic control; (2)\nthe dynamic changes in traffic, with changes in tenant traffic trends causing\nthrottling or resource wastage, and changes in access distribution causing hot\nkey pressure or cache hit ratio drops; and (3) the imbalanced layout of data\nnodes due to tenants' diverse resource requirements, leading to low resource\nutilization. To address these challenges, we introduce ABase, a multi-tenant\nNoSQL serverless database developed at ByteDance. ABase introduces a two-layer\ncaching mechanism with a cache-aware isolation mechanism to ensure accurate\nresource consumption estimates. Furthermore, ABase employs a predictive\nautoscaling policy to dynamically adjust resources in response to tenant\ntraffic changes and a multi-resource rescheduling algorithm to balance resource\nutilization across data nodes. With these innovations, ABase has successfully\nserved ByteDance's large-scale cloud environment, supporting a total workload\nthat has achieved a peak QPS of over 13 billion and total storage exceeding 1\nEB.",

In this paper, we present PrefillOnly,\nthe first LLM inference engine that improves the inference throughput and\nlatency by fully embracing the properties of prefill-only workloads. First,\nsince it generates only one token, PrefillOnly only needs to store the KV cache\nof only the last computed layer, rather than of all layers. This drastically\nreduces the GPU memory footprint of LLM inference and allows handling long\ninputs without using solutions that reduces throughput, such as cross-GPU KV\ncache parallelization. Second, because the output length is fixed, rather than\narbitrary, PrefillOnly can precisely determine the job completion time (JCT) of\neach prefill-only request before it starts.

To\nbridge the digital divide, this paper investigates the potential of leveraging\nmultiple high-altitude platforms (HAPs) for energy-efficient content delivery\nin wide rural regions. Each caching-enabled HAP is equipped with both\nFree-Space Optical (FSO) transceivers for backhaul links and Radio Frequency\n(RF) antenna arrays for access links.

LONGER consistently outperforms strong\nbaselines in both offline metrics and online A/B testing in both advertising\nand e-commerce services at ByteDance, validating its consistent effectiveness\nand industrial-level scaling laws. Currently, LONGER has been fully deployed at\nmore than 10 influential scenarios at ByteDance, serving billion users.",

In\nthis paper, we present LONGER, a Long-sequence Optimized traNsformer for\nGPU-Efficient Recommenders. LONGER incorporates (i) a global token mechanism\nfor stabilizing attention over long contexts, (ii) a token merge module with\nlightweight InnerTransformers and hybrid attention strategy to reduce quadratic\ncomplexity, and (iii) a series of engineering optimizations, including training\nwith mixed-precision and activation recomputation, KV cache serving, and the\nfully synchronous model training and serving framework for unified GPU-based\ndense and sparse parameter updates. LONGER consistently outperforms strong\nbaselines in both offline metrics and online A/B testing in both advertising\nand e-commerce services at ByteDance, validating its consistent effectiveness\nand industrial-level scaling laws. Currently, LONGER has been fully deployed at\nmore than 10 influential scenarios at ByteDance, serving billion users."

The key insight behind Fate is\nthat gate inputs from adjacent layers can be effectively used for expert\nprefetching, achieving high prediction accuracy without additional GPU\noverhead. Furthermore, Fate employs a shallow-favoring expert caching strategy\nthat increases the expert hit rate to 99\\%. Additionally, Fate integrates\ntailored quantization strategies for cache optimization and IO efficiency.\nExperimental results show that, compared to Load on Demand and Expert\nActivation Path-based method, Fate achieves up to 4.5x and 1.9x speedups in\nprefill speed and up to 4.1x and 2.2x speedups in decoding speed, respectively,\nwhile maintaining inference quality.

Our study investigates how compilation impacts the\nperformance and energy consumption of Python code, using seven benchmarks\ncompiled with eight different tools: PyPy, Numba, Nuitka, Mypyc, Codon, Cython,\nPyston-lite, and the experimental Python 3.13 version, compared to CPython. The\nbenchmarks are single-threaded and executed on an NUC and a server, measuring\nenergy usage, execution time, memory usage, and Last-Level Cache (LLC) miss\nrates at a fixed frequency and on a single core. The results show that\ncompilation can significantly enhance execution time, energy and memory usage,\nwith Codon, PyPy, and Numba achieving over 90\\% speed and energy improvements.\nNuitka optimizes memory usage consistently on both testbeds. The impact of\ncompilation on LLC miss rate is not clear since it varies considerably across\nbenchmarks for each compiler.

We propose a\nnovel delivery scheme consisting of two phases: partitioning and transmission.\nIn the partitioning phase, users with identical cache profiles are partitioned\ninto the minimum number of sets, such that users within each set can\nsuccessfully decode their desired message from a joint transmission enabled by\nMIMO precoding. To optimally partition the users, we employ the branch and\nbound method. In the transmission phase, each partition is treated as a single\nentity, and codewords are multicast to partitions with distinct cache profiles.\nThe proposed delivery scheme is applicable to any partially connected network,\nand while the partitioning is optimal, the overall delivery scheme, including\ntransmission, is heuristic.

We present Mixture of Sparse Attention (MoSA),\na novel approach inspired by Mixture of Experts (MoE) with expert choice\nrouting. MoSA dynamically selects tokens for each attention head, allowing\narbitrary sparse attention patterns. By selecting $k$ tokens from a sequence of\nlength $T$, MoSA reduces the computational complexity of each attention head\nfrom $O(T^2)$ to $O(k^2 + T)$. This enables using more heads within the same\ncomputational budget, allowing higher specialization. We show that among the\ntested sparse attention variants, MoSA is the only one that can outperform the\ndense baseline, sometimes with up to 27% better perplexity for an identical\ncompute budget. MoSA can also reduce the resource usage compared to dense\nself-attention. Despite using torch implementation without an optimized kernel,\nperplexity-matched MoSA models are simultaneously faster in wall-clock time,\nrequire less memory for training, and drastically reduce the size of the\nKV-cache compared to the dense transformer baselines.",

By selecting $k$ tokens from a sequence of\nlength $T$, MoSA reduces the computational complexity of each attention head\nfrom $O(T^2)$ to $O(k^2 + T)$. This enables using more heads within the same\ncomputational budget, allowing higher specialization. We show that among the\ntested sparse attention variants, MoSA is the only one that can outperform the\ndense baseline, sometimes with up to 27% better perplexity for an identical\ncompute budget. MoSA can also reduce the resource usage compared to dense\nself-attention. Despite using torch implementation without an optimized kernel,\nperplexity-matched MoSA models are simultaneously faster in wall-clock time,\nrequire less memory for training, and drastically reduce the size of the\nKV-cache compared to the dense transformer baselines."

We uncover a\ncritical issue: existing INT4 quantization methods suffer from significant\nruntime overhead (20-90%) when dequantizing either weights or partial sums on\nGPUs. To address this challenge, we introduce QoQ, a W4A8KV4 quantization\nalgorithm with 4-bit weight, 8-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache. QoQ stands\nfor quattuor-octo-quattuor, which represents 4-8-4 in Latin. QoQ is implemented\nby the QServe inference library that achieves measured speedup.

The file system\nplays a critical role in the operating system, managing all I/O activities\nbetween the application layer and the physical storage device. We observe that\nthe file system implementation is shared, leading to timing leakage when using\ncommon I/O system calls. Specifically, we found that modern operating systems\ntake advantage of any flush operation (which saves cached blocks in memory to\nthe SSD or disk) to flush all of the I/O buffers, even those used by other\nisolation domains. Thus, by measuring the delay of syncfs, the attacker can\ninfer the I/O behavior of victim programs. We then demonstrate a syncfs covert\nchannel attack on multiple file systems, including both Linux native file\nsystems and the Windows file system, achieving a maximum bandwidth of 5 Kbps\nwith an error rate of 0.15% on Linux and 7.6 Kbps with an error rate of 1.9% on\nWindows. In addition, we construct three side-channel attacks targeting both\nLinux and Android devices. On Linux devices, we implement a website\nfingerprinting attack and a video fingerprinting attack by tracking the write\npatterns of temporary buffering files. On Android devices, we design an\napplication fingerprinting attack that leaks application write patterns during\nboot-up. The attacks achieve over 90% F1 score, precision, and recall.

However, applying RL\nin real-world trading tasks remains challenging due to the non-stationarity of\nfinancial data, low signal-to-noise ratios, and various market frictions.\nAlthough numerous FinRL methods have been developed for tasks such as trading\nand portfolio management, the lack of standardized task definitions, datasets,\nenvironments, and baselines has hindered consistent evaluation and\nreproducibility. To bridge this gap, we organized three FinRL Contests from\n2023 to 2025, covering a diverse range of financial tasks such as stock\ntrading, order execution, cryptocurrency trading, and the use of large language\nmodel (LLM)-generated signals. These contests attracted 200 participants from\nover 100 institutions across 22 countries. To promote reproduction, we provided\nopen-source starter kits featuring GPU-optimized parallel market environments\nand comprehensive documentation. In this paper, we summarize these benchmarking\nefforts, detailing task formulations, data curation pipelines, environment\nimplementations, evaluation protocols, participant performance, and key\norganizational insights.",

However, applying RL\nin real-world trading tasks remains challenging due to the non-stationarity of\nfinancial data, low signal-to-noise ratios, and various market frictions.\nAlthough numerous FinRL methods have been developed for tasks such as trading\nand portfolio management, the lack of standardized task definitions, datasets,\nenvironments, and baselines has hindered consistent evaluation and\nreproducibility. To bridge this gap, we organized three FinRL Contests from\n2023 to 2025, covering a diverse range of financial tasks such as stock\ntrading, order execution, cryptocurrency trading, and the use of large language\nmodel (LLM)-generated signals. These contests attracted 200 participants from\nover 100 institutions across 22 countries. To promote reproduction, we provided\nopen-source starter kits featuring GPU-optimized parallel market environments\nand comprehensive documentation. In this paper, we summarize these benchmarking\nefforts, detailing task formulations, data curation pipelines, environment\nimplementations, evaluation protocols, participant performance, and key\norganizational insights."

Current methods for\nevaluating and mitigating these biases rely on bias-benchmark datasets. These\nbenchmarks measure bias by observing an LLM's behavior on biased statements.\nHowever, these statements lack contextual considerations of the situations they\ntry to present. To address this, we introduce a contextual reliability\nframework, which evaluates model robustness to biased statements by considering\nthe various contexts in which they may appear.

To evaluate the metric, we augmented 2,291 stereotyped\nstatements from two existing benchmark datasets by adding contextual\ninformation. We show that COBIAS aligns with human judgment on the contextual\nreliability of biased statements (Spearman's $\\rho = 0.65, p = 3.4 * 10^{-60}$)\nand can be used to create reliable benchmarks, which would assist bias\nmitigation works.",

Recent advances in\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced their\ncapabilities in this area. However, MLLMs often suffer from hallucinations,\ngenerating irrelevant or nonsensical content. To the best of our knowledge,\ndespite the importance of this issue, there has been no dedicated effort to\nevaluate emotion-related hallucinations in MLLMs. In this work, we introduce\nEmotionHallucer, the first benchmark for detecting and analyzing emotion\nhallucinations in MLLMs. Unlike humans, whose emotion understanding stems from\nthe interplay of biology and social learning, MLLMs rely solely on data-driven\nlearning and lack innate emotional instincts. Fortunately, emotion psychology\nprovides a solid foundation of knowledge about human emotions. Building on\nthis, we assess emotion hallucinations from two dimensions: emotion psychology\nknowledge and real-world multimodal perception. To support robust evaluation,\nwe utilize an adversarial binary question-answer (QA) framework, which employs\ncarefully crafted basic and hallucinated pairs to assess the emotion\nhallucination tendencies of MLLMs. By evaluating 38 LLMs and MLLMs on\nEmotionHallucer, we reveal that: i) most current models exhibit substantial\nissues with emotion hallucinations; ii) closed-source models outperform\nopen-source ones in detecting emotion hallucinations, and reasoning capability\nprovides additional advantages; iii) existing models perform better in emotion\npsychology knowledge than in multimodal emotion perception.

                "summary": "Verifying the provenance of content is crucial to the function of many\norganizations, e.g., educational institutions, social media platforms, firms,\netc. This problem is becoming increasingly challenging as text generated by\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) becomes almost indistinguishable from\nhuman-generated content. In addition, many institutions utilize in-house LLMs\nand want to ensure that external, non-sanctioned LLMs do not produce content\nwithin the institution. In this paper, we answer the following question: Given\na piece of text, can we identify whether it was produced by a particular LLM or\nnot? We model LLM-generated text as a sequential stochastic process with\ncomplete dependence on history. We then design zero-shot statistical tests to\n(i) distinguish between text generated by two different known sets of LLMs $A$\n(non-sanctioned) and $B$ (in-house), and (ii) identify whether text was\ngenerated by a known LLM or generated by any unknown model, e.g., a human or\nsome other language generation process.

                    "value": "Verifying the provenance of content is crucial to the function of many\norganizations, e.g., educational institutions, social media platforms, firms,\netc. This problem is becoming increasingly challenging as text generated by\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) becomes almost indistinguishable from\nhuman-generated content. In addition, many institutions utilize in-house LLMs\nand want to ensure that external, non-sanctioned LLMs do not produce content\nwithin the institution. In this paper, we answer the following question: Given\na piece of text, can we identify whether it was produced by a particular LLM or\nnot? We model LLM-generated text as a sequential stochastic process with\ncomplete dependence on history. We then design zero-shot statistical tests to\n(i) distinguish between text generated by two different known sets of LLMs $A$\n(non-sanctioned) and $B$ (in-house), and (ii) identify whether text was\ngenerated by a known LLM or generated by any unknown model, e.g., a human or\nsome other language generation process. We prove that the type I and type II\nerrors of our test decrease exponentially with the length of the text.

Meanwhile, noninvasive\nalternatives often rely on artifact-prone signals, require lengthy user\ntraining, and struggle to deliver robust high-dimensional control for dexterous\ntasks. To address these issues, this study introduces a novel human-centered\nmultimodal AI approach as intelligent compensatory mechanisms for lost motor\nfunctions that could potentially enable patients with severe paralysis to\ncontrol high-dimensional assistive devices, such as dexterous robotic arms,\nusing limited and noninvasive inputs. In contrast to the current\nstate-of-the-art (SoTA) noninvasive approaches, our context-aware, multimodal\nshared-autonomy framework integrates deep reinforcement learning algorithms to\nblend limited low-dimensional user input with real-time environmental\nperception, enabling adaptive, dynamic, and intelligent interpretation of human\nintent for complex dexterous manipulation tasks, such as pick-and-place. The\nresults from our ARAS (Adaptive Reinforcement learning for Amplification of\nlimited inputs in Shared autonomy) trained with synthetic users over 50,000\ncomputer simulation episodes demonstrated the first successful implementation\nof the proposed closed-loop human-in-the-loop paradigm, outperforming the SoTA\nshared autonomy algorithms. Following a zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, ARAS\nwas evaluated on 23 human subjects, demonstrating high accuracy in dynamic\nintent detection and smooth, stable 3D trajectory control for dexterous\npick-and-place tasks.

Our approach\nenables state-of-the-art models $\\unicode{x2013}$ including\nPhi-3-mini-4k-instruct and Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct $\\unicode{x2013}$ to retain\nperformance comparable to 4-bit weight, 8-bit activation baselines, despite the\npresence of analog noise and quantization constraints. Additionally, we show\nthat as a byproduct of our training methodology, analog foundation models can\nbe quantized for inference on low-precision digital hardware. Finally, we show\nthat our models also benefit from test-time compute scaling, showing better\nscaling behavior than models trained with 4-bit weight and 8-bit static input\nquantization. Our work bridges the gap between high-capacity LLMs and efficient\nanalog hardware, offering a path toward energy-efficient foundation models.\nCode is available at https://github.com/IBM/analog-foundation-models."

Evaluations on vocal effects transfer on the\nMedleyDB dataset show significant improvements across metrics compared to\nbaselines, including a blind audio effects estimator, nearest-neighbour\napproaches, and uncalibrated ST-ITO. The proposed calibration reduces parameter\nmean squared error by up to 33% and matches the reference style better.\nSubjective evaluations with 16 participants confirm our method's superiority,\nespecially in limited data regimes.

Recent research has\nexplored using reinforcement learning (RL) to improve LLMs' search capabilities\nby interacting with live search engines in real-world environments. While these\napproaches show promising results, they face two major challenges: (1)\nUncontrolled Document Quality: The quality of documents returned by search\nengines is often unpredictable, introducing noise and instability into the\ntraining process. (2) Prohibitively High API Costs: RL training requires\nfrequent rollouts, potentially involving hundreds of thousands of search\nrequests, which incur substantial API expenses and severely constrain\nscalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ZeroSearch, a novel RL\nframework that incentivizes the capabilities of LLMs to use a real search\nengine with simulated searches during training. Our approach begins with\nlightweight supervised fine-tuning to transform the LLM into a retrieval module\ncapable of generating both useful and noisy documents in response to a query.\nDuring RL training, we employ a curriculum-based rollout strategy that\nincrementally degrades the quality of generated documents, progressively\neliciting the model's reasoning ability by exposing it to increasingly\nchallenging retrieval scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nZeroSearch effectively incentivizes the search capabilities of LLMs using a 3B\nLLM as the retrieval module. Remarkably, a 7B retrieval module achieves\ncomparable performance to the real search engine, while a 14B retrieval module\neven surpasses it.

The distributional shift causes decoding-time queries to fail to align\nwell with the appropriate keys from the prefill stage, leading to a drop in\nperformance. We propose a simple, novel, and effective procedure for correcting\nthis distributional shift, bringing the distribution of sparse attention\noutputs closer to that of quadratic attention. Our method can be applied on top\nof any sparse attention method, and results in an average 36%pt performance\nincrease, recovering 88% of quadratic attention accuracy on the 131K RULER\nbenchmark when applied on top of sliding window attention with sink tokens\nwhile only adding a small overhead. Our method can maintain approximately 98.5%\nsparsity over full quadratic attention, making our model 32 times faster than\nFlash Attention 2 when processing 1M token prefills."

However, these\nsafety-critical scenarios are rare and difficult to collect from real-world\ndriving data, posing significant challenges to effectively assessing the\nperformance of autonomous vehicles.

                "summary": "The development of reasoning capabilities represents a critical frontier in\nlarge language models (LLMs) research, where reinforcement learning (RL) and\nprocess reward models (PRMs) have emerged as predominant methodological\nframeworks. Contrary to conventional wisdom, empirical evidence from\nDeepSeek-R1 demonstrates that pure RL training focused on mathematical\nproblem-solving can progressively enhance reasoning abilities without PRM\nintegration, challenging the perceived necessity of process supervision. In\nthis study, we conduct a systematic investigation of the relationship between\nRL training and PRM capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that problem-solving\nproficiency and process supervision capabilities represent complementary\ndimensions of reasoning that co-evolve synergistically during pure RL training.\nIn particular, current PRMs underperform simple baselines like majority voting\nwhen applied to state-of-the-art models such as DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B. To\naddress this limitation, we propose Self-PRM, an introspective framework in\nwhich models autonomously evaluate and rerank their generated solutions through\nself-reward mechanisms. Although Self-PRM consistently improves the accuracy of\nthe benchmark (particularly with larger sample sizes), analysis exposes\npersistent challenges: The approach exhibits low precision (<10\\%) on difficult\nproblems, frequently misclassifying flawed solutions as valid. These analyses\nunderscore the need for continued RL scaling to improve reward alignment and\nintrospective accuracy. Overall, our findings suggest that PRM may not be\nessential for enhancing complex reasoning, as pure RL not only improves\nproblem-solving skills but also inherently fosters robust PRM capabilities. We\nhope these findings provide actionable insights for building more reliable and\nself-aware complex reasoning models.",

                    "value": "The development of reasoning capabilities represents a critical frontier in\nlarge language models (LLMs) research, where reinforcement learning (RL) and\nprocess reward models (PRMs) have emerged as predominant methodological\nframeworks. Contrary to conventional wisdom, empirical evidence from\nDeepSeek-R1 demonstrates that pure RL training focused on mathematical\nproblem-solving can progressively enhance reasoning abilities without PRM\nintegration, challenging the perceived necessity of process supervision. In\nthis study, we conduct a systematic investigation of the relationship between\nRL training and PRM capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that problem-solving\nproficiency and process supervision capabilities represent complementary\ndimensions of reasoning that co-evolve synergistically during pure RL training.\nIn particular, current PRMs underperform simple baselines like majority voting\nwhen applied to state-of-the-art models such as DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B. To\naddress this limitation, we propose Self-PRM, an introspective framework in\nwhich models autonomously evaluate and rerank their generated solutions through\nself-reward mechanisms. Although Self-PRM consistently improves the accuracy of\nthe benchmark (particularly with larger sample sizes), analysis exposes\npersistent challenges: The approach exhibits low precision (<10\\%) on difficult\nproblems, frequently misclassifying flawed solutions as valid. These analyses\nunderscore the need for continued RL scaling to improve reward alignment and\nintrospective accuracy. Overall, our findings suggest that PRM may not be\nessential for enhancing complex reasoning, as pure RL not only improves\nproblem-solving skills but also inherently fosters robust PRM capabilities. We\nhope these findings provide actionable insights for building more reliable and\nself-aware complex reasoning models."

A\nkey innovation is our Hybrid Sequence-level Contrastive Alignment Learning\n(H-SCALE), which improves cross-modal learning by matching mean- and std-pooled\nprotein embeddings with text representations via contrastive loss. After the\nalignment phase, we apply instruction-based fine-tuning using LoRA on the\ndecoder to teach the model how to generate accurate protein function\ndescriptions conditioned on the protein sequence. We train Prot2Text-V2 on\nabout 250K curated entries from SwissProt and evaluate it under low-homology\nconditions, where test sequences have low similarity with training samples.\nProt2Text-V2 consistently outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines\nacross various metrics.",

A\nkey innovation is our Hybrid Sequence-level Contrastive Alignment Learning\n(H-SCALE), which improves cross-modal learning by matching mean- and std-pooled\nprotein embeddings with text representations via contrastive loss. After the\nalignment phase, we apply instruction-based fine-tuning using LoRA on the\ndecoder to teach the model how to generate accurate protein function\ndescriptions conditioned on the protein sequence. We train Prot2Text-V2 on\nabout 250K curated entries from SwissProt and evaluate it under low-homology\nconditions, where test sequences have low similarity with training samples.\nProt2Text-V2 consistently outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines\nacross various metrics."

Here we\ndemonstrate the existence of a learning transition, having signatures in the\nlong distance behavior of conditional correlation functions, in the\ntwo-dimensional classical Ising model. This transition, which arises when\nlearning local energy densities, extends all the way from the\ninfinite-temperature paramagnetic state down to the thermal critical state. The\nintersection of the line of learning transitions and the thermal Ising\ntransition is a novel tricritical point. Our model for learning also describes\nthe effects of weak measurements on a family of quantum states which\ninterpolate between the (topologically ordered) toric code and a trivial\nproduct state. Notably, the location of the above tricritical point implies\nthat the quantum memory in the entire topological phase is robust to weak\nmeasurement, even when the initial state is arbitrarily close to the quantum\nphase transition separating topological and trivial phases. Our analysis uses a\nreplica field theory combined with the renormalization group, and we chart out\nthe phase diagram using a combination of tensor network and Monte Carlo\ntechniques. Our methods can be extended to study the more general effects of\nlearning on both classical and quantum states.",

                    "value": "Conditional probability distributions describe the effect of learning an\ninitially unknown classical state through Bayesian inference. Here we\ndemonstrate the existence of a learning transition, having signatures in the\nlong distance behavior of conditional correlation functions, in the\ntwo-dimensional classical Ising model. This transition, which arises when\nlearning local energy densities, extends all the way from the\ninfinite-temperature paramagnetic state down to the thermal critical state. The\nintersection of the line of learning transitions and the thermal Ising\ntransition is a novel tricritical point. Our model for learning also describes\nthe effects of weak measurements on a family of quantum states which\ninterpolate between the (topologically ordered) toric code and a trivial\nproduct state. Notably, the location of the above tricritical point implies\nthat the quantum memory in the entire topological phase is robust to weak\nmeasurement, even when the initial state is arbitrarily close to the quantum\nphase transition separating topological and trivial phases. Our analysis uses a\nreplica field theory combined with the renormalization group, and we chart out\nthe phase diagram using a combination of tensor network and Monte Carlo\ntechniques. Our methods can be extended to study the more general effects of\nlearning on both classical and quantum states."

We present\na reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs using Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO), guided by a reward function that considers both functional\ncorrectness, validated through test cases, and execution performance relative\nto the industry-standard compiler gcc -O3. To support this study, we introduce\na benchmark of 8,072 real-world programs. Our model, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-PPO,\nachieves 96.0% test pass rates and an average speedup of 1.47x over the gcc -O3\nbaseline, outperforming all 20 other models evaluated, including\nClaude-3.7-sonnet. These results indicate that reinforcement learning can\nunlock the potential of LLMs to serve as effective optimizers for assembly code\nperformance."

We address this by separating\n11 biomedical QA benchmarks into reasoning- and knowledge-focused subsets using\na PubMedBERT classifier that reaches 81 percent accuracy, comparable to human\nperformance. Our analysis shows that only 32.8 percent of questions require\ncomplex reasoning. We evaluate biomedical models (HuatuoGPT-o1, MedReason, m1)\nand general-domain models (DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, Qwen3), finding consistent\ngaps between knowledge and reasoning performance.

Our analysis shows that only 32.8 percent of questions require\ncomplex reasoning.

To address this, we introduce a contextual reliability\nframework, which evaluates model robustness to biased statements by considering\nthe various contexts in which they may appear. We develop the Context-Oriented\nBias Indicator and Assessment Score (COBIAS) to measure a biased statement's\nreliability in detecting bias, based on the variance in model behavior across\ndifferent contexts. To evaluate the metric, we augmented 2,291 stereotyped\nstatements from two existing benchmark datasets by adding contextual\ninformation. We show that COBIAS aligns with human judgment on the contextual\nreliability of biased statements (Spearman's $\\rho = 0.65, p = 3.4 * 10^{-60}$)\nand can be used to create reliable benchmarks, which would assist bias\nmitigation works.",

This task\nwas initially researched with a focus on developing methods to help machines\nunderstand objects and scene contexts in images. However, some scene text that\ncarries explicit information about the full content of the image is not\nmentioned. Along with the continuous development of the AI era, there have been\nmany studies on the reading comprehension ability of VQA models in the world.\nTherefore, we introduce the first large-scale dataset in Vietnamese\nspecializing in the ability to understand scene text, we call it ViTextVQA\n(\\textbf{Vi}etnamese \\textbf{Text}-based \\textbf{V}isual \\textbf{Q}uestion\n\\textbf{A}nswering dataset) which contains \\textbf{over 16,000} images and\n\\textbf{over 50,000} questions with answers. To tackle this task efficiently,\nwe propose ViTextBLIP-2, an novel multimodal feature fusion Method, which\noptimizes Vietnamese OCR-based VQA by integrating a frozen Vision Transformer,\nSwinTextSpotter OCR, and ViT5 LLM with a trainable Q-Former for multimodal\nfeature fusion. Through experiments with various state-of-the-art models, we\nuncover the significance of the order in which tokens in OCR text are processed\nand selected to formulate answers.

We introduce PathEval, a\nnovel benchmark evaluating VLMs as plan evaluators in complex path-planning\nscenarios.

Our analysis of state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that these models\nface significant challenges on the benchmark. We observe that the VLMs can\nprecisely abstract given scenarios to identify the desired traits and exhibit\nmixed performance in integrating the provided information. Yet, their vision\ncomponent presents a critical bottleneck, with models struggling to perceive\nlow-level details about a path. Our experimental results show that this issue\ncannot be trivially addressed via end-to-end fine-tuning; rather, task-specific\ndiscriminative adaptation of these vision encoders is needed for these VLMs to\nbecome effective path evaluators.",

We observe that the VLMs can\nprecisely abstract given scenarios to identify the desired traits and exhibit\nmixed performance in integrating the provided information. Yet, their vision\ncomponent presents a critical bottleneck, with models struggling to perceive\nlow-level details about a path. Our experimental results show that this issue\ncannot be trivially addressed via end-to-end fine-tuning; rather, task-specific\ndiscriminative adaptation of these vision encoders is needed for these VLMs to\nbecome effective path evaluators."

Our analysis reveals that many state-of-the-art LLMs remain\nvulnerable to jailbreaks that subtly rephrase harmful prompts, while also\nover-refusing safe but atypically phrased queries. Finally, we propose a\nmitigation strategy using a lightweight classifier to detect jailbreak attempts\nand steer models toward safer behavior via reminder-based conditioning. CARES\nprovides a rigorous framework for testing and improving medical LLM safety\nunder adversarial and ambiguous conditions."

In addition, many institutions utilize in-house LLMs\nand want to ensure that external, non-sanctioned LLMs do not produce content\nwithin the institution. In this paper, we answer the following question: Given\na piece of text, can we identify whether it was produced by a particular LLM or\nnot? We model LLM-generated text as a sequential stochastic process with\ncomplete dependence on history. We then design zero-shot statistical tests to\n(i) distinguish between text generated by two different known sets of LLMs $A$\n(non-sanctioned) and $B$ (in-house), and (ii) identify whether text was\ngenerated by a known LLM or generated by any unknown model, e.g., a human or\nsome other language generation process. We prove that the type I and type II\nerrors of our test decrease exponentially with the length of the text. For\nthat, we show that if $B$ generates the text, then except with an exponentially\nsmall probability in string length, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$\nconverges to the average cross-entropy of $B$ and $A$. We then present\nexperiments using LLMs with white-box access to support our theoretical results\nand empirically examine the robustness of our results to black-box settings and\nadversarial attacks. In the black-box setting, our method achieves an average\nTPR of 82.5\\% at a fixed FPR of 5\\%. Under adversarial perturbations, our\nminimum TPR is 48.6\\% at the same FPR threshold. Both results outperform all\nnon-commercial baselines. See\nhttps://github.com/TaraRadvand74/llm-text-detection for code, data, and an\nonline demo of the project.",

                "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed as autonomous agents\ncapable of following user instructions and making decisions in real-world\napplications. Previous studies have made notable progress in benchmarking the\ninstruction following capabilities of LLMs in general domains, with a primary\nfocus on their inherent commonsense knowledge. Recently, LLMs have been\nincreasingly deployed as domain-oriented agents, which rely on domain-oriented\nguidelines that may conflict with their commonsense knowledge.

Additionally, we\npropose to control the decode-time influence of the USM and LLM using a softmax\ntemperature, which shows effectiveness in domain adaptation."

Incalmo enables LLMs\nto specify high-level actions (e.g., infect a host, scan a network). Incalmo's\ntranslation layer converts these actions into lower-level primitives (e.g.,\ncommands to exploit tools) through expert agents. In 9 out of 10 networks in\nMHBench, LLMs using Incalmo achieve at least some of the attack goals.

We proceed by adapting\nvarious explainability techniques to different aerial combat scenarios to gain\nexplanatory insights about the model behavior. By linking AI-generated tactics\nwith human-understandable reasoning, we emphasize the need for transparency to\nensure reliable deployment and meaningful human-machine interaction.

However, its practical deployment in\nsensitive military contexts is constrained by the lack of explainability, which\nis an essential factor for trust, safety, and alignment with human strategies.\nThis work reviews and assesses current advances in explainability methods for\nMARL with a focus on simulated air combat scenarios. We proceed by adapting\nvarious explainability techniques to different aerial combat scenarios to gain\nexplanatory insights about the model behavior. By linking AI-generated tactics\nwith human-understandable reasoning, we emphasize the need for transparency to\nensure reliable deployment and meaningful human-machine interaction. By\nilluminating the crucial importance of explainability in advancing MARL for\noperational defense, our work supports not only strategic planning but also the\ntraining of military personnel with insightful and comprehensible analyses."

Our approach adopts a\ndual-phase training paradigm: first, the model learns to pre-estimate the\nreasoning cost based on the difficulty of the query. Then, we introduce\nbudget-guided GPRO for reinforcement learning, which effectively maintains\naccuracy while reducing output length. SelfBudgeter allows users to anticipate\ngeneration time and make informed decisions about continuing or interrupting\nthe process. Furthermore, our method enables direct manipulation of reasoning\nlength via pre-filling token budget. Experimental results demonstrate that\nSelfBudgeter can rationally allocate budgets according to problem complexity,\nachieving up to 74.47% response length compression on the MATH benchmark while\nmaintaining nearly undiminished accuracy.",

This study examines the use of LLMs for AI\nethics in practice, assessing how LLM trustworthiness-enhancing techniques\naffect software development in this context. Using the Design Science Research\n(DSR) method, we identify techniques for LLM trustworthiness: multi-agents,\ndistinct roles, structured communication, and multiple rounds of debate. We\ndesign a multi-agent prototype LLM-MAS, where agents engage in structured\ndiscussions on real-world AI ethics issues from the AI Incident Database. We\nevaluate the prototype across three case scenarios using thematic analysis,\nhierarchical clustering, comparative (baseline) studies, and running source\ncode. The system generates approximately 2,000 lines of code per case, compared\nto only 80 lines in baseline trials. Discussions reveal terms like bias\ndetection, transparency, accountability, user consent, GDPR compliance,\nfairness evaluation, and EU AI Act compliance, showing this prototype ability\nto generate extensive source code and documentation addressing often overlooked\nAI ethics issues. However, practical challenges in source code integration and\ndependency management may limit its use by practitioners.",

This study examines the use of LLMs for AI\nethics in practice, assessing how LLM trustworthiness-enhancing techniques\naffect software development in this context. Using the Design Science Research\n(DSR) method, we identify techniques for LLM trustworthiness: multi-agents,\ndistinct roles, structured communication, and multiple rounds of debate. We\ndesign a multi-agent prototype LLM-MAS, where agents engage in structured\ndiscussions on real-world AI ethics issues from the AI Incident Database. We\nevaluate the prototype across three case scenarios using thematic analysis,\nhierarchical clustering, comparative (baseline) studies, and running source\ncode. The system generates approximately 2,000 lines of code per case, compared\nto only 80 lines in baseline trials. Discussions reveal terms like bias\ndetection, transparency, accountability, user consent, GDPR compliance,\nfairness evaluation, and EU AI Act compliance, showing this prototype ability\nto generate extensive source code and documentation addressing often overlooked\nAI ethics issues. However, practical challenges in source code integration and\ndependency management may limit its use by practitioners."

We find that, so long as next-token prediction\nconverges to its true probability distribution, random sampling is consistent\nwith outputting sequences that mimic sampling from the true probability\ndistribution. For the other goals, such as minimizing the 0-1 loss on the\nentire sequence, we show no polynomial-time algorithm is optimal for all\nprobability distributions and all decoding algorithms studied are only optimal\nfor a subset of probability distributions. When analyzing these results, we see\nthat there is a dichotomy created between the goals of information retrieval\nand creative generation for the decoding algorithms. This shows that choosing\nthe correct decoding algorithm based on the desired goal is extremely important\nand many of the ones used are lacking theoretical grounding in numerous\nscenarios.",

We find that, so long as next-token prediction\nconverges to its true probability distribution, random sampling is consistent\nwith outputting sequences that mimic sampling from the true probability\ndistribution. For the other goals, such as minimizing the 0-1 loss on the\nentire sequence, we show no polynomial-time algorithm is optimal for all\nprobability distributions and all decoding algorithms studied are only optimal\nfor a subset of probability distributions. When analyzing these results, we see\nthat there is a dichotomy created between the goals of information retrieval\nand creative generation for the decoding algorithms. This shows that choosing\nthe correct decoding algorithm based on the desired goal is extremely important\nand many of the ones used are lacking theoretical grounding in numerous\nscenarios."

Experimental results show that SoLoPO\nenhances all these algorithms with respect to stronger length and domain\ngeneralization abilities across various long-context benchmarks, while\nachieving notable improvements in both computational and memory efficiency."

While traditional formulaic\nalpha mining relies on human expertise, contemporary automated methods, such as\nthose based on genetic programming or reinforcement learning, often suffer from\nsearch inefficiency or yield poorly interpretable alpha factors. This paper\nintroduces a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with\nMonte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to overcome these limitations.

                    "value": "Alpha factor mining is pivotal in quantitative investment for identifying\npredictive signals from complex financial data. While traditional formulaic\nalpha mining relies on human expertise, contemporary automated methods, such as\nthose based on genetic programming or reinforcement learning, often suffer from\nsearch inefficiency or yield poorly interpretable alpha factors. This paper\nintroduces a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with\nMonte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to overcome these limitations.

We evaluate the effectiveness of methods\nto detect lying and deception: logistic regression on the activations and\nsparse autoencoders (SAEs). We find that probes trained on a dataset of\n``pretend you're a dishonest model: $\\dots$'' generalize extremely well\nout-of-distribution, consistently obtaining AUROCs over 95% even when evaluated\njust on the deceptive statement, without the chain of thought. We also find two\nSAE features that work well at deception detection but are unable to steer the\nmodel to lie less. We hope our open-sourced sandbox, game logs, and probes\nserve to anticipate and mitigate deceptive behavior and capabilities in\nlanguage-based agents."
