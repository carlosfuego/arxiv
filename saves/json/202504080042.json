To speed up the prefill of the long\nLLM inputs, one can pre-compute the KV cache of a text and re-use the KV cache\nwhen the context is reused as the prefix of another LLM input. However, the\nreused text chunks are not always the input prefix, which makes precomputed KV\ncaches not directly usable since they ignore the text's cross-attention with\nthe preceding texts. Thus, the benefits of reusing KV caches remain largely\nunrealized.\n  This paper tackles just one challenge: when an LLM input contains multiple\ntext chunks, how to quickly combine their precomputed KV caches in order to\nachieve the same generation quality as the expensive full prefill (i.e.,\nwithout reusing KV cache)? This challenge naturally arises in\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where the input is supplemented with\nmultiple retrieved texts as the context. We present CacheBlend, a scheme that\nreuses the precomputed KV caches, regardless prefix or not, and selectively\nrecomputes the KV values of a small subset of tokens to partially update each\nreused KV cache. In the meantime, the small extra delay for recomputing some\ntokens can be pipelined with the retrieval of KV caches within the same job,\nallowing CacheBlend to store KV caches in slower devices with more storage\ncapacity while retrieving them without increasing the inference delay. By\ncomparing CacheBlend with the state-of-the-art KV cache reusing schemes on\nthree open-source LLMs of various sizes and four popular benchmark datasets of\ndifferent tasks, we show that CacheBlend reduces time-to-first-token (TTFT) by\n2.2-3.3x and increases the inference throughput by 2.8-5x from full KV\nrecompute without compromising generation quality.

However, cGAs have a tendency to repeatedly\ngenerate the same chromosomes as they approach convergence, resulting in\nunnecessary evaluations of identical chromosomes. This article introduces the\nconcept of caching in cGAs as a means of avoiding redundant evaluations of the\nsame chromosomes. Our proposed approach operates equivalently to cGAs, but\nenhances the algorithm's time efficiency by reducing the number of function\nevaluations. We also present a data structure for efficient cache maintenance\nto ensure low overhead. The proposed caching approach has an asymptotically\nconstant time complexity on average. The proposed method further generalizes\nthe caching mechanism with higher selection pressure for elitism-based cGAs. We\nconduct a rigorous analysis based on experiments on benchmark optimization\nproblems using two well-known cache replacement strategies.

                    "value": "Compact Genetic Algorithms (cGAs) are condensed variants of classical Genetic\nAlgorithms (GAs) that use a probability vector representation of the population\ninstead of the complete population. cGAs have been shown to significantly\nreduce the number of function evaluations required while producing outcomes\nsimilar to those of classical GAs. However, cGAs have a tendency to repeatedly\ngenerate the same chromosomes as they approach convergence, resulting in\nunnecessary evaluations of identical chromosomes. This article introduces the\nconcept of caching in cGAs as a means of avoiding redundant evaluations of the\nsame chromosomes. Our proposed approach operates equivalently to cGAs, but\nenhances the algorithm's time efficiency by reducing the number of function\nevaluations. We also present a data structure for efficient cache maintenance\nto ensure low overhead. The proposed caching approach has an asymptotically\nconstant time complexity on average. The proposed method further generalizes\nthe caching mechanism with higher selection pressure for elitism-based cGAs. We\nconduct a rigorous analysis based on experiments on benchmark optimization\nproblems using two well-known cache replacement strategies. The results\ndemonstrate that caching significantly reduces the number of function\nevaluations required while maintaining the same level of performance accuracy."

MagicDec first identifies the bottleneck shifts with\nincreasing batch size and sequence length, and uses these insights to deploy SD\nmore effectively for high throughput inference. We leverage draft model with\nsparse KV cache to address the KV bottleneck, which scales with both sequence\nlength and batch size. Additionally, we propose a theoretical model to select\nthe optimal drafting strategy for maximum speedup.

On the one hand, slide\nelectrification generates electricity with possible applications on tiny\ndevices. On the other hand, the potential of up to 1 KV generated by slide\nelectrification alters wetting and drop motion. Therefore, it is important to\nknow the factors that affect slide electrification. To find out how surfactants\naffect slide electrification, we measured drop charges of aqueous drops\ncontaining cationic CTAB, anionic SDS and neutral C8E3 sliding on different\nhydrophobic surfaces. The result is: addition of surfactant significantly\nreduces the spontaneous charging of moving water drops. Based on zeta potential\nmeasurements, confocal microscopy of deposited surface-active dyes and drop\nimpact studies, we propose that several factors contribute to this suppression\nof charge separation: (1) Surfactants tend to lower the contact angles, which\nreduces charge separation. (2) Surfactant adsorption at the solid-liquid\ninterface can reduce the density of primary ions, particularly for anionic\nsurfactants. (3) Anionic and neutral surfactants are mostly transferred to the\nliquid-air interface at the rear of the sliding drop, retaining primary ions\nwithin the drop.

It reduces redundant computation at the cost of\nincreased memory usage. To mitigate this overhead, existing approaches compress\nKV tensors into lower-bit representations; however, quantization errors can\naccumulate as more tokens are generated, potentially resulting in undesired\noutputs. In this paper, we introduce SQuat (Subspace-orthogonal KV cache\nquantization). It first constructs a subspace spanned by query tensors to\ncapture the most critical task-related information. During key tensor\nquantization, it enforces that the difference between the (de)quantized and\noriginal keys remains orthogonal to this subspace, minimizing the impact of\nquantization errors on the attention mechanism's outputs. SQuat requires no\nmodel fine-tuning, no additional calibration dataset for offline learning, and\nis grounded in a theoretical framework we develop. Through numerical\nexperiments, we show that our method reduces peak memory by 2.17 to 2.82,\nimproves throughput by 2.45 to 3.60, and achieves more favorable benchmark\nscores than existing KV cache quantization algorithms.",

                    "value": "The key-value (KV) cache accelerates LLMs decoding by storing KV tensors from\npreviously generated tokens. It reduces redundant computation at the cost of\nincreased memory usage. To mitigate this overhead, existing approaches compress\nKV tensors into lower-bit representations; however, quantization errors can\naccumulate as more tokens are generated, potentially resulting in undesired\noutputs. In this paper, we introduce SQuat (Subspace-orthogonal KV cache\nquantization). It first constructs a subspace spanned by query tensors to\ncapture the most critical task-related information. During key tensor\nquantization, it enforces that the difference between the (de)quantized and\noriginal keys remains orthogonal to this subspace, minimizing the impact of\nquantization errors on the attention mechanism's outputs. SQuat requires no\nmodel fine-tuning, no additional calibration dataset for offline learning, and\nis grounded in a theoretical framework we develop. Through numerical\nexperiments, we show that our method reduces peak memory by 2.17 to 2.82,\nimproves throughput by 2.45 to 3.60, and achieves more favorable benchmark\nscores than existing KV cache quantization algorithms."

                "summary": "Test-time adaptation (TTA) of visual language models has recently attracted\nsignificant attention as a solution to the performance degradation caused by\ndistribution shifts in downstream tasks. However, existing cache-based TTA\nmethods have certain limitations. They mainly rely on the accuracy of cached\nfeature labels, and the presence of noisy pseudo-labels can cause these\nfeatures to deviate from their true distribution. This makes cache retrieval\nmethods based on similarity matching highly sensitive to outliers or extreme\nsamples. Moreover, current methods lack effective mechanisms to model class\ndistributions, which limits their ability to fully exploit the potential of\ncached information. To address these challenges, we introduce a comprehensive\nand reliable caching mechanism and propose a novel zero-shot TTA method called\n\"Cache, Residual, Gaussian\" (CRG). This method not only employs learnable\nresidual parameters to better align positive and negative visual prototypes\nwith text prototypes, thereby optimizing the quality of cached features, but\nalso incorporates Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA) to dynamically model\nintra-class feature distributions, further mitigating the impact of noisy\nfeatures. Experimental results on 13 benchmarks demonstrate that CRG\noutperforms state-of-the-art TTA methods, showcasing exceptional robustness and\nadaptability.",

                    "value": "Test-time adaptation (TTA) of visual language models has recently attracted\nsignificant attention as a solution to the performance degradation caused by\ndistribution shifts in downstream tasks. However, existing cache-based TTA\nmethods have certain limitations. They mainly rely on the accuracy of cached\nfeature labels, and the presence of noisy pseudo-labels can cause these\nfeatures to deviate from their true distribution. This makes cache retrieval\nmethods based on similarity matching highly sensitive to outliers or extreme\nsamples. Moreover, current methods lack effective mechanisms to model class\ndistributions, which limits their ability to fully exploit the potential of\ncached information. To address these challenges, we introduce a comprehensive\nand reliable caching mechanism and propose a novel zero-shot TTA method called\n\"Cache, Residual, Gaussian\" (CRG). This method not only employs learnable\nresidual parameters to better align positive and negative visual prototypes\nwith text prototypes, thereby optimizing the quality of cached features, but\nalso incorporates Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA) to dynamically model\nintra-class feature distributions, further mitigating the impact of noisy\nfeatures. Experimental results on 13 benchmarks demonstrate that CRG\noutperforms state-of-the-art TTA methods, showcasing exceptional robustness and\nadaptability."

While cache-based methods show promise by\nleveraging historical information, they struggle with both caching unreliable\nfeature-label pairs and indiscriminately using single-class information during\nquerying, significantly compromising adaptation accuracy. To address these\nlimitations, we propose COSMIC (Clique-Oriented Semantic Multi-space\nIntegration for CLIP), a robust test-time adaptation framework that enhances\nadaptability through multi-granular, cross-modal semantic caching and\ngraph-based querying mechanisms. Our framework introduces two key innovations:\nDual Semantics Graph (DSG) and Clique Guided Hyper-class (CGH). The Dual\nSemantics Graph constructs complementary semantic spaces by incorporating\ntextual features, coarse-grained CLIP features, and fine-grained DINOv2\nfeatures to capture rich semantic relationships. Building upon these dual\ngraphs, the Clique Guided Hyper-class component leverages structured class\nrelationships to enhance prediction robustness through correlated class\nselection. Extensive experiments demonstrate COSMIC's superior performance\nacross multiple benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over\nstate-of-the-art methods: 15.81% gain on out-of-distribution tasks and 5.33% on\ncross-domain generation with CLIP RN-50.

However, current FSDMC research often\nlacks generalizability due to its focus on specific datasets. Additionally,\ndefect classification heavily relies on contextual information within images,\nand existing methods fall short of effectively extracting this information. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a general FSDMC framework called MVREC,\nwhich offers two primary advantages: (1) MVREC extracts general features for\ndefect instances by incorporating the pre-trained AlphaCLIP model. (2) It\nutilizes a region-context framework to enhance defect features by leveraging\nmask region input and multi-view context augmentation. Furthermore, Few-shot\nZip-Adapter(-F) classifiers within the model are introduced to cache the visual\nfeatures of the support set and perform few-shot classification. We also\nintroduce MVTec-FS, a new FSDMC benchmark based on MVTec AD, which includes\n1228 defect images with instance-level mask annotations and 46 defect types.\nExtensive experiments conducted on MVTec-FS and four additional datasets\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in general defect classification and its ability\nto incorporate contextual information to improve classification performance.\nCode: https://github.com/ShuaiLYU/MVREC",

                "summary": "The growing prevalence of data-intensive workloads, such as artificial\nintelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), high-performance computing (HPC),\nin-memory databases, and real-time analytics, has exposed limitations in\nconventional memory technologies like DRAM. While DRAM offers low latency and\nhigh throughput, it is constrained by high costs, scalability challenges, and\nvolatility, making it less viable for capacity-bound and persistent\napplications in modern datacenters.\n  Recently, Compute Express Link (CXL) has emerged as a promising alternative,\nenabling high-speed, cacheline-granular communication between CPUs and external\ndevices. By leveraging CXL technology, NAND flash can now be used as memory\nexpansion, offering three-fold benefits: byte-addressability, scalable\ncapacity, and persistence at a low cost. Samsung's CXL Memory Module Hybrid\n(CMM-H) is the first product to deliver these benefits through a hardware-only\nsolution, i.e., it does not incur any OS and IO overheads like conventional\nblock devices.

                    "value": "The growing prevalence of data-intensive workloads, such as artificial\nintelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), high-performance computing (HPC),\nin-memory databases, and real-time analytics, has exposed limitations in\nconventional memory technologies like DRAM. While DRAM offers low latency and\nhigh throughput, it is constrained by high costs, scalability challenges, and\nvolatility, making it less viable for capacity-bound and persistent\napplications in modern datacenters.\n  Recently, Compute Express Link (CXL) has emerged as a promising alternative,\nenabling high-speed, cacheline-granular communication between CPUs and external\ndevices. By leveraging CXL technology, NAND flash can now be used as memory\nexpansion, offering three-fold benefits: byte-addressability, scalable\ncapacity, and persistence at a low cost. Samsung's CXL Memory Module Hybrid\n(CMM-H) is the first product to deliver these benefits through a hardware-only\nsolution, i.e., it does not incur any OS and IO overheads like conventional\nblock devices. In particular, CMM-H integrates a DRAM cache with NAND flash in\na single device to deliver near-DRAM latency. This paper presents the first\npublicly available study for comprehensive characterizations of an FPGA-based\nCMM-H prototype. Through this study, we address users' concerns about whether a\nwide variety of applications can successfully run on a memory device backed by\nNAND flash medium. Additionally, based on these characterizations, we provide\nkey insights into how to best take advantage of the CMM-H device."

Architectural features such as Intel RDT,\nArm QoS, and Arm MPAM are either unavailable on commercial embedded platforms\nor designed primarily for server environments optimized for average-case\nperformance and might fail to deliver the expected real-time guarantees. Arm\nDynamIQ Shared Unit (DSU) includes isolation features-among others, hardware\nper-way cache partitioning-that can improve the real-time guarantees of complex\nembedded multicore systems and facilitate real-time analysis.

Compared to state-of-the-art NoCs, our system offers\nthree times the energy efficiency and more than double the link bandwidth.\nFurthermore, compared to a traditional AXI4-based multi-layer interconnect, our\nNoC achieves a 30% reduction in area, corresponding to a 47% increase in\nGFLOPSDP within the same floorplan."

To address these issues, we propose\nVivar, a novel system that integrates multi-modal sensor data and presents 3D\nvolumetric content for AR visualization. In particular, we introduce a\ncross-modal embedding approach that maps sensor data into a pre-trained visual\nembedding space through barycentric interpolation. This approach accurately\nreflects value changes in multi-modal sensor information, ensuring that sensor\nvariations are properly shown in visualization outcomes. Vivar also\nincorporates sensor-aware AR scene generation using foundation models and 3D\nGaussian Splatting (3DGS) without requiring domain expertise. In addition,\nVivar leverages latent reuse and caching strategies to accelerate 2D and AR\ncontent generation, demonstrating 11x latency reduction without compromising\nquality. A user study involving over 503 participants, including domain\nexperts, demonstrates Vivar's effectiveness in accuracy, consistency, and\nreal-world applicability, paving the way for more intuitive sensor data\nvisualization.",

This\nversion introduces vision understanding abilities, a wider coverage of\nlanguages and longer context - at least 128K tokens. We also change the\narchitecture of the model to reduce the KV-cache memory that tends to explode\nwith long context. This is achieved by increasing the ratio of local to global\nattention layers, and keeping the span on local attention short. The Gemma 3\nmodels are trained with distillation and achieve superior performance to Gemma\n2 for both pre-trained and instruction finetuned versions. In particular, our\nnovel post-training recipe significantly improves the math, chat,\ninstruction-following and multilingual abilities, making Gemma3-4B-IT\ncompetitive with Gemma2-27B-IT and Gemma3-27B-IT comparable to Gemini-1.5-Pro\nacross benchmarks. We release all our models to the community.",

The complexity of applications results in a wide variety of memory\naccess patterns, prompting the development of numerous cache-prefetching\nalgorithms. Consequently, commercial processors often employ a hybrid of these\nalgorithms to enhance the overall prefetching performance. Nonetheless, since\nthese prefetchers share hardware resources, conflicts arising from competing\nprefetching requests can negate the benefits of hardware prefetching. Under\nsuch circumstances, several prefetcher selection algorithms have been proposed\nto mitigate conflicts between prefetchers. However, these prior solutions\nsuffer from two limitations. First, the input demand request allocation is\ninaccurate. Second, the prefetcher selection criteria are coarse-grained.\n  In this paper, we address both limitations by introducing an efficient and\nwidely applicable prefetcher selection algorithm--Alecto, which tailors the\ndemand requests for each prefetcher. Every demand request is first sent to\nAlecto to identify suitable prefetchers before being routed to prefetchers for\ntraining and prefetching. Our analysis shows that Alecto is adept at not only\nharmonizing prefetching accuracy, coverage, and timeliness but also\nsignificantly enhancing the utilization of the prefetcher table, which is vital\nfor temporal prefetching. Alecto outperforms the state-of-the-art RL-based\nprefetcher selection algorithm--Bandit by 2.76% in single-core, and 7.56% in\neight-core. For memory-intensive benchmarks, Alecto outperforms Bandit by\n5.25%. Alecto consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance in scheduling\nvarious types of cache prefetchers. In addition to the performance improvement,\nAlecto can reduce the energy consumption associated with accessing the\nprefetchers' table by 48%, while only adding less than 1 KB of storage\noverhead.",

To address this, we propose $\\textbf{ReTaKe}$, a\ntraining-free method with two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly\nreduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for video\ncompression. To align with the way of human temporal perception, DPSelect\nidentifies keyframes based on inter-frame distance peaks. To leverage LLMs'\nlearned prior knowledge, PivotKV marks the keyframes as pivots and compress\nnon-pivot frames by pruning low-attention tokens in their KV cache. ReTaKe\nenables VideoLLMs to process 8 times longer frames (up to 2048), outperforming\nsimilar-sized models by 3-5% and even rivaling much larger ones on VideoMME,\nMLVU, LongVideoBench, and LVBench. Moreover, by overlapping compression\noperations with prefilling, ReTaKe introduces only ~10% prefilling latency\noverhead while reducing decoding latency by ~20%.

We formulate\na mixed timescale problem to jointly optimize cache placement, LEO satellite\nbeam direction, and cooperative multicast beamforming among satellite beams and\nbase stations. To tackle this intricate problem, we propose a two-stage\nsolution framework, where the primary problem is decoupled into a short-term\ncontent delivery subproblem and a long-term cache placement subproblem. The\nformer subproblem is solved by designing an alternating optimization approach\nwith whale optimization and successive convex approximation methods according\nto the cache placement state, while cache content in STNs is updated using an\niterative algorithm that utilizes historical information.

We use a novel metalorganic precursor\nbis(1,4-di-tert-butyl-1,3-diazadienyl) (nickel Ni(tBu2DAD)2) with ozone (O3) to\ndeposit NiO.

Two\ncomplementary reward models are evaluated: the first improves readability by\nscoring surface-level textual features to provide explicit structuring, while\nthe second reinforces deeper coherence and rhetorical sophistication by\nanalyzing global discourse patterns through hierarchical discourse motifs,\noutperforming both standard and RLHF-enhanced models in tasks such as essay\ngeneration and long-document summarization.

Two\ncomplementary reward models are evaluated: the first improves readability by\nscoring surface-level textual features to provide explicit structuring, while\nthe second reinforces deeper coherence and rhetorical sophistication by\nanalyzing global discourse patterns through hierarchical discourse motifs,\noutperforming both standard and RLHF-enhanced models in tasks such as essay\ngeneration and long-document summarization. All training data and code will be\npublicly shared at https://github.com/minnesotanlp/struct_align."

Large language\nmodels (LLMs) hold great potential in identifying such implied relevance by\nleveraging their reasoning skills. Nevertheless, current LLM-augmented\nretrieval is hindered by high latency and computation cost, as the LLM\ntypically computes the query-document relevance online, for every query anew.\nTo tackle this issue we introduce EnrichIndex, a retrieval approach which\ninstead uses the LLM offline to build semantically-enriched retrieval indices,\nby performing a single pass over all documents in the retrieval corpus once\nduring ingestion time. Furthermore, the semantically-enriched indices can\ncomplement existing online retrieval approaches, boosting the performance of\nLLM re-rankers. We evaluated EnrichIndex on five retrieval tasks, involving\npassages and tables, and found that it outperforms strong online LLM-based\nretrieval systems, with an average improvement of 11.7 points in recall @ 10\nand 10.6 points in NDCG @ 10 compared to strong baselines.

This\npractice overlooks the fundamental human cognitive principle of situational\nself-awareness during decision-making-the ability to dynamically assess\nsituational demands and strategically employ resources during decision-making.\nWe propose agentic knowledgeable self-awareness to address this gap, a novel\nparadigm enabling LLM-based agents to autonomously regulate knowledge\nutilization. Specifically, we propose KnowSelf, a data-centric approach that\napplies agents with knowledgeable self-awareness like humans. Concretely, we\ndevise a heuristic situation judgement criterion to mark special tokens on the\nagent's self-explored trajectories for collecting training data. Through a\ntwo-stage training process, the agent model can switch between different\nsituations by generating specific special tokens, achieving optimal planning\neffects with minimal costs. Our experiments demonstrate that KnowSelf can\noutperform various strong baselines on different tasks and models with minimal\nuse of external knowledge.

While they are in a similar parameter space of B supergiants\n(BSGs), some BHGs are known to be luminous blue variables (LBVs). Their spectra\nwith absorption and emission features resemble Of/WNh stars. Yet, their wind\nphysics and their evolutionary connections are not clear. Aims. In this study,\nwe aim to understand (i) the atmospheric and wind structure, (ii) the\nwind-launching and -driving mechanisms, and (iii) the spectrum formation of\nearly-type BHGs. As an observational prototype, we use zet1 Sco (B1.5Ia+).\nMethods. Using the atmosphere code PoWRhd, we calculated the first\nhydrodynamically consistent models at the BHG domain. They give insights into\nthe radiative driving of the calculated wind regimes and enable us to study the\ninfluence of clumping and X-rays on the resulting wind structure. Results. Our\nconsistent model reproduces the main spectral features of zet1 Sco. The\nobtained mass-loss rate is higher than that of similar spectral type BSGs.\nHowever, the wind optical depth of BHGs is way below unity, making them less of\na transition type. To reproduce zet1 Sco's spectrum, we needed low clumping\nwith subsonic onset. The wind has a shallow-gradient velocity profile,\ndeviating from the beta law, and is mainly driven by Fe III opacity.\nConclusions. Our study suggests that despite more mass loss, early-type\nGalactic BHGs have winds relatively similar to BSGs. Their winds are not thick\nenough to characterize them as \"transition-type\" stars, unlike Of/WNh, implying\nthat emission features arise more easily in cooler than in hotter stars. The\nspectral BHG appearance is likely connected to atmospheric inhomogeneities\nbelow the sonic point.

Among various\napproaches, enumeration algorithms have emerged as some of the most effective\ntechniques for this task. These algorithms employ advanced strategies to\nsystematically enumerate candidate formulas while minimizing redundancies by\navoiding the generation of syntactically different but semantically equivalent\nformulas. However, a notable drawback is that these algorithms typically do not\nprovide guarantees of termination, which poses challenges for their use in\nreal-world applications.\n  This paper develops an abstract framework to bound the size of possible\nsolutions for a logic inference task, thereby providing a termination guarantee\nfor enumeration algorithms through the introduction of a sufficient stopping\ncriterion. The proposed framework is designed with flexibility in mind and is\napplicable to a broad spectrum of practically relevant logical formalisms,\nincluding Modal Logic, Linear Temporal Logic, Computation Tree Logic,\nAlternating-time Temporal Logic, and even selected inference task for finite\nautomata. In addition, our approach enabled us to develop a new class of\nalgorithms that enumerate over the semantics of formulas rather than their\nsyntactic representations, offering new possibilities for reducing redundancy.",

These algorithms employ advanced strategies to\nsystematically enumerate candidate formulas while minimizing redundancies by\navoiding the generation of syntactically different but semantically equivalent\nformulas. However, a notable drawback is that these algorithms typically do not\nprovide guarantees of termination, which poses challenges for their use in\nreal-world applications.\n  This paper develops an abstract framework to bound the size of possible\nsolutions for a logic inference task, thereby providing a termination guarantee\nfor enumeration algorithms through the introduction of a sufficient stopping\ncriterion. The proposed framework is designed with flexibility in mind and is\napplicable to a broad spectrum of practically relevant logical formalisms,\nincluding Modal Logic, Linear Temporal Logic, Computation Tree Logic,\nAlternating-time Temporal Logic, and even selected inference task for finite\nautomata. In addition, our approach enabled us to develop a new class of\nalgorithms that enumerate over the semantics of formulas rather than their\nsyntactic representations, offering new possibilities for reducing redundancy."

In this work, we\nintroduce Edge-SD-SR, the first parameter efficient and low latency diffusion\nmodel for image super-resolution. Edge-SD-SR consists of ~169M parameters,\nincluding UNet, encoder and decoder, and has a complexity of only ~142 GFLOPs.\nTo maintain a high visual quality on such low compute budget, we introduce a\nnumber of training strategies: (i) A novel conditioning mechanism on the low\nresolution input, coined bidirectional conditioning, which tailors the SD model\nfor the SR task. (ii) Joint training of the UNet and encoder, while decoupling\nthe encodings of the HR and LR images and using a dedicated schedule. (iii)\nFinetuning the decoder using the UNet's output to directly tailor the decoder\nto the latents obtained at inference time. Edge-SD-SR runs efficiently on\ndevice, e.g. it can upscale a 128x128 patch to 512x512 in 38 msec while running\non a Samsung S24 DSP, and of a 512x512 to 2048x2048 (requiring 25 model\nevaluations) in just ~1.1 sec.

Although curriculum learning attempts to\naddress this by adjusting difficulty, it often relies on static schedules, and\neven recent online filtering methods lack theoretical grounding and a\nsystematic understanding of their effectiveness. In this work, we theoretically\nand empirically show that curating the batch with the problems that the\ntraining model achieves intermediate accuracy on the fly can maximize the\neffectiveness of RORL training, namely balanced online difficulty filtering. We\nfirst derive that the lower bound of the KL divergence between the initial and\nthe optimal policy can be expressed with the variance of the sampled accuracy.\nBuilding on those insights, we show that balanced filtering can maximize the\nlower bound, leading to better performance. Experimental results across five\nchallenging math reasoning benchmarks show that balanced online filtering\nyields an additional 10% in AIME and 4% improvements in average over plain\nGRPO.

Due to the non-convexity\nand multi-fold difficulties from an optimization perspective, we develop a deep\nlearning-based framework where beamforming is tackled as a Rayleigh quotient\nproblem, while antenna positioning is addressed through multi-layer perceptron\ntraining. The neural network parameters are optimized using stochastic gradient\ndescent to achieve effective jamming mitigation strategy, featuring offline\ntraining with marginal complexity for online inference.

As opposed to the possibility that they could memorize some Erdos-Renyi\ngraphs included in their scraped training set, this second investigation aims\nat studying a possible emergent property of LLMs. For both tasks, we propose a\nmetric to assess their errors with the lens of hallucination (i.e. incorrect\ninformation returned as facts). We most notably find that the amplitude of\ngraph hallucinations can characterize the superiority of some LLMs. Indeed, for\nthe recitation task, we observe that graph hallucinations correlate with the\nHallucination Leaderboard, a hallucination rank that leverages 10, 000 times\nmore prompts to obtain its ranking. For the generation task, we find\nsurprisingly good and reproducible results in most of LLMs. We believe this to\nconstitute a starting point for more in-depth studies of this emergent\ncapability and a challenging benchmark for their improvements.

The FN constraints explicitly imposed through the binding energies\nand charge radii of selected nuclei are found to significantly affect the EoS\nacross different densities. However, the high computational cost of these\nconstraints makes it challenging to extend the analysis to a broader set of\nnuclei, particularly when the objective is not merely to obtain a single\noptimized model but to systematically explore uncertainties in global modeling.\nTo overcome this challenge, we introduce NucleiML (NML), a machine learning\nframework trained on ground-state FN properties obtained from mean-field\nmodels. Integrated into a Bayesian inference approach, NML demonstrates high\naccuracy and strong consistency with the underlying mean-field model. The NML\nachieves around ten-fold computational speed-up, from $\\sim 4.5$ hours to 30\nminutes. Its predictive performance improves further as the number of nuclei in\nthe training data increases, which we plan to employ in extensive future\nexplorations.",

                "summary": "Formulating statements that support diverse or controversial stances on\nspecific topics is vital for platforms that enable user expression, reshape\npolitical discourse, and drive social critique and information dissemination.\nWith the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), controllable text generation\ntowards specific stances has become a promising research area with applications\nin shaping public opinion and commercial marketing. However, current datasets\noften focus solely on pure texts, lacking multimodal content and effective\ncontext, particularly in the context of stance detection. In this paper, we\nformally define and study the new problem of stance-driven controllable content\ngeneration for tweets with text and images, where given a multimodal post (text\nand image/video), a model generates a stance-controlled response.

However, current datasets\noften focus solely on pure texts, lacking multimodal content and effective\ncontext, particularly in the context of stance detection. In this paper, we\nformally define and study the new problem of stance-driven controllable content\ngeneration for tweets with text and images, where given a multimodal post (text\nand image/video), a model generates a stance-controlled response.

Besides that, query\ndenoising can be used to increase the diversity of training samples for\nmodeling complex scenarios which is critical for Multi-Object Tracking (MOT),\nshowing its potential in MOT application. Existing approaches integrate query\ndenoising within the tracking-by-attention paradigm. However, as the denoising\nprocess only happens within the single frame, it cannot benefit the tracker to\nlearn temporal-related information. In addition, the attention mask in query\ndenoising prevents information exchange between denoising and object queries,\nlimiting its potential in improving association using self-attention. To\naddress these issues, we propose TQD-Track, which introduces Temporal Query\nDenoising (TQD) tailored for MOT, enabling denoising queries to carry temporal\ninformation and instance-specific feature representation. We introduce diverse\nnoise types onto denoising queries that simulate real-world challenges in MOT.\nWe analyze our proposed TQD for different tracking paradigms, and find out the\nparadigm with explicit learned data association module, e.g.\ntracking-by-detection or alternating detection and association, benefit from\nTQD by a larger margin. For these paradigms, we further design an association\nmask in the association module to ensure the consistent interaction between\ntrack and detection queries as during inference.

Due to the large variations in\nbody shapes, poses, and cloth types, existing methods mostly require hours of\nper-subject optimization during inference, which limits their practical\napplications. In contrast, we learn a universal prior from over a thousand\nclothed humans to achieve instant feedforward generation and zero-shot\ngeneralization. Specifically, instead of rigging the avatar with shared\nskinning weights, we jointly infer personalized avatar shape, skinning weights,\nand pose-dependent deformations, which effectively improves overall geometric\nfidelity and reduces deformation artifacts. Moreover, to normalize pose\nvariations and resolve coupled ambiguity between canonical shapes and skinning\nweights, we design a 3D canonicalization process to produce pixel-aligned\ninitial conditions, which helps to reconstruct fine-grained geometric details.\nWe then propose a multi-frame feature aggregation to robustly reduce artifacts\nintroduced in canonicalization and fuse a plausible avatar preserving\nperson-specific identities. Finally, we train the model in an end-to-end\nframework on a large-scale capture dataset, which contains diverse human\nsubjects paired with high-quality 3D scans.

Further, we\npropose a control paradigm for guidance, that allows the users to modulate the\namount of influence each retrieval insertion has over the generated sequence.\nOur comparative evaluations demonstrate the validity of our approach against\nrecent gesture generation approaches.

However, despite their\ncapabilities, VDMs often fail to produce physically plausible videos due to an\ninherent lack of understanding of physics, resulting in incorrect dynamics and\nevent sequences. To address this limitation, we propose a novel two-stage\nimage-to-video generation framework that explicitly incorporates physics with\nvision and language informed physical prior. In the first stage, we employ a\nVision Language Model (VLM) as a coarse-grained motion planner, integrating\nchain-of-thought and physics-aware reasoning to predict a rough motion\ntrajectories/changes that approximate real-world physical dynamics while\nensuring the inter-frame consistency. In the second stage, we use the predicted\nmotion trajectories/changes to guide the video generation of a VDM. As the\npredicted motion trajectories/changes are rough, noise is added during\ninference to provide freedom to the VDM in generating motion with more fine\ndetails. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework can\nproduce physically plausible motion, and comparative evaluations highlight the\nnotable superiority of our approach over existing methods.

Specifically,\nLAM creates an animatable Gaussian head in a single forward pass, enabling\nreenactment and rendering without additional networks or post-processing steps.\nThis capability allows for seamless integration into existing rendering\npipelines, ensuring real-time animation and rendering across a wide range of\nplatforms, including mobile phones. The centerpiece of our framework is the\ncanonical Gaussian attributes generator, which utilizes FLAME canonical points\nas queries. These points interact with multi-scale image features through a\nTransformer to accurately predict Gaussian attributes in the canonical space.\nThe reconstructed canonical Gaussian avatar can then be animated utilizing\nstandard linear blend skinning (LBS) with corrective blendshapes as the FLAME\nmodel did and rendered in real-time on various platforms. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that LAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on existing\nbenchmarks. Our code and video are available at\nhttps://aigc3d.github.io/projects/LAM/",

We examine its robustness by comparing performance across different\nLLMs. We further investigate the challenges and constraints that arise from\nLLM-based political simulations. Our work provides both a scalable framework\nfor modeling political decision-making behavior and insights into the promise\nand limitations of using LLMs in political science research."

Through\nsemi-structured interviews with seven K-12 teachers, we examined their\npractices and challenges when designing, implementing, and deploying chatbots.\nOur findings revealed that teachers prioritize developing task-specific\nchatbots aligned with their lessons. Teachers engaged in various creation\npractices and had different challenges; novices in chatbot creation struggled\nmainly with initial design and technical implementation, while experienced\nteachers faced challenges with technical aspects and analyzing conversational\ndata. Based on these insights, we explore approaches to supporting teachers'\nchatbot development and opportunities for designing future chatbot creation\nsystems. This work provides foundational insights from teachers that can\nempower teacher-created chatbots, facilitating AI-augmented teaching."

AMP4EC features a resource-aware model\npartitioner that splits deep learning models based on device capabilities, a\ntask scheduler that ensures efficient load balancing using a weighted scoring\nmechanism, and a Docker-based deployment environment for validation.\nExperimental results show up to a 78% reduction in latency and a 414%\nimprovement in throughput compared to baseline methods. The framework achieves\nconsistent performance with low scheduling overhead across varying resource\nprofiles, demonstrating adaptability in high-resource (1 CPU, 1GB RAM) and\nlow-resource (0.4 CPU, 512MB RAM) scenarios. These results highlight AMP4EC's\nscalability, efficiency, and robustness for real-world edge deployments,\naddressing the critical need for efficient distributed inference in dynamic,\nresource-constrained environments.",

This paper introduces AMP4EC, an Adaptive Model\nPartitioning framework designed to optimize deep learning inference in edge\nenvironments through real-time resource monitoring, dynamic model partitioning,\nand adaptive task scheduling. AMP4EC features a resource-aware model\npartitioner that splits deep learning models based on device capabilities, a\ntask scheduler that ensures efficient load balancing using a weighted scoring\nmechanism, and a Docker-based deployment environment for validation.\nExperimental results show up to a 78% reduction in latency and a 414%\nimprovement in throughput compared to baseline methods. The framework achieves\nconsistent performance with low scheduling overhead across varying resource\nprofiles, demonstrating adaptability in high-resource (1 CPU, 1GB RAM) and\nlow-resource (0.4 CPU, 512MB RAM) scenarios. These results highlight AMP4EC's\nscalability, efficiency, and robustness for real-world edge deployments,\naddressing the critical need for efficient distributed inference in dynamic,\nresource-constrained environments."

Multi-hop integrated access and backhaul (IAB) architectures\nhave emerged as a cost-effective solution for network densification.

To handle these challenges, we decompose the IOP into sub-problems\nto reduce the solution space. To tackle these sub-problems, we formulate them\nseparately as the non-cooperative games and design the corresponding utility\nfunctions to guarantee the existence of Nash equilibrium solutions. Also, to\nachieve the system-wide solution, we propose a single-leader heterogeneous\nmulti-follower Stackelberg-game-based resource allocation scheme, which can\ncombine the solving results of all the sub-problems to get the IOP approximate\nsolution.

Traditional bias detection\nmethods, predominantly reliant on human moderation, suffer from subjective\ninterpretations and scalability constraints.

To this end, we\ncollect an extensive dataset consisting of over 30,000 crime-related articles\nfrom five politically diverse news sources spanning a decade (2013-2023). Our\napproach employs a two-stage methodology: (1) bias detection, where each LLM\nscores and justifies biased content at the paragraph level, validated through\nhuman evaluation for ground truth establishment, and (2) iterative debiasing\nusing GPT-4o Mini, verified by both automated reassessment and human reviewers.\nEmpirical results indicate GPT-4o Mini's superior accuracy in bias detection\nand effectiveness in debiasing. Furthermore, our analysis reveals temporal and\ngeographical variations in media bias correlating with socio-political dynamics\nand real-world events. This study contributes to scalable computational\nmethodologies for bias mitigation, promoting fairness and accountability in\nnews reporting.",

In this paper, we propose LLMSched, an\nuncertainty-aware scheduling framework for emerging compound LLM applications.\nIn LLMSched, we first design a novel DAG-based model to describe the uncertain\ncompound LLM applications. Then, we adopt the Bayesian network to\ncomprehensively profile compound LLM applications and identify\nuncertainty-reducing stages, along with an entropy-based mechanism to quantify\ntheir uncertainty reduction. Combining an uncertainty reduction strategy and a\njob completion time (JCT)-efficient scheme, we further propose an efficient\nscheduler to reduce the average JCT. Evaluation of both simulation and testbed\nexperiments on various representative compound LLM applications shows that\ncompared to existing state-of-the-art scheduling schemes, LLMSched can reduce\nthe average JCT by 14~79%.",

Combining an uncertainty reduction strategy and a\njob completion time (JCT)-efficient scheme, we further propose an efficient\nscheduler to reduce the average JCT. Evaluation of both simulation and testbed\nexperiments on various representative compound LLM applications shows that\ncompared to existing state-of-the-art scheduling schemes, LLMSched can reduce\nthe average JCT by 14~79%."

Current training methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human\nFeedback (RLHF) prioritize helpfulness and safety but fall short in fostering\ntruly empathetic, adaptive, and personalized interactions. Traditional\napproaches to personalization often rely on extensive user history, limiting\ntheir effectiveness for new or context-limited users. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose to incorporate an intrinsic motivation to improve the\nconversational agents's model of the user as an additional reward alongside\nmulti-turn RLHF. This reward mechanism encourages the agent to actively elicit\nuser traits by optimizing conversations to increase the accuracy of its user\nmodel. Consequently, the policy agent can deliver more personalized\ninteractions through obtaining more information about the user. We applied our\nmethod both education and fitness settings, where LLMs teach concepts or\nrecommend personalized strategies based on users' hidden learning style or\nlifestyle attributes. Using LLM-simulated users, our approach outperformed a\nmulti-turn RLHF baseline in revealing information about the users' preferences,\nand adapting to them.",

Current training methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human\nFeedback (RLHF) prioritize helpfulness and safety but fall short in fostering\ntruly empathetic, adaptive, and personalized interactions. Traditional\napproaches to personalization often rely on extensive user history, limiting\ntheir effectiveness for new or context-limited users. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose to incorporate an intrinsic motivation to improve the\nconversational agents's model of the user as an additional reward alongside\nmulti-turn RLHF. This reward mechanism encourages the agent to actively elicit\nuser traits by optimizing conversations to increase the accuracy of its user\nmodel. Consequently, the policy agent can deliver more personalized\ninteractions through obtaining more information about the user. We applied our\nmethod both education and fitness settings, where LLMs teach concepts or\nrecommend personalized strategies based on users' hidden learning style or\nlifestyle attributes. Using LLM-simulated users, our approach outperformed a\nmulti-turn RLHF baseline in revealing information about the users' preferences,\nand adapting to them."

In particular, guessing a fraction of a mean of\nnumbers chosen by all players is a classic behavioral experiment designed to\ntest iterative reasoning patterns among various groups of people. The previous\nliterature reveals that the level of sophistication of the opponents is an\nimportant factor affecting the outcome of the game. Smarter decision makers\nchoose strategies that are closer to theoretical Nash equilibrium and\ndemonstrate faster convergence to equilibrium in iterated contests with\ninformation revelation.

To bridge this gap, we introduce RingMoE, a unified multi-modal RS\nfoundation model with 14.7 billion parameters, pre-trained on 400 million\nmulti-modal RS images from nine satellites. RingMoE incorporates three key\ninnovations: (1) A hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture\ncomprising modal-specialized, collaborative, and shared experts, effectively\nmodeling intra-modal knowledge while capturing cross-modal dependencies to\nmitigate conflicts between modal representations; (2) Physics-informed\nself-supervised learning, explicitly embedding sensor-specific radiometric\ncharacteristics into the pre-training objectives; (3) Dynamic expert pruning,\nenabling adaptive model compression from 14.7B to 1B parameters while\nmaintaining performance, facilitating efficient deployment in Earth observation\napplications. Evaluated across 23 benchmarks spanning six key RS tasks (i.e.,\nclassification, detection, segmentation, tracking, change detection, and depth\nestimation), RingMoE outperforms existing foundation models and sets new SOTAs,\ndemonstrating remarkable adaptability from single-modal to multi-modal\nscenarios.

In this paper, we\nintroduce DeepResearcher, the first comprehensive framework for end-to-end\ntraining of LLM-based deep research agents through scaling reinforcement\nlearning (RL) in real-world environments with authentic web search\ninteractions. Unlike RAG-based approaches that assume all necessary information\nexists within a fixed corpus, our method trains agents to navigate the noisy,\nunstructured, and dynamic nature of the open web. We implement a specialized\nmulti-agent architecture where browsing agents extract relevant information\nfrom various webpage structures and overcoming significant technical\nchallenges. Extensive experiments on open-domain research tasks demonstrate\nthat DeepResearcher achieves substantial improvements of up to 28.9 points over\nprompt engineering-based baselines and up to 7.2 points over RAG-based RL\nagents. Our qualitative analysis reveals emergent cognitive behaviors from\nend-to-end RL training, including the ability to formulate plans,\ncross-validate information from multiple sources, engage in self-reflection to\nredirect research, and maintain honesty when unable to find definitive answers.\nOur results highlight that end-to-end training in real-world web environments\nis not merely an implementation detail but a fundamental requirement for\ndeveloping robust research capabilities aligned with real-world applications.\nWe release DeepResearcher at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/DeepResearcher.",

AMP4EC features a resource-aware model\npartitioner that splits deep learning models based on device capabilities, a\ntask scheduler that ensures efficient load balancing using a weighted scoring\nmechanism, and a Docker-based deployment environment for validation.\nExperimental results show up to a 78% reduction in latency and a 414%\nimprovement in throughput compared to baseline methods. The framework achieves\nconsistent performance with low scheduling overhead across varying resource\nprofiles, demonstrating adaptability in high-resource (1 CPU, 1GB RAM) and\nlow-resource (0.4 CPU, 512MB RAM) scenarios.

In this paper, we propose FedLMG, a heterogeneous\none-shot Federated learning method with Local Model-Guided diffusion models.\nBriefly speaking, in FedLMG, clients do not need access to any foundation\nmodels but only train and upload their local models, which is consistent with\ntraditional FL methods. On the clients, we employ classification loss and BN\nloss to capture the broad category features and detailed contextual features of\nthe client distributions. On the server, based on the uploaded client models,\nwe utilize backpropagation to guide the server's DM in generating synthetic\ndatasets that comply with the client distributions, which are then used to\ntrain the aggregated model. By using the locally trained client models as a\nmedium to transfer client knowledge, our method significantly reduces the\ncomputational requirements on client devices and effectively adapts to\nscenarios with heterogeneous clients. Extensive quantitation and visualization\nexperiments on three large-scale real-world datasets, along with theoretical\nanalysis, demonstrate that the synthetic datasets generated by FedLMG exhibit\ncomparable quality and diversity to the client datasets, which leads to an\naggregated model that outperforms all compared methods and even the performance\nceiling, further elucidating the significant potential of utilizing DMs in FL.",

The\nfindings contribute to the growing body of knowledge on designing efficient\nconcurrency control mechanisms for modern distributed systems."

To speed up the prefill of the long\nLLM inputs, one can pre-compute the KV cache of a text and re-use the KV cache\nwhen the context is reused as the prefix of another LLM input. However, the\nreused text chunks are not always the input prefix, which makes precomputed KV\ncaches not directly usable since they ignore the text's cross-attention with\nthe preceding texts. Thus, the benefits of reusing KV caches remain largely\nunrealized.\n  This paper tackles just one challenge: when an LLM input contains multiple\ntext chunks, how to quickly combine their precomputed KV caches in order to\nachieve the same generation quality as the expensive full prefill (i.e.,\nwithout reusing KV cache)? This challenge naturally arises in\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where the input is supplemented with\nmultiple retrieved texts as the context. We present CacheBlend, a scheme that\nreuses the precomputed KV caches, regardless prefix or not, and selectively\nrecomputes the KV values of a small subset of tokens to partially update each\nreused KV cache. In the meantime, the small extra delay for recomputing some\ntokens can be pipelined with the retrieval of KV caches within the same job,\nallowing CacheBlend to store KV caches in slower devices with more storage\ncapacity while retrieving them without increasing the inference delay. By\ncomparing CacheBlend with the state-of-the-art KV cache reusing schemes on\nthree open-source LLMs of various sizes and four popular benchmark datasets of\ndifferent tasks, we show that CacheBlend reduces time-to-first-token (TTFT) by\n2.2-3.3x and increases the inference throughput by 2.8-5x from full KV\nrecompute without compromising generation quality.

However, most prior LLM-based\nwork in robotic applications either directly predicts waypoints or applies LLMs\nwithin fixed tool integration frameworks, offering limited flexibility in\nexploring and configuring solutions best suited to different tasks. In this\nwork, we propose a framework that leverages LLMs to select appropriate planning\nand control strategies based on task descriptions, environmental constraints,\nand system dynamics. These strategies are then executed by calling the\navailable comprehensive planning and control APIs. Our approach employs\niterative LLM-based reasoning with performance feedback to refine the algorithm\nselection. We validate our approach through extensive experiments across tasks\nof varying complexity, from simple tracking to complex planning scenarios\ninvolving spatiotemporal constraints. The results demonstrate that using LLMs\nto determine planning and control strategies from natural language descriptions\nsignificantly enhances robotic autonomy while reducing the need for extensive\nmanual tuning and expert knowledge. Furthermore, our framework maintains\ngeneralizability across different tasks and notably outperforms baseline\nmethods that rely on LLMs for direct trajectory, control sequence, or code\ngeneration.",

However, most prior LLM-based\nwork in robotic applications either directly predicts waypoints or applies LLMs\nwithin fixed tool integration frameworks, offering limited flexibility in\nexploring and configuring solutions best suited to different tasks. In this\nwork, we propose a framework that leverages LLMs to select appropriate planning\nand control strategies based on task descriptions, environmental constraints,\nand system dynamics. These strategies are then executed by calling the\navailable comprehensive planning and control APIs. Our approach employs\niterative LLM-based reasoning with performance feedback to refine the algorithm\nselection. We validate our approach through extensive experiments across tasks\nof varying complexity, from simple tracking to complex planning scenarios\ninvolving spatiotemporal constraints. The results demonstrate that using LLMs\nto determine planning and control strategies from natural language descriptions\nsignificantly enhances robotic autonomy while reducing the need for extensive\nmanual tuning and expert knowledge. Furthermore, our framework maintains\ngeneralizability across different tasks and notably outperforms baseline\nmethods that rely on LLMs for direct trajectory, control sequence, or code\ngeneration."
