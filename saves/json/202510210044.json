We present Hive hash table, a\nhigh-performance, warp-cooperative and dynamically resizable GPU hash table\nthat adapts to varying workloads without global rehashing.\n  Hive hash table makes three key contributions. First, a cache-aligned packed\nbucket layout stores key-value pairs as 64-bit words, enabling coalesced memory\naccess and atomic updates via single-CAS operations. Second, warp-synchronous\nconcurrency protocols - Warp-Aggregated-Bitmask-Claim (WABC) and\nWarp-Cooperative Match-and-Elect (WCME) - reduce contention to one atomic\noperation per warp while ensuring lock-free progress. Third, a\nload-factor-aware dynamic resizing strategy expands or contracts capacity in\nwarp-parallel K-bucket batches using linear hashing, maintaining balanced\noccupancy. To handle insertions under heavy contention, Hive hash table employs\na four-step strategy: replace, claim-and-commit, bounded cuckoo eviction, and\noverflow-stash fallback. This design provides lock-free fast paths and bounded\nrecovery cost under contention determined by a fixed eviction depth, while\neliminating ABA hazards during concurrent updates.\n  Experimental evaluation on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 shows Hive hash table sustains\nload factors up to 95% while delivering 1.5-2x higher throughput than\nstate-of-the-art GPU hash tables (Slab-Hash, DyCuckoo, WarpCore) under mixed\ninsert-delete-lookup workloads.

In practice, the reduced memory impact\nmeans our matrix-free MTTKRP can compute a rank 2000 tensor decomposition on a\nsingle NVIDIA H100 instead of six H100s using a matrix-based MTTKRP. We also\ncompare our optimized matrix-free MTTKRP to baseline matrix-free\nimplementations on different devices, showing a 3x single-device speedup on an\nIntel 8480+ CPU and an 11x speedup on a H100 GPU. In addition to numerical\nresults, we provide fine grained performance models for an ideal multi-level\ncache machine, compare analytical performance predictions to empirical results,\nand provide a motivated heuristic selection for selecting an algorithmic\nhyperparameter."

A 2.4\n$\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ thick epitaxially grown gain layer enables controlled internal\namplification up to 1 kV reverse bias, while maintaining full depletion below\n500 V. Electrical characteristics, including I-V, C-V, and gain behavior, were\nsimulated in Synopsys Sentaurus Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) using a\nquasi-1D geometry and verified across process-related variations in gain layer\nparameters. To ensure high-voltage stability and proper edge termination, a\nguard structure combining deep etched trenches and deep $p^+$ junction\ntermination extension (JTE) implants was designed. TCAD simulations varying the\nguard structure dimensions yielded an optimized design with a breakdown voltage\nabove 2.4 kV. A corresponding wafer run is currently processed at IMB-CNM,\nBarcelona."

This\npaper considers probabilistic guarantees for DAG tasks by utilizing the results\nof probabilistic guarantees for single processors, which have been relatively\nmore advanced than those for multi-core processors. This paper proposes a task\nset partitioning method that guarantees schedulability under the partitioned\nscheduling. The evaluation on randomly generated DAG task sets demonstrates\nthat the proposed method schedules more task sets with a smaller mean analysis\ntime compared to existing probabilistic schedulability analysis for DAGs. The\nevaluation also compares four bin-packing heuristics, revealing Item-Centric\nWorst-Fit-Decreasing schedules the most task sets.",

Their acceleration features, such as caches and\npipelining, often result in execution times below the worst-case. Thus, a\nprobabilistic approach ensuring constraint satisfaction within a probability\nthreshold is more suitable than worst-case guarantees for these systems. This\npaper considers probabilistic guarantees for DAG tasks by utilizing the results\nof probabilistic guarantees for single processors, which have been relatively\nmore advanced than those for multi-core processors. This paper proposes a task\nset partitioning method that guarantees schedulability under the partitioned\nscheduling. The evaluation on randomly generated DAG task sets demonstrates\nthat the proposed method schedules more task sets with a smaller mean analysis\ntime compared to existing probabilistic schedulability analysis for DAGs. The\nevaluation also compares four bin-packing heuristics, revealing Item-Centric\nWorst-Fit-Decreasing schedules the most task sets."

In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative\nfor long-context summarization tasks.

In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative\nfor long-context summarization tasks.

Causal attention AR models support KV caching for\nfaster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory\nchallenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based\ngeneration, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are\ncritical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in\nreal time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,\nespecially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt\ntransitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level\nAR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states\nwith new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable\nlong video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);\nand short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as\nframe sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.\nWith these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model\nto minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains\n20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both\nshort and long videos.

We envision a future where\nInternet communication will be dominated by \"prompts\" sent to generative AI\nmodels. For this, we will need proxies that provide similar functions to HTTP\nproxies (e.g., caching, routing, compression) while dealing with unique\nchallenges and opportunities of prompt-based communication. As a first step\ntoward supporting prompt-based communication, we present LLMBridge, an LLM\nproxy designed for cost-conscious users, such as those in developing regions\nand education (e.g., students, instructors). LLMBridge supports three key\noptimizations: model selection (routing prompts to the most suitable model),\ncontext management (intelligently reducing the amount of context), and semantic\ncaching (serving prompts using local models and vector databases). These\noptimizations introduce trade-offs between cost and quality, which applications\nnavigate through a high-level, bidirectional interface. As case studies, we\ndeploy LLMBridge in two cost-sensitive settings: a WhatsApp-based Q&A service\nand a university classroom environment. The WhatsApp service has been live for\nover twelve months, serving 100+ users and handling more than 14.7K requests.\nIn parallel, we exposed LLMBridge to students across three computer science\ncourses over a semester, where it supported diverse LLM-powered applications -\nsuch as reasoning agents and chatbots - and handled an average of 500 requests\nper day. We report on deployment experiences across both settings and use the\ncollected workloads to benchmark the effectiveness of various cost-optimization\nstrategies, analyzing their trade-offs in cost, latency, and response quality.",

To overcome the computational cost, we\nintroduce an efficient batching strategy and a specialized KV-caching mechanism\nthat minimizes compute and memory overhead. For example, RoE enables a 7B MoE\nmodel to match the performance of a 10.5B MoE model while using 30% less\ncompute for inference.

Current context compression methods predominantly rely on\nautoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress\ncontextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to\nacquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a\nfundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge\nfrom actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial\nfor real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel\nmethod that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture\nthat is equipped with this compression capability \\textit{a priori}. Instead of\ntraining models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly\nselects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates\ncontextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving\nrepresentations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need\nfor autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly\nleveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor\nembeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2)\nbidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture\ninformation from the entire context. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC\nconsistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various\ncompression ratios.

Modeling these high-cardinality sequences is challenging, and\ndiscriminative models often falter under limited supervision. To bridge this\ngap, we extend generative pretraining to user behavior, learning transferable\nrepresentations from unlabeled behavioral data analogous to how LLMs learn from\ntext. We present PANTHER, a hybrid generative-discriminative framework that\nunifies user behavior pretraining and downstream adaptation, enabling\nlarge-scale sequential user representation learning and real-time inference.\nPANTHER introduces: (1) Structured Tokenization to compress multi-dimensional\ntransaction attributes into an interpretable vocabulary; (2) Sequence Pattern\nRecognition Module (SPRM) for modeling periodic transaction motifs; (3) a\nUnified User-Profile Embedding that fuses static demographics with dynamic\ntransaction histories; and (4) Real-time scalability enabled by offline caching\nof pretrained embeddings for millisecond-level inference.

                "summary": "Property-based testing (PBT) is a lightweight formal method, typically\nimplemented as a randomized testing framework. Users specify the input domain\nfor their test using combinators supplied by the PBT framework, and the\nexpected properties or invariants as a unit-test function. The framework then\nsearches for a counterexample, e.g. by generating inputs and calling the test\nfunction. In this work, we demonstrate an LLM-based agent which analyzes Python\nmodules, infers function-specific and cross-function properties from code and\ndocumentation, synthesizes and executes PBTs, reflects on outputs of these\ntests to confirm true bugs, and finally outputs actionable bug reports for the\ndeveloper. We perform an extensive evaluation of our agent across 100 popular\nPython packages. Of the bug reports generated by the agent, we found after\nmanual review that 56\\% were valid bugs and 32\\% were valid bugs that we would\nreport to maintainers. We then developed a ranking rubric to surface\nhigh-priority valid bugs to developers, and found that of the 21 top-scoring\nbugs, 86\\% were valid and 81\\% we would report. The bugs span diverse failure\nmodes from serialization failures to numerical precision errors to flawed cache\nimplementations. We reported 5 bugs, 4 with patches, including to NumPy and\ncloud computing SDKs, with 3 patches merged successfully. Our results suggest\nthat LLMs with PBT provides a rigorous and scalable method for autonomously\ntesting software.

However, due to the substantial cost and time\nrequired to construct fusion reactors and run physical experiments, numerical\nexperiments are indispensable for understanding plasma physics inside tokamaks,\nsupporting the design and engineering phase, and optimizing future reactor\ndesigns. Geometric multigrid methods are optimal solvers for many problems that\narise from the discretization of partial differential equations. It has been\nshown that the multigrid solver GMGPolar solves the 2D gyrokinetic Poisson\nequation in linear complexity and with only small memory requirements compared\nto other state-of-the-art solvers. In this paper, we present a completely\nrefactored and object-oriented version of GMGPolar which offers two different\nmatrix-free implementations. Among other things, we leverage the\nSherman-Morrison formula to solve cyclic tridiagonal systems from circular line\nsolvers without additional fill-in and we apply reordering to optimize cache\naccess of circular and radial smoothing operations.

                    "value": "Tokamak fusion reactors are actively studied as a means of realizing energy\nproduction from plasma fusion. However, due to the substantial cost and time\nrequired to construct fusion reactors and run physical experiments, numerical\nexperiments are indispensable for understanding plasma physics inside tokamaks,\nsupporting the design and engineering phase, and optimizing future reactor\ndesigns. Geometric multigrid methods are optimal solvers for many problems that\narise from the discretization of partial differential equations. It has been\nshown that the multigrid solver GMGPolar solves the 2D gyrokinetic Poisson\nequation in linear complexity and with only small memory requirements compared\nto other state-of-the-art solvers. In this paper, we present a completely\nrefactored and object-oriented version of GMGPolar which offers two different\nmatrix-free implementations. Among other things, we leverage the\nSherman-Morrison formula to solve cyclic tridiagonal systems from circular line\nsolvers without additional fill-in and we apply reordering to optimize cache\naccess of circular and radial smoothing operations. With the Give approach,\nmemory requirements are further reduced and speedups of four to seven are\nobtained for usual test cases. For the Take approach, speedups of 16 to 18 can\nbe attained.

Specifically, the\ncache mechanism for bidirectional attention in dLLMs demands large memory\nfootprint, restricting their ability to handle long contexts under\nresource-limited settings. Existing cache eviction strategies are designed for\nARMs and ignore the unique characteristics of dLLMs, thus leading to\nunsatisfactory performance. To address these challenges, we introduce MaskKV, a\ntraining-free cache eviction framework tailored to dLLMs, focusing on the\neffect of mask tokens in dLLMs. MaskKV is built on two key innovations: (1) a\nmask-query guided scoring mechanism that leverages attention weights to\nidentify and evict less critical prompt tokens for each head; (2) an adaptive\ncache budgeting strategy that improves efficiency by reducing allocation in\nintermediate layers and concentrating resources on prompt-preferring heads. On\nLLaDA with MaskKV, compressing the KV cache to only 256 pairs (less than 5% of\ntokens) retains 94% of the full-cache performance on LongBench and achieves up\nto 31x acceleration at 32k prompt length.

Our analysis\nreveals critical trade-offs: sequential concatenation excels with noisy,\nmoderate-length contexts, while parallel caching scales more effectively to\nlong, high-signal contexts but is more susceptible to distractors. To address\nthe challenge of noisy structural data, we also introduce and validate two\neffective techniques: Context Distillation and Semantic Balancing.

We investigate two primary in-process\nmethods: sequential concatenation and parallel caching. Through extensive\nzero-shot experiments across retrieval, clustering, classification, and\nrecommendation tasks, we demonstrate that our structure-aware approaches\nconsistently outperform both text-only and post-hoc baselines. Our analysis\nreveals critical trade-offs: sequential concatenation excels with noisy,\nmoderate-length contexts, while parallel caching scales more effectively to\nlong, high-signal contexts but is more susceptible to distractors. To address\nthe challenge of noisy structural data, we also introduce and validate two\neffective techniques: Context Distillation and Semantic Balancing. This work\nprovides the first comprehensive analysis of in-process structure-aware\nencoding, offering a blueprint for building more powerful and contextually\naware embedding models."

Dynamically selecting critical KV caches\nduring decoding helps maintain performance. Existing methods use random linear\nhashing to identify important tokens, but this approach is inefficient due to\nthe orthogonal distribution of queries and keys within two narrow cones in\nLLMs. We introduce Spotlight Attention, a novel method that employs non-linear\nhashing functions to optimize the embedding distribution of queries and keys,\nenhancing coding efficiency and robustness. We also developed a lightweight,\nstable training framework using a Bradley-Terry ranking-based loss, enabling\noptimization of the non-linear hashing module on GPUs with 16GB memory in 8\nhours.

Dynamically selecting critical KV caches\nduring decoding helps maintain performance. Existing methods use random linear\nhashing to identify important tokens, but this approach is inefficient due to\nthe orthogonal distribution of queries and keys within two narrow cones in\nLLMs. We introduce Spotlight Attention, a novel method that employs non-linear\nhashing functions to optimize the embedding distribution of queries and keys,\nenhancing coding efficiency and robustness. We also developed a lightweight,\nstable training framework using a Bradley-Terry ranking-based loss, enabling\noptimization of the non-linear hashing module on GPUs with 16GB memory in 8\nhours.

While they match\nthe quality of similarly sized autoregressive (AR) models (e.g., Qwen2.5 7B,\nLlama3 8B), their iterative denoising requires multiple full-sequence forward\npasses, resulting in high computational costs and latency, particularly for\nlong input prompts and long-context scenarios. Furthermore, parallel token\ngeneration introduces token incoherence problems, and current sampling\nheuristics suffer from significant quality drops with decreasing denoising\nsteps.

Although model compression and parameter\noffloading are common strategies to address memory limitations, compression can\ndegrade quality, and offloading maintains quality but suffers from slow\ninference. Speculative decoding presents a promising avenue to accelerate\nparameter offloading, utilizing a fast draft model to propose multiple draft\ntokens, which are then verified by the target LLM in parallel with a single\nforward pass. This method reduces the time-consuming data transfers in forward\npasses that involve offloaded weight transfers. Existing methods often rely on\npretrained weights of the same family, but require additional training to align\nwith custom-trained models. Moreover, approaches that involve draft model\ntraining usually yield only modest speedups.

To address these challenges and achieve greater speedups,\nwe propose SubSpec, a plug-and-play method to accelerate parameter offloading\nthat is lossless and training-free. SubSpec constructs a highly aligned draft\nmodel by generating low-bit quantized substitute layers from offloaded target\nLLM portions. Additionally, our method shares the remaining GPU-resident layers\nand the KV-Cache, further reducing memory overhead and enhance alignment.\nSubSpec achieves a high average acceptance length, delivering 9.1x speedup for\nQwen2.5 7B on MT-Bench (8GB VRAM limit) and an average of 12.5x speedup for\nQwen2.5 32B on popular generation benchmarks (24GB VRAM limit).",

Among 10 popular deep research benchmarks, PokeeResearch-7B achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale deep research agents. This\nhighlights that careful reinforcement learning and reasoning design can produce\nefficient, resilient, and research-grade AI agents. The model and inference\ncode is open-sourced under MIT license at\nhttps://github.com/Pokee-AI/PokeeResearchOSS."

To address this, we propose a novel hybrid lexicon-fuzzy-transformer\nframework that combines rule-based heuristics, contextual deep learning, and\nfuzzy logic to generate continuous sentiment scores reflecting both polarity\nand strength. The pipeline begins with VADER-based initial sentiment\nestimations, which are refined through a two-stage adjustment process. This\ninvolves leveraging confidence scores from DistilBERT, a lightweight\ntransformer and applying fuzzy logic principles to mitigate excessive\nneutrality bias and enhance granularity. A custom fuzzy inference system then\nmaps the refined scores onto a 0 to 1 continuum, producing expert)like\njudgments. The framework is rigorously evaluated on four domain-specific\ndatasets. food delivery, e-commerce, tourism, and fashion. Results show\nimproved alignment with user ratings, better identification of sentiment\nextremes, and reduced misclassifications.

To address this, we propose a novel hybrid lexicon-fuzzy-transformer\nframework that combines rule-based heuristics, contextual deep learning, and\nfuzzy logic to generate continuous sentiment scores reflecting both polarity\nand strength. The pipeline begins with VADER-based initial sentiment\nestimations, which are refined through a two-stage adjustment process. This\ninvolves leveraging confidence scores from DistilBERT, a lightweight\ntransformer and applying fuzzy logic principles to mitigate excessive\nneutrality bias and enhance granularity. A custom fuzzy inference system then\nmaps the refined scores onto a 0 to 1 continuum, producing expert)like\njudgments. The framework is rigorously evaluated on four domain-specific\ndatasets. food delivery, e-commerce, tourism, and fashion. Results show\nimproved alignment with user ratings, better identification of sentiment\nextremes, and reduced misclassifications.

Our approach centers on the Inferred Attention Fusion\n(INAF) module, which integrates AI with geometric odometry. Utilizing the KITTI\ndataset's LiDAR data, INAF dynamically adjusts attention weights based on\nenvironmental feedback, enhancing the system's adaptability and measurement\naccuracy. This method advances the precision of both localization and 3D\nmapping, demonstrating the potential of our fusion technique to enhance\nautonomous navigation systems in complex scenarios."

By computing similarities between query and item\n(product) embeddings, it efficiently selects candidate products from\nlarge-scale repositories. With the breakthroughs in large language models\n(LLMs), mainstream embedding models have gradually shifted from BERT to LLMs\nfor more accurate text modeling. However, these models still adopt\ndirect-embedding methods, and the semantic accuracy of embeddings remains\ninadequate. Therefore, contrastive learning is heavily employed to achieve\ntight semantic alignment between positive pairs. Consequently, such models tend\nto capture statistical co-occurrence patterns in the training data, biasing\nthem toward shallow lexical and semantic matches. For difficult queries\nexhibiting notable lexical disparity from target items, the performance\ndegrades significantly. In this work, we propose the Large Reasoning Embedding\nModel (LREM), which novelly integrates reasoning processes into representation\nlearning. For difficult queries, LREM first conducts reasoning to achieve a\ndeep understanding of the original query, and then produces a\nreasoning-augmented query embedding for retrieval. This reasoning process\neffectively bridges the semantic gap between original queries and target items,\nsignificantly improving retrieval accuracy. Specifically, we adopt a two-stage\ntraining process: the first stage optimizes the LLM on carefully curated\nQuery-CoT-Item triplets with SFT and InfoNCE losses to establish preliminary\nreasoning and embedding capabilities, and the second stage further refines the\nreasoning trajectories via reinforcement learning (RL).

Modern\nexamples include decisions over justice frameworks, solving environmental\npollution, planning for pandemic resilience and food security.

In forced-choice perceptual studies,\nhuman participants overwhelmingly preferred our imperative layouts, choosing\nthem over those from two state-of-the-art declarative systems 82% and 94% of\nthe time, demonstrating the significant potential of this alternative paradigm.\nFinally, we present a simple automated evaluation metric for 3D scene layout\ngeneration that correlates strongly with human judgment."

To\naddress this, we propose FACE, a general interpretable framework that maps CF\nembeddings into pre-trained LLM tokens. Specifically, we introduce a\ndisentangled projection module to decompose CF embeddings into concept-specific\nvectors, followed by a quantized autoencoder to convert continuous embeddings\ninto LLM tokens (descriptors). Then, we design a contrastive alignment\nobjective to ensure that the tokens align with corresponding textual signals.\nHence, the model-agnostic FACE framework achieves semantic alignment without\nfine-tuning LLMs and enhances recommendation performance by leveraging their\npre-trained capabilities. Empirical results on three real-world recommendation\ndatasets demonstrate performance improvements in benchmark models, with\ninterpretability studies confirming the interpretability of the descriptors.\nCode is available in https://github.com/YixinRoll/FACE.",

Results suggest\nthat both the contextual information and the method by which it is incorporated\nare key, with gains of up to 3 and 6 F1 points on textual and multimodal setups\nrespectively, from a zero-context baseline to the highest-performing system,\nbased on embedding concatenation."

An optimizer then\nallocates resources based on these estimates. After deployment, the system\nmonitors real performance and uses this data to refine its predictions via a\nsecond neural network.

However, its latency and memory demands dominate\nend-to-end budgets on edge hardware. Revisiting the objective of top-K\nselection, we reveal that only relative rankings matter, not exact\nper-candidate scores. We further observe sequence-level sparsity: relative\nrankings stabilize early in intermediate layers, allowing pruning opportunities\nprior to completing full inference.\n  Building on this insight, we propose monolithic forwarding and develop a\ntraining-free inference system, GRATING. By maintaining a global view of all\ncandidates, it reduces latency through progressive cluster pruning. It also\nbounds peak memory usage by strategically overlapping I/O with computation via\ndual-layer sliding window and chunked execution. We evaluate GRATING against\nstate-of-the-art baselines on rerankers from 0.6B to 8B parameters across Apple\nM2 and RTX 5070. GRATING consistently reduces latency by up to 89.0% and peak\nmemory by up to 94.9% in microbenchmarks, without any loss in precision.

                    "value": "Semantic top-K selection with cross-encoder rerankers underpins of on-device\nAI services, such as retrieval-augmented generation, agent memory, and\npersonalized recommendation. However, its latency and memory demands dominate\nend-to-end budgets on edge hardware. Revisiting the objective of top-K\nselection, we reveal that only relative rankings matter, not exact\nper-candidate scores. We further observe sequence-level sparsity: relative\nrankings stabilize early in intermediate layers, allowing pruning opportunities\nprior to completing full inference.\n  Building on this insight, we propose monolithic forwarding and develop a\ntraining-free inference system, GRATING. By maintaining a global view of all\ncandidates, it reduces latency through progressive cluster pruning. It also\nbounds peak memory usage by strategically overlapping I/O with computation via\ndual-layer sliding window and chunked execution. We evaluate GRATING against\nstate-of-the-art baselines on rerankers from 0.6B to 8B parameters across Apple\nM2 and RTX 5070. GRATING consistently reduces latency by up to 89.0% and peak\nmemory by up to 94.9% in microbenchmarks, without any loss in precision. Across\nthree real-world on-device AI applications, GRATING lowers latency by\n11.6%-51.0% and peak memory by 18.6%-77.8%, demonstrating substantial\nimprovements in efficiency and deployability."

Empirically, lmKANs reduce inference\nFLOPs by up to 6.0x while matching the flexibility of MLPs in general\nhigh-dimensional function approximation. In another feedforward fully connected\nbenchmark, on the tabular-like dataset of randomly displaced methane\nconfigurations, lmKANs enable more than 10x higher H100 throughput at equal\naccuracy. Within frameworks of Convolutional Neural Networks, lmKAN-based CNNs\ncut inference FLOPs at matched accuracy by 1.6-2.1x and by 1.7x on the CIFAR-10\nand ImageNet-1k datasets, respectively. Our code, including dedicated CUDA\nkernels, is available online at https://github.com/schwallergroup/lmkan."

With an extended\nscore-threshold-based mechanism, it also achieves strong performance-efficiency\ntrade-offs under low-latency constraints. The code and data are available at\nhttps://github.com/OwwO99/RAGRouter."

More critically, the characterization of deception\nacross realistic real-world scenarios remains underexplored. To bridge this\ngap, we establish DeceptionBench, the first benchmark that systematically\nevaluates how deceptive tendencies manifest across different societal domains,\nwhat their intrinsic behavioral patterns are, and how extrinsic factors affect\nthem. Specifically, on the static count, the benchmark encompasses 150\nmeticulously designed scenarios in five domains, i.e., Economy, Healthcare,\nEducation, Social Interaction, and Entertainment, with over 1,000 samples,\nproviding sufficient empirical foundations for deception analysis.

By computing similarities between query and item\n(product) embeddings, it efficiently selects candidate products from\nlarge-scale repositories. With the breakthroughs in large language models\n(LLMs), mainstream embedding models have gradually shifted from BERT to LLMs\nfor more accurate text modeling. However, these models still adopt\ndirect-embedding methods, and the semantic accuracy of embeddings remains\ninadequate. Therefore, contrastive learning is heavily employed to achieve\ntight semantic alignment between positive pairs. Consequently, such models tend\nto capture statistical co-occurrence patterns in the training data, biasing\nthem toward shallow lexical and semantic matches. For difficult queries\nexhibiting notable lexical disparity from target items, the performance\ndegrades significantly. In this work, we propose the Large Reasoning Embedding\nModel (LREM), which novelly integrates reasoning processes into representation\nlearning. For difficult queries, LREM first conducts reasoning to achieve a\ndeep understanding of the original query, and then produces a\nreasoning-augmented query embedding for retrieval. This reasoning process\neffectively bridges the semantic gap between original queries and target items,\nsignificantly improving retrieval accuracy. Specifically, we adopt a two-stage\ntraining process: the first stage optimizes the LLM on carefully curated\nQuery-CoT-Item triplets with SFT and InfoNCE losses to establish preliminary\nreasoning and embedding capabilities, and the second stage further refines the\nreasoning trajectories via reinforcement learning (RL).

But they commonly operate in remote, dynamic and hazardous\nenvironments, requiring rapid in-mission adaptation without reliance on fragile\nor slow communication links to centralised compute. Fast, on-board replanning\nalgorithms are therefore needed to enhance resilience. Reinforcement Learning\nshows strong promise for efficiently solving mission planning tasks when\nformulated as Travelling Salesperson Problems (TSPs), but existing methods: 1)\nare unsuitable for replanning, where agents do not start at a single location;\n2) do not allow cooperation between agents; 3) are unable to model tasks with\nvariable durations; or 4) lack practical considerations for on-board\ndeployment. Here we define the Cooperative Mission Replanning Problem as a\nnovel variant of multiple TSP with adaptations to overcome these issues, and\ndevelop a new encoder/decoder-based model using Graph Attention Networks and\nAttention Models to solve it effectively and efficiently. Using a simple\nexample of cooperative drones, we show our replanner consistently (90% of the\ntime) maintains performance within 10% of the state-of-the-art LKH3 heuristic\nsolver, whilst running 85-370 times faster on a Raspberry Pi. This work paves\nthe way for increased resilience in autonomous multi-agent systems.",

                    "value": "Cooperative autonomous robotic systems have significant potential for\nexecuting complex multi-task missions across space, air, ground, and maritime\ndomains. But they commonly operate in remote, dynamic and hazardous\nenvironments, requiring rapid in-mission adaptation without reliance on fragile\nor slow communication links to centralised compute. Fast, on-board replanning\nalgorithms are therefore needed to enhance resilience. Reinforcement Learning\nshows strong promise for efficiently solving mission planning tasks when\nformulated as Travelling Salesperson Problems (TSPs), but existing methods: 1)\nare unsuitable for replanning, where agents do not start at a single location;\n2) do not allow cooperation between agents; 3) are unable to model tasks with\nvariable durations; or 4) lack practical considerations for on-board\ndeployment. Here we define the Cooperative Mission Replanning Problem as a\nnovel variant of multiple TSP with adaptations to overcome these issues, and\ndevelop a new encoder/decoder-based model using Graph Attention Networks and\nAttention Models to solve it effectively and efficiently. Using a simple\nexample of cooperative drones, we show our replanner consistently (90% of the\ntime) maintains performance within 10% of the state-of-the-art LKH3 heuristic\nsolver, whilst running 85-370 times faster on a Raspberry Pi. This work paves\nthe way for increased resilience in autonomous multi-agent systems."

To address this gap, we introduce $\\textbf{GraphMind}$, an\neasy-to-use interactive web tool designed to assist users in evaluating the\nnovelty of scientific papers or drafted ideas. Specially, $\\textbf{GraphMind}$\nenables users to capture the main structure of a scientific paper, explore\nrelated ideas through various perspectives, and assess novelty via providing\nverifiable contextual insights. $\\textbf{GraphMind}$ enables users to annotate\nkey elements of a paper, explore related papers through various relationships,\nand assess novelty with contextual insight. This tool integrates external APIs\nsuch as arXiv and Semantic Scholar with LLMs to support annotation, extraction,\nretrieval and classification of papers. This combination provides users with a\nrich, structured view of a scientific idea's core contributions and its\nconnections to existing work. $\\textbf{GraphMind}$ is available at\nhttps://oyarsa.github.io/graphmind and a demonstration video at\nhttps://youtu.be/wKbjQpSvwJg.

To address this gap, we introduce $\\textbf{GraphMind}$, an\neasy-to-use interactive web tool designed to assist users in evaluating the\nnovelty of scientific papers or drafted ideas. Specially, $\\textbf{GraphMind}$\nenables users to capture the main structure of a scientific paper, explore\nrelated ideas through various perspectives, and assess novelty via providing\nverifiable contextual insights. $\\textbf{GraphMind}$ enables users to annotate\nkey elements of a paper, explore related papers through various relationships,\nand assess novelty with contextual insight. This tool integrates external APIs\nsuch as arXiv and Semantic Scholar with LLMs to support annotation, extraction,\nretrieval and classification of papers. This combination provides users with a\nrich, structured view of a scientific idea's core contributions and its\nconnections to existing work. $\\textbf{GraphMind}$ is available at\nhttps://oyarsa.github.io/graphmind and a demonstration video at\nhttps://youtu.be/wKbjQpSvwJg. The source code is available at\nhttps://github.com/oyarsa/graphmind."

Notably, many\nDL frameworks expose similar APIs with overlapping input parameters and\nfunctionalities, rendering them vulnerable to shared bugs, where a flaw in one\nAPI may extend to analogous APIs in other frameworks. To address this\nchallenge, we propose MirrorFuzz, an automated API fuzzing solution to discover\nshared bugs in DL frameworks.

Second, it matches each buggy API in a\nspecific framework with similar APIs within and across other DL frameworks.\nThird, it employs large language models (LLMs) to synthesize code for the API\nunder test, leveraging the historical bug data of similar APIs to trigger\nanalogous bugs across APIs.

While near-term variational quantum\nalgorithms provide a theoretically scalable framework for quantum chemical\nproblems, the accurate simulation of multireference effects remains elusive,\nhindering progress toward the rational design of novel chemical space. In this\nregard, we introduce a general and customizable scheme to handle strong\nelectronic correlation, based on problem decomposition, entanglement buildup,\nand subsequent consolidation.

While near-term variational quantum\nalgorithms provide a theoretically scalable framework for quantum chemical\nproblems, the accurate simulation of multireference effects remains elusive,\nhindering progress toward the rational design of novel chemical space. In this\nregard, we introduce a general and customizable scheme to handle strong\nelectronic correlation, based on problem decomposition, entanglement buildup,\nand subsequent consolidation.

We propose a real-time method, named QFCA,\nwhich implements a quantized version of the feature correspondence analysis\n(FCA) algorithm. By carefully adapting the patch statistics comparison to work\non histograms of quantized values, we obtain a 10x speedup with little to no\nloss in accuracy. Moreover, we introduce a feature preprocessing step based on\nprincipal component analysis, which enhances the contrast between normal and\nanomalous features, improving the detection precision on complex textures.

We propose ParallaxRAG, a\nframework that symmetrically decouples queries and graph triples into\nmulti-view spaces, enabling a robust retrieval architecture that explicitly\nenforces head diversity while constraining weakly related paths. Central to our\napproach is the observation that different attention heads specialize in\nsemantic relations at distinct reasoning stages, contributing to different hops\nof the reasoning chain. This specialization allows ParallaxRAG to construct\ncleaner subgraphs and guide LLMs through grounded, step-wise reasoning.\nExperiments on WebQSP and CWQ, under our unified, reproducible setup (BGE-M3 +\nLlama3.1-8B), demonstrate competitive retrieval and QA performance, alongside\nreduced hallucination and good generalization. Our results highlight multi-view\nhead specialization as a principled direction for knowledge-grounded multi-hop\nreasoning. Our implementation will be released as soon as the paper is\naccepted.",

Knowledge-graph-based\nretrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) offers grounding, yet most methods rely\non flat embeddings and noisy path exploration. We propose ParallaxRAG, a\nframework that symmetrically decouples queries and graph triples into\nmulti-view spaces, enabling a robust retrieval architecture that explicitly\nenforces head diversity while constraining weakly related paths. Central to our\napproach is the observation that different attention heads specialize in\nsemantic relations at distinct reasoning stages, contributing to different hops\nof the reasoning chain. This specialization allows ParallaxRAG to construct\ncleaner subgraphs and guide LLMs through grounded, step-wise reasoning.\nExperiments on WebQSP and CWQ, under our unified, reproducible setup (BGE-M3 +\nLlama3.1-8B), demonstrate competitive retrieval and QA performance, alongside\nreduced hallucination and good generalization. Our results highlight multi-view\nhead specialization as a principled direction for knowledge-grounded multi-hop\nreasoning. Our implementation will be released as soon as the paper is\naccepted."

Unlike conventional compressing approaches that address only a\nsubset of these requirements (limited numerical precision and limited number of\nneurons in the network), SpikeFit treats the allowed weights' discrete values\nthemselves as learnable parameters co-optimized with the model, allowing for\noptimal Clusterization-Aware Training (CAT) of the model's weights at low\nprecision (2-, 4-, or 8-bit) which results in higher network compression\nefficiency, as well as limiting the number of unique synaptic connections to a\nvalue required by neuromorphic processor. This joint optimization allows\nSpikeFit to find a discrete weight set aligned with hardware constraints,\nenabling the most complete deployment across a broader range of neuromorphic\nprocessors than existing methods of SNN compression support. Moreover, SpikeFit\nintroduces a new hardware-friendly Fisher Spike Contribution (FSC) pruning\nmethod showing the state-of-the-art performance. We demonstrate that for\nspiking neural networks constrained to only four unique synaptic weight values\n(M = 4), our SpikeFit method not only outperforms state-of-the-art SNNs\ncompression methods and conventional baselines combining extreme quantization\nschemes and clustering algorithms, but also meets a wider range of neuromorphic\nhardware requirements and provides the lowest energy use in experiments.",

This joint optimization allows\nSpikeFit to find a discrete weight set aligned with hardware constraints,\nenabling the most complete deployment across a broader range of neuromorphic\nprocessors than existing methods of SNN compression support. Moreover, SpikeFit\nintroduces a new hardware-friendly Fisher Spike Contribution (FSC) pruning\nmethod showing the state-of-the-art performance. We demonstrate that for\nspiking neural networks constrained to only four unique synaptic weight values\n(M = 4), our SpikeFit method not only outperforms state-of-the-art SNNs\ncompression methods and conventional baselines combining extreme quantization\nschemes and clustering algorithms, but also meets a wider range of neuromorphic\nhardware requirements and provides the lowest energy use in experiments."

Our preliminary experiments suggest that this degradation stems\nfrom the unstructured latent space, which makes fitting latent tokens\ndifficult. To address this, we restrict the latent space to the column space of\nthe LLM vocabulary, treating latent reasoning as a superposition over\nvocabulary probabilities. Once latent reasoning concludes, it collapses into an\neigenstate of explicit reasoning to yield the final answer. Based on this idea,\nwe propose Latent-SFT, a two-stage learning framework. In the first stage, we\ndesign two specialized attention masks to guide the Latent Token Encoder in\ngenerating latent tokens, allowing the LLM to produce the correct answer\nconditioned on them. In the second stage, the Latent Token Encoder is\ndiscarded, and the LLM is directly trained to generate these latent tokens\nautonomously for latent reasoning, optimized with KL and CE losses. Latent-SFT\nsets a new state of the art on GSM8k, matching explicit SFT performance while\ncutting reasoning chains by up to 4 times and outperforming prior latent\nmethods. On Math500 and AIME24, lexical probability-based latent reasoning also\nclearly surpasses hidden-state-based approaches.

Across diverse mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks, HERO consistently outperforms RM-only and verifier-only baselines,\nwith strong gains on both verifiable and hard-to-verify tasks.

We introduce HERO (Hybrid\nEnsemble Reward Optimization), a reinforcement learning framework that\nintegrates verifier signals with reward-model scores in a structured way. HERO\nemploys stratified normalization to bound reward-model scores within\nverifier-defined groups, preserving correctness while refining quality\ndistinctions, and variance-aware weighting to emphasize challenging prompts\nwhere dense signals matter most. Across diverse mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks, HERO consistently outperforms RM-only and verifier-only baselines,\nwith strong gains on both verifiable and hard-to-verify tasks. Our results show\nthat hybrid reward design retains the stability of verifiers while leveraging\nthe nuance of reward models to advance reasoning."

Existing methods -\nranging from rule-based heuristics to reinforcement learning (RL) - often\nstruggle to generalize to complex, dynamic, and safety-critical scenarios. We\nintroduce VLMLight, a novel TSC framework that integrates vision-language\nmeta-control with dual-branch reasoning. At the core of VLMLight is the first\nimage-based traffic simulator that enables multi-view visual perception at\nintersections, allowing policies to reason over rich cues such as vehicle type,\nmotion, and spatial density. A large language model (LLM) serves as a\nsafety-prioritized meta-controller, selecting between a fast RL policy for\nroutine traffic and a structured reasoning branch for critical cases. In the\nlatter, multiple LLM agents collaborate to assess traffic phases, prioritize\nemergency vehicles, and verify rule compliance. Experiments show that VLMLight\nreduces waiting times for emergency vehicles by up to 65% over RL-only systems,\nwhile preserving real-time performance in standard conditions with less than 1%\ndegradation. VLMLight offers a scalable, interpretable, and safety-aware\nsolution for next-generation traffic signal control.",

Content-based sequential\nrecommendation has recently emerged as a promising direction that exploits\nitems' textual and visual features to enhance preference learning.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel model,\nself-supervised representation learning with ID-Content modality alignment,\nnamed SICSRec. Firstly, we propose a LLM-driven sample construction method and\ndevelop a supervised fine-tuning approach to align item-level modality\nrepresentations. Secondly, we design a novel Transformer-based sequential\nmodel, where an ID-modality sequence encoder captures user behavior\npreferences, a content-modality sequence encoder learns user content\npreferences, and a mix-modality sequence decoder grasps the intrinsic\nrelationship between these two types of preferences. Thirdly, we propose a\ntwo-step training strategy with a content-aware contrastive learning task to\nalign modality representations and ID representations, which decouples the\ntraining process of content modality dependency and item collaborative\ndependency.

However, such aggressive compression leads to\nsignificant accuracy degradation, even after costly quantization-aware training\nwith massive data. We identify the core issue as deadzone trapping: a large\nnumber of weights are trapped at the deadzone boundary. This occurs because\nthese weights receive only noisy, uninformative gradients, preventing stable\nescape from the deadzone and severely impeding model capacity and optimization.\nTo address this issue, we propose Tequila, a trapping-free quantization\noptimization method that reactivates deadzone-trapped weights by repurposing\nthem as dynamic biases.

A prevalent approach\nwithin the field is sampling-based test-time scaling methods, which enhance\nreasoning by generating multiple reasoning paths for a given input during\ninference.

In this paper, we provide the first theoretical framework\nfor analyzing sampling-based test-time scaling methods, grounded in the\nperspective of confidence estimation.

To address these limitations, we introduce RPC, a\nhybrid method that leverages our theoretical insights through two key\ncomponents: Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning. Perplexity\nConsistency combines the strengths of self-consistency and perplexity, boosting\nthe convergence rate of estimation error from linear to exponential while\npreserving model error. Reasoning Pruning prevents degradation by eliminating\nlow-probability reasoning paths. Both theoretical analysis and empirical\nresults across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that RPC has a strong\npotential for reducing reasoning error.

Through comprehensive evaluation across model-, problem-,\nand noise-related configurations, we examine the extent and mechanisms of this\nrobustness, exploring both the handling of character-level tokenization and\nimplicit versus explicit denoising mechanism hypotheses of character-level\nnoises.
