In particular, online\ncontinual learning - iteratively training the model with small batches of user\nfeedback - has demonstrated notable performance improvements. However, the\nexisting practice of separating training and serving processes forces the\nonline trainer to recompute the intermediate results already done during\nserving. Such redundant computations can account for 30%-42% of total training\ntime.\n  In this paper, we propose Alchemist, to the best of our knowledge, the first\nonline continual learning system that efficiently reuses serving activations to\nincrease training throughput. Alchemist introduces two key techniques: (1)\nrecording and storing activations and KV cache only during the prefill phase to\nminimize latency and memory overhead; and (2) smart activation offloading and\nhedging. Evaluations with inputs of varied token length sampled from ShareGPT\ndataset show that compared with a separate training cluster, Alchemist\nsignificantly increases training throughput by up to 1.72x, reduces up to 47%\nmemory usage during training, and supports up to 2x more training tokens - all\nwhile maintaining negligible impact on serving latency.",

Rather than caching keys and\nvalues separately, MLA stores their compressed latent representations, reducing\nmemory overhead while maintaining the performance. While MLA improves memory\nefficiency without compromising language model accuracy, its major limitation\nlies in its integration during the pre-training phase, requiring models to be\ntrained from scratch. This raises a key question: can we use MLA's benefits\nfully or partially in models that have already been pre-trained with different\nattention mechanisms? In this paper, we propose X-EcoMLA to deploy post\ntraining distillation to enable the upcycling of Transformer-based attention\ninto an efficient hybrid (i.e., combination of regular attention and MLA\nlayers) or full MLA variant through lightweight post-training adaptation,\nbypassing the need for extensive pre-training. We demonstrate that leveraging\nthe dark knowledge of a well-trained model can enhance training accuracy and\nenable extreme KV cache compression in MLA without compromising model\nperformance. Our results show that using an 8B teacher model allows us to\ncompress the KV cache size of the Llama3.2-1B-Inst baseline by 6.4x while\npreserving 100% of its average score across multiple tasks on the LM Harness\nEvaluation benchmark.

Existing\ntraining-based token compression methods improve inference efficiency but\nrequire costly retraining, while training-free methods struggle to maintain\nperformance when aggressively reducing token counts. In this study, we reveal\nthat the performance degradation of MLLM closely correlates with the\naccelerated loss of information in the attention output matrix. This insight\nintroduces a novel information-preserving perspective, making it possible to\nmaintain performance even under extreme token compression. Based on this\nfinding, we propose TokenCarve, a training-free, plug-and-play, two-stage token\ncompression framework. The first stage employs an\nInformation-Preservation-Guided Selection (IPGS) strategy to prune\nlow-information tokens, while the second stage further leverages IPGS to guide\ntoken merging, minimizing information loss. Extensive experiments on 11\ndatasets and 2 model variants demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenCarve. It\ncan even reduce the number of visual tokens to 22.2% of the original count,\nachieving a 1.23x speedup in inference, a 64% reduction in KV cache storage,\nand only a 1.54% drop in accuracy.

We propose two new attack\nprimitives, Flush+Demote and Demote+Time, built on our analysis. Flush+Demote\nconstructs a covert channel with a bandwidth of 2.84 Mbps and a bit error rate\nof 0.018%, while Demote+Time derandomizes the kernel base address in 2.49 ms on\nLinux. Furthermore, we show that leveraging cldemote accelerates eviction set\nconstruction in non-inclusive LLC designs by obviating the need for helper\nthreads or extensive cache conflicts, thereby reducing construction time by 36%\nyet retaining comparable success rates. Finally, we examine how ISA extensions\ncontribute to broader microarchitectural attacks, identifying five key\nexploitable characteristics and categorizing four distinct attack types.

We propose two new attack\nprimitives, Flush+Demote and Demote+Time, built on our analysis. Flush+Demote\nconstructs a covert channel with a bandwidth of 2.84 Mbps and a bit error rate\nof 0.018%, while Demote+Time derandomizes the kernel base address in 2.49 ms on\nLinux. Furthermore, we show that leveraging cldemote accelerates eviction set\nconstruction in non-inclusive LLC designs by obviating the need for helper\nthreads or extensive cache conflicts, thereby reducing construction time by 36%\nyet retaining comparable success rates. Finally, we examine how ISA extensions\ncontribute to broader microarchitectural attacks, identifying five key\nexploitable characteristics and categorizing four distinct attack types. We\nalso discuss potential countermeasures, highlighting the far-reaching security\nimplications of emerging ISA extensions."

In\nthis setting, MoE models exhibit a high degree of activation sparsity, meaning\na small number of experts are frequently reused in generating tokens during the\ndecode phase.

This oversight is particularly critical, as KV\ncache reuse has become widely adopted in LLMs inference frameworks, such as\nvLLM and SGLang, as well as by LLM providers, including OpenAI, Microsoft,\nGoogle, and Anthropic. To address this gap, we introduce\nSCBench(SharedContextBench), a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating\nlong-context methods from a KV cachecentric perspective: 1) KV cache\ngeneration, 2) KV cache compression, 3) KV cache retrieval, 4) KV cache\nloading. Specifically, SCBench uses test examples with shared context, ranging\n12 tasks with two shared context modes, covering four categories of\nlong-context capabilities: string retrieval, semantic retrieval, global\ninformation, and multi-task. With it, we provide an extensive KV cache-centric\nanalysis of eight categories long-context solutions, including Gated Linear\nRNNs, Mamba-Attention hybrids, and efficient methods such as sparse attention,\nKV cache dropping, quantization, retrieval, loading, and prompt compression.\nThe evaluation is conducted on 8 long-context LLMs. Our findings show that\nsub-O(n) memory methods suffer in multi-turn scenarios, while sparse encoding\nwith O(n) memory and sub-O(n^2) pre-filling computation perform robustly.\nDynamic sparsity yields more expressive KV caches than static patterns, and\nlayer-level sparsity in hybrid architectures reduces memory usage with strong\nperformance.

To address this gap, we introduce\nSCBench(SharedContextBench), a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating\nlong-context methods from a KV cachecentric perspective: 1) KV cache\ngeneration, 2) KV cache compression, 3) KV cache retrieval, 4) KV cache\nloading. Specifically, SCBench uses test examples with shared context, ranging\n12 tasks with two shared context modes, covering four categories of\nlong-context capabilities: string retrieval, semantic retrieval, global\ninformation, and multi-task. With it, we provide an extensive KV cache-centric\nanalysis of eight categories long-context solutions, including Gated Linear\nRNNs, Mamba-Attention hybrids, and efficient methods such as sparse attention,\nKV cache dropping, quantization, retrieval, loading, and prompt compression.\nThe evaluation is conducted on 8 long-context LLMs. Our findings show that\nsub-O(n) memory methods suffer in multi-turn scenarios, while sparse encoding\nwith O(n) memory and sub-O(n^2) pre-filling computation perform robustly.\nDynamic sparsity yields more expressive KV caches than static patterns, and\nlayer-level sparsity in hybrid architectures reduces memory usage with strong\nperformance. Additionally, we identify attention distribution shift issues in\nlong-generation scenarios. https://aka.ms/SCBench."

In contrast, linear attention\nprovides a far more efficient solution by reducing the complexity to linear\nlevels. However, compared to Softmax attention, linear attention often\nexperiences significant performance degradation. Our experiments indicate that\nthis performance drop is due to the low-rank nature of linear attention's\nfeature map, which hinders its ability to adequately model complex spatial\ninformation. In this paper, to break the low-rank dilemma of linear attention,\nwe conduct rank analysis from two perspectives: the KV buffer and the output\nfeatures. Consequently, we introduce Rank-Augmented Linear Attention (RALA),\nwhich rivals the performance of Softmax attention while maintaining linear\ncomplexity and high efficiency. Based on RALA, we construct the Rank-Augmented\nVision Linear Transformer (RAVLT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAVLT\nachieves excellent performance across various vision tasks. Specifically,\nwithout using any additional labels, data, or supervision during training,\nRAVLT achieves an 84.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k with only 26M parameters\nand 4.6G FLOPs. This result significantly surpasses previous linear attention\nmechanisms, fully illustrating the potential of RALA. Code will be available at\nhttps://github.com/qhfan/RALA.",

As the KV-Cache grows, it\nbecomes a major memory and computation bottleneck, however, there is an\nopportunity to alleviate this bottleneck, especially because prior research has\nshown that only a small subset of tokens contribute meaningfully to each\ndecoding step. A key challenge in finding these critical tokens is that they\nare dynamic, and heavily input query-dependent. Existing methods either risk\nquality by evicting tokens permanently, or retain the full KV-Cache but rely on\nretrieving chunks (pages) of tokens at generation, failing at dense,\ncontext-rich tasks.

To solve this problem, feature caching has been\nproposed to accelerate diffusion models by caching the features in the previous\ntimesteps and then reusing them in the following timesteps. However, at\ntimesteps with significant intervals, the feature similarity in diffusion\nmodels decreases substantially, leading to a pronounced increase in errors\nintroduced by feature caching, significantly harming the generation quality. To\nsolve this problem, we propose TaylorSeer, which firstly shows that features of\ndiffusion models at future timesteps can be predicted based on their values at\nprevious timesteps. Based on the fact that features change slowly and\ncontinuously across timesteps, TaylorSeer employs a differential method to\napproximate the higher-order derivatives of features and predict features in\nfuture timesteps with Taylor series expansion. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate its significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis,\nespecially in high acceleration ratios. For instance, it achieves an almost\nlossless acceleration of 4.99$\\times$ on FLUX and 5.00$\\times$ on HunyuanVideo\nwithout additional training. On DiT, it achieves $3.41$ lower FID compared with\nprevious SOTA at $4.53$$\\times$ acceleration. %Our code is provided in the\nsupplementary materials and will be made publicly available on GitHub.

Efficient Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is\ncrucial to address these issues. However, unlike traditional models, diffusion\nmodels critically rely on the time-step for the multi-round denoising.\nTypically, each time-step is encoded into a hypersensitive temporal feature by\nseveral modules.

To address these challenges, we introduce a novel quantization\nframework that includes three strategies: 1) TIB-based Maintenance: Based on\nour innovative Temporal Information Block (TIB) definition, Temporal\nInformation-aware Reconstruction (TIAR) and Finite Set Calibration (FSC) are\ndeveloped to efficiently align original temporal features. 2) Cache-based\nMaintenance: Instead of indirect and complex optimization for the related\nmodules, pre-computing and caching quantized counterparts of temporal features\nare developed to minimize errors. 3) Disturbance-aware Selection: Employ\ntemporal feature errors to guide a fine-grained selection between the two\nmaintenance strategies for further disturbance reduction.

During inference, we incorporate a feature cache mechanism to generate\nvideos of arbitrary length while maintaining temporal continuity and adopt\nsampling acceleration technique to enhance efficiency. Trained using only a\nbasic MSE diffusion loss for reconstruction, along with KL term and LPIPS\nperceptual loss from scratch, extensive experiments demonstrate that CDT\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in video reconstruction tasks with just a\nsingle-step sampling.

To address this, we\nintroduce Proximity, an approximate key-value cache that optimizes the RAG\nworkflow by leveraging similarities in user queries. Instead of treating each\nquery independently, Proximity reuses previously retrieved documents when\nsimilar queries appear, reducing reliance on expensive vector database lookups.\nWe evaluate Proximity on the MMLU and MedRAG benchmarks, demonstrating that it\nsignificantly improves retrieval efficiency while maintaining response\naccuracy. Proximity reduces retrieval latency by up to 59% while maintaining\naccuracy and lowers the computational burden on the vector database. We also\nexperiment with different similarity thresholds and quantify the trade-off\nbetween speed and recall.

Camera control, if implemented\nat all, is imprecise, because camera parameters are mere inputs to the neural\nnetwork which must then infer how the video depends on the camera. In contrast,\nGEN3C is guided by a 3D cache: point clouds obtained by predicting the\npixel-wise depth of seed images or previously generated frames. When generating\nthe next frames, GEN3C is conditioned on the 2D renderings of the 3D cache with\nthe new camera trajectory provided by the user. Crucially, this means that\nGEN3C neither has to remember what it previously generated nor does it have to\ninfer the image structure from the camera pose. The model, instead, can focus\nall its generative power on previously unobserved regions, as well as advancing\nthe scene state to the next frame. Our results demonstrate more precise camera\ncontrol than prior work, as well as state-of-the-art results in sparse-view\nnovel view synthesis, even in challenging settings such as driving scenes and\nmonocular dynamic video.

As model\nsizes and context lengths grow, the KV Cache becomes a significant memory\nbottleneck, which calls for compression methods that limit its size during\ngeneration. In this paper, we discover surprising properties of Query (Q) and\nKey (K) vectors that allow us to efficiently approximate attention scores\nwithout computing the attention maps. We propose Q-Filters, a training-free KV\nCache compression method that filters out less crucial Key-Value pairs based on\na single context-agnostic projection. Contrarily to many alternatives,\nQ-Filters is compatible with FlashAttention, as it does not require direct\naccess to attention weights. Experimental results in long-context settings\ndemonstrate that Q-Filters is competitive with attention-based compression\nmethods such as SnapKV in retrieval tasks while consistently outperforming\nefficient compression schemes such as Streaming-LLM in generation setups.\nNotably, Q-Filters achieves a 99% accuracy in the needle-in-a-haystack task\nwith a x32 compression level while reducing the generation perplexity drop by\nup to 65% in text generation compared to Streaming-LLM.",

                    "value": "Autoregressive language models rely on a Key-Value (KV) Cache, which avoids\nre-computing past hidden states during generation, making it faster. As model\nsizes and context lengths grow, the KV Cache becomes a significant memory\nbottleneck, which calls for compression methods that limit its size during\ngeneration. In this paper, we discover surprising properties of Query (Q) and\nKey (K) vectors that allow us to efficiently approximate attention scores\nwithout computing the attention maps. We propose Q-Filters, a training-free KV\nCache compression method that filters out less crucial Key-Value pairs based on\na single context-agnostic projection. Contrarily to many alternatives,\nQ-Filters is compatible with FlashAttention, as it does not require direct\naccess to attention weights. Experimental results in long-context settings\ndemonstrate that Q-Filters is competitive with attention-based compression\nmethods such as SnapKV in retrieval tasks while consistently outperforming\nefficient compression schemes such as Streaming-LLM in generation setups.\nNotably, Q-Filters achieves a 99% accuracy in the needle-in-a-haystack task\nwith a x32 compression level while reducing the generation perplexity drop by\nup to 65% in text generation compared to Streaming-LLM."

This\nphenomenon has been widely adopted in applications such as streaming/long\ncontext generation, KV cache optimization, inference acceleration, model\nquantization, and others. Despite its widespread use, a deep understanding of\nattention sink in LMs is still lacking. In this work, we first demonstrate that\nattention sinks exist universally in LMs with various inputs, even in small\nmodels. Furthermore, attention sink is observed to emerge during the LM\npre-training, motivating us to investigate how optimization, data distribution,\nloss function, and model architecture in LM pre-training influence its\nemergence. We highlight that attention sink emerges after effective\noptimization on sufficient training data. The sink position is highly\ncorrelated with the loss function and data distribution. Most importantly, we\nfind that attention sink acts more like key biases, storing extra attention\nscores, which could be non-informative and not contribute to the value\ncomputation. We also observe that this phenomenon (at least partially) stems\nfrom tokens' inner dependence on attention scores as a result of softmax\nnormalization. After relaxing such dependence by replacing softmax attention\nwith other attention operations, such as sigmoid attention without\nnormalization, attention sinks do not emerge in LMs up to 1B parameters.

However, serving long-context LLMs comes with\nsignificant inference costs due to the high memory overhead of the key-value\n(KV) cache. Existing work leverages dynamic sparse attention algorithms (DSAes)\nto mitigate the KV cache overhead, but these algorithms rely on top-$k$ KV\ncache selection, which results in a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.\nA larger $k$ improves accuracy but decreases efficiency, while a smaller $k$\nboosts efficiency but compromises accuracy.

The PSA algorithm adaptively adjusts the KV cache\nbudget of different tokens and layers according to their real attention weight\ndistributions, rather than relying on a fixed budget $k$.

To further enhance execution\nefficiency, we introduce a pipelined iteration scheme that reduces CPU-GPU\ninterleaving and synchronization overhead during PSA computation.

This method is motivated by\nour finding that DiTs' sparse pattern and LSE vary w.r.t. inputs, layers, and\nheads, but remain invariant across denoising steps. By leveraging this\ninvariance across denoising steps, it adapts to the dynamic nature of DiTs and\nallows for precise, real-time identification of sparse indices with minimal\noverhead.

A promising direction is to efficiently harness the\ndiverse capabilities of LLMs to overcome these individual limitations. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce a novel LLM selection algorithm called\nSelectLLM, which efficiently directs input queries to the most suitable subset\nof LLMs from a large pool, ensuring that the selected models collectively\nprovide accurate responses. SelectLLM employs a multi-label classifier and\npolicy based on the classifier's predictions and confidence scores in selecting\nan optimal, query-aware, and lightweight subset of LLMs. Our findings indicate\nthat the proposed model outperforms existing ensemble-based baselines and\nachieves competitive performance with similarly sized top-performing LLMs while\nmaintaining efficiency. Specifically, it achieves a huge reduction in inference\nlatency on two challenging reasoning benchmarks: 13% on GSM8K and 70% on MMLU,\ncompared to the top-performing baseline.

This\ngives them an advantage when compared to Ahead-of-Time (AoT) compilers that\nmust choose the code to generate once for all.\n  Inquiry: Is it possible to improve the performance of AoT compilers by adding\nDynamic Binary Modification (DBM) to the executions?\n  Approach: We added to the Hopc AoT JavaScript compiler a new optimization\nbased on DBM to the inline cache (IC), a classical optimization dynamic\nlanguages use to implement object property accesses efficiently.\n  Knowledge: Reducing the number of memory accesses as the new optimization\ndoes, does not shorten execution times on contemporary architectures.\n  Grounding: The DBM optimization we have implemented is fully operational on\nx86_64 architectures. We have conducted several experiments to evaluate its\nimpact on performance and to study the reasons of the lack of acceleration.\n  Importance: The (negative) result we present in this paper sheds new light on\nthe best strategy to be used to implement dynamic languages. It tells that the\nold days were removing instructions or removing memory reads always yielded to\nspeed up is over. Nowadays, implementing sophisticated compiler optimizations\nis only worth the effort if the processor is not able by itself to accelerate\nthe code.

This\ngives them an advantage when compared to Ahead-of-Time (AoT) compilers that\nmust choose the code to generate once for all.\n  Inquiry: Is it possible to improve the performance of AoT compilers by adding\nDynamic Binary Modification (DBM) to the executions?\n  Approach: We added to the Hopc AoT JavaScript compiler a new optimization\nbased on DBM to the inline cache (IC), a classical optimization dynamic\nlanguages use to implement object property accesses efficiently.\n  Knowledge: Reducing the number of memory accesses as the new optimization\ndoes, does not shorten execution times on contemporary architectures.\n  Grounding: The DBM optimization we have implemented is fully operational on\nx86_64 architectures. We have conducted several experiments to evaluate its\nimpact on performance and to study the reasons of the lack of acceleration.\n  Importance: The (negative) result we present in this paper sheds new light on\nthe best strategy to be used to implement dynamic languages. It tells that the\nold days were removing instructions or removing memory reads always yielded to\nspeed up is over. Nowadays, implementing sophisticated compiler optimizations\nis only worth the effort if the processor is not able by itself to accelerate\nthe code. This result applies to AoT compilers as well as JIT compilers."

While existing training-free\ntoken reduction methods aim to address these inefficiencies, how to precisely\nidentify redundant visual tokens and recover the essential information from the\ndiscarded tokens remain unclear. In this paper, we propose a\n''filter-correlate-compress'' framework that decomposes the token reduction\ninto three stages: filtering redundant tokens, correlating discarded\ninformation to preserved tokens, and compressing tokens to minimize redundancy.\nFollowing the framework, we propose a solution FiCoCo to identify limitations\nin single redundancy assessment, propose adaptive strategies to retain critical\ninformation from discarded tokens, and mitigate semantic dilution during token\nfusion. Two specialized variants, FiCoCo-V (for vision encoders) and FiCoCo-L\n(for LLM decoders), further optimize efficiency across MLLM architectures.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that FiCoCo achieves up to 5.7x/14.7x FLOPs\nreduction with 92.8%/93.6% performance retention on LLaVA-1.5-7B/LLaVA-NeXT-7B.\nOur methods consistently outperform state-of-the-art training-free approaches,\nshowcasing effectiveness and generalizability across model architectures,\nsizes, and tasks without requiring retraining.

                "summary": "State-of-the-art transformer-based large multimodal models (LMMs) struggle to\nhandle hour-long video inputs due to the quadratic complexity of the causal\nself-attention operations, leading to high computational costs during training\nand inference. Existing token compression-based methods reduce the number of\nvideo tokens but often incur information loss and remain inefficient for\nextremely long sequences. In this paper, we explore an orthogonal direction to\nbuild a hybrid Mamba-Transformer model (VAMBA) that employs Mamba-2 blocks to\nencode video tokens with linear complexity. Without any token reduction, VAMBA\ncan encode more than 1024 frames (640$\\times$360) on a single GPU, while\ntransformer-based models can only encode 256 frames. On long video input, VAMBA\nachieves at least 50% reduction in GPU memory usage during training and\ninference, and nearly doubles the speed per training step compared to\ntransformer-based LMMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that VAMBA\nimproves accuracy by 4.3% on the challenging hour-long video understanding\nbenchmark LVBench over prior efficient video LMMs, and maintains strong\nperformance on a broad spectrum of long and short video understanding tasks.",

However, the autoregressive nature of these models\nmakes the inference process slow and costly. Speculative decoding has emerged\nas a promising solution, leveraging a smaller auxiliary model to draft future\ntokens, which are then validated simultaneously by the larger model, achieving\na speed-up of 1-2x. Although speculative decoding matches the same distribution\nas multinomial sampling, multinomial sampling itself is prone to suboptimal\noutputs, whereas beam sampling is widely recognized for producing\nhigher-quality results by maintaining multiple candidate sequences at each\nstep. This paper explores the novel integration of speculative decoding with\nbeam sampling. However, there are four key challenges: (1) how to generate\nmultiple sequences from the larger model's distribution given drafts sequences\nfrom the small model; (2) how to dynamically optimize the number of beams to\nbalance efficiency and accuracy; (3) how to efficiently verify the multiple\ndrafts in parallel; and (4) how to address the extra memory costs inherent in\nbeam sampling. To address these challenges, we propose dynamic-width\nspeculative beam decoding (DSBD). Specifically, we first introduce a novel\ndraft and verification scheme that generates multiple sequences following the\nlarge model's distribution based on beam sampling trajectories from the small\nmodel. Then, we introduce an adaptive mechanism to dynamically tune the number\nof beams based on the context, optimizing efficiency and effectiveness.\nBesides, we extend tree-based parallel verification to handle multiple trees\nsimultaneously, accelerating the verification process. Finally, we illustrate a\nsimple modification to our algorithm to mitigate the memory overhead of beam\nsampling...",

Although speculative decoding matches the same distribution\nas multinomial sampling, multinomial sampling itself is prone to suboptimal\noutputs, whereas beam sampling is widely recognized for producing\nhigher-quality results by maintaining multiple candidate sequences at each\nstep. This paper explores the novel integration of speculative decoding with\nbeam sampling. However, there are four key challenges: (1) how to generate\nmultiple sequences from the larger model's distribution given drafts sequences\nfrom the small model; (2) how to dynamically optimize the number of beams to\nbalance efficiency and accuracy; (3) how to efficiently verify the multiple\ndrafts in parallel; and (4) how to address the extra memory costs inherent in\nbeam sampling. To address these challenges, we propose dynamic-width\nspeculative beam decoding (DSBD). Specifically, we first introduce a novel\ndraft and verification scheme that generates multiple sequences following the\nlarge model's distribution based on beam sampling trajectories from the small\nmodel. Then, we introduce an adaptive mechanism to dynamically tune the number\nof beams based on the context, optimizing efficiency and effectiveness.\nBesides, we extend tree-based parallel verification to handle multiple trees\nsimultaneously, accelerating the verification process. Finally, we illustrate a\nsimple modification to our algorithm to mitigate the memory overhead of beam\nsampling..."

It\nintroduces additional redundancy, abrupt variations, and a domain gap between\nlanguage and vision tokens while generation. Addressing these challenges\nrequires an effective video tokenizer that can efficiently encode video data\nwhile preserving essential semantic and spatiotemporal information, serving as\na critical bridge between text and vision. Inspired by the observation in\nVQ-VAE-2 and workflows of traditional animation, we propose HiTVideo for\ntext-to-video generation with hierarchical tokenizers. It utilizes a 3D causal\nVAE with a multi-layer discrete token framework, encoding video content into\nhierarchically structured codebooks. Higher layers capture semantic information\nwith higher compression, while lower layers focus on fine-grained\nspatiotemporal details, striking a balance between compression efficiency and\nreconstruction quality. Our approach efficiently encodes longer video sequences\n(e.g., 8 seconds, 64 frames), reducing bits per pixel (bpp) by approximately\n70\\% compared to baseline tokenizers, while maintaining competitive\nreconstruction quality. We explore the trade-offs between compression and\nreconstruction, while emphasizing the advantages of high-compressed semantic\ntokens in text-to-video tasks. HiTVideo aims to address the potential\nlimitations of existing video tokenizers in text-to-video generation tasks,\nstriving for higher compression ratios and simplify LLMs modeling under\nlanguage guidance, offering a scalable and promising framework for advancing\ntext to video generation.

The optimal GRPO policy $\\pi_{n}$ can be expressed\nexplicitly in terms of the binary reward, as well as the first and second order\nstatistics of the old policy ($\\pi_{n-1}$) and the reference policy $\\pi_0$.\nIterating this scheme, we obtain a sequence of policies $\\pi_{n}$ for which we\ncan quantify the probability of success $p_n$. We show that the probability of\nsuccess of the policy satisfies a recurrence that converges to a fixed point of\na function that depends on the initial probability of success $p_0$ and the\nregularization parameter $\\beta$ of the $\\mathsf{KL}$ regularizer. We show that\nthe fixed point $p^*$ is guaranteed to be larger than $p_0$, thereby\ndemonstrating that GRPO effectively amplifies the probability of success of the\npolicy.",

We show in this paper that GRPO\nwith verifiable rewards can be written as a Kullback Leibler ($\\mathsf{KL}$)\nregularized contrastive loss, where the contrastive samples are synthetic data\nsampled from the old policy. The optimal GRPO policy $\\pi_{n}$ can be expressed\nexplicitly in terms of the binary reward, as well as the first and second order\nstatistics of the old policy ($\\pi_{n-1}$) and the reference policy $\\pi_0$.\nIterating this scheme, we obtain a sequence of policies $\\pi_{n}$ for which we\ncan quantify the probability of success $p_n$. We show that the probability of\nsuccess of the policy satisfies a recurrence that converges to a fixed point of\na function that depends on the initial probability of success $p_0$ and the\nregularization parameter $\\beta$ of the $\\mathsf{KL}$ regularizer. We show that\nthe fixed point $p^*$ is guaranteed to be larger than $p_0$, thereby\ndemonstrating that GRPO effectively amplifies the probability of success of the\npolicy."

Furthermore, VideoTree\nleverages the inherent hierarchical structure of long video data, which is\noften overlooked by existing LLM-based methods. Specifically, we incorporate\nmulti-granularity information into a tree-based representation, allowing\nVideoTree to extract query-relevant details from long videos in a\ncoarse-to-fine manner. This enables the model to effectively handle a wide\nrange of video queries with varying levels of detail. Finally, VideoTree\naggregates the hierarchical query-relevant information within the tree\nstructure and feeds it into an LLM reasoning model to answer the query.

Second, this patch-based\napproach significantly increases the model's training and inference time.\nRecently, Mamba has garnered attention for its ability to model large-scale\nimages with linear time complexity and low memory consumption. It offers a\npromising solution for training nuclei segmentation and classification models\non full-sized images. However, the Mamba orientation-based scanning method\nlacks account for category-specific features, resulting in sub-optimal\nperformance in scenarios with imbalanced class distributions. To address these\nchallenges, this paper introduces a novel scanning strategy based on category\nprobability sorting, which independently ranks and scans features for each\ncategory according to confidence from high to low. This approach enhances the\nfeature representation of uncertain samples and mitigates the issues caused by\nimbalanced distributions. Extensive experiments conducted on four public\ndatasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches,\ndelivering superior performance in nuclei segmentation and classification\ntasks.",

We aim to simultaneously infer the IMF and the SFH of the Galactic\ndisc comparing Gaia data with the mock catalog resulting from the Besan\\c{c}on\npopulation synthesis model (BGM). Our goal is also to estimate the impact of\nthe systematics present in current stellar evolutionary models (SEMs) on this\ninference. We use a new implementation of the BGM Fast Approximate Simulations\n(BGM FASt) framework to fit the seven million star Gaia DR3 all-sky $G<13$\ncolor-magnitude diagram (CMD) to the most updated dynamically self-consistent\nBGM. Our derived SFH supports an abrupt decrease of the star formation\napproximately 1-1.5 Gyr ago followed by a significant enhancement with a wide\nplateau in the range 2-6 Gyr ago.

Robust constraints of the number density often require line\nobservations of specific molecules along with radiation transfer modeling,\nwhich provides densities traced by that specific molecule. Column density maps\nof molecular clouds are more readily available, with many high-fidelity maps\ncalculated from dust emission and extinction, in particular from surveys\nconducted with the Herschel Space Observatory.

To address this\nchallenge, we introduce HIVAU-70k, a large-scale benchmark for hierarchical\nvideo anomaly understanding across any granularity.

For efficient\nanomaly detection in long videos, we propose the Anomaly-focused Temporal\nSampler (ATS). ATS integrates an anomaly scorer with a density-aware sampler to\nadaptively select frames based on anomaly scores, ensuring that the multimodal\nLLM concentrates on anomaly-rich regions, which significantly enhances both\nefficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nhierarchical instruction data markedly improves anomaly comprehension.

Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates\nthe potential of UniTranslator to overcome the limitations of existing\napproaches and unlock the power of smaller LLMs for complex code translation\ntasks. We explore the effectiveness of this dynamic multi-agent paradigm in\nhandling diverse language pairs, including low-resource languages, and in\nmitigating common issues such as code artifacts and hallucinations through the\nuse of Natural Language Inference (NLI) grounding and iterative feedback\nmechanisms",

Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates\nthe potential of UniTranslator to overcome the limitations of existing\napproaches and unlock the power of smaller LLMs for complex code translation\ntasks. We explore the effectiveness of this dynamic multi-agent paradigm in\nhandling diverse language pairs, including low-resource languages, and in\nmitigating common issues such as code artifacts and hallucinations through the\nuse of Natural Language Inference (NLI) grounding and iterative feedback\nmechanisms"

We propose that maximizing the\ninformational density of individual demonstrations can dramatically reduce\nreliance on large-scale datasets while improving task performance. To this end,\nwe introduce Adversarial Data Collection, a Human-in-the-Loop (HiL) framework\nthat redefines robotic data acquisition through real-time, bidirectional\nhuman-environment interactions. Unlike conventional pipelines that passively\nrecord static demonstrations, ADC adopts a collaborative perturbation paradigm:\nduring a single episode, an adversarial operator dynamically alters object\nstates, environmental conditions, and linguistic commands, while the\ntele-operator adaptively adjusts actions to overcome these evolving challenges.\nThis process compresses diverse failure-recovery behaviors, compositional task\nvariations, and environmental perturbations into minimal demonstrations. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that ADC-trained models achieve superior compositional\ngeneralization to unseen task instructions, enhanced robustness to perceptual\nperturbations, and emergent error recovery capabilities. Strikingly, models\ntrained with merely 20% of the demonstration volume collected through ADC\nsignificantly outperform traditional approaches using full datasets. These\nadvances bridge the gap between data-centric learning paradigms and practical\nrobotic deployment, demonstrating that strategic data acquisition, not merely\npost-hoc processing, is critical for scalable, real-world robot learning.\nAdditionally, we are curating a large-scale ADC-Robotics dataset comprising\nreal-world manipulation tasks with adversarial perturbations.

To this end,\nwe introduce Adversarial Data Collection, a Human-in-the-Loop (HiL) framework\nthat redefines robotic data acquisition through real-time, bidirectional\nhuman-environment interactions. Unlike conventional pipelines that passively\nrecord static demonstrations, ADC adopts a collaborative perturbation paradigm:\nduring a single episode, an adversarial operator dynamically alters object\nstates, environmental conditions, and linguistic commands, while the\ntele-operator adaptively adjusts actions to overcome these evolving challenges.\nThis process compresses diverse failure-recovery behaviors, compositional task\nvariations, and environmental perturbations into minimal demonstrations. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that ADC-trained models achieve superior compositional\ngeneralization to unseen task instructions, enhanced robustness to perceptual\nperturbations, and emergent error recovery capabilities. Strikingly, models\ntrained with merely 20% of the demonstration volume collected through ADC\nsignificantly outperform traditional approaches using full datasets. These\nadvances bridge the gap between data-centric learning paradigms and practical\nrobotic deployment, demonstrating that strategic data acquisition, not merely\npost-hoc processing, is critical for scalable, real-world robot learning.\nAdditionally, we are curating a large-scale ADC-Robotics dataset comprising\nreal-world manipulation tasks with adversarial perturbations. This benchmark\nwill be open-sourced to facilitate advancements in robotic imitation learning."

The results show that\nthe implemented conflict detection and resolution mechanisms allow a\nsignificant improvement in network operation stability by reducing the\nvariability of the measured Downlink (DL) throughput by 78%."

It\nintroduces additional redundancy, abrupt variations, and a domain gap between\nlanguage and vision tokens while generation. Addressing these challenges\nrequires an effective video tokenizer that can efficiently encode video data\nwhile preserving essential semantic and spatiotemporal information, serving as\na critical bridge between text and vision. Inspired by the observation in\nVQ-VAE-2 and workflows of traditional animation, we propose HiTVideo for\ntext-to-video generation with hierarchical tokenizers. It utilizes a 3D causal\nVAE with a multi-layer discrete token framework, encoding video content into\nhierarchically structured codebooks. Higher layers capture semantic information\nwith higher compression, while lower layers focus on fine-grained\nspatiotemporal details, striking a balance between compression efficiency and\nreconstruction quality. Our approach efficiently encodes longer video sequences\n(e.g., 8 seconds, 64 frames), reducing bits per pixel (bpp) by approximately\n70\\% compared to baseline tokenizers, while maintaining competitive\nreconstruction quality. We explore the trade-offs between compression and\nreconstruction, while emphasizing the advantages of high-compressed semantic\ntokens in text-to-video tasks. HiTVideo aims to address the potential\nlimitations of existing video tokenizers in text-to-video generation tasks,\nstriving for higher compression ratios and simplify LLMs modeling under\nlanguage guidance, offering a scalable and promising framework for advancing\ntext to video generation.

We utilize Deep Q-Network (DQN) with action elimination\nand integrate DQN, Double Deep Q-Network ( DDQN), and Dueling DQN architectures\nto effectively manage large state and action spaces. Simulations with various\ninitial donor configurations demonstrate the effectiveness of our DRL approach,\nwith Dueling DQN reducing node count by an average of 12.3% compared to\ntraditional heuristics.

In this paper, we first\nestablish data selection criteria based on three distinct aspects of data\nvalue: diversity, difficulty, and dependability, and then propose the D3 method\ncomprising two key steps of scoring and selection. Specifically, in the scoring\nstep, we define the diversity function to measure sample distinctiveness and\nintroduce the uncertainty-based prediction difficulty to evaluate sample\ndifficulty by mitigating the interference of context-oriented generation\ndiversity. Additionally, we integrate an external LLM for dependability\nassessment. In the selection step, we formulate the D3 weighted coreset\nobjective, which jointly optimizes three aspects of data value to solve for the\nmost valuable subset. The two steps of D3 can iterate multiple rounds,\nincorporating feedback to refine the selection focus adaptively.

To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose VideoTree, a training-free framework which builds a\nquery-adaptive and hierarchical video representation for LLM reasoning over\nlong-form videos. First, VideoTree extracts query-relevant information from the\ninput video through an iterative process, progressively refining the selection\nof keyframes based on their relevance to the query. Furthermore, VideoTree\nleverages the inherent hierarchical structure of long video data, which is\noften overlooked by existing LLM-based methods. Specifically, we incorporate\nmulti-granularity information into a tree-based representation, allowing\nVideoTree to extract query-relevant details from long videos in a\ncoarse-to-fine manner. This enables the model to effectively handle a wide\nrange of video queries with varying levels of detail. Finally, VideoTree\naggregates the hierarchical query-relevant information within the tree\nstructure and feeds it into an LLM reasoning model to answer the query. Our\nexperiments show that our method improves both reasoning accuracy and\nefficiency. Specifically, VideoTree outperforms existing training-free\napproaches on EgoSchema and NExT-QA with less inference time, achieving 61.1%\nand 75.6% accuracy on the test set without additional video-specific training.\nMoreover, on the long split of Video-MME (average 44 minutes), VideoTree\nachieves better performance than GPT-4V and many other MLLMs that were\nextensively trained on video data.",

Three out of\nfive LLMs demonstrated excellent performance (over 90% of F-1 and accuracy),\nwith Llama 3.1 405B achieving 93% in both F-1 and accuracy using a zero-shot\napproach. While LLMs showed promise in binary classification and handling\ncomplex metrics like Patient Health Questionnaire-4, inconsistencies in\nchallenging cases warrant further real-life assessment.

We applied multiple approaches, including engineered prompts,\nsystemic persona, temperature adjustments, and zero-shot and few-shot learning,\nto identify the best-performing model and enhance performance. Three out of\nfive LLMs demonstrated excellent performance (over 90% of F-1 and accuracy),\nwith Llama 3.1 405B achieving 93% in both F-1 and accuracy using a zero-shot\napproach. While LLMs showed promise in binary classification and handling\ncomplex metrics like Patient Health Questionnaire-4, inconsistencies in\nchallenging cases warrant further real-life assessment. The findings highlight\nthe potential of LLMs to assist in timely screening and referrals, providing\nvaluable empirical knowledge for real-world triage systems that could improve\nmental health care for patients with chronic diseases."

Biography generation, as a specialized form of abstractive\nsummarization, plays a crucial role in historical research but faces unique\nchallenges that existing large language models (LLMs) struggle to address.\nThese challenges include maintaining stylistic adherence to historical writing\nconventions, ensuring factual fidelity, and handling fragmented information\nacross multiple documents. We present AIstorian, a novel end-to-end agentic\nsystem featured with a knowledge graph (KG)-powered retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) and anti-hallucination multi-agents. Specifically, AIstorian\nintroduces an in-context learning based chunking strategy and a KG-based index\nfor accurate and efficient reference retrieval. Meanwhile, AIstorian\norchestrates multi-agents to conduct on-the-fly hallucination detection and\nerror-type-aware correction. Additionally, to teach LLMs a certain language\nstyle, we finetune LLMs based on a two-step training approach combining data\naugmentation-enhanced supervised fine-tuning with stylistic preference\noptimization. Extensive experiments on a real-life historical Jinshi dataset\ndemonstrate that AIstorian achieves a 3.8x improvement in factual accuracy and\na 47.6% reduction in hallucination rate compared to existing baselines.

Biography generation, as a specialized form of abstractive\nsummarization, plays a crucial role in historical research but faces unique\nchallenges that existing large language models (LLMs) struggle to address.\nThese challenges include maintaining stylistic adherence to historical writing\nconventions, ensuring factual fidelity, and handling fragmented information\nacross multiple documents. We present AIstorian, a novel end-to-end agentic\nsystem featured with a knowledge graph (KG)-powered retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) and anti-hallucination multi-agents. Specifically, AIstorian\nintroduces an in-context learning based chunking strategy and a KG-based index\nfor accurate and efficient reference retrieval. Meanwhile, AIstorian\norchestrates multi-agents to conduct on-the-fly hallucination detection and\nerror-type-aware correction. Additionally, to teach LLMs a certain language\nstyle, we finetune LLMs based on a two-step training approach combining data\naugmentation-enhanced supervised fine-tuning with stylistic preference\noptimization. Extensive experiments on a real-life historical Jinshi dataset\ndemonstrate that AIstorian achieves a 3.8x improvement in factual accuracy and\na 47.6% reduction in hallucination rate compared to existing baselines. The\ndata and code are available at: https://github.com/ZJU-DAILY/AIstorian."

Traditional Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU)\nmethods focus on frame-level anomaly prediction, often missing the\ninterpretability of complex and diverse real-world anomalies. Recent multimodal\napproaches leverage visual and textual data but lack hierarchical annotations\nthat capture both short-term and long-term anomalies. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce HIVAU-70k, a large-scale benchmark for hierarchical\nvideo anomaly understanding across any granularity. We develop a semi-automated\nannotation engine that efficiently scales high-quality annotations by combining\nmanual video segmentation with recursive free-text annotation using large\nlanguage models (LLMs). This results in over 70,000 multi-granular annotations\norganized at clip-level, event-level, and video-level segments. For efficient\nanomaly detection in long videos, we propose the Anomaly-focused Temporal\nSampler (ATS). ATS integrates an anomaly scorer with a density-aware sampler to\nadaptively select frames based on anomaly scores, ensuring that the multimodal\nLLM concentrates on anomaly-rich regions, which significantly enhances both\nefficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nhierarchical instruction data markedly improves anomaly comprehension. The\nintegrated ATS and visual-language model outperform traditional methods in\nprocessing long videos. Our benchmark and model are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/pipixin321/HolmesVAU.",

Existing studies on LLM self-knowledge\nhave been largely constrained by human-defined notions of feasibility, often\nneglecting the reasons behind unanswerability by LLMs and failing to study\ndeficient types of self-knowledge. This study aims to obtain intrinsic insights\ninto different types of LLM self-knowledge with a novel methodology: allowing\nthem the flexibility to set their own feasibility boundaries and then analysing\nthe consistency of these limits. We find that even frontier models like GPT-4o\nand Mistral Large are not sure of their own capabilities more than 80% of the\ntime, highlighting a significant lack of trustworthiness in responses. Our\nanalysis of confidence balance in LLMs indicates that models swing between\noverconfidence and conservatism in feasibility boundaries depending on task\ncategories and that the most significant self-knowledge weaknesses lie in\ntemporal awareness and contextual understanding. These difficulties in\ncontextual comprehension additionally lead models to question their operational\nboundaries, resulting in considerable confusion within the self-knowledge of\nLLMs. We make our code and results available publicly at\nhttps://github.com/knowledge-verse-ai/LLM-Self_Knowledge_Eval",

To our\nsurprise, 44.44% of the bugs LLMs make are completely identical to the pre-fix\nversion, indicating that LLMs have been seriously biased by historical bugs\nwhen completing code.

In this work, we investigate and evaluate how prompt engineering\ntechnologies can enhance the drug design process from different strategies such\nas zero shot, few shot, chain of thought, etc. The dissolution profile for\nspecific drugs is predicted and suggested from the LLMs model. Furthermore, the\nfundamental physical properties such as PSD, aspect ratio, and specific surface\narea could be inversely designed from the LLMs model. Finally, all the results\nare evaluated and validated by real-world cases to prove the reliability of\nprompt engineering techniques. This work breaks down any barriers in developing\na systematic framework where LLMs assist in formulation design, process\ncontrol, and decision making. Finally, we conclude the work by discussing open\nchallenges and future research directions in pharmaceutical processes."

Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations,\nwe demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, emphasizing the quality of the\ngenerated banner designs, their adaptability to various banner requests, and\ntheir strong editability enabled by this component-based approach."

To address it, we\npropose ChartMoE, which employs the Mixture of Expert (MoE) architecture to\nreplace the traditional linear projector to bridge the modality gap.\nSpecifically, we train several linear connectors through distinct alignment\ntasks, which are utilized as the foundational initialization parameters for\ndifferent experts. Additionally, we introduce ChartMoE-Align, a dataset with\nnearly 1 million chart-table-JSON-code quadruples to conduct three alignment\ntasks (chart-table/JSON/code). Combined with the vanilla connector, we\ninitialize different experts diversely and adopt high-quality knowledge\nlearning to further refine the MoE connector and LLM parameters. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the MoE connector and our\ninitialization strategy, e.g., ChartMoE improves the accuracy of the previous\nstate-of-the-art from 80.48\\% to 84.64\\% on the ChartQA benchmark.",
