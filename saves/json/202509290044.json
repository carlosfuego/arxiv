Our key insight is that effective random-order modeling necessitates\nexplicit guidance for determining the position of the next predicted token. To\nthis end, we propose a novel decoupled decoding framework that decouples\npositional guidance from content representation, encoding them separately as\nqueries and key-value pairs. By directly incorporating this guidance into the\ncausal attention mechanism, our approach enables fully random-order training\nand generation, eliminating the need for bidirectional attention. Consequently,\nARPG readily generalizes to zero-shot inference tasks such as image inpainting,\noutpainting, and resolution expansion. Furthermore, it supports parallel\ninference by concurrently processing multiple queries using a shared KV cache.\nOn the ImageNet-1K 256 benchmark, our approach attains an FID of 1.83 with only\n32 sampling steps, achieving over a 30 times speedup in inference and a 75\npercent reduction in memory consumption compared to representative recent\nautoregressive models at a similar scale.",

In\nrecommendation models, embedding hit rates largely determine throughput, while\nin large language models, KV-cache misses substantially increase\ntime-to-first-token (TTFT). Heuristic policies such as \\textsc{LRU} often\nstruggle under structured access patterns. Learning-based approaches are\npromising, but in practice face two major limitations: they degrade sharply\nwhen predictions are inaccurate, or they gain little even with accurate\npredictions due to conservative designs. Some also incur high overhead, further\nlimiting practicality.\n  We present \\textsc{LCR}, a practical framework for learning-based GPU caching\nthat delivers performance gains while ensuring robustness and efficiency. Its\ncore algorithm, \\textsc{LARU}, enhances \\textsc{LRU} with machine-learned\npredictions and dynamically adapts to prediction accuracy through online error\nestimation. When predictions are accurate, \\textsc{LARU} achieves near-optimal\nperformance. With inaccurate predictions, it degrades gracefully to\nnear-\\textsc{LRU} performance. With \\textsc{LCR}, we bridge the gap between\nempirical progress and theoretical advances in learning-based caching.\n  Experiments show that \\textsc{LCR} delivers consistent gains under realistic\nconditions. In DLRM and LLM scenarios, it improves throughput by up to 24.2\\%\nand reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3\\%, outperforming widely used inference\nsystems.

                    "value": "In modern GPU inference, cache efficiency remains a major bottleneck. In\nrecommendation models, embedding hit rates largely determine throughput, while\nin large language models, KV-cache misses substantially increase\ntime-to-first-token (TTFT). Heuristic policies such as \\textsc{LRU} often\nstruggle under structured access patterns. Learning-based approaches are\npromising, but in practice face two major limitations: they degrade sharply\nwhen predictions are inaccurate, or they gain little even with accurate\npredictions due to conservative designs. Some also incur high overhead, further\nlimiting practicality.\n  We present \\textsc{LCR}, a practical framework for learning-based GPU caching\nthat delivers performance gains while ensuring robustness and efficiency. Its\ncore algorithm, \\textsc{LARU}, enhances \\textsc{LRU} with machine-learned\npredictions and dynamically adapts to prediction accuracy through online error\nestimation. When predictions are accurate, \\textsc{LARU} achieves near-optimal\nperformance. With inaccurate predictions, it degrades gracefully to\nnear-\\textsc{LRU} performance. With \\textsc{LCR}, we bridge the gap between\nempirical progress and theoretical advances in learning-based caching.\n  Experiments show that \\textsc{LCR} delivers consistent gains under realistic\nconditions. In DLRM and LLM scenarios, it improves throughput by up to 24.2\\%\nand reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3\\%, outperforming widely used inference\nsystems. Even under poor predictions, its performance remains stable,\ndemonstrating practical robustness."

While\ntechniques such as Key-Value (KV) cache compression are designed to reduce\nmemory usage, they often neglect the structured sparsity inherent in the\nrelationship between hidden states and their corresponding KV cache. In this\nwork, we explore the role of uncertainty as a potential indicator of sparsity\nwithin LLMs. We propose UNComp, an uncertainty-aware framework that leverages\ntruncated matrix entropy to identify areas of low information content, thereby\nrevealing sparsity patterns that can be used for adaptive compression. Unlike\ntraditional methods that apply uniform compression, UNComp dynamically adjusts\nits approach to compression, guided by uncertainty measures that reflect the\nimportance of various model components. Our analysis shows that sparsity\npatterns, when derived from uncertainty estimates, can be exploited to reveal\nspecial long-range dependencies, such as retrieval heads and retrieval layers.\nThis perspective not only enhances our understanding of how compression can be\noptimized but also provides new insights into the inherent sparsity of LLMs\nduring long-context inference. By focusing on uncertainty to analyze the\nsparsity pattern in detail, UNComp reduces the KV cache size to 4.74% of the\noriginal, achieves a 6% prefill speedup, and improves throughput by 6.4x - not\nonly delivering strong lossless compression performance, but also validating\nthe effectiveness of the underlying theoretical tool. We release the code at\nhttps://github.com/menik1126/UNComp.",

Our approach constructs pruning and\ndistillation sets to perform iterative block removal independently for the\nprefill and decode stages, obtaining better pruning solutions.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach\nconsistently achieves strong performance in both PD disaggregation and PD\nunified settings without disaggregation.

The Reuse Distance Histogram (RDH) is\na widely used metric to quantify temporal locality, measuring the distance\nbetween consecutive accesses to the same memory location. Traditionally,\ncalculating RDH requires program execution and memory trace collection to\nobtain dynamic memory access behavior. This trace collection is often\ntime-consuming, resource-intensive, and unsuitable for early-stage optimization\nor large-scale applications. Static prediction, on the other hand, offers a\nsignificant speedup in estimating RDH and cache hit rates. However, these\napproaches lack accuracy, since the predictions come without running the\nprogram and knowing the complete memory access pattern, more specifically when\narrays are used inside nested loops. This paper presents a novel static\nanalysis framework for predicting the reuse profiles of array references in\nprograms with nested loop structures, without requiring any runtime\ninformation. By analyzing loop bounds, access patterns in smaller problem\nsizes, and predictive equations, our method predicts access patterns of arrays\nand estimates reuse distances and cache hit rate at compile time. This paper\nextends our previous study by incorporating more analysis and improving\nprediction by addressing previously unhandled reuse patterns. We evaluate our\ntechnique against a widely accepted traditional trace-driven profiling tool,\nParallel Reuse Distance Analysis (PARDA). The results demonstrate that our\nstatic predictor achieves comparable accuracy while offering\norders-of-magnitude improvement in the analysis speed.

Although model compression and parameter\noffloading are common strategies to address memory limitations, compression can\ndegrade quality, and offloading maintains quality but suffers from slow\ninference. Speculative decoding presents a promising avenue to accelerate\nparameter offloading, utilizing a fast draft model to propose multiple draft\ntokens, which are then verified by the target LLM in parallel with a single\nforward pass. This method reduces the time-consuming data transfers in forward\npasses that involve offloaded weight transfers. Existing methods often rely on\npretrained weights of the same family, but require additional training to align\nwith custom-trained models. Moreover, approaches that involve draft model\ntraining usually yield only modest speedups.

To address these challenges and achieve greater speedups,\nwe propose SubSpec, a plug-and-play method to accelerate parameter offloading\nthat is lossless and training-free. SubSpec constructs a highly aligned draft\nmodel by generating low-bit quantized substitute layers from offloaded target\nLLM portions.

Spiffy proposes\ndraft states by leveraging the dLLM's distribution itself in an\nauto-speculative manner. This approach is efficient and effective, and\neliminates the overheads of training and running an independent draft model. To\nstructure the candidate draft states, we propose a novel directed draft graph\nwhich is uniquely designed to take advantage of the bidirectional, block-wise\nnature of dLLM generation and can be verified in parallel by the dLLM. To\nfurther optimize the structure of these draft graphs, we introduce an\nefficient, offline calibration algorithm that procedurally determines\nhigh-quality graph configurations. These optimized draft graphs, enabling\nincreased acceptance rates, lead to a significant boost in the overall speedup\nachieved by the system. Crucially, Spiffy is also complementary to other recent\ninnovations in improving dLLM generation speeds such as KV-caching and\nmulti-token unmasking. We demonstrate that when combined with such parallel\ndecoding algorithms, Spiffy is able to effectively multiply the benefits of\nthese methods leading to total speedups of up to $\\mathbf{7.9\\times}$.",

To\nstructure the candidate draft states, we propose a novel directed draft graph\nwhich is uniquely designed to take advantage of the bidirectional, block-wise\nnature of dLLM generation and can be verified in parallel by the dLLM. To\nfurther optimize the structure of these draft graphs, we introduce an\nefficient, offline calibration algorithm that procedurally determines\nhigh-quality graph configurations. These optimized draft graphs, enabling\nincreased acceptance rates, lead to a significant boost in the overall speedup\nachieved by the system. Crucially, Spiffy is also complementary to other recent\ninnovations in improving dLLM generation speeds such as KV-caching and\nmulti-token unmasking. We demonstrate that when combined with such parallel\ndecoding algorithms, Spiffy is able to effectively multiply the benefits of\nthese methods leading to total speedups of up to $\\mathbf{7.9\\times}$."

A\nsemantic element captures the semantic embedding representation of an LLM query\ntogether with performance-aware metadata such as latency, cost, and staticity.\nSine then provides two-stage retrieval: a vector similar index with semantic\nembedding for fast candidate selection and a lightweight LLM-powered semantic\njudger for precise validation.

To reduce overhead,\nAsteria co-locates the small LLM judger with the main LLM using adaptive\nscheduling and resource sharing. Our evaluation demonstrates that Asteria\ndelivers substantial performance improvements without compromising correctness.\nOn representative search workloads, Asteria achieves up to a 3.6$\\times$\nincrease in throughput by maintaining cache hit rates of over 85%, while\npreserving accuracy virtually identical to non-cached baselines.

Our evaluation uses\ndiverse benchmarks to assess both correctness and scalability, and we\ndemonstrate real-world impact by integrating these hash tables into three\ndownstream applications.\n  We propose several optimization techniques to reduce concurrency overhead,\nincluding fingerprint-based metadata to minimize cache line probes and\nspecialized Nvidia GPU instructions for lock-free queries.

Current limitations include incomplete concurrency support and\nmissing compound operations such as upserts.\n  This paper presents WarpSpeed, a library of high-performance concurrent GPU\nhash tables with a unified benchmarking framework for performance analysis.\nWarpSpeed implements eight state-of-the-art Nvidia GPU hash table designs and\nprovides a rich API designed for modern GPU applications. Our evaluation uses\ndiverse benchmarks to assess both correctness and scalability, and we\ndemonstrate real-world impact by integrating these hash tables into three\ndownstream applications.\n  We propose several optimization techniques to reduce concurrency overhead,\nincluding fingerprint-based metadata to minimize cache line probes and\nspecialized Nvidia GPU instructions for lock-free queries. Our findings provide\nnew insights into concurrent GPU hash table design and offer practical guidance\nfor developing efficient, scalable data structures on modern GPUs."

The LFXT was high voltage conditioned up to 300 kV.The\nfocal spot characterization resulted in a strongly eccentric electron\ndistribution with a width of 72.3 $\\mu$m. Dosimetry showed sharp microbeam dose\nprofiles with steep lateral penumbras and a peak-to-valley dose ratio above 10\nthroughout a 70 mm thick PMMA phantom. An open-field dose rate of 4.3 Gy/s was\nmeasured at an acceleration voltage of 150 kV and a beam current of 17.4 mA at\n150 mm distance from the focal spot. In vitro and in vivo experiments\ndemonstrated the feasibility of the LFXT for minibeam and microbeam\napplications with field sizes of 1.5-2 cm.

Yet, existing SD approaches adhere to\na strict draft-then-verify paradigm, enforcing a sequential process that\nhampers performance and constrains the draft model's capacity. Moreover,\nrejecting a token in the candidate sequence invalidates all subsequent tokens,\nleading to wasted computation during drafting. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose a cache-assisted parallel speculative decoding framework called\nCARD, which employs a novel query-and-correct paradigm. Our approach decouples\ndrafting from verification: the draft model populates a shared cache with\ncandidate tokens, while the target model concurrently refines the draft's\ntrajectory. This enables inference at near-draft-speed, effectively leveraging\nthe draft model's efficiency without additional fine-tuning. Experimental\nresults show that CARD significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving up to a 4.83x acceleration over vanilla autoregressive\ndecoding, with no fine-tuning required for either models.",

Yet, existing SD approaches adhere to\na strict draft-then-verify paradigm, enforcing a sequential process that\nhampers performance and constrains the draft model's capacity. Moreover,\nrejecting a token in the candidate sequence invalidates all subsequent tokens,\nleading to wasted computation during drafting. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose a cache-assisted parallel speculative decoding framework called\nCARD, which employs a novel query-and-correct paradigm. Our approach decouples\ndrafting from verification: the draft model populates a shared cache with\ncandidate tokens, while the target model concurrently refines the draft's\ntrajectory. This enables inference at near-draft-speed, effectively leveraging\nthe draft model's efficiency without additional fine-tuning. Experimental\nresults show that CARD significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving up to a 4.83x acceleration over vanilla autoregressive\ndecoding, with no fine-tuning required for either models."

This paper describes the\ndesign and operation of the cathode feedthrough and high voltage distribution\nthrough the field cage of the NEXT-100 experiment, an underground TPC that will\nsearch for neutrinoless double beta decay $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$.

The\nsystem has been realized within the constraints of a stringent radiopurity\nbudget and is now being used to execute a suite of sensitive double beta decay\nanalyses.",

Homoepitaxial growth was performed on (010)\n$10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$ substrates using TMGa as the Ga precursor. Growth\nparameters were systematically optimized to determine the best conditions for\nhigh quality thick growths with the given reactor geometry. Chamber pressure\nwas found to improve the growth rate, mobility, and roughness of the samples.\nGrowth rates of up to 7.2 $\\mu m$/hr., thicknesses of up to 10 $\\mu m$, Hall\nmobilities of up to 176 $cm^2$/Vs, RMS roughness down to 5.45 nm, UID\nconcentrations as low as $2 \\times$ $10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$, and controllable\nintentional doping down to $3 \\times$ $10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$ were achieved. Field\nplated Schottky barrier diodes (FP-SBDs) were fabricated on a $6.5 \\times$\n$10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$ intentionally doped 10 $\\mu m$ thick film to determine the\nelectrical performance of the MOCVD-grown material. The FP-SBD was found to\nhave current density $>$100 A/$cm^2$ at 3 V forward bias with a specific\ndifferential on resistance ($R_{on,sp}$) of 16.22 m$\\Omega$.$cm^2$ and a turn\non voltage of 1 V. The diodes were found to have high quality anode\nmetal/semiconductor interfaces with an ideality factor of 1.04, close to unity.\nDiodes had a maximum breakdown voltage of 1.50 kV, leading to a punch-through\nmaximum field of 2.04 MV/cm under the anode metal, which is a state-of-the-art\nresult for SBDs on MOCVD-grown (010) drift layers.",

                    "value": "We report on the growth optimization of intentionally low-doped ($10^{15}$\n$cm^{-3}$) high-quality $\\beta-Ga_2O_3$ drift layers up to 10 $\\mu m$ thick via\nMOCVD and the fabrication of kilovolt-class field plated Schottky barrier\ndiodes on these thick drift layers. Homoepitaxial growth was performed on (010)\n$10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$ substrates using TMGa as the Ga precursor. Growth\nparameters were systematically optimized to determine the best conditions for\nhigh quality thick growths with the given reactor geometry. Chamber pressure\nwas found to improve the growth rate, mobility, and roughness of the samples.\nGrowth rates of up to 7.2 $\\mu m$/hr., thicknesses of up to 10 $\\mu m$, Hall\nmobilities of up to 176 $cm^2$/Vs, RMS roughness down to 5.45 nm, UID\nconcentrations as low as $2 \\times$ $10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$, and controllable\nintentional doping down to $3 \\times$ $10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$ were achieved. Field\nplated Schottky barrier diodes (FP-SBDs) were fabricated on a $6.5 \\times$\n$10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$ intentionally doped 10 $\\mu m$ thick film to determine the\nelectrical performance of the MOCVD-grown material. The FP-SBD was found to\nhave current density $>$100 A/$cm^2$ at 3 V forward bias with a specific\ndifferential on resistance ($R_{on,sp}$) of 16.22 m$\\Omega$.$cm^2$ and a turn\non voltage of 1 V. The diodes were found to have high quality anode\nmetal/semiconductor interfaces with an ideality factor of 1.04, close to unity.\nDiodes had a maximum breakdown voltage of 1.50 kV, leading to a punch-through\nmaximum field of 2.04 MV/cm under the anode metal, which is a state-of-the-art\nresult for SBDs on MOCVD-grown (010) drift layers."

We provide a formal theoretical analysis of\nAQUA, establishing the break-even point at which it becomes more\ncomputationally efficient than standard attention. Our empirical evaluations on\nstate-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B demonstrate that a 25% reduction in\nthe attention dot-product computation can be achieved with a statistically\ninsignificant impact on performance across a wide range of benchmarks. We\nfurther showcase the versatility of AQUA by demonstrating its ability to\nsynergistically accelerate existing token eviction methods like H2O and to\ndirectly reduce KV-cache memory size.

Although this scheme is simple to implement, it\ntends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect\nor omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose\nJudge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This\nmethod only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost.

The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy\nare further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically,\nwe compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived\ncontext relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which\ntokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to\navoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information\nflow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most\nrepresentative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the\ndiscrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning,\nthereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs.\nExperiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while\nmaintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache\nmemory and 3.8 times faster inference.",

Specifically,\nwe compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived\ncontext relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which\ntokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to\navoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information\nflow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most\nrepresentative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the\ndiscrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning,\nthereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs.\nExperiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while\nmaintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache\nmemory and 3.8 times faster inference."

Their prohibitive computational and memory costs\nseverely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has\nbecome a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we\nempirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing\nbillion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed\nactivation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes\ncalibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first\nQuantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two\ntechnical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained\nQuantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local\nchannel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel\nvariance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which\nfilters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse\ncalibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results\nacross different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous\nstate-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight\nthat our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\\times$ memory reduction and\n2.5$\\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining\nreconstruction accuracy above 98\\% of its full-precision counterpart.

Quantization reduces memory through lower\nnumerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic\nperformance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as\nQuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before\nquantization, using computational invariance: $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{Wx} =\n(\\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\\mathbf{Q}$. However, these\nmethods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case\ncoherence $\\mu = 1/\\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight\ndistributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct\noutlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than\none-size-fits-all approaches. In this work, we propose ButterflyQuant, which\nreplaces Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized\nby continuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\\{+1, -1\\}$\nentries that are non-differentiable and thus prohibit gradient-based learning,\nbutterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization\nwhile guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint\nensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \\log\nn)$ computational complexity with only $\\frac{n \\log n}{2}$ learnable\nparameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on\npost-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to\nquantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in\nminutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost.

These Superchips employ a tightly coupled\nheterogeneous architecture that integrates GPU and CPU on the same package,\nwhich offers unprecedented computational power. However, there has been scant\nresearch investigating how LLM training benefits from this new architecture. In\nthis work, for the first time, we study LLM training solutions based on\noffloading for Superchips. We observe important differences between Superchips\nand traditional loosely-coupled GPU-CPU architecture, which necessitate\nrevisiting prevailing assumptions about offloading. Based on that, we present\nSuperOffload, a Superchip-centric offloading system that simultaneously uses\nHopper GPU, Grace CPU, and NVLink-C2C interconnect more efficiently.\nSuperOffload accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as\nadaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware\ncasting, speculative execution, and a highly optimized Adam optimizer for Grace\nCPUs. Our evaluation of SuperOffload on NVIDIA GH200 demonstrates up to 2.5x\nthroughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based systems,\nenabling training of up to 25B model on a single Superchip while achieving high\ntraining throughput. We also extend SuperOffload with ZeRO-style data\nparallelism and DeepSpeed-Ulysses sequence parallelism, enabling training of\n13B model with sequence lengths up to 1 million tokens on 8 GH200 while\nachieving 55% MFU.",

These limitations restrict their adaptability and effectiveness in\nconstructing optimal portfolios. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Agent\nScaling Simulation (MASS), a novel framework that leverages multi-agent\nsimulation for direct, end-to-end portfolio construction. At its core, MASS\nemploys a backward optimization process to dynamically learn the optimal\ndistribution of heterogeneous agents, enabling the system to adapt to evolving\nmarket regimes. A key finding enabled by our framework is the exploration of\nthe scaling effect for portfolio construction: we demonstrate that as the\nnumber of agents increases exponentially (up to 512), the aggregated decisions\nyield progressively higher excess returns. Extensive experiments on a\nchallenging, self-collected dataset from the 2023 Chinese A-share market show\nthat MASS consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines.

To\nprovide clearer guidance for training practical MLLMs, we introduce the\nMME-VideoOCR benchmark, which encompasses a comprehensive range of video OCR\napplication scenarios. MME-VideoOCR features 10 task categories comprising 25\nindividual tasks and spans 44 diverse scenarios. These tasks extend beyond text\nrecognition to incorporate deeper comprehension and reasoning of textual\ncontent within videos. The benchmark consists of 1,464 videos with varying\nresolutions, aspect ratios, and durations, along with 2,000 meticulously\ncurated, manually annotated question-answer pairs. We evaluate 18\nstate-of-the-art MLLMs on MME-VideoOCR, revealing that even the best-performing\nmodel (Gemini-2.5 Pro) achieves an accuracy of only 73.7%. Fine-grained\nanalysis indicates that while existing MLLMs demonstrate strong performance on\ntasks where relevant texts are contained within a single or few frames, they\nexhibit limited capability in effectively handling tasks that demand holistic\nvideo comprehension. These limitations are especially evident in scenarios that\nrequire spatio-temporal reasoning, cross-frame information integration, or\nresistance to language prior bias. Our findings also highlight the importance\nof high-resolution visual input and sufficient temporal coverage for reliable\nOCR in dynamic video scenarios.",

These tasks extend beyond text\nrecognition to incorporate deeper comprehension and reasoning of textual\ncontent within videos. The benchmark consists of 1,464 videos with varying\nresolutions, aspect ratios, and durations, along with 2,000 meticulously\ncurated, manually annotated question-answer pairs. We evaluate 18\nstate-of-the-art MLLMs on MME-VideoOCR, revealing that even the best-performing\nmodel (Gemini-2.5 Pro) achieves an accuracy of only 73.7%. Fine-grained\nanalysis indicates that while existing MLLMs demonstrate strong performance on\ntasks where relevant texts are contained within a single or few frames, they\nexhibit limited capability in effectively handling tasks that demand holistic\nvideo comprehension. These limitations are especially evident in scenarios that\nrequire spatio-temporal reasoning, cross-frame information integration, or\nresistance to language prior bias. Our findings also highlight the importance\nof high-resolution visual input and sufficient temporal coverage for reliable\nOCR in dynamic video scenarios."

We reveal that existing\nreinforcement learning methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO), rely on on-policy sampling for policy updates. However, in tasks with\nlarge temporal search spaces, this strategy becomes both inefficient and\nlimited in performance, as it often fails to identify temporally accurate\nsolutions. To address this limitation, TempSamp-R1 leverages ground-truth\nannotations as off-policy supervision to provide temporally precise guidance,\neffectively compensating for the sparsity and misalignment in on-policy\nsolutions. To further stabilize training and reduce variance in reward-based\nupdates, TempSamp-R1 provides a non-linear soft advantage computation method\nthat dynamically reshapes the reward feedback via an asymmetric transformation.\nBy employing a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training paradigm, TempSamp-R1\noptimizes a single unified model to support both CoT and non-CoT inference\nmodes, enabling efficient handling of queries with varying reasoning\ncomplexity. Experimental results demonstrate that TempSamp-R1 outperforms\nGRPO-based baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance on\nbenchmark datasets: Charades-STA (R1@0.7: 52.9%, +2.7%), ActivityNet Captions\n(R1@0.5: 56.0%, +5.3%), and QVHighlights (mAP: 30.0%, +3.0%).

Although dense neural models learn contextualised\nembeddings, they still underperform on queries containing negation. To\nunderstand this phenomenon, we study negation in both traditional neural\ninformation retrieval and LLM-based models. We (1) introduce a taxonomy of\nnegation that derives from philosophical, linguistic, and logical definitions;\n(2) generate two benchmark datasets that can be used to evaluate the\nperformance of neural information retrieval models and to fine-tune models for\na more robust performance on negation; and (3) propose a logic-based\nclassification mechanism that can be used to analyze the performance of\nretrieval models on existing datasets. Our taxonomy produces a balanced data\ndistribution over negation types, providing a better training setup that leads\nto faster convergence on the NevIR dataset. Moreover, we propose a\nclassification schema that reveals the coverage of negation types in existing\ndatasets, offering insights into the factors that might affect the\ngeneralization of fine-tuned models on negation.",

To\nunderstand this phenomenon, we study negation in both traditional neural\ninformation retrieval and LLM-based models. We (1) introduce a taxonomy of\nnegation that derives from philosophical, linguistic, and logical definitions;\n(2) generate two benchmark datasets that can be used to evaluate the\nperformance of neural information retrieval models and to fine-tune models for\na more robust performance on negation; and (3) propose a logic-based\nclassification mechanism that can be used to analyze the performance of\nretrieval models on existing datasets. Our taxonomy produces a balanced data\ndistribution over negation types, providing a better training setup that leads\nto faster convergence on the NevIR dataset. Moreover, we propose a\nclassification schema that reveals the coverage of negation types in existing\ndatasets, offering insights into the factors that might affect the\ngeneralization of fine-tuned models on negation."

By\ntraining MoE families that vary total parameters, active parameters, and\ntop-$k$ routing under fixed compute budgets, we disentangle pre-training loss\nfrom downstream accuracy. Our results reveal two principles. First, Active\nFLOPs: models with identical training loss but greater active compute achieve\nhigher reasoning accuracy. Second, Total tokens per parameter (TPP):\nmemorization tasks improve with more parameters, while reasoning tasks benefit\nfrom optimal TPP, indicating that reasoning is data-hungry. Neither\nreinforcement learning post-training (GRPO) nor increased test-time compute\nalters these trends. We therefore argue that optimal MoE sparsity must be\ndetermined jointly by active FLOPs and TPP, revising the classical picture of\ncompute-optimal scaling.

Our results reveal two principles. First, Active\nFLOPs: models with identical training loss but greater active compute achieve\nhigher reasoning accuracy. Second, Total tokens per parameter (TPP):\nmemorization tasks improve with more parameters, while reasoning tasks benefit\nfrom optimal TPP, indicating that reasoning is data-hungry. Neither\nreinforcement learning post-training (GRPO) nor increased test-time compute\nalters these trends. We therefore argue that optimal MoE sparsity must be\ndetermined jointly by active FLOPs and TPP, revising the classical picture of\ncompute-optimal scaling. Our model checkpoints, code and logs are open-source\nat https://github.com/rioyokotalab/optimal-sparsity."

Our key insight is that effective random-order modeling necessitates\nexplicit guidance for determining the position of the next predicted token. To\nthis end, we propose a novel decoupled decoding framework that decouples\npositional guidance from content representation, encoding them separately as\nqueries and key-value pairs. By directly incorporating this guidance into the\ncausal attention mechanism, our approach enables fully random-order training\nand generation, eliminating the need for bidirectional attention. Consequently,\nARPG readily generalizes to zero-shot inference tasks such as image inpainting,\noutpainting, and resolution expansion. Furthermore, it supports parallel\ninference by concurrently processing multiple queries using a shared KV cache.\nOn the ImageNet-1K 256 benchmark, our approach attains an FID of 1.83 with only\n32 sampling steps, achieving over a 30 times speedup in inference and a 75\npercent reduction in memory consumption compared to representative recent\nautoregressive models at a similar scale.",

                    "value": "We introduce ARPG, a novel visual autoregressive model that enables\nrandomized parallel generation, addressing the inherent limitations of\nconventional raster-order approaches, which hinder inference efficiency and\nzero-shot generalization due to their sequential, predefined token generation\norder. Our key insight is that effective random-order modeling necessitates\nexplicit guidance for determining the position of the next predicted token. To\nthis end, we propose a novel decoupled decoding framework that decouples\npositional guidance from content representation, encoding them separately as\nqueries and key-value pairs. By directly incorporating this guidance into the\ncausal attention mechanism, our approach enables fully random-order training\nand generation, eliminating the need for bidirectional attention. Consequently,\nARPG readily generalizes to zero-shot inference tasks such as image inpainting,\noutpainting, and resolution expansion. Furthermore, it supports parallel\ninference by concurrently processing multiple queries using a shared KV cache.\nOn the ImageNet-1K 256 benchmark, our approach attains an FID of 1.83 with only\n32 sampling steps, achieving over a 30 times speedup in inference and a 75\npercent reduction in memory consumption compared to representative recent\nautoregressive models at a similar scale."

The observationally inferred\nprofiles of $x$(ortho-H2D+) and $x$(N2D+)/$x$(N2H+) are reproduced by a\ndeuteration-focused chemo-dynamical model; however, the central ortho-H2D+\ndepletion is only marginally matched within the $2\\sigma$ upper limit, likely\nsuggesting additional deuteration in the depletion zone. From these models we\ninfer a core age of ~0.42Ma, comparable to the free-fall time, suggesting that\nthe substructures formed via rapid, turbulence-dominated fragmentation rather\nthan slow, quasi-static contraction. Our observations also reveal that\northo-H2D+ velocity dispersions are largely subsonic in the core and nearly\nthermal between B1 and B2, consistent with turbulence dissipating within a few\nfree-fall times.

We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)\nScore-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform\nhigher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity\nInconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and\nequivalence contradictions (A=B=C\\neq A). We argue that these issues come from\ninformation loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during\npairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that\naddresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)\ndistribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from\ndiscrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise\nscoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity\nviolations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also\nformalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and\ndemonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with\nLlama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces\nScore-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise\nTransitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining\nhigher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of\nevaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both\ntheoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.\nThe framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model\narchitectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without\nrequiring additional training or human annotations.

Leveraging BESPOKE, we conduct systematic analyses that reveal key\nrequirements for effective personalization in information-seeking tasks,\nproviding a foundation for fine-grained evaluation of personalized\nsearch-augmented LLMs. Our code and data are available at\nhttps://augustinlib.github.io/BESPOKE/."

Yet, current approaches\nhinge on posterior approximations via Tweedie's formula, which often yield\nunreliable guidance, particularly in low-density regions. Stochastic optimal\ncontrol (SOC), in contrast, provides principled posterior simulation but is\nprohibitively expensive for fast sampling. In this work, we reconcile the\nstrengths of these paradigms by introducing Stein Diffusion Guidance (SDG), a\nnovel training-free framework grounded in a surrogate SOC objective. We\nestablish a theoretical bound on the value function, demonstrating the\nnecessity of correcting approximate posteriors to faithfully reflect true\ndiffusion dynamics. Leveraging Stein variational inference, SDG identifies the\nsteepest descent direction that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence\nbetween approximate and true posteriors.

                    "value": "Training free diffusion guidance provides a flexible way to leverage\noff-the-shelf classifiers without additional training. Yet, current approaches\nhinge on posterior approximations via Tweedie's formula, which often yield\nunreliable guidance, particularly in low-density regions. Stochastic optimal\ncontrol (SOC), in contrast, provides principled posterior simulation but is\nprohibitively expensive for fast sampling. In this work, we reconcile the\nstrengths of these paradigms by introducing Stein Diffusion Guidance (SDG), a\nnovel training-free framework grounded in a surrogate SOC objective. We\nestablish a theoretical bound on the value function, demonstrating the\nnecessity of correcting approximate posteriors to faithfully reflect true\ndiffusion dynamics. Leveraging Stein variational inference, SDG identifies the\nsteepest descent direction that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence\nbetween approximate and true posteriors.

The dataset, which contains 1,065 annotated SoM problems,\nmirrors real-world engineering tasks by including both textual problem\nstatements and schematic diagrams. Due to the limited capabilities of current\nfoundation models in understanding complicated visual information, we propose a\nnovel prompting strategy called Descriptions of Images (DoI), which provides\nrigorous expert-generated text descriptions of the visual diagrams as the\ncontext. We evaluate eight representative foundation models, including both\nlarge language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). Our results\nshow that current foundation models struggle significantly with these\nengineering problems, with the best-performing model achieving only 56.6%\naccuracy. Interestingly, we found that LLMs, when provided with DoI, often\noutperform VLMs provided with visual diagrams. A detailed error analysis\nreveals that DoI plays a crucial role in mitigating visual misinterpretation\nerrors, suggesting that accurate text-based descriptions can be more effective\nthan direct image input for current foundation models. This work establishes a\nrigorous benchmark for engineering AI and highlights a critical need for\ndeveloping more robust multimodal reasoning capabilities in foundation models,\nparticularly in scientific and engineering contexts.",

Due to the limited capabilities of current\nfoundation models in understanding complicated visual information, we propose a\nnovel prompting strategy called Descriptions of Images (DoI), which provides\nrigorous expert-generated text descriptions of the visual diagrams as the\ncontext. We evaluate eight representative foundation models, including both\nlarge language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). Our results\nshow that current foundation models struggle significantly with these\nengineering problems, with the best-performing model achieving only 56.6%\naccuracy. Interestingly, we found that LLMs, when provided with DoI, often\noutperform VLMs provided with visual diagrams. A detailed error analysis\nreveals that DoI plays a crucial role in mitigating visual misinterpretation\nerrors, suggesting that accurate text-based descriptions can be more effective\nthan direct image input for current foundation models. This work establishes a\nrigorous benchmark for engineering AI and highlights a critical need for\ndeveloping more robust multimodal reasoning capabilities in foundation models,\nparticularly in scientific and engineering contexts."

In this work, we propose Rubric-Scaffolded\nReinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel instructional scaffolding framework\ndesigned to break the exploration bottleneck for general LLM reasoning.\nSpecifically, RuscaRL introduces checklist-style rubrics as (1) explicit\nscaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, where different rubrics\nare provided as external guidance within task instructions to steer diverse\nhigh-quality responses. This guidance is gradually decayed over time,\nencouraging the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns; (2)\nverifiable rewards for exploitation during model training, where we can obtain\nrobust LLM-as-a-Judge scores using rubrics as references, enabling effective RL\non general reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority\nof the proposed RuscaRL across various benchmarks, effectively expanding\nreasoning boundaries under the Best-of-N evaluation. Notably, RuscaRL\nsignificantly boosts Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 23.6 to 50.3 on HealthBench-500,\nsurpassing GPT-4.1.

To address these challenges, we\npropose Agent-as-Interviewer, a dynamic evaluation paradigm that employs LLM\nagents to conduct multi-turn interactions for evaluation. Unlike current\nbenchmarking or dynamic interaction paradigms, Agent-as-Interviewer utilizes\nagents to invoke knowledge tools for wider and deeper knowledge in the dynamic\nmulti-turn question generation, achieving more comprehensive evaluations of\nLLM's knowledge boundaries. It also leverages agents to plan query strategies\nfor adjustment of the question difficulty levels, enhancing the difficulty\ncontrol to match the actual capabilities of target LLMs. Based on this\nparadigm, we develop JudgeAgent, a knowledge-wise dynamic evaluation framework\nthat employs knowledge-driven synthesis as the agent's tool and uses difficulty\nscoring as strategy guidance, thereby finally providing valuable suggestions to\nhelp targets optimize themselves. Extensive experiments validate the\neffectiveness of JudgeAgent's suggestions, demonstrating that\nAgent-as-Interviewer can accurately identify the knowledge and capability\nboundaries of target models.

We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary\nFlexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven\npreferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward\nmodels to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness.\nRLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g.\naccuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language\nfeedback.

Their prohibitive computational and memory costs\nseverely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has\nbecome a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we\nempirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing\nbillion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed\nactivation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes\ncalibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first\nQuantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two\ntechnical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained\nQuantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local\nchannel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel\nvariance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which\nfilters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse\ncalibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results\nacross different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous\nstate-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight\nthat our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\\times$ memory reduction and\n2.5$\\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining\nreconstruction accuracy above 98\\% of its full-precision counterpart. This\ndemonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in\nresource-constrained scenarios. Our code is released in\nhttps://github.com/wlfeng0509/QuantVGGT.",

Quantization reduces memory through lower\nnumerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic\nperformance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as\nQuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before\nquantization, using computational invariance: $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{Wx} =\n(\\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\\mathbf{Q}$.

We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct\noutlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than\none-size-fits-all approaches. In this work, we propose ButterflyQuant, which\nreplaces Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized\nby continuous Givens rotation angles.

                "summary": "Long context training is crucial for LLM's context extension. Existing\nschemes, such as sequence parallelism, incur substantial communication\noverhead. Pipeline parallelism (PP) reduces this cost, but its effectiveness\nhinges on partitioning granularity. Batch-level PP dividing input samples\nexhibits high memory consumption in long-context scenario, whereas token-level\nPP splitting sequences into slices alleviates memory overhead but may incur\nhardware under-utilization. This trade-off motivates adaptively selecting PP\ngranularity to match resource and workload characteristics. Moreover, sequence\nlength distribution of the real-world dataset exhibits skewness, posing a\nchallenge on PP's workload balance and efficient scheduling. Current static PP\nscheduling methods overlook the variance of sequence length, leading to\nsuboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose Elastic Pipeline Parallelism\n(EPP) that orchestrates token-level PP and batch-level PP to adapt to resource\nand workload heterogeneity. We build InfiniPipe, a distributed training system\nthat unleashes the potential of EPP via (1) a resource-aware and\nworkload-balanced sequence processor that splits long sequences and packs short\nones; and (2) a co-optimization methodology that jointly optimizes pipeline\nschedule and gradient checkpointing via a mechanism named stage-aware\nchunk-level adaptive checkpointing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that\nInfiniPipe achieves a 1.69x speedup over state-of-the-art systems.",

                    "value": "Long context training is crucial for LLM's context extension. Existing\nschemes, such as sequence parallelism, incur substantial communication\noverhead. Pipeline parallelism (PP) reduces this cost, but its effectiveness\nhinges on partitioning granularity. Batch-level PP dividing input samples\nexhibits high memory consumption in long-context scenario, whereas token-level\nPP splitting sequences into slices alleviates memory overhead but may incur\nhardware under-utilization. This trade-off motivates adaptively selecting PP\ngranularity to match resource and workload characteristics. Moreover, sequence\nlength distribution of the real-world dataset exhibits skewness, posing a\nchallenge on PP's workload balance and efficient scheduling. Current static PP\nscheduling methods overlook the variance of sequence length, leading to\nsuboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose Elastic Pipeline Parallelism\n(EPP) that orchestrates token-level PP and batch-level PP to adapt to resource\nand workload heterogeneity. We build InfiniPipe, a distributed training system\nthat unleashes the potential of EPP via (1) a resource-aware and\nworkload-balanced sequence processor that splits long sequences and packs short\nones; and (2) a co-optimization methodology that jointly optimizes pipeline\nschedule and gradient checkpointing via a mechanism named stage-aware\nchunk-level adaptive checkpointing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that\nInfiniPipe achieves a 1.69x speedup over state-of-the-art systems."

In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Agent\nScaling Simulation (MASS), a novel framework that leverages multi-agent\nsimulation for direct, end-to-end portfolio construction. At its core, MASS\nemploys a backward optimization process to dynamically learn the optimal\ndistribution of heterogeneous agents, enabling the system to adapt to evolving\nmarket regimes. A key finding enabled by our framework is the exploration of\nthe scaling effect for portfolio construction: we demonstrate that as the\nnumber of agents increases exponentially (up to 512), the aggregated decisions\nyield progressively higher excess returns. Extensive experiments on a\nchallenging, self-collected dataset from the 2023 Chinese A-share market show\nthat MASS consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines. Further\nbacktesting, stability analyses and the experiment on data leakage concerns\nvalidate its enhanced profitability and robustness.

At its core, MASS\nemploys a backward optimization process to dynamically learn the optimal\ndistribution of heterogeneous agents, enabling the system to adapt to evolving\nmarket regimes. A key finding enabled by our framework is the exploration of\nthe scaling effect for portfolio construction: we demonstrate that as the\nnumber of agents increases exponentially (up to 512), the aggregated decisions\nyield progressively higher excess returns. Extensive experiments on a\nchallenging, self-collected dataset from the 2023 Chinese A-share market show\nthat MASS consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines. Further\nbacktesting, stability analyses and the experiment on data leakage concerns\nvalidate its enhanced profitability and robustness. We have open-sourced our\ncode, dataset, and training snapshots at https://github.com/gta0804/MASS/ to\nfoster further research."

We reveal that existing\nreinforcement learning methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO), rely on on-policy sampling for policy updates. However, in tasks with\nlarge temporal search spaces, this strategy becomes both inefficient and\nlimited in performance, as it often fails to identify temporally accurate\nsolutions. To address this limitation, TempSamp-R1 leverages ground-truth\nannotations as off-policy supervision to provide temporally precise guidance,\neffectively compensating for the sparsity and misalignment in on-policy\nsolutions. To further stabilize training and reduce variance in reward-based\nupdates, TempSamp-R1 provides a non-linear soft advantage computation method\nthat dynamically reshapes the reward feedback via an asymmetric transformation.\nBy employing a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training paradigm, TempSamp-R1\noptimizes a single unified model to support both CoT and non-CoT inference\nmodes, enabling efficient handling of queries with varying reasoning\ncomplexity. Experimental results demonstrate that TempSamp-R1 outperforms\nGRPO-based baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance on\nbenchmark datasets: Charades-STA (R1@0.7: 52.9%, +2.7%), ActivityNet Captions\n(R1@0.5: 56.0%, +5.3%), and QVHighlights (mAP: 30.0%, +3.0%).

While recent work has explored\nprompting LLMs to follow FET, our evaluation demonstrates that LLM-generated\nfour-elements are often incomplete and less representative, limiting their\neffectiveness in legal reasoning. To address these issues, we present JUREX-4E,\nan expert-annotated four-element knowledge base covering 155 criminal charges.\nThe annotations follow a progressive hierarchical framework grounded in legal\nsource validity and incorporate diverse interpretive methods to ensure\nprecision and authority. We evaluate JUREX-4E on the Similar Charge\nDisambiguation task and apply it to Legal Case Retrieval. Experimental results\nvalidate the high quality of JUREX-4E and its substantial impact on downstream\nlegal tasks, underscoring its potential for advancing legal AI applications.\nThe dataset and code are available at: https://github.com/THUlawtech/JUREX",

CLaw comprises two\nkey components: (1) a comprehensive, fine-grained corpus of all 306 Chinese\nnational statutes, segmented to the subparagraph level and incorporating\nprecise historical revision timesteps for rigorous recall evaluation (64,849\nentries), and (2) a challenging set of 254 case-based reasoning instances\nderived from China Supreme Court curated materials to assess the practical\napplication of legal knowledge. Our empirical evaluation reveals that most\ncontemporary LLMs significantly struggle to faithfully reproduce legal\nprovisions. As accurate retrieval and citation of legal provisions form the\nbasis of legal reasoning, this deficiency critically undermines the reliability\nof their responses. We contend that achieving trustworthy legal reasoning in\nLLMs requires a robust synergy of accurate knowledge retrieval--potentially\nenhanced through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG)--and strong general reasoning capabilities.

The model was trained on 1.7M hours of total data samples,\nincluding Granary and NeMo ASR Set 3.0, with non-speech audio added to reduce\nhallucinations for ASR and AST. We describe its two-stage pre-training and\nfine-tuning process with dynamic data balancing, as well as experiments with an\nnGPT encoder. Results show nGPT scales well with massive data, while\nFastConformer excels after fine-tuning. For timestamps, Canary-1B-v2 uses the\nNeMo Forced Aligner (NFA) with an auxiliary CTC model, providing reliable\nsegment-level timestamps for ASR and AST. Evaluations show Canary-1B-v2\noutperforms Whisper-large-v3 on English ASR while being 10x faster, and\ndelivers competitive multilingual ASR and AST performance against larger models\nlike Seamless-M4T-v2-large and LLM-based systems.

Recent research has demonstrated significantly improved\nperformance through fine-tuning LLMs with code review data. However, compared\nto human reviewers who often simultaneously analyze multiple dimensions of code\nreview to better identify issues, the full potential of these methods is\nhampered by the limited or vague information used to fine-tune the models.

However, how these\nmethods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an\naccuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning\nprocess, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies\nreasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training\nprocess (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains).\nSpecifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of\ngranularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs,\nand the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to\nindividual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning\ntrajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories,\nwhereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens\n(about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay\nrates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality\ndistributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates\nreasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it\nacross many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies\nfrom multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct\ncharacteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path\nperspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training,\nwith SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for\ndata construction and more efficient learning approaches.",

                    "value": "Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning\n(RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on\nreasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these\nmethods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an\naccuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning\nprocess, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies\nreasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training\nprocess (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains).\nSpecifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of\ngranularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs,\nand the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to\nindividual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning\ntrajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories,\nwhereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens\n(about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay\nrates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality\ndistributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates\nreasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it\nacross many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies\nfrom multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct\ncharacteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path\nperspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training,\nwith SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for\ndata construction and more efficient learning approaches."

                "summary": "The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators\n(LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation\nframeworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)\nScore-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform\nhigher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity\nInconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and\nequivalence contradictions (A=B=C\\neq A). We argue that these issues come from\ninformation loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during\npairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that\naddresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)\ndistribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from\ndiscrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise\nscoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity\nviolations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also\nformalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and\ndemonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with\nLlama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces\nScore-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise\nTransitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining\nhigher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of\nevaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both\ntheoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.\nThe framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model\narchitectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without\nrequiring additional training or human annotations.

We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)\nScore-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform\nhigher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity\nInconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and\nequivalence contradictions (A=B=C\\neq A). We argue that these issues come from\ninformation loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during\npairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that\naddresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)\ndistribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from\ndiscrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise\nscoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity\nviolations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also\nformalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and\ndemonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with\nLlama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces\nScore-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise\nTransitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining\nhigher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of\nevaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both\ntheoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.\nThe framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model\narchitectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without\nrequiring additional training or human annotations.

Existing methods mainly\nleverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static\nperception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a\nnovel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during\ninference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining\nfocus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual\npredictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP)\nmechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal\nsupervision to optimize reasoning.

Existing methods mainly\nleverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static\nperception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a\nnovel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during\ninference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining\nfocus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual\npredictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP)\nmechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal\nsupervision to optimize reasoning.

Specifically, in terms of\nspatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the\nforeground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this\ndecomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based\narchitecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in\nthe videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on\nrandom masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from\nlarge-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning\nparadigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a\nChain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We\ndecompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and\nleverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide\nthe generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset\ncalled OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in\nvideo concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method\nachieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse\nreference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual\nfidelity and editability.

In this work, we identify and\nsystematically investigate this novel culture positioning bias, in which an\nLLM's default generative stance aligns with a mainstream view and treats other\ncultures as outsiders. We propose the CultureLens benchmark with 4000\ngeneration prompts and 3 evaluation metrics for quantifying this bias through\nthe lens of a culturally situated interview script generation task, in which an\nLLM is positioned as an onsite reporter interviewing local people across 10\ndiverse cultures. Empirical evaluation on 5 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a\nstark pattern: while models adopt insider tones in over 88 percent of\nUS-contexted scripts on average, they disproportionately adopt mainly outsider\nstances for less dominant cultures. To resolve these biases, we propose 2\ninference-time mitigation methods: a baseline prompt-based Fairness\nIntervention Pillars (FIP) method, and a structured Mitigation via Fairness\nAgents (MFA) framework consisting of 2 pipelines: (1) MFA-SA (Single-Agent)\nintroduces a self-reflection and rewriting loop based on fairness guidelines.\n(2) MFA-MA (Multi-Agent) structures the process into a hierarchy of specialized\nagents: a Planner Agent(initial script generation), a Critique Agent (evaluates\ninitial script against fairness pillars), and a Refinement Agent (incorporates\nfeedback to produce a polished, unbiased script).

In this work, we propose Rubric-Scaffolded\nReinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel instructional scaffolding framework\ndesigned to break the exploration bottleneck for general LLM reasoning.\nSpecifically, RuscaRL introduces checklist-style rubrics as (1) explicit\nscaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, where different rubrics\nare provided as external guidance within task instructions to steer diverse\nhigh-quality responses. This guidance is gradually decayed over time,\nencouraging the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns; (2)\nverifiable rewards for exploitation during model training, where we can obtain\nrobust LLM-as-a-Judge scores using rubrics as references, enabling effective RL\non general reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority\nof the proposed RuscaRL across various benchmarks, effectively expanding\nreasoning boundaries under the Best-of-N evaluation. Notably, RuscaRL\nsignificantly boosts Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 23.6 to 50.3 on HealthBench-500,\nsurpassing GPT-4.1.
