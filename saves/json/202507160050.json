However,\nwe have found that client-side state (e.g., caching) is not only ineffective\nbut also consumes valuable memory resources in the deep learning pipelines. We\nthus propose FalconFS, a DFS optimized for deep learning pipelines with the\nstateless-client architecture. Specifically, instead of performing client-side\npath resolution and caching, FalconFS efficiently resolves paths on the server\nside using hybrid metadata indexing and lazy namespace replication. FalconFS\nalso boosts server concurrency with concurrent request merging and provides\neasy deployment with VFS shortcut. Evaluations against CephFS and Lustre show\nthat FalconFS achieves up to 5.72$\\times$ throughput for small file read/write\nand up to 12.81$\\times$ throughput for deep learning model training.

                    "value": "Client-side metadata caching has long been considered an effective method for\naccelerating metadata operations in distributed file systems (DFSs). However,\nwe have found that client-side state (e.g., caching) is not only ineffective\nbut also consumes valuable memory resources in the deep learning pipelines. We\nthus propose FalconFS, a DFS optimized for deep learning pipelines with the\nstateless-client architecture. Specifically, instead of performing client-side\npath resolution and caching, FalconFS efficiently resolves paths on the server\nside using hybrid metadata indexing and lazy namespace replication. FalconFS\nalso boosts server concurrency with concurrent request merging and provides\neasy deployment with VFS shortcut. Evaluations against CephFS and Lustre show\nthat FalconFS achieves up to 5.72$\\times$ throughput for small file read/write\nand up to 12.81$\\times$ throughput for deep learning model training.

PAWN shows competitive and even better performance\nin-distribution than the strongest baselines (fine-tuned LMs) with a fraction\nof their trainable parameters. Our model also generalizes better to unseen\ndomains and source models, with smaller variability in the decision boundary\nacross distribution shifts. It is also more robust to adversarial attacks, and\nif the backbone has multilingual capabilities, it presents decent\ngeneralization to languages not seen during supervised training, with LLaMA3-1B\nreaching a mean macro-averaged F1 score of 81.46% in cross-validation with nine\nlanguages.",

Based on this idea, we propose the Perplexity\nAttention Weighted Network (PAWN), which uses the last hidden states of the LLM\nand positions to weight the sum of a series of features based on metrics from\nthe next-token distribution across the sequence length. Although not zero-shot,\nour method allows us to cache the last hidden states and next-token\ndistribution metrics on disk, greatly reducing the training resource\nrequirements. PAWN shows competitive and even better performance\nin-distribution than the strongest baselines (fine-tuned LMs) with a fraction\nof their trainable parameters. Our model also generalizes better to unseen\ndomains and source models, with smaller variability in the decision boundary\nacross distribution shifts. It is also more robust to adversarial attacks, and\nif the backbone has multilingual capabilities, it presents decent\ngeneralization to languages not seen during supervised training, with LLaMA3-1B\nreaching a mean macro-averaged F1 score of 81.46% in cross-validation with nine\nlanguages."

Efficient Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is\ncrucial to address these issues. However, unlike traditional models, diffusion\nmodels critically rely on the time-step for the multi-round denoising.\nTypically, each time-step is encoded into a hypersensitive temporal feature by\nseveral modules.

It has long been verified that, in a static\nmagnetic field, those atomic energy levels with hyperfine interactions shift\naccording to the Breit-Rabi formula, which introduces nonlinear dependence on\nthe magnetic field. On the other hand, the corresponding Breit-Rabi dependence\non a static electric field has not been observed before due to a combination of\nexperimental challenges. Here we precisely measure the Stark shift of the\n$6s^2\\ ^1S_0\\ \\leftrightarrow\\ 6s6p\\ ^1P_1$ transition of $^{171}$Yb ($I$ =\n1/2) with cold atoms held by an optical dipole trap in a static electric field\nup to 120 kV/cm.

                    "value": "The response of an atom to external electric and magnetic fields can reveal\nfundamental atomic properties. It has long been verified that, in a static\nmagnetic field, those atomic energy levels with hyperfine interactions shift\naccording to the Breit-Rabi formula, which introduces nonlinear dependence on\nthe magnetic field. On the other hand, the corresponding Breit-Rabi dependence\non a static electric field has not been observed before due to a combination of\nexperimental challenges. Here we precisely measure the Stark shift of the\n$6s^2\\ ^1S_0\\ \\leftrightarrow\\ 6s6p\\ ^1P_1$ transition of $^{171}$Yb ($I$ =\n1/2) with cold atoms held by an optical dipole trap in a static electric field\nup to 120 kV/cm. We observe the electric Breit-Rabi effect displaying\nhigh-order ($E^4$ and $E^6$) DC Stark shifts. These effects arise from the\ninfluence of the strong electric field on hyperfine interactions."

Our key insight\nis to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has\nbeen overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into\nmulti-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree\nstructure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal\ndimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token\nreduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a\n2$\\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and\na 3$\\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is\nquery-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same\nvideo. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.",

                "summary": "Existing safety assurance research has primarily focused on training-phase\nalignment to instill safe behaviors into LLMs. However, recent studies have\nexposed these methods' susceptibility to diverse jailbreak attacks.\nConcurrently, inference scaling has significantly advanced LLM reasoning\ncapabilities but remains unexplored in the context of safety assurance.\nAddressing this gap, our work pioneers inference scaling for robust and\neffective LLM safety against emerging threats. We reveal that conventional\ninference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform\npoorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like\nBest-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified\nchallenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high\ncomputational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM)\nevaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference\nscaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance.

                    "value": "Existing safety assurance research has primarily focused on training-phase\nalignment to instill safe behaviors into LLMs. However, recent studies have\nexposed these methods' susceptibility to diverse jailbreak attacks.\nConcurrently, inference scaling has significantly advanced LLM reasoning\ncapabilities but remains unexplored in the context of safety assurance.\nAddressing this gap, our work pioneers inference scaling for robust and\neffective LLM safety against emerging threats. We reveal that conventional\ninference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform\npoorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like\nBest-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified\nchallenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high\ncomputational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM)\nevaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference\nscaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance.

Our\nmethod stores the full scene out-of-core (e.g., in CPU memory) and trains a\nLevel-of-Detail (LoD) representation directly, dynamically streaming only the\nrelevant Gaussians. A hybrid data structure combining Gaussian hierarchies with\nSequential Point Trees enables efficient, view-dependent LoD selection, while a\nlightweight caching and view scheduling system exploits temporal coherence to\nsupport real-time streaming and rendering. Together, these innovations enable\nseamless multi-scale reconstruction and interactive visualization of complex\nscenes -- from broad aerial views to fine-grained ground-level details."

In this paper, we present a completely\nrefactored and object-oriented version of GMGPolar which offers two different\nmatrix-free implementations. Among other things, we leverage the\nSherman-Morrison formula to solve cyclic tridiagonal systems from circular line\nsolvers without additional fill-in and we apply reordering to optimize cache\naccess of circular and radial smoothing operations. With the Give approach,\nmemory requirements are further reduced and speedups of four to seven are\nobtained for usual test cases. For the Take approach, speedups of 16 to 18 can\nbe attained.",

In this\npaper, we propose a simple eviction criterion based on the contribution of\ncached tokens to attention outputs. Our method, CAOTE, optimizes for eviction\nerror due to token eviction, by seamlessly integrating attention scores and\nvalue vectors. This is the first method which uses value vector information on\ntop of attention-based eviction scores. Additionally, CAOTE can act as a\nmeta-heuristic method with flexible usage with any token eviction method.

Fine-tuning LLMs with\nparameter-efficient adapters, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enables these\nmodels to efficiently adapt to downstream tasks without extensive retraining.\nDeploying fine-tuned LLMs on multi-tenant edge devices offers substantial\nbenefits, such as reduced latency, enhanced privacy, and personalized\nresponses. However, serving LLMs efficiently on resource-constrained edge\ndevices presents critical challenges, including the complexity of adapter\nselection for different tasks and memory overhead from frequent adapter\nswapping. Moreover, given the multiple requests in multi-tenant settings,\nprocessing requests sequentially results in underutilization of computational\nresources and increased latency. This paper introduces EdgeLoRA, an efficient\nsystem for serving LLMs on edge devices in multi-tenant environments. EdgeLoRA\nincorporates three key innovations: (1) an adaptive adapter selection mechanism\nto streamline the adapter configuration process; (2) heterogeneous memory\nmanagement, leveraging intelligent adapter caching and pooling to mitigate\nmemory operation overhead; and (3) batch LoRA inference, enabling efficient\nbatch processing to significantly reduce computational latency. Comprehensive\nevaluations using the Llama3.1-8B model demonstrate that EdgeLoRA significantly\noutperforms the status quo (i.e., llama.cpp) in terms of both latency and\nthroughput. The results demonstrate that EdgeLoRA can achieve up to a 4 times\nboost in throughput. Even more impressively, it can serve several orders of\nmagnitude more adapters simultaneously. These results highlight EdgeLoRA's\npotential to transform edge deployment of LLMs in multi-tenant scenarios,\noffering a scalable and efficient solution for resource-constrained\nenvironments.",

However, serving LLMs efficiently on resource-constrained edge\ndevices presents critical challenges, including the complexity of adapter\nselection for different tasks and memory overhead from frequent adapter\nswapping. Moreover, given the multiple requests in multi-tenant settings,\nprocessing requests sequentially results in underutilization of computational\nresources and increased latency. This paper introduces EdgeLoRA, an efficient\nsystem for serving LLMs on edge devices in multi-tenant environments. EdgeLoRA\nincorporates three key innovations: (1) an adaptive adapter selection mechanism\nto streamline the adapter configuration process; (2) heterogeneous memory\nmanagement, leveraging intelligent adapter caching and pooling to mitigate\nmemory operation overhead; and (3) batch LoRA inference, enabling efficient\nbatch processing to significantly reduce computational latency. Comprehensive\nevaluations using the Llama3.1-8B model demonstrate that EdgeLoRA significantly\noutperforms the status quo (i.e., llama.cpp) in terms of both latency and\nthroughput. The results demonstrate that EdgeLoRA can achieve up to a 4 times\nboost in throughput. Even more impressively, it can serve several orders of\nmagnitude more adapters simultaneously. These results highlight EdgeLoRA's\npotential to transform edge deployment of LLMs in multi-tenant scenarios,\noffering a scalable and efficient solution for resource-constrained\nenvironments."

To address those issues, we develop PAE MobiLLM, a privacy-aware and\nefficient LLM FT method which can be deployed on the mobile device via\nserver-assisted additive side-tuning. To further accelerate FT convergence and\nimprove computing efficiency, PAE MobiLLM integrates activation caching on the\nserver side, which allows the server to reuse historical activations and saves\nthe mobile device from repeatedly computing forward passes for the recurring\ndata samples. Besides, to reduce communication cost, PAE MobiLLM develops a\none-token (i.e., ``pivot'' token) activation shortcut that transmits only a\nsingle activation dimension instead of full activation matrices to guide the\nside network tuning. Last but not least, PAE MobiLLM introduces the additive\nadapter side-network design which makes the server train the adapter modules\nbased on device-defined prediction differences rather than raw ground-truth\nlabels. In this way, the server can only assist device-defined side-network\ncomputing, and learn nothing about data, labels or fine-tuned models.",

To\nimprove the decompression bandwidth, we introduce CompBin, a compact binary\nrepresentation of the CSR format. CompBin facilitates direct accesses to\nneighbors while preventing storage usage for unused bytes. Our evaluation on 12\nreal-world and synthetic graphs with up to 128 billion edges shows that PG-Fuse\nand CompBin achieve up to 7.6 and 21.8 times speedup, respectively.",

First, we propose a scalable sampling parallelism strategy with\nmulti-layers workload division and hybrid sampling scheme, which break the\nscalability barriers for large-scale NQS training.

Last, we employ cache-centric optimization for\ntransformer-based \\textit{ansatz} and incorporate it with sampling parallelism\nstrategy, which further speedup up the NQS training and achieve stable memory\nfootprint at scale.

Enhancing the capacity,\ndensity, or bandwidth of these memories can unlock substantial performance\ngains; however, the recent stagnation of SRAM bit-cell scaling leads to\ninequivalent losses in compute density.\n  To address the challenges posed by SRAM's scaling and leakage power\nconsumption, this paper explores the potential CMOS+X integration of amorphous\noxide semiconductor (AOS) transistors in capacitive, persistent memory\ntopologies (e.g., 1T1C eDRAM, 2T0C/3T0C Gain Cell) as alternative cells in\nmulti-ported and high-bandwidth banked GPGPU memories.

Beyond directly answering user queries, LLMs can also\nserve as judges, assessing and comparing the quality of responses generated by\nother models.

To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a\nbenchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and\nunit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform\nnon-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even\nrelatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially\ntrained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still\nexhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise\njudging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can\nsubstantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests\nwritten by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in\nperformance. This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and\nconsistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios. Lastly, we study optimal\nprompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge.

We performed visible to near-infrared multicolor\nphotometry of 2024 PT$_5$ from data taken using the TriColor CMOS Camera and\nSpectrograph (TriCCS) on the Seimei 3.8 m telescope during 2025 January 4-10.\nThe Seimei/TriCCS observations of 2024 PT$_5$ cover phase angles from 14 deg to\n27 deg, and were obtained in the $g$, $r$, $i$, and $z$ bands in the Pan-STARRS\nsystem. In addition, we analyzed $Y$, $J$, $H$, and $K$ photometry taken with\nthe Multi-Object Spectrograph for Infrared Exploration (MOSFIRE) on the Keck I\n10-m telescope taken on 2025 January 16-17.

In this paper, we consider estimation and inference for a\nnonparametric class of real-valued c\\`adl\\`ag functions with bounded sectional\nvariation (Gill et al., 1995), using the Highly Adaptive Lasso (HAL) (van der\nLaan, 2015; Benkeser and van der Laan, 2016; van der Laan, 2023), a flexible\nempirical risk minimizer over linear combinations of tensor products of zero-\nor higher-order spline basis functions under an L1 norm constraint. Building on\nrecent theoretical advances in asymptotic normality and uniform convergence\nrates for higher-order spline HAL estimators (van der Laan, 2023), this work\nfocuses on constructing robust confidence intervals for HAL-based conditional\nmean estimators. To address regularization bias, we propose a targeted HAL with\na debiasing step to remove bias for the conditional mean, and also consider a\nrelaxed HAL estimator to reduce bias. We also introduce both global and local\nundersmoothing strategies to adaptively select the working model, reducing bias\nrelative to variance. Combined with delta-method-based variance estimation, we\nconstruct confidence intervals for conditional means based on HAL. Through\nsimulations, we evaluate combinations of estimation and model selection\nstrategies, showing that our methods substantially reduce bias and yield\nconfidence intervals with coverage rates close to nominal levels across\nscenarios.

                "summary": "Catastrophic forgetting is the primary challenge that hinders continual\nlearning, which refers to a neural network ability to sequentially learn\nmultiple tasks while retaining previously acquired knowledge. Elastic Weight\nConsolidation, a regularization-based approach inspired by synaptic\nconsolidation in biological neural systems, has been used to overcome this\nproblem. In this study prior research is replicated and extended by evaluating\nEWC in supervised learning settings using the PermutedMNIST and RotatedMNIST\nbenchmarks. Through systematic comparisons with L2 regularization and\nstochastic gradient descent (SGD) without regularization, we analyze how\ndifferent approaches balance knowledge retention and adaptability.

Elastic Weight\nConsolidation, a regularization-based approach inspired by synaptic\nconsolidation in biological neural systems, has been used to overcome this\nproblem. In this study prior research is replicated and extended by evaluating\nEWC in supervised learning settings using the PermutedMNIST and RotatedMNIST\nbenchmarks. Through systematic comparisons with L2 regularization and\nstochastic gradient descent (SGD) without regularization, we analyze how\ndifferent approaches balance knowledge retention and adaptability.

Traditional recruitment processes often encounter bottlenecks in\nresume screening and candidate shortlisting due to time and resource\nconstraints. MLAR addresses these challenges employing Large Language Models\n(LLMs) in three distinct layers: extracting key characteristics from job\npostings in the first layer, parsing applicant resume to identify education,\nexperience, skills in the second layer, and similarity matching in the third\nlayer. These features are then matched through advanced semantic algorithms to\nidentify the best candidates efficiently. Our approach integrates seamlessly\ninto existing RPA pipelines, automating resume parsing, job matching, and\ncandidate notifications. Extensive performance benchmarking shows that MLAR\noutperforms the leading RPA platforms, including UiPath and Automation\nAnywhere, in high-volume resume-processing tasks. When processing 2,400\nresumes, MLAR achieved an average processing time of 5.4 seconds per resume,\nreducing processing time by approximately 16.9% compared to Automation Anywhere\nand 17.1% compared to UiPath. These results highlight the potential of MLAR to\ntransform recruitment workflows by providing an efficient, accurate, and\nscalable solution tailored to modern hiring needs.",

                "summary": "Missing covariates are not uncommon in capture-recapture studies. When\ncovariate information is missing at random in capture-recapture data, an\nempirical full likelihood method has been demonstrated to outperform\nconditional-likelihood-based methods in abundance estimation. However, the\nfully observed covariates must be discrete, and the method is not directly\napplicable to continuous-time capture-recapture data. Based on the Binomial and\nPoisson regression models, we propose a two-step semiparametric empirical\nlikelihood approach for abundance estimation in the presence of missing\ncovariates, regardless of whether the fully observed covariates are discrete or\ncontinuous.

When\ncovariate information is missing at random in capture-recapture data, an\nempirical full likelihood method has been demonstrated to outperform\nconditional-likelihood-based methods in abundance estimation. However, the\nfully observed covariates must be discrete, and the method is not directly\napplicable to continuous-time capture-recapture data. Based on the Binomial and\nPoisson regression models, we propose a two-step semiparametric empirical\nlikelihood approach for abundance estimation in the presence of missing\ncovariates, regardless of whether the fully observed covariates are discrete or\ncontinuous.

                "summary": "Prompt engineering has proven to be a crucial step in leveraging pretrained\nlarge language models (LLMs) in solving various real-world tasks. Numerous\nsolutions have been proposed that seek to automate prompt engineering by using\nthe model itself to edit prompts. However, the majority of state-of-the-art\napproaches are evaluated on tasks that require minimal prompt templates and on\nvery large and highly capable LLMs. In contrast, solving complex tasks that\nrequire detailed information to be included in the prompt increases the amount\nof text that needs to be optimised. Furthermore, smaller models have been shown\nto be more sensitive to prompt design. To address these challenges, we propose\nan evolutionary search approach to automated discrete prompt optimisation\nconsisting of two phases.

                    "value": "Prompt engineering has proven to be a crucial step in leveraging pretrained\nlarge language models (LLMs) in solving various real-world tasks. Numerous\nsolutions have been proposed that seek to automate prompt engineering by using\nthe model itself to edit prompts. However, the majority of state-of-the-art\napproaches are evaluated on tasks that require minimal prompt templates and on\nvery large and highly capable LLMs. In contrast, solving complex tasks that\nrequire detailed information to be included in the prompt increases the amount\nof text that needs to be optimised. Furthermore, smaller models have been shown\nto be more sensitive to prompt design. To address these challenges, we propose\nan evolutionary search approach to automated discrete prompt optimisation\nconsisting of two phases. In the first phase, grammar-guided genetic\nprogramming is invoked to synthesise prompt-creating programmes by searching\nthe space of programmes populated by function compositions of syntactic,\ndictionary-based and LLM-based prompt-editing functions.

In the Galaxy however, velocity measurements\nexhibit scatter from both observational uncertainty and the intrinsic velocity\ndispersion of the distribution function. We exploit the factorization property\nof the objective function in SVGPR to simultaneously model both the mean\nvelocity field and velocity dispersion tensor as separate Gaussian Processes.\nThis achieves a computational complexity of O(M^3) versus GPR's O(N^3), where M\n<< N is a subset of points chosen in a principled way to summarize the data.\nApplied to a sample of ~8 x 10^5 stars from the Gaia DR3 Radial Velocity\nSurvey, we construct differentiable profiles of the mean velocity and velocity\ndispersion as functions of height above the Galactic midplane. We find\nasymmetric features in all three diagonal components of the velocity dispersion\ntensor, providing evidence that the vertical dynamics of the Milky Way are in a\nstate of disequilibrium. Furthermore, our dispersion profiles exhibit\ncorrelated structures at several locations in |z|, which we interpret as\nsignatures of the Gaia phase spiral.

These theories are based on\nextensive observations of high-energy solar processes, providing substantial\ndirect evidence in the MeV energy range. Although the model is widely and\nsuccessfully used to explain high-energy cosmic phenomena, direct validation\nhas been elusive. The multi-wavelength spectra and angular profile measurements\nof the Geminga pulsar wind nebula and its pulsar halo, particularly the precise\nspectral observations by HAWC and LHAASO-KM2A in recent years, offer a rare\nopportunity to test these theories with cosmic rays energies between 1 TeV and\nseveral hundred TeV. These observations are expected to elevate the direct\ntesting of theoretical models from multi-MeV to sub-PeV energies. In this work,\na method is developed to test the diffusive shock acceleration and diffusion\npropagation model between one and several hundred TeV energies through the\nlatest spectral and morphological data of the Geminga region from HAWC and\nFermi-LAT. Our results show that the theories of diffusive shock acceleration\nand diffusion propagation are consistent with experimental observations.\nHowever, the published morphological data adopted rather wide energy bins and\ncurrently do not allow a high precision test of the inferred energy dependent\ndiffusion coefficient by observed energy spectra with DSA theory. It is\nanticipated that future HAWC and LHAASO-KM2A observations will yield\nhigher-precision results, and the confirmation of a rapidly increasing\ndiffusion coefficient above 100 TeV would serve as important evidence\nsupporting the diffusive shock acceleration and diffusion propagation theory.",

By ensuring\nconsistent SAM segmentations through video tracking and using low-dimensional\nindexing for high-dimensional CLIP features, SLGaussian efficiently embeds\nlanguage information in 3D space, offering a robust solution for accurate 3D\nscene understanding under sparse view conditions. In experiments on two-view\nsparse 3D object querying and segmentation in the LERF and 3D-OVS datasets,\nSLGaussian outperforms existing methods in chosen IoU, Localization Accuracy,\nand mIoU. Moreover, our model achieves scene inference in under 30 seconds and\nopen-vocabulary querying in just 0.011 seconds per query.",

While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content\nsynthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur,\ntemporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing\nstable, fine-grained motion fields.

This\nframework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current\nlimitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating optimization.\nSpecifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline to extract\nframe-wise deformation control conditions (motion region segmentation masks,\nand camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation. To ameliorate\nmotion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling strategy,\nwhich independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid (head) motions\nfor improved reconstruction accuracy. Meanwhile, a motion consistency\nconstraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency, thereby\nmitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In addition, an\nalternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively refine facial and\noral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video generation. Experiments\nacross multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation quality and 0.64\ngain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian while with 150 FPS\ninference speed.

This\nmethod exploits narrow-linewidth laser absorption of hot CO$_2$ molecules,\nwhich can be generated from combustion or artificially seeded into the flow. A\ncollinear dual-laser setup allowed for periodic scans over tens of CO$_2$\nabsorption transitions near the $\\nu_3$ bandhead every 100 $\\mu s$, from which\ngas temperatures (as well as CO$_2$ concentrations) were determined with high\nsensitivity and robustness. Spatially resolved measurements were achieved using\nan electrically driven high-speed beam scanning system consisting of a 2-D\ngalvo scanner and a pair of off-axis parabolic mirrors. An effective spatial\nresolution of 1 mm was achieved at a planar field measurement speed of 200 Hz\nand a volumetric field measurement speed of 2 Hz, with further improvements in\nspeed anticipated by another order of magnitude. A physically constrained\nnonlinear inference framework was also developed for the quantitative analysis\nof the measurement data. Proof-of-concept experiments were performed on\naxisymmetric flames stabilized on a Mckenna burner at various equivalence\nratios and flow rates, and the results agreed asymptotically with the\ntheoretical value of the adiabatic flame temperature. An additional experiment\non a flame of complex geometry demonstrated an excellent level of resolution,\nprecision, and contrast achieved by the current thermometry method.

                "summary": "The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been a\nlongstanding focus of research. Recent works have further enhanced these\ncapabilities using reinforcement learning (RL), with many new methods claiming\nsignificant improvements with minimal or no external supervision. Surprisingly,\nsome studies even suggest that random or incorrect reward signals can enhance\nreasoning performance. However, these breakthroughs are mostly reported on the\nQwen2.5 model family and evaluated on well-known benchmarks such as MATH-500,\nAMC, and AIME, while failing to achieve similar gains on other models like\nLlama, which warrants further investigation. Our analysis shows that although\nQwen2.5 achieves strong mathematical reasoning performance, its pretraining on\nlarge-scale web corpora makes it vulnerable to data contamination in popular\nbenchmarks. As a result, results derived from these benchmarks may be\nunreliable. To address this, we introduce a generator that produces fully\nsynthetic arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, yielding a\nclean dataset we call RandomCalculation.

                    "value": "The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been a\nlongstanding focus of research. Recent works have further enhanced these\ncapabilities using reinforcement learning (RL), with many new methods claiming\nsignificant improvements with minimal or no external supervision. Surprisingly,\nsome studies even suggest that random or incorrect reward signals can enhance\nreasoning performance. However, these breakthroughs are mostly reported on the\nQwen2.5 model family and evaluated on well-known benchmarks such as MATH-500,\nAMC, and AIME, while failing to achieve similar gains on other models like\nLlama, which warrants further investigation. Our analysis shows that although\nQwen2.5 achieves strong mathematical reasoning performance, its pretraining on\nlarge-scale web corpora makes it vulnerable to data contamination in popular\nbenchmarks. As a result, results derived from these benchmarks may be\nunreliable. To address this, we introduce a generator that produces fully\nsynthetic arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, yielding a\nclean dataset we call RandomCalculation. Using these leakage-free datasets, we\nshow that only accurate reward signals consistently improve performance, while\nnoisy or incorrect signals do not. We advocate for evaluating RL methods on\nuncontaminated benchmarks and across diverse model families to ensure\ntrustworthy conclusions."

Our evaluation on both open-ended and multiple-choice questions\npresent significant challenges for current LLMs; in particular, they notably\nstruggle with open questions that require structured, multi-step legal\nreasoning.

Experimental results across multiple network topologies show that TORTA\nreduces average inference response time by up to 15\\%, improves load balance by\napproximately 4-5\\%, and cuts total operational cost by 10-20\\% compared to\nstate-of-the-art baseline methods.",

Further analyses suggest two additional insights:\n(1) state update operations, unlike attention, incur high hardware cost, making\nper-bank PIM acceleration inefficient, and (2) different low-precision\narithmetic methods offer varying accuracy-area tradeoffs, while we identify\nMicrosoft's MX as the Pareto-optimal choice. Building on these insights, we\ndesign Pimba as an array of State-update Processing Units (SPUs), each shared\nbetween two banks to enable interleaved access to PIM. Each SPU includes a\nState-update Processing Engine (SPE) that comprises element-wise multipliers\nand adders using MX-based quantized arithmetic, enabling efficient execution of\nstate update and attention operations. Our evaluation shows that, compared to\nLLM-optimized GPU and GPU+PIM systems, Pimba achieves up to 3.2x and 2.1x\nhigher token generation throughput, respectively."

At the heart of their success lies the concept of\nTN ranks, which governs the efficiency and expressivity of TN decompositions.\nHowever, unlike matrix ranks, TN ranks often lack a universal meaning and an\nintuitive interpretation, with their properties varying significantly across\ndifferent TN structures.

However, their large\nparameter sizes pose challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices.\nIn this study, we propose an efficient parameter reduction method for these\nmodels by applying $H^{2}$ model order reduction techniques from control theory\nto their linear SSM components. In experiments, the LRA benchmark results show\nthat the model compression based on our proposed method outperforms an existing\nmethod using the Balanced Truncation, while successfully reducing the number of\nparameters in the SSMs to $1/32$ without sacrificing the performance of the\noriginal models."

Three open LLMs: Llama-3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, and\nMistral-Large-Instruct-2407 are selected based on their sizes and architectures\nand tested with zero-shot, few-shot, and two chain-of-thought variants. Outputs\nwere compared with gold answers, and resulting errors were categorized. We find\nthat the performance varies markedly across models and prompting strategies,\nand that translations for Wikidata to DBpedia work far better than translations\nfor DBpedia to Wikidata."

To address\nthis, we propose the Edge Iterative MRI Lesion Localization System\n(EdgeIMLocSys), which integrates Continuous Learning from Human Feedback to\nadaptively fine-tune segmentation models based on clinician feedback, thereby\nenhancing robustness to scanner-specific imaging characteristics. Central to\nthis system is the Graph-based Multi-Modal Interaction Lightweight Network for\nBrain Tumor Segmentation (GMLN-BTS), which employs a Modality-Aware Adaptive\nEncoder (M2AE) to extract multi-scale semantic features efficiently, and a\nGraph-based Multi-Modal Collaborative Interaction Module (G2MCIM) to model\ncomplementary cross-modal relationships via graph structures. Additionally, we\nintroduce a novel Voxel Refinement UpSampling Module (VRUM) that\nsynergistically combines linear interpolation and multi-scale transposed\nconvolutions to suppress artifacts while preserving high-frequency details,\nimproving segmentation boundary accuracy. Our proposed GMLN-BTS model achieves\na Dice score of 85.1% on the BraTS2017 dataset with only 4.58 million\nparameters, representing a 98% reduction compared to mainstream 3D Transformer\nmodels, and significantly outperforms existing lightweight approaches. This\nwork demonstrates a synergistic breakthrough in achieving high-accuracy,\nresource-efficient brain tumor segmentation suitable for deployment in\nresource-constrained clinical environments.",

To address\nthis, we propose the Edge Iterative MRI Lesion Localization System\n(EdgeIMLocSys), which integrates Continuous Learning from Human Feedback to\nadaptively fine-tune segmentation models based on clinician feedback, thereby\nenhancing robustness to scanner-specific imaging characteristics. Central to\nthis system is the Graph-based Multi-Modal Interaction Lightweight Network for\nBrain Tumor Segmentation (GMLN-BTS), which employs a Modality-Aware Adaptive\nEncoder (M2AE) to extract multi-scale semantic features efficiently, and a\nGraph-based Multi-Modal Collaborative Interaction Module (G2MCIM) to model\ncomplementary cross-modal relationships via graph structures. Additionally, we\nintroduce a novel Voxel Refinement UpSampling Module (VRUM) that\nsynergistically combines linear interpolation and multi-scale transposed\nconvolutions to suppress artifacts while preserving high-frequency details,\nimproving segmentation boundary accuracy. Our proposed GMLN-BTS model achieves\na Dice score of 85.1% on the BraTS2017 dataset with only 4.58 million\nparameters, representing a 98% reduction compared to mainstream 3D Transformer\nmodels, and significantly outperforms existing lightweight approaches. This\nwork demonstrates a synergistic breakthrough in achieving high-accuracy,\nresource-efficient brain tumor segmentation suitable for deployment in\nresource-constrained clinical environments."

Reasoning with table-structured data poses\nsignificant challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to its hidden\nsemantics, inherent complexity, and structured nature. One of these challenges\nis lacking an effective evaluation benchmark fairly reflecting the performances\nof LLMs on broad table reasoning abilities. In this paper, we fill in this gap,\npresenting a comprehensive table reasoning evolution benchmark, TReB, which\nmeasures both shallow table understanding abilities and deep table reasoning\nabilities, a total of 26 sub-tasks. We construct a high quality dataset through\nan iterative data processing procedure. We create an evaluation framework to\nrobustly measure table reasoning capabilities with three distinct inference\nmodes, TCoT, PoT and ICoT. Further, we benchmark over 20 state-of-the-art LLMs\nusing this frame work and prove its effectiveness.

Reasoning with table-structured data poses\nsignificant challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to its hidden\nsemantics, inherent complexity, and structured nature. One of these challenges\nis lacking an effective evaluation benchmark fairly reflecting the performances\nof LLMs on broad table reasoning abilities. In this paper, we fill in this gap,\npresenting a comprehensive table reasoning evolution benchmark, TReB, which\nmeasures both shallow table understanding abilities and deep table reasoning\nabilities, a total of 26 sub-tasks. We construct a high quality dataset through\nan iterative data processing procedure. We create an evaluation framework to\nrobustly measure table reasoning capabilities with three distinct inference\nmodes, TCoT, PoT and ICoT. Further, we benchmark over 20 state-of-the-art LLMs\nusing this frame work and prove its effectiveness.

In this work, we\nput forward a new paradigm of MemSinks that promotes isolation of memorization\nby design. We leverage a sequence identifier that activates a unique set of\nmemorization neurons for each sequence across repetitions. By analyzing the\ndynamics of learning and forgetting, we argue that MemSinks facilitates\nisolation of memorized content, making it easier to remove without compromising\ngeneral language capabilities. We implement MemSinks at the billion-parameter\nand billion-token scale, and observe both effective isolation and strong\ngeneralization.

To begin, we continual train current ATP models\nwith a hybrid dataset, which consists of numerous statement-proof pairs, and\nadditional data aimed at incorporating cognitive behaviors that emulate human\nreasoning and hypothesis refinement. Next, we explore reinforcement learning\nwith the use of outcome reward returned by Lean 4 compiler.

For example, we achieve a 59.8% pass\nrate (pass@32) on MiniF2F. This is an on-going project and we will\nprogressively update our findings, release our data and training details.",
