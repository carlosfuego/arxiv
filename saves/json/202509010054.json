                "summary": "X-ray scatter has been a serious concern in computed tomography (CT), leading\nto image artifacts and distortion of CT values. The linear Boltzmann transport\nequation (LBTE) is recognized as a fast and accurate approach for scatter\nestimation. However, for multi-spectral CT, it is cumbersome to compute\nmultiple scattering components for different spectra separately when applying\nLBTE-based scatter correction. In this work, we propose a Matrixed-Spectrum\nDecomposition accelerated LBTE solver (MSD-LBTE) that can be used to compute\nX-ray scatter distributions from CT acquisitions at two or more different\nspectra simultaneously, in a unified framework with no sacrifice in accuracy\nand nearly no increase in computation in theory. First, a matrixed-spectrum\nsolver of LBTE is obtained by introducing an additional label dimension to\nexpand the phase space. Then, we propose a ``spectrum basis'' for LBTE and a\nprinciple of selection of basis using the QR decomposition, along with the\nabove solver to construct the MSD-LBTE.

                    "value": "X-ray scatter has been a serious concern in computed tomography (CT), leading\nto image artifacts and distortion of CT values. The linear Boltzmann transport\nequation (LBTE) is recognized as a fast and accurate approach for scatter\nestimation. However, for multi-spectral CT, it is cumbersome to compute\nmultiple scattering components for different spectra separately when applying\nLBTE-based scatter correction. In this work, we propose a Matrixed-Spectrum\nDecomposition accelerated LBTE solver (MSD-LBTE) that can be used to compute\nX-ray scatter distributions from CT acquisitions at two or more different\nspectra simultaneously, in a unified framework with no sacrifice in accuracy\nand nearly no increase in computation in theory. First, a matrixed-spectrum\nsolver of LBTE is obtained by introducing an additional label dimension to\nexpand the phase space. Then, we propose a ``spectrum basis'' for LBTE and a\nprinciple of selection of basis using the QR decomposition, along with the\nabove solver to construct the MSD-LBTE. Based on MSD-LBTE, a unified scatter\ncorrection method can be established for multi-spectral CT. We validate the\neffectiveness and accuracy of our method by comparing it with the Monte Carlo\nmethod, including the computational time. We also evaluate the scatter\ncorrection performance using two different phantoms for fast-kV switching based\ndual-energy CT, and using an elliptical phantom in a numerical simulation for\nkV-modulation enabled CT scans, validating that our proposed method can\nsignificantly reduce the computational cost at multiple spectra and effectively\nreduce scatter artifact in reconstructed CT images."

To address these issues,\nwe propose a training-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value\nDecomposition (ASVD). Specifically, ASVD manages activation outliers by\ntransforming the weight matrix based on the activation distribution. This\ntransformation allows the outliers in the activation matrix to be absorbed into\nthe transformed weight matrix, thereby enhancing decomposition accuracy.\nAdditionally, we propose an efficient iterative calibration process to optimize\nlayer-specific decomposition by addressing the varying sensitivity of different\nLLM layers. In this way, ASVD can compress a network by 10%-30%. Based on the\nsuccess of the low-rank decomposition of projection matrices in the\nself-attention module, we further introduce ASVD to compress the KV cache. By\nreducing the channel dimension of KV activations, memory requirements for KV\ncache can be largely reduced.

Both models\nare trained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal datasets sourced via\nresponsible web crawling, licensed corpora, and high-quality synthetic data,\nthen further refined with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on\na new asynchronous platform. The resulting models support several additional\nlanguages while understanding images and executing tool calls.

Both models\nare trained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal datasets sourced via\nresponsible web crawling, licensed corpora, and high-quality synthetic data,\nthen further refined with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on\na new asynchronous platform. The resulting models support several additional\nlanguages while understanding images and executing tool calls.

Notably, our experiments show that\nIOMMU interference can delay DMA transactions by up to 1.79x for lower-size\ntransfers on the Arm SMMUv2 implementation."

However, transferring large\ncached contexts back to the GPU introduces severe performance bottlenecks:\nfragmented I/O from paged layouts prevents full bandwidth utilization, and\nexisting schedulers fail to account for cache-loading delays, leaving systems\nloading-bound rather than compute-bound. We present Strata, a hierarchical\ncontext caching framework designed for efficient long context LLM serving.\nStrata introduces GPU-assisted I/O to combat KV cache fragmentation, decoupling\nGPU and CPU memory layouts and employs cache-aware request scheduling to\nbalance compute with I/O latency and overlapping unavoidable stalls with\ncomplementary tasks. Built on SGLang and deployed in production, Strata\nachieves up to 5x lower Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) compared to vLLM + LMCache\nand 3.75x speedup over NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM on long-context benchmarks, without\ndegrading short-context performance."

Across real-robot tasks and large open logs, RT-Cache achieves higher\nsuccess and lower completion time than strong retrieval baselines\n(approximately x2 higher success and ~30% faster in our settings), and a\nsingle-episode anchoring study shows immediate adaptation to a more complex,\ncontact-rich task without fine-tuning. RT-Cache turns experience into an\nappend-only memory, offering a simple, scalable path to few-shot deployment\ntoday and a foundation for multimodal keys and optional integration with\nhigh-level policies.

Recently, diffusion models\n(DMs) have shown great potential in this area by leveraging strong generative\npriors to restore fine details. However, their iterative denoising process\nincurs high computational overhead, posing challenges for real-time\napplications. Although one-step distillation methods, such as OSEDiff and\nTSD-SR, offer faster inference, they remain fundamentally constrained by their\nlarge, over-parameterized model architectures. In this work, we present TinySR,\na compact yet effective diffusion model specifically designed for Real-ISR that\nachieves real-time performance while maintaining perceptual quality. We\nintroduce a Dynamic Inter-block Activation and an Expansion-Corrosion Strategy\nto facilitate more effective decision-making in depth pruning. We achieve VAE\ncompression through channel pruning, attention removal and lightweight SepConv.\nWe eliminate time- and prompt-related modules and perform pre-caching\ntechniques to further speed up the model. TinySR significantly reduces\ncomputational cost and model size, achieving up to 5.68x speedup and 83%\nparameter reduction compared to its teacher TSD-SR, while still providing high\nquality results.",

However, their iterative denoising process\nincurs high computational overhead, posing challenges for real-time\napplications. Although one-step distillation methods, such as OSEDiff and\nTSD-SR, offer faster inference, they remain fundamentally constrained by their\nlarge, over-parameterized model architectures. In this work, we present TinySR,\na compact yet effective diffusion model specifically designed for Real-ISR that\nachieves real-time performance while maintaining perceptual quality. We\nintroduce a Dynamic Inter-block Activation and an Expansion-Corrosion Strategy\nto facilitate more effective decision-making in depth pruning. We achieve VAE\ncompression through channel pruning, attention removal and lightweight SepConv.\nWe eliminate time- and prompt-related modules and perform pre-caching\ntechniques to further speed up the model. TinySR significantly reduces\ncomputational cost and model size, achieving up to 5.68x speedup and 83%\nparameter reduction compared to its teacher TSD-SR, while still providing high\nquality results."

                "summary": "In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using\nunlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test\ndistributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy\ncriterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class\ncompactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution\nshifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class\ndistributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between\ncache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this\nobservation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time\nAdaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing\nprototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for\nintegrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class\ndistributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using\nhigh-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating\ncross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype\nresidual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream\ntasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve\nstate-of-the-art generalization performance.

                    "value": "In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using\nunlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test\ndistributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy\ncriterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class\ncompactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution\nshifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class\ndistributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between\ncache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this\nobservation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time\nAdaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing\nprototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for\nintegrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class\ndistributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using\nhigh-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating\ncross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype\nresidual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream\ntasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve\nstate-of-the-art generalization performance.

Existing static\ncaching strategies mitigate this issue only in the initial navigation phase by\npreloading entry points and multi-hop neighbors, but they fail in the second\nphase where query-dependent nodes must be dynamically accessed to achieve high\nrecall. We propose GoVector, an I/O-efficient caching strategy tailored for\ndisk-based graph indices. GoVector combines (1) a static cache that stores\nentry points and frequently accessed neighbors, and (2) a dynamic cache that\nadaptively captures nodes with high spatial locality during the second search\nphase. To further align storage layout with similarity-driven search patterns,\nGoVector reorders nodes on disk so that similar vectors are colocated on the\nsame or adjacent pages, thereby improving locality and reducing I/O overhead.\nExtensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that GoVector achieves\nsubstantial performance improvements. At 90% recall, it reduces I/O operations\nby 46% on average, increases query throughput by 1.73x, and lowers query\nlatency by 42% compared to state-of-the-art disk-based graph indexing systems.",

In such a case, a polynomial-time\nalgorithm with a $\\left(1-\\epsilon\\right)/2$-approximation guarantee is\ndeveloped. Subsequently, we address the original problem for the general case\nby developing a greedy algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the\nproposed TrimCaching framework significantly improves the cache hit ratio\ncompared with state-of-the-art content caching without exploiting shared\nparameters in AI models."

Emerging hybrid bonding (HB) technology has been\nproposed as a promising alternative to conventional near-memory processing\n(NMP) architectures, offering improved bandwidth efficiency and lower power\nconsumption while exhibiting characteristics of distributed memory. In this\npaper, we propose H2EAL, a hybrid bonding-based accelerator with sparse\nattention algorithm-hardware co-design for efficient LLM inference at the edge.\nAt the algorithm level, we propose a hybrid sparse attention scheme with static\nand dynamic sparsity for different heads to fully leverage the sparsity with\nhigh accuracy. At the hardware level, we co-design the hardware to support\nhybrid sparse attention and propose memory-compute co-placement to address the\ndistributed memory bottleneck. Since different attention heads exhibit\ndifferent sparse patterns and the attention structure often mismatches the HB\narchitecture, we further develop a load-balancing scheduler with parallel tiled\nattention to address workload imbalance and optimize the mapping strategy.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate H2EAL achieves 5.20~48.21x speedup and\n6.22~73.48x energy efficiency improvement over baseline HB implementation, with\na negligible average accuracy drop of 0.87% on multiple benchmarks.",

In this work, we propose\nSGEMM-cube, a high-performance algorithm for emulating FP32 general\nmatrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM) using only FP16 computation units on a\nrepresentative AI accelerator. The method decomposes each FP32 operand into two\nFP16 values and compensates for numerical errors through a tunable scaling\nstrategy. A detailed analysis of numerical errors, including underflow\nconditions and precision loss, guides the selection of scaling parameters to\npreserve up to 22 bits of mantissa accuracy. We further investigate the effect\nof computation order on accuracy and demonstrate that a term-wise accumulation\nscheme improves numerical stability over conventional FP32 GEMM in low-exponent\nregimes. Finally, a cache-aware blocking strategy and double-buffered pipeline\nare introduced to overlap memory transfers with computation, enabling\nSGEMM-cube to achieve up to 77\\% of the theoretical FP32-equivalent peak\nperformance on Ascend 910A NPU lacking native FP32 support. Extensive numerical\nexperiments confirm that our method not only recovers the accuracy of native\nFP32 GEMM but also exhibits superior numerical stability under certain\nconditions, due to its structured and error-aware computation order.",

In this work, we propose\nSGEMM-cube, a high-performance algorithm for emulating FP32 general\nmatrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM) using only FP16 computation units on a\nrepresentative AI accelerator. The method decomposes each FP32 operand into two\nFP16 values and compensates for numerical errors through a tunable scaling\nstrategy. A detailed analysis of numerical errors, including underflow\nconditions and precision loss, guides the selection of scaling parameters to\npreserve up to 22 bits of mantissa accuracy. We further investigate the effect\nof computation order on accuracy and demonstrate that a term-wise accumulation\nscheme improves numerical stability over conventional FP32 GEMM in low-exponent\nregimes. Finally, a cache-aware blocking strategy and double-buffered pipeline\nare introduced to overlap memory transfers with computation, enabling\nSGEMM-cube to achieve up to 77\\% of the theoretical FP32-equivalent peak\nperformance on Ascend 910A NPU lacking native FP32 support. Extensive numerical\nexperiments confirm that our method not only recovers the accuracy of native\nFP32 GEMM but also exhibits superior numerical stability under certain\nconditions, due to its structured and error-aware computation order."

Unified Virtual Memory (UVM)\nhas been proposed to ease the burden of memory management; however, at a high\ncost in performance. The recent introduction of AMD's MI300A Accelerated\nProcessing Units (APUs)--as deployed in the El Capitan supercomputer--enables\nHPC systems featuring integrated CPU and GPU with Unified Physical Memory (UPM)\nfor the first time. This work presents the first comprehensive characterization\nof the UPM architecture on MI300A. We first analyze the UPM system properties,\nincluding memory latency, bandwidth, and coherence overhead. We then assess the\nefficiency of the system software in memory allocation, page fault handling,\nTLB management, and Infinity Cache utilization. We propose a set of porting\nstrategies for transforming applications for the UPM architecture and evaluate\nsix applications on the MI300A APU.

                    "value": "Discrete GPUs are a cornerstone of HPC and data center systems, requiring\nmanagement of separate CPU and GPU memory spaces. Unified Virtual Memory (UVM)\nhas been proposed to ease the burden of memory management; however, at a high\ncost in performance. The recent introduction of AMD's MI300A Accelerated\nProcessing Units (APUs)--as deployed in the El Capitan supercomputer--enables\nHPC systems featuring integrated CPU and GPU with Unified Physical Memory (UPM)\nfor the first time. This work presents the first comprehensive characterization\nof the UPM architecture on MI300A. We first analyze the UPM system properties,\nincluding memory latency, bandwidth, and coherence overhead. We then assess the\nefficiency of the system software in memory allocation, page fault handling,\nTLB management, and Infinity Cache utilization. We propose a set of porting\nstrategies for transforming applications for the UPM architecture and evaluate\nsix applications on the MI300A APU. Our results show that applications on UPM\nusing the unified memory model can match or outperform those in the explicitly\nmanaged model--while reducing memory costs by up to 44%."

Using OnGoal, participants spent less time and\neffort to achieve their goals while exploring new prompting strategies to\novercome miscommunication, suggesting tracking and visualizing goals can\nenhance engagement and resilience in LLM dialogues.

In such\nscenarios, practitioners might hope to adapt models to new domains, without\nlosing performance on previous domains (so-called catastrophic forgetting).\nWhile any single model may struggle to achieve this goal, learning an ensemble\nof domain-specific experts offers the potential to adapt more closely to each\nindividual institution. However, a core challenge in this context is\ndetermining which expert to deploy at test time. In this paper, we propose\nGenerate to Discriminate (G2D), a domain-incremental continual learning method\nthat leverages synthetic data to train a domain-discriminator that routes\nsamples at inference time to the appropriate expert. Surprisingly, we find that\nleveraging synthetic data in this capacity is more effective than using the\nsamples to \\textit{directly} train the downstream classifier (the more common\napproach to leveraging synthetic data in the lifelong learning literature). We\nobserve that G2D outperforms competitive domain-incremental learning methods on\ntasks in both vision and language modalities, providing a new perspective on\nthe use of synthetic data in the lifelong learning literature.",

In such\nscenarios, practitioners might hope to adapt models to new domains, without\nlosing performance on previous domains (so-called catastrophic forgetting).\nWhile any single model may struggle to achieve this goal, learning an ensemble\nof domain-specific experts offers the potential to adapt more closely to each\nindividual institution. However, a core challenge in this context is\ndetermining which expert to deploy at test time. In this paper, we propose\nGenerate to Discriminate (G2D), a domain-incremental continual learning method\nthat leverages synthetic data to train a domain-discriminator that routes\nsamples at inference time to the appropriate expert. Surprisingly, we find that\nleveraging synthetic data in this capacity is more effective than using the\nsamples to \\textit{directly} train the downstream classifier (the more common\napproach to leveraging synthetic data in the lifelong learning literature). We\nobserve that G2D outperforms competitive domain-incremental learning methods on\ntasks in both vision and language modalities, providing a new perspective on\nthe use of synthetic data in the lifelong learning literature."

The framework supports rigorous, privacy-preserving study of\ntherapeutic conversation and provides a robust, replicable basis for research\nand clinical translation."

DrivingGaussian++ models the static background using\nincremental 3D Gaussians and reconstructs moving objects with a composite\ndynamic Gaussian graph, ensuring accurate positions and occlusions. By\nintegrating a LiDAR prior, it achieves detailed and consistent scene\nreconstruction, outperforming existing methods in dynamic scene reconstruction\nand photorealistic surround-view synthesis. DrivingGaussian++ supports\ntraining-free controllable editing for dynamic driving scenes, including\ntexture modification, weather simulation, and object manipulation, leveraging\nmulti-view images and depth priors. By integrating large language models (LLMs)\nand controllable editing, our method can automatically generate dynamic object\nmotion trajectories and enhance their realism during the optimization process.\nDrivingGaussian++ demonstrates consistent and realistic editing results and\ngenerates dynamic multi-view driving scenarios, while significantly enhancing\nscene diversity.

                    "value": "We present DrivingGaussian++, an efficient and effective framework for\nrealistic reconstructing and controllable editing of surrounding dynamic\nautonomous driving scenes. DrivingGaussian++ models the static background using\nincremental 3D Gaussians and reconstructs moving objects with a composite\ndynamic Gaussian graph, ensuring accurate positions and occlusions. By\nintegrating a LiDAR prior, it achieves detailed and consistent scene\nreconstruction, outperforming existing methods in dynamic scene reconstruction\nand photorealistic surround-view synthesis. DrivingGaussian++ supports\ntraining-free controllable editing for dynamic driving scenes, including\ntexture modification, weather simulation, and object manipulation, leveraging\nmulti-view images and depth priors. By integrating large language models (LLMs)\nand controllable editing, our method can automatically generate dynamic object\nmotion trajectories and enhance their realism during the optimization process.\nDrivingGaussian++ demonstrates consistent and realistic editing results and\ngenerates dynamic multi-view driving scenarios, while significantly enhancing\nscene diversity.

Leveraging the information from different environments, as in\ndensity-split and density-marked clustering, is known to tighten the\nconstraints on cosmological parameters, like $\\Omega_m$, $\\sigma_8$ and\nneutrino mass. We use data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)\nand the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) in their region of overlap to\ndemonstrate informative tSZ splitting of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs). We\ndiscover a significant increase in the large-scale clustering of DESI LRGs\ncorresponding to detections starting from 1-2 sigma in the ACT DR6 + Planck tSZ\nCompton-$y$ map, below the cluster candidate threshold (4 sigma). We also find\nthat such galaxies have higher line-of-sight coordinate (and velocity)\ndispersions and a higher number of close neighbors than both the full sample\nand near-zero tSZ regions. We produce simple simulations of tSZ maps that are\nintrinsically consistent with galaxy catalogs and do not include systematic\neffects, and find a similar pattern of large-scale clustering enhancement with\ntSZ effect significance. Moreover, we observe that this relative bias pattern\nremains largely unchanged with variations in the galaxy-halo connection model\nin our simulations. This is promising for future cosmological inference from\ntSZ-split clustering with semi-analytical models.

However, recent\nadvancements have introduced optimization techniques that, interestingly,\nexpand models post-training, increasing model size to improve quality when\nreducing volume. For instance, to enable 4-bit weight and activation\nquantization, incoherence processing often necessitates inserting online\nHadamard rotations in the compute graph, and preserving highly sensitive\nweights often calls for additional higher precision computations.

However,\ncurrent serverless inference platforms encounter the coarse-grained and static\nGPU resource allocation problems during scaling, which leads to high costs and\nService Level Objective (SLO) violations in fluctuating workloads. Meanwhile,\ncurrent platforms only support horizontal scaling for GPU inferences, thus the\ncold start problem further exacerbates the problems. In this paper, we propose\nHAS-GPU, an efficient Hybrid Auto-scaling Serverless architecture with\nfine-grained GPU allocation for deep learning inferences. HAS-GPU proposes an\nagile scheduler capable of allocating GPU Streaming Multiprocessor (SM)\npartitions and time quotas with arbitrary granularity and enables significant\nvertical quota scalability at runtime. To resolve performance uncertainty\nintroduced by massive fine-grained resource configuration spaces, we propose\nthe Resource-aware Performance Predictor (RaPP). Furthermore, we present an\nadaptive hybrid auto-scaling algorithm with both horizontal and vertical\nscaling to ensure inference SLOs and minimize GPU costs. The experiments\ndemonstrated that compared to the mainstream serverless inference platform,\nHAS-GPU reduces function costs by an average of 10.8x with better SLO\nguarantees.

Our approach supports multiple translation paradigms, including\ndirect document-to-document and chunk-level translation, by integrating\ninstructions both with and without surrounding context. This enables models to\nbetter capture cross-sentence dependencies while maintaining strong\nsentence-level translation performance. Experimental results show that\nincorporating multiple translation paradigms improves document-level\ntranslation quality and inference speed compared to prompting and agent-based\nmethods."

While contrastive search-based decoding\nstrategies have emerged to address this trade-off, their practical utility is\noften limited by hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs. We\nintroduce GUARD, a self-adaptive decoding method that effectively balances\nthese competing objectives through a novel \"Glocal\" uncertainty-driven\nframework. GUARD combines global entropy estimates with local entropy\ndeviations to integrate both long-term and short-term uncertainty signals. We\ndemonstrate that our proposed global entropy formulation effectively mitigates\nabrupt variations in uncertainty, such as sudden overconfidence or high entropy\nspikes, and provides theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and consistency. To\nreduce computational overhead, we incorporate a simple yet effective\ntoken-count-based penalty into GUARD. Experimental results demonstrate that\nGUARD achieves a good balance between text diversity and coherence, while\nexhibiting substantial improvements in generation speed. In a more nuanced\ncomparison study across different dimensions of text quality, both human and\nLLM evaluators validated its remarkable performance.

While contrastive search-based decoding\nstrategies have emerged to address this trade-off, their practical utility is\noften limited by hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs. We\nintroduce GUARD, a self-adaptive decoding method that effectively balances\nthese competing objectives through a novel \"Glocal\" uncertainty-driven\nframework. GUARD combines global entropy estimates with local entropy\ndeviations to integrate both long-term and short-term uncertainty signals. We\ndemonstrate that our proposed global entropy formulation effectively mitigates\nabrupt variations in uncertainty, such as sudden overconfidence or high entropy\nspikes, and provides theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and consistency. To\nreduce computational overhead, we incorporate a simple yet effective\ntoken-count-based penalty into GUARD. Experimental results demonstrate that\nGUARD achieves a good balance between text diversity and coherence, while\nexhibiting substantial improvements in generation speed. In a more nuanced\ncomparison study across different dimensions of text quality, both human and\nLLM evaluators validated its remarkable performance. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/YecanLee/GUARD."

These specifications translate legal requirements\ninto a developer-friendly form.\n  Methods: Ten participants evaluated specifications generated from food-safety\nregulations by Claude and Llama. Using Gherkin, a structured BDD language, 60\nspecifications were produced. Each participant assessed 12 across five\ncriteria: Relevance, Clarity, Completeness, Singularity, and Time Savings. Each\nspecification was reviewed by two participants, yielding 120 assessments.\n  Results: For Relevance, 75% of ratings were highest and 20% second-highest.\nClarity reached 90% highest. Completeness: 75% highest, 19% second.\nSingularity: 82% highest, 12% second. Time Savings: 68% highest, 24% second. No\nlowest ratings occurred.

To constrain them, we incorporate observational\ndata on the maximum mass of NSs (from binary and merger systems), the radii of\n$1.4$ M$_{\\odot}$ NSs (from gravitational wave and electromagnetic\nobservations), and tidal deformabilities (from GW170817). Our results show that\nquark strong interactions play a key role, requiring at least a $20\\%$\ndeviation from the free-quark limit. We also find that color superconductivity\nis relevant, with the gap parameter reaching up to $\\sim 230$ MeV for a strange\nquark mass of $100$ MeV. The surface-to-vacuum energy density jump lies in the\nrange $(1.1-2.2)$ $\\rho_{\\rm{sat}}$, where $\\rho_{\\rm{sat}} \\simeq 2.7 \\times\n10^{14}$ g cm$^{-3}$. Observational constraints also imply that a $1.4$\nM$_{\\odot}$ quark star has a radius of $(10.0-12.3)$ km and tidal deformability\nbetween $270$ and $970$. These are consistent with the low mass and radius\ninferred for the compact object XMMU J173203.3-344518.

They assumed that the first-order\nunderidentification is due to the expected Jacobian having rank p-1 at the true\nvalue {\\phi}_{0}, i.e., having a rank deficiency of one. After reparametrizing\nthe model such that the last column of the Jacobian vanishes, they showed that\nthe GMM estimator of the first p-1 parameters converges at rate T^{-1/2} and\nthe GMM estimator of the remaining parameter, {\\phi}_{p}, converges at rate\nT^{-1/4}. They also provided a limiting distribution of\nT^{1/4}({\\phi}_{p}-{\\phi}_{0,p}) subject to a (non-transparent) condition which\nthey claimed to be not restrictive in general. However, as we show in this\npaper, their condition is in fact only satisfied when {\\phi} is overidentified\nand the limiting distribution of T^{1/4}({\\phi}_{p}-{\\phi}_{0,p}), which is\nnon-standard, depends on whether {\\phi} is exactly identified or\noveridentified. In particular, the limiting distributions of the sign of\nT^{1/4}({\\phi}_{p}-{\\phi}_{0,p}) for the cases of exact and overidentification,\nrespectively, are different and are obtained by using expansions of the GMM\nobjective function of different orders. Unsurprisingly, we find that the\nlimiting distribution theories of Dovonon and Hall (2018) for Indirect\nInference (II) estimation under two different scenarios with second-order\nidentification where the target function is a GMM estimator of the auxiliary\nparameter vector, are incomplete for similar reasons.

The investigation of these dynamics can provide a better\nunderstanding of diffusing objects and their surrounding media, but a\nquantitative characterization from individual trajectories is often\nchallenging. Efforts devoted to improving anomalous diffusion detection using\nclassical statistics and machine learning have produced several new methods.\nRecently, the anomalous diffusion challenge (AnDi, www.andi-challenge.org) was\nlaunched to objectively assess these approaches on a common dataset, focusing\non three aspects of anomalous diffusion: the inference of the anomalous\ndiffusion exponent; the classification of the diffusion model; and the\nsegmentation of trajectories. In this article, I describe a simple approach to\ntackle the tasks of the AnDi challenge by combining extreme learning machine\nand feature engineering (AnDi-ELM). The method reaches satisfactory performance\nwhile offering a straightforward implementation and fast training time with\nlimited computing resources, making it a suitable tool for fast preliminary\nscreening of anomalous diffusion.",

                    "value": "The study of the dynamics of natural and artificial systems has provided\nseveral examples of deviations from Brownian behavior, generally defined as\nanomalous diffusion. The investigation of these dynamics can provide a better\nunderstanding of diffusing objects and their surrounding media, but a\nquantitative characterization from individual trajectories is often\nchallenging. Efforts devoted to improving anomalous diffusion detection using\nclassical statistics and machine learning have produced several new methods.\nRecently, the anomalous diffusion challenge (AnDi, www.andi-challenge.org) was\nlaunched to objectively assess these approaches on a common dataset, focusing\non three aspects of anomalous diffusion: the inference of the anomalous\ndiffusion exponent; the classification of the diffusion model; and the\nsegmentation of trajectories. In this article, I describe a simple approach to\ntackle the tasks of the AnDi challenge by combining extreme learning machine\nand feature engineering (AnDi-ELM). The method reaches satisfactory performance\nwhile offering a straightforward implementation and fast training time with\nlimited computing resources, making it a suitable tool for fast preliminary\nscreening of anomalous diffusion."

During inference, only the ST pathway is\nactivated, leveraging evolving ST tokens to deliver the answer directly.\nExtensive experimental results demonstrate that DART offers significant\nperformance gains compared with existing non-autoregressive baselines without\nextra inference latency, serving as a feasible alternative for efficient\nreasoning."

Using OnGoal, participants spent less time and\neffort to achieve their goals while exploring new prompting strategies to\novercome miscommunication, suggesting tracking and visualizing goals can\nenhance engagement and resilience in LLM dialogues. Our findings inspired\ndesign implications for future LLM chat interfaces that improve goal\ncommunication, reduce cognitive load, enhance interactivity, and enable\nfeedback to improve LLM performance.",

Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by\nvisual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics\nand temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding\nas a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel\ntraining-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by\nMaximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,\nwe first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then\ndynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal\ngain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm\nthat jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby\nmaximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid\ncan maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly\nimproving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original\nperformance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the\nprefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B.

Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by\nvisual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics\nand temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding\nas a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel\ntraining-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by\nMaximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,\nwe first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then\ndynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal\ngain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm\nthat jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby\nmaximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid\ncan maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly\nimproving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original\nperformance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the\nprefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon."

This critical\nproblem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the\nrobot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action\npropagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and\nsolution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due\nto uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield\nsignificantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to\nout-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety,\nthus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree\n(DiTree): a \\emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion\npolicies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search\nwithin SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of\nexpert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness\nof SBPs to yield \\emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation\niterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an\nimplementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler\ntrained on a \\emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD\nscenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than\nclassical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs.\nDiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other\napproaches by achieving roughly 30\\% higher success rate.

DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of\nexpert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness\nof SBPs to yield \\emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation\niterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an\nimplementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler\ntrained on a \\emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD\nscenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than\nclassical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs.\nDiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other\napproaches by achieving roughly 30\\% higher success rate.

Our experiments show that Bidirectional Transformer models outperform\nboth standard machine-learning approaches and Large Language Models (LLMs),\nparticularly when the meta-learning Reptile approach is employed."

The system employs a\n4$\\times$4 rectangular microstrip patch array, utilizing advanced beamforming\ntechniques and a Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation algorithm. It achieves\n$\\pm 42^{\\circ}$ wide-angle scanning in both azimuth and elevation planes. The\ndesign emphasizes a balance between high angular coverage and consistent gain\nperformance. This makes it suitable for wireless tracking, radar, and satellite\ncommunication terminals. Fabricated on Rogers 6010.2LM substrate, the system\ndemonstrates reproducibility and scalability. All components are sourced\nlocally to ensure practical deployment. The system is built using commercially\navailable components, highlighting its affordability for research and\nprototyping purposes."

Meanwhile,\ncurrent platforms only support horizontal scaling for GPU inferences, thus the\ncold start problem further exacerbates the problems. In this paper, we propose\nHAS-GPU, an efficient Hybrid Auto-scaling Serverless architecture with\nfine-grained GPU allocation for deep learning inferences. HAS-GPU proposes an\nagile scheduler capable of allocating GPU Streaming Multiprocessor (SM)\npartitions and time quotas with arbitrary granularity and enables significant\nvertical quota scalability at runtime. To resolve performance uncertainty\nintroduced by massive fine-grained resource configuration spaces, we propose\nthe Resource-aware Performance Predictor (RaPP). Furthermore, we present an\nadaptive hybrid auto-scaling algorithm with both horizontal and vertical\nscaling to ensure inference SLOs and minimize GPU costs. The experiments\ndemonstrated that compared to the mainstream serverless inference platform,\nHAS-GPU reduces function costs by an average of 10.8x with better SLO\nguarantees.

Existing evaluation methods rely on\nmisaligned proxy indicators or naive holistic judgments. They frequently\nmisinterpret model responses, leading to inconsistent and subjective\nassessments that misalign with human perception. To address this gap, we\nintroduce JADES (Jailbreak Assessment via Decompositional Scoring), a universal\njailbreak evaluation framework. Its key mechanism is to automatically decompose\nan input harmful question into a set of weighted sub-questions, score each\nsub-answer, and weight-aggregate the sub-scores into a final decision. JADES\nalso incorporates an optional fact-checking module to strengthen the detection\nof hallucinations in jailbreak responses. We validate JADES on JailbreakQR, a\nnewly introduced benchmark proposed in this work, consisting of 400 pairs of\njailbreak prompts and responses, each meticulously annotated by humans. In a\nbinary setting (success/failure), JADES achieves 98.5% agreement with human\nevaluators, outperforming strong baselines by over 9%. Re-evaluating five\npopular attacks on four LLMs reveals substantial overestimation (e.g., LAA's\nattack success rate on GPT-3.5-Turbo drops from 93% to 69%).

                    "value": "Accurately determining whether a jailbreak attempt has succeeded is a\nfundamental yet unresolved challenge. Existing evaluation methods rely on\nmisaligned proxy indicators or naive holistic judgments. They frequently\nmisinterpret model responses, leading to inconsistent and subjective\nassessments that misalign with human perception. To address this gap, we\nintroduce JADES (Jailbreak Assessment via Decompositional Scoring), a universal\njailbreak evaluation framework. Its key mechanism is to automatically decompose\nan input harmful question into a set of weighted sub-questions, score each\nsub-answer, and weight-aggregate the sub-scores into a final decision. JADES\nalso incorporates an optional fact-checking module to strengthen the detection\nof hallucinations in jailbreak responses. We validate JADES on JailbreakQR, a\nnewly introduced benchmark proposed in this work, consisting of 400 pairs of\njailbreak prompts and responses, each meticulously annotated by humans. In a\nbinary setting (success/failure), JADES achieves 98.5% agreement with human\nevaluators, outperforming strong baselines by over 9%. Re-evaluating five\npopular attacks on four LLMs reveals substantial overestimation (e.g., LAA's\nattack success rate on GPT-3.5-Turbo drops from 93% to 69%). Our results show\nthat JADES could deliver accurate, consistent, and interpretable evaluations,\nproviding a reliable basis for measuring future jailbreak attacks."

This\ncreates challenges for engineers who must develop compliance artifacts such as\nrequirements and acceptance criteria. Manual creation is labor-intensive,\nerror-prone, and requires domain expertise. Advances in Generative AI (GenAI),\nespecially Large Language Models (LLMs), offer a way to automate deriving such\nartifacts.\n  Objective: We present the first systematic human-subject study of LLMs'\nability to derive behavioral specifications from legal texts using a\nquasi-experimental design. These specifications translate legal requirements\ninto a developer-friendly form.\n  Methods: Ten participants evaluated specifications generated from food-safety\nregulations by Claude and Llama. Using Gherkin, a structured BDD language, 60\nspecifications were produced. Each participant assessed 12 across five\ncriteria: Relevance, Clarity, Completeness, Singularity, and Time Savings. Each\nspecification was reviewed by two participants, yielding 120 assessments.\n  Results: For Relevance, 75% of ratings were highest and 20% second-highest.\nClarity reached 90% highest. Completeness: 75% highest, 19% second.\nSingularity: 82% highest, 12% second. Time Savings: 68% highest, 24% second. No\nlowest ratings occurred. Mann-Whitney U tests showed no significant differences\nacross participants or models.

This can be performed in a variety of ways, from word perturbations\nto full document rewriting, and most often under local DP. Here, an input text\nmust be made indistinguishable from any other potential text, within some bound\ngoverned by the privacy parameter $\\varepsilon$. Such a guarantee is quite\ndemanding, and recent works show that privatizing texts under local DP can only\nbe done reasonably under very high $\\varepsilon$ values. Addressing this\nchallenge, we introduce DP-ST, which leverages semantic triples for\nneighborhood-aware private document generation under local DP guarantees.\nThrough the evaluation of our method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the\ndivide-and-conquer paradigm, particularly when limiting the DP notion (and\nprivacy guarantees) to that of a privatization neighborhood. When combined with\nLLM post-processing, our method allows for coherent text generation even at\nlower $\\varepsilon$ values, while still balancing privacy and utility.

Small vision-language models (sVLMs)\nsuch as ViLT, VisualBERT and FLAVA therefore lag behind their larger generative\ncounterparts. To study the effect of careful commonsense knowledge integration\non sVLMs, we present an end-to-end framework (NLKI) that (i) retrieves natural\nlanguage facts, (ii) prompts an LLM to craft natural language explanations, and\n(iii) feeds both signals to sVLMs respectively across two commonsense VQA\ndatasets (CRIC, AOKVQA) and a visual-entailment dataset (e-SNLI-VE). Facts\nretrieved using a fine-tuned ColBERTv2 and an object information-enriched\nprompt yield explanations that largely cut down hallucinations, while lifting\nthe end-to-end answer accuracy by up to 7% (across 3 datasets), making FLAVA\nand other models in NLKI match or exceed medium-sized VLMs such as Qwen-2 VL-2B\nand SmolVLM-2.5B. As these benchmarks contain 10-25% label noise, additional\nfinetuning using noise-robust losses (such as symmetric cross entropy and\ngeneralised cross entropy) adds another 2.5% in CRIC, and 5.5% in AOKVQA. Our\nfindings expose when LLM-based commonsense knowledge beats retrieval from\ncommonsense knowledge bases, how noise-aware training stabilises small models\nin the context of external knowledge augmentation, and why parameter-efficient\ncommonsense reasoning is now within reach for 250M models.",

To study the effect of careful commonsense knowledge integration\non sVLMs, we present an end-to-end framework (NLKI) that (i) retrieves natural\nlanguage facts, (ii) prompts an LLM to craft natural language explanations, and\n(iii) feeds both signals to sVLMs respectively across two commonsense VQA\ndatasets (CRIC, AOKVQA) and a visual-entailment dataset (e-SNLI-VE). Facts\nretrieved using a fine-tuned ColBERTv2 and an object information-enriched\nprompt yield explanations that largely cut down hallucinations, while lifting\nthe end-to-end answer accuracy by up to 7% (across 3 datasets), making FLAVA\nand other models in NLKI match or exceed medium-sized VLMs such as Qwen-2 VL-2B\nand SmolVLM-2.5B. As these benchmarks contain 10-25% label noise, additional\nfinetuning using noise-robust losses (such as symmetric cross entropy and\ngeneralised cross entropy) adds another 2.5% in CRIC, and 5.5% in AOKVQA. Our\nfindings expose when LLM-based commonsense knowledge beats retrieval from\ncommonsense knowledge bases, how noise-aware training stabilises small models\nin the context of external knowledge augmentation, and why parameter-efficient\ncommonsense reasoning is now within reach for 250M models."

To ease deployment, sensing is kept minimal and\nconsistent between simulation and hardware: the planner consumes compact,\nforward-facing elevation cues together with onboard IMU and joint signals.

However, they are usually inefficient or ineffective for large\nmodels, not workable for black-box models, or unable to continuously adjust\nLLMs' sensitivity to the knowledge provided in the context. To mitigate these\nproblems, we propose CSKS (Continuously Steering Knowledge Sensitivity), a\nsimple framework that can steer LLMs' sensitivity to contextual knowledge\ncontinuously at a lightweight cost. Specifically, we tune two small LMs (i.e.\nproxy models) and use the difference in their output distributions to shift the\noriginal distribution of an LLM without modifying the LLM weights. In the\nevaluation process, we not only design synthetic data and fine-grained metrics\nto measure models' sensitivity to contextual knowledge but also use a real\nconflict dataset to validate CSKS's practical efficacy. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our framework achieves continuous and precise control over\nLLMs' sensitivity to contextual knowledge, enabling both increased sensitivity\nand reduced sensitivity, thereby allowing LLMs to prioritize either contextual\nor parametric knowledge as needed flexibly.

We introduce a novel primitive, Proof-of-Transit\nTimestamping (PoTT), to provide cryptographic, tamper-evident audit trails for\nBitcoin data across high-latency, intermittently-connected links. Leveraging\nDelay/Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) and optical low-Earth-orbit (LEO)\nmesh constellations, we propose an architecture for header-first replication,\nlong-horizon Lightning channels with planetary watchtowers, and secure\nsettlement through federated sidechains or blind-merge-mined (BMM) commit\nchains. We formalize PoTT, analyze its security model, and show how it\nmeasurably improves reliability and accountability without altering Bitcoin\nconsensus or its monetary base. Near-term deployments favor strong federations\nfor local settlement; longer-term, blind-merge-mined commit chains (if adopted)\nprovide an alternative. The Earth L1 monetary base remains unchanged, while\nMars can operate a pegged commit chain or strong federation with 1:1 pegged\nassets for local block production. For transparency, if both time-beacon\nregimes are simultaneously compromised, PoTT-M2 (and PoTT generally) reduces to\nadministrative assertions rather than cryptographic time-anchoring.",

                    "value": "We explore the feasibility of deploying Bitcoin as the shared monetary\nstandard between Earth and Mars, accounting for physical constraints of\ninterplanetary communication. We introduce a novel primitive, Proof-of-Transit\nTimestamping (PoTT), to provide cryptographic, tamper-evident audit trails for\nBitcoin data across high-latency, intermittently-connected links. Leveraging\nDelay/Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) and optical low-Earth-orbit (LEO)\nmesh constellations, we propose an architecture for header-first replication,\nlong-horizon Lightning channels with planetary watchtowers, and secure\nsettlement through federated sidechains or blind-merge-mined (BMM) commit\nchains. We formalize PoTT, analyze its security model, and show how it\nmeasurably improves reliability and accountability without altering Bitcoin\nconsensus or its monetary base. Near-term deployments favor strong federations\nfor local settlement; longer-term, blind-merge-mined commit chains (if adopted)\nprovide an alternative. The Earth L1 monetary base remains unchanged, while\nMars can operate a pegged commit chain or strong federation with 1:1 pegged\nassets for local block production. For transparency, if both time-beacon\nregimes are simultaneously compromised, PoTT-M2 (and PoTT generally) reduces to\nadministrative assertions rather than cryptographic time-anchoring."

Comparing 5 LLMs across 10 distinct tasks, we find that\nwhile there is indeed little overlap between circuits for formal and functional\ntasks, there is also little overlap between formal linguistic tasks, as exists\nin the human brain.

Traditional extractive\nsummarization models, based primarily on ranking candidate summary segments,\nhave been the dominant approach in industrial applications. However, these\napproaches suffer from two key limitations: 1) The multi-stage pipeline often\nintroduces cumulative information loss and architectural bottlenecks due to its\nweakest component; 2) Traditional models lack sufficient semantic understanding\nof both user queries and documents, particularly when dealing with complex\nsearch intents. In this study, we propose a novel framework to pioneer the\napplication of generative models to address real-time QDTS in industrial web\nsearch. Our approach integrates large model distillation, supervised\nfine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding to\ntransform a lightweight model with only 0.1B parameters into a\ndomain-specialized QDTS expert. Evaluated on multiple industry-relevant\nmetrics, our model outperforms the production baseline and achieves a new state\nof the art.

In this\nstudy, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our\nWayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from\n25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses\nposture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing\nlow-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.\nThis process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We\nachieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test\nset (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published\nliterature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on\nthe completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable\nwith state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust\ngeneralization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a\nMAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the\nfull pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices\nusing the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,\nfiltering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source\ncontributions.",
