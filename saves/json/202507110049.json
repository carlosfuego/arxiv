To\naddress this, we propose Prompt-Complexity-Aware (PCA) caching, a method that\nautomatically adjusts reuse thresholds based on scene complexity estimated\ndirectly from the input prompt. By incorporating prompt-derived semantic cues,\nPCA enables more adaptive and informed reuse decisions than conventional\ncaching methods. We also revisit the assumptions behind TeaCache and identify a\nkey limitation: it suffers from poor input-output relationship modeling due to\nan oversimplified prior. To overcome this, we decouple the noisy input, enhance\nthe contribution of meaningful textual information, and improve the model's\npredictive accuracy through multivariate polynomial feature expansion. To\nfurther reduce computational cost, we replace the static CFGCache with\nDynCFGCache, a dynamic mechanism that selectively reuses classifier-free\nguidance (CFG) outputs based on estimated output variations.

While traditional speculative decoding methods\nexist, simply extending their generation limits fails to accelerate the process\nand can be detrimental. Through an in-depth analysis, we identify three major\nchallenges hindering efficient generation: frequent model reloading, dynamic\nkey-value (KV) management and repetitive generation. To address these issues,\nwe introduce TOKENSWIFT, a novel framework designed to substantially accelerate\nthe generation process of ultra-long sequences while maintaining the target\nmodel's inherent quality. Experimental results demonstrate that TOKENSWIFT\nachieves over 3 times speedup across models of varying scales (1.5B, 7B, 8B,\n14B) and architectures (MHA, GQA). This acceleration translates to hours of\ntime savings for ultra-long sequence generation, establishing TOKENSWIFT as a\nscalable and effective solution at unprecedented lengths.

However, existing serverless platforms lack efficient support for\nGPUs, hindering their ability to deliver high-performance inference. In this\npaper, we present Torpor, a serverless platform for GPU-efficient, low-latency\ninference. To enable efficient sharing of a node's GPUs among numerous\ninference functions, Torpor maintains models in main memory and dynamically\nswaps them onto GPUs upon request arrivals (i.e., late binding with model\nswapping). Torpor uses various techniques, including asynchronous API\nredirection, GPU runtime sharing, pipelined model execution, and efficient GPU\nmemory management, to minimize latency overhead caused by model swapping.\nAdditionally, we design an interference-aware request scheduling algorithm that\nutilizes high-speed GPU interconnects to meet latency service-level objectives\n(SLOs) for individual inference functions. We have implemented Torpor and\nevaluated its performance in a production environment. Utilizing late binding\nand model swapping, Torpor can concurrently serve hundreds of inference\nfunctions on a worker node with 4 GPUs, while achieving latency performance\ncomparable to native execution, where each model is cached exclusively on a\nGPU. Pilot deployment in a leading commercial serverless cloud shows that\nTorpor reduces the GPU provisioning cost by 70% and 65% for users and the\nplatform, respectively.",

                "summary": "Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a high-performance technique for novel view\nsynthesis, enabling real-time rendering and high-quality reconstruction of\nsmall scenes. However, scaling to larger environments has so far relied on\npartitioning the scene into chunks -- a strategy that introduces artifacts at\nchunk boundaries, complicates training across varying scales, and is poorly\nsuited to unstructured scenarios such as city-scale flyovers combined with\nstreet-level views. Moreover, rendering remains fundamentally limited by GPU\nmemory, as all visible chunks must reside in VRAM simultaneously. We introduce\nA LoD of Gaussians, a framework for training and rendering ultra-large-scale\nGaussian scenes on a single consumer-grade GPU -- without partitioning.

                    "value": "Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a high-performance technique for novel view\nsynthesis, enabling real-time rendering and high-quality reconstruction of\nsmall scenes. However, scaling to larger environments has so far relied on\npartitioning the scene into chunks -- a strategy that introduces artifacts at\nchunk boundaries, complicates training across varying scales, and is poorly\nsuited to unstructured scenarios such as city-scale flyovers combined with\nstreet-level views. Moreover, rendering remains fundamentally limited by GPU\nmemory, as all visible chunks must reside in VRAM simultaneously. We introduce\nA LoD of Gaussians, a framework for training and rendering ultra-large-scale\nGaussian scenes on a single consumer-grade GPU -- without partitioning.

To identify these\nheads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies\nhead-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on\nthis discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that\nallocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual\nscores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference\nof MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the\nparticularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual\nsemantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal\nbenchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency\ntrade-offs.

                "summary": "Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is a critical security mechanism\nfor BGP, but the complexity of its architecture is a growing concern as its\nadoption scales. Current RPKI design heavily reuses legacy PKI components, such\nas X.509 EE-certificates, ASN.1 encoding, and XML-based repository protocols,\nall these introduce excessive cryptographic validation, redundant metadata, and\ninefficiencies in both storage and processing. We show that these design\nchoices, although based on established standards, create significant\nperformance bottlenecks, increase the vulnerability surface, and hinder\nscalability for wide-scale Internet deployment.\n  In this paper, we perform the first systematic analysis of the root causes of\ncomplexity in RPKI's design and experimentally quantify their real-world\nimpact.

As\nthe size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an\nout-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained\nsystems.

Enhancing the capacity,\ndensity, or bandwidth of these memories can unlock substantial performance\ngains; however, the recent stagnation of SRAM bit-cell scaling leads to\ninequivalent losses in compute density.\n  To address the challenges posed by SRAM's scaling and leakage power\nconsumption, this paper explores the potential CMOS+X integration of amorphous\noxide semiconductor (AOS) transistors in capacitive, persistent memory\ntopologies (e.g., 1T1C eDRAM, 2T0C/3T0C Gain Cell) as alternative cells in\nmulti-ported and high-bandwidth banked GPGPU memories. A detailed study of the\ndensity and energy tradeoffs of back-end-of-line (BEOL) integrated memories\nutilizing monolithic 3D (M3D)-integrated multiplexed arrays is conducted, while\naccounting for the macro-level limitations of integrating AOS candidate\nstructures proposed by the device community (an aspect often overlooked in\nprior work). By exploiting the short lifetime of register operands, we propose\na multi-ported AOS gain-cell capable of delivering 3x the read ports in ~76% of\nthe footprint of SRAM with over 70% lower standby power, enabling enhancements\nto compute capacity, such as larger warp sizes or processor counts. Benchmarks\nrun on a validated NVIDIA Ampere-class GPU model, using a modified version of\nAccel-Sim, demonstrate improvements of up to 5.2x the performance per watt and\nan average 8% higher geometric mean instruction per cycle (IPC) on various\ncompute- and memory-bound tasks.",

A detailed study of the\ndensity and energy tradeoffs of back-end-of-line (BEOL) integrated memories\nutilizing monolithic 3D (M3D)-integrated multiplexed arrays is conducted, while\naccounting for the macro-level limitations of integrating AOS candidate\nstructures proposed by the device community (an aspect often overlooked in\nprior work). By exploiting the short lifetime of register operands, we propose\na multi-ported AOS gain-cell capable of delivering 3x the read ports in ~76% of\nthe footprint of SRAM with over 70% lower standby power, enabling enhancements\nto compute capacity, such as larger warp sizes or processor counts. Benchmarks\nrun on a validated NVIDIA Ampere-class GPU model, using a modified version of\nAccel-Sim, demonstrate improvements of up to 5.2x the performance per watt and\nan average 8% higher geometric mean instruction per cycle (IPC) on various\ncompute- and memory-bound tasks."

To improve retrieval latency,\nwe remove the initial forward pass of PCL, which otherwise greatly increases\ntraining and inference time, with a negligible trade-off in performance.\nAdditionally, we introduce a novel topic-aware prompt pool that employs neural\ntopic embeddings as fixed keys, eliminating the instability of prompt key\noptimization while maintaining competitive performance with existing PCL prompt\npools.

As a result of this informed\nsearch strategy, FOCUS achieves strong performance across four fine-grained VQA\ndatasets and two types of MLLMs. It outperforms three popular visual cropping\nmethods in both accuracy and efficiency, and matches the best-performing\nbaseline, ZoomEye, while requiring 3 - 6.5 x less compute."

In this paper, we introduce\nOmniwise, the first end-to-end, self-supervised fine-tuning pipeline that\napplies large language models (LLMs) to GPU kernel performance prediction--a\nnovel use case in performance profiling. Omniwise is model-agnostic and\nlightweight, achieving strong results even with a small 3B-parameter model. It\ncan predict key performance metrics, including memory bandwidth, cache hit\nrates, GFLOPs, and arithmetic intensity, directly from kernel code without the\nneed for code execution or profiling tools. Our approach achieves over 90% of\npredictions within 10% relative error on GPU kernels executed on AMD MI250 and\nMI300X architectures. In addition to the pipeline, we develop an online\ninference server and a Visual Studio Code plugin that seamlessly integrate\nLLM-based performance prediction into developers' workflows.",

MegaFold\ntackles key bottlenecks through ahead-of-time caching to eliminate GPU idle\ntime from the retrieval-augmented data pipeline, Triton-based kernels for\nmemory-efficient EvoAttention on heterogeneous devices, and deep fusion for\ncommon and critical small operators in AF3. Evaluation on both NVIDIA H200 and\nAMD MI250 GPUs shows that MegaFold reduces peak memory usage of AF3 training by\nup to 1.23$\\times$ and improves per-iteration training time by up-to\n1.73$\\times$ and 1.62$\\times$ respectively. More importantly, MegaFold enables\ntraining on 1.35$\\times$ longer sequence lengths compared to PyTorch baselines\nwithout running out-of-memory, significantly improving the scalability of\nmodern protein folding models.

We observe that quantizing\nthe KV cache of different tokens has varying impacts on the quality of\nattention outputs. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we perform\nforward error propagation analysis on attention and propose the Anchor Score\n(AnS) that quantifies the sensitivity of each token's KV cache to\nquantization-induced error. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in AnS\nacross tokens, suggesting that preserving a small subset with full precision\n(FP16) of high-AnS tokens can greatly mitigate accuracy loss in aggressive\nquantization scenarios. Based on this insight, we introduce AnTKV, a novel\nframework that leverages Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization to compress the\nKV cache. Furthermore, to support efficient deployment, we design and develop a\ntriton kernel that is fully compatible with FlashAttention, enabling fast\nonline Anchor Token selection. AnTKV enables LLaMA-3-8B to handle context\nlengths up to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100 GPU, while achieving up to 3.5x\nhigher decoding throughput compared to the FP16 baseline.

A critical challenge is ensuring that distributed memories remain\nsynchronized, relevant, and free from the accumulation of outdated or\ninconsequential data - a process analogous to biological forgetting. This paper\nintroduces the Co-Forgetting Protocol, a novel, comprehensive framework\ndesigned to address this challenge by enabling synchronized memory pruning in\nMAS. The protocol integrates three key components: (1) context-aware semantic\nvoting, where agents utilize a lightweight DistilBERT model to assess the\nrelevance of memory items based on their content and the current operational\ncontext; (2) multi-scale temporal decay functions, which assign diminishing\nimportance to memories based on their age and access frequency across different\ntime horizons; and (3) a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)-based\nconsensus mechanism, ensuring that decisions to retain or discard memory items\nare agreed upon by a qualified and fault-tolerant majority of agents, even in\nthe presence of up to f Byzantine (malicious or faulty) agents in a system of N\ngreater than or equal to 3f+1 agents. The protocol leverages gRPC for efficient\ninter-agent communication and Pinecone for scalable vector embedding storage\nand similarity search, with SQLite managing metadata. Experimental evaluations\nin a simulated MAS environment with four agents demonstrate the protocol's\nefficacy, achieving a 52% reduction in memory footprint over 500 epochs, 88%\nvoting accuracy in forgetting decisions against human-annotated benchmarks, a\n92% PBFT consensus success rate under simulated Byzantine conditions, and an\n82% cache hit rate for memory access.",

The protocol leverages gRPC for efficient\ninter-agent communication and Pinecone for scalable vector embedding storage\nand similarity search, with SQLite managing metadata. Experimental evaluations\nin a simulated MAS environment with four agents demonstrate the protocol's\nefficacy, achieving a 52% reduction in memory footprint over 500 epochs, 88%\nvoting accuracy in forgetting decisions against human-annotated benchmarks, a\n92% PBFT consensus success rate under simulated Byzantine conditions, and an\n82% cache hit rate for memory access."

To address this, we propose Commutative\nVector Quantization (CommVQ) to significantly reduce memory usage for\nlong-context LLM inference. We first introduce additive quantization with a\nlightweight encoder and codebook to compress the KV cache, which can be decoded\nvia simple matrix multiplication. To further reduce computational costs during\ndecoding, we design the codebook to be commutative with Rotary Position\nEmbedding (RoPE) and train it using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.\nThis enables efficient integration of decoding into the self-attention\nmechanism. Our approach achieves high accuracy with additive quantization and\nlow overhead via the RoPE-commutative codebook. Experiments on long-context\nbenchmarks and GSM8K show that our method reduces FP16 KV cache size by 87.5%\nwith 2-bit quantization, while outperforming state-of-the-art KV cache\nquantization methods. Notably, it enables 1-bit KV cache quantization with\nminimal accuracy loss, allowing a LLaMA-3.1 8B model to run with a 128K context\nlength on a single RTX 4090 GPU.

This\nreview presents a structured analysis of \\textbf{Trust, Risk, and Security\nManagement (TRiSM)} in the context of LLM-based Agentic Multi-Agent Systems\n(AMAS). We begin by examining the conceptual foundations of Agentic AI and\nhighlight its architectural distinctions from traditional AI agents. We then\nadapt and extend the AI TRiSM framework for Agentic AI, structured around four\nkey pillars: Explainability, ModelOps, Security, Privacy and Governance, each\ncontextualized to the challenges of multi-agent LLM systems. A novel risk\ntaxonomy is proposed to capture the unique threats and vulnerabilities of\nAgentic AI, ranging from coordination failures to prompt-based adversarial\nmanipulation. To support practical assessment in Agentic AI works, we introduce\ntwo novel metrics: the Component Synergy Score (CSS), which quantifies the\nquality of inter-agent collaboration, and the Tool Utilization Efficacy (TUE),\nwhich evaluates the efficiency of tool use within agent workflows. We further\ndiscuss strategies for improving explainability in Agentic AI , as well as\napproaches to enhancing security and privacy through encryption, adversarial\nrobustness, and regulatory compliance. The review concludes with a research\nroadmap for the responsible development and deployment of Agentic AI, outlining\ncritical directions to align emerging systems with TRiSM principles for safe,\ntransparent, and accountable operation.",

                    "value": "Agentic AI systems, built upon large language models (LLMs) and deployed in\nmulti-agent configurations, are redefining intelligence, autonomy,\ncollaboration, and decision-making across enterprise and societal domains. This\nreview presents a structured analysis of \\textbf{Trust, Risk, and Security\nManagement (TRiSM)} in the context of LLM-based Agentic Multi-Agent Systems\n(AMAS). We begin by examining the conceptual foundations of Agentic AI and\nhighlight its architectural distinctions from traditional AI agents. We then\nadapt and extend the AI TRiSM framework for Agentic AI, structured around four\nkey pillars: Explainability, ModelOps, Security, Privacy and Governance, each\ncontextualized to the challenges of multi-agent LLM systems. A novel risk\ntaxonomy is proposed to capture the unique threats and vulnerabilities of\nAgentic AI, ranging from coordination failures to prompt-based adversarial\nmanipulation. To support practical assessment in Agentic AI works, we introduce\ntwo novel metrics: the Component Synergy Score (CSS), which quantifies the\nquality of inter-agent collaboration, and the Tool Utilization Efficacy (TUE),\nwhich evaluates the efficiency of tool use within agent workflows. We further\ndiscuss strategies for improving explainability in Agentic AI , as well as\napproaches to enhancing security and privacy through encryption, adversarial\nrobustness, and regulatory compliance. The review concludes with a research\nroadmap for the responsible development and deployment of Agentic AI, outlining\ncritical directions to align emerging systems with TRiSM principles for safe,\ntransparent, and accountable operation."

This work explores parameter pruning to\nimprove parameter efficiency while maintaining recommendation quality, thereby\nenabling easier deployment. Unlike existing approaches that focus primarily on\ninter-layer redundancy, we uncover intra-layer redundancy within components\nsuch as self-attention and MLP modules. Building on this analysis, we propose a\nmore fine-grained pruning approach that integrates both intra-layer and\nlayer-wise pruning. Specifically, we introduce a three-stage pruning strategy\nthat progressively prunes parameters at different levels and parts of the\nmodel, moving from intra-layer to layer-wise pruning, or from width to depth.\nEach stage also includes a performance restoration step using distillation\ntechniques, helping to strike a balance between performance and parameter\nefficiency. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach:\nacross three datasets, our models achieve an average of 88% of the original\nmodel's performance while pruning more than 95% of the non-embedding\nparameters.

Extending to\nlong-context generation, LASeR improves by 2.96 F1 points (avg.) on\nsingle-document QA tasks and 2.97 F1 points on few-shot learning over the RM\nscore ensemble baseline with best-of-n sampling."

These proofs convince the user that the ML model output is\ncorrect, without revealing the weights of the model to the user. Past work on\nthese provers can be placed into two categories. The first method compiles the\nML model into a low-level circuit, and proves the circuit using a ZK-SNARK. The\nsecond method uses custom cryptographic protocols designed only for a specific\nclass of models. Unfortunately, the first method is highly inefficient, making\nit impractical for the large models used today, and the second method does not\ngeneralize well, making it difficult to update in the rapidly changing field of\nmachine learning. To solve this, we propose ZKTorch, an open source end-to-end\nproving system that compiles ML models into base cryptographic operations\ncalled basic blocks, each proved using specialized protocols. ZKTorch is built\non top of a novel parallel extension to the Mira accumulation scheme, enabling\nsuccinct proofs with minimal accumulation overhead. These contributions allow\nZKTorch to achieve at least a $3\\times$ reduction in the proof size compared to\nspecialized protocols and up to a $6\\times$ speedup in proving time over a\ngeneral-purpose ZKML framework.",

Unfortunately, the first method is highly inefficient, making\nit impractical for the large models used today, and the second method does not\ngeneralize well, making it difficult to update in the rapidly changing field of\nmachine learning. To solve this, we propose ZKTorch, an open source end-to-end\nproving system that compiles ML models into base cryptographic operations\ncalled basic blocks, each proved using specialized protocols. ZKTorch is built\non top of a novel parallel extension to the Mira accumulation scheme, enabling\nsuccinct proofs with minimal accumulation overhead. These contributions allow\nZKTorch to achieve at least a $3\\times$ reduction in the proof size compared to\nspecialized protocols and up to a $6\\times$ speedup in proving time over a\ngeneral-purpose ZKML framework."

Therefore,\nautomated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has\nsignificant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term\ncolorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features\nto achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local\nparadigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color\nconsistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can\nbe achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically\nextracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation.\nSpecifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly\nincludes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color\nConsistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support\nthe DGLM module.

                    "value": "Animation colorization is a crucial part of real animation industry\nproduction. Long animation colorization has high labor costs. Therefore,\nautomated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has\nsignificant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term\ncolorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features\nto achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local\nparadigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color\nconsistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can\nbe achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically\nextracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation.\nSpecifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly\nincludes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color\nConsistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support\nthe DGLM module.

This design not only reduces inference latency and\ncomputational cost but also minimizes communication overhead by removing\nnon-informative noise. We extended the well-known OPV2V dataset by simulating\nrain, snow, and fog using our realistic weather simulation models. We\ndemonstrate that DenoiseCP-Net achieves near-perfect denoising accuracy in\nadverse weather, reduces the bandwidth requirements by up to 23.6% while\nmaintaining the same detection accuracy and reducing the inference latency for\ncooperative vehicles.",

This not only artificially inflates measured performance but also\ncompromises accurate reward estimation in reinforcement learning frameworks\nutilizing verifiable rewards (RLVR). To address these critical shortcomings, we\nsystematically investigate the test-case generation (TCG) task by proposing\nmulti-dimensional metrics designed to rigorously quantify test-suite\nthoroughness. Furthermore, we introduce a human-LLM collaborative method\n(SAGA), leveraging human programming expertise with LLM reasoning capability,\naimed at significantly enhancing both the coverage and the quality of generated\ntest cases. In addition, we develop a TCGBench to facilitate the study of the\nTCG task. Experiments show that SAGA achieves a detection rate of 90.62% and a\nverifier accuracy of 32.58% on TCGBench. The Verifier Accuracy (Verifier Acc)\nof the code generation evaluation benchmark synthesized by SAGA is 10.78%\nhigher than that of LiveCodeBench-v6.

One major limitation of most\nexisting Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL\nin nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully\nutilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time,\nposing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To\nthis end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating\nMix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable\non-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix\nconsists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient\nwith an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2)\nKL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and\nflexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from\nefficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our\nexperiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base\nmodels. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with\n0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B\nmodel) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math\nreasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and\nMATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level\nperformance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of\nrollout data volume. In addition, we reveal insightful findings via\nmultifaceted analysis, including the implicit preference for shorter responses\ndue to the Whipping Effect of off-policy discrepancy, the collapse mode of\nself-reflection behavior under the presence of severe off-policyness, etc.",

We demonstrate that adversaries can\nleverage three distinct attack surfaces - direct prompt injection, RAG backdoor\nattacks, and inter-agent trust exploitation - to coerce popular LLMs (including\nGPT-4o, Claude-4 and Gemini-2.5) into autonomously installing and executing\nmalware on victim machines. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals\nan alarming vulnerability hierarchy: while 41.2% of models succumb to direct\nprompt injection, 52.9% are vulnerable to RAG backdoor attacks, and a critical\n82.4% can be compromised through inter-agent trust exploitation. Notably, we\ndiscovered that LLMs which successfully resist direct malicious commands will\nexecute identical payloads when requested by peer agents, revealing a\nfundamental flaw in current multi-agent security models. Our findings\ndemonstrate that only 5.9% of tested models (1/17) proved resistant to all\nattack vectors, with the majority exhibiting context-dependent security\nbehaviors that create exploitable blind spots. Our findings also highlight the\nneed to increase awareness and research on the security risks of LLMs, showing\na paradigm shift in cybersecurity threats, where AI tools themselves become\nsophisticated attack vectors.",

We demonstrate that adversaries can\nleverage three distinct attack surfaces - direct prompt injection, RAG backdoor\nattacks, and inter-agent trust exploitation - to coerce popular LLMs (including\nGPT-4o, Claude-4 and Gemini-2.5) into autonomously installing and executing\nmalware on victim machines. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals\nan alarming vulnerability hierarchy: while 41.2% of models succumb to direct\nprompt injection, 52.9% are vulnerable to RAG backdoor attacks, and a critical\n82.4% can be compromised through inter-agent trust exploitation. Notably, we\ndiscovered that LLMs which successfully resist direct malicious commands will\nexecute identical payloads when requested by peer agents, revealing a\nfundamental flaw in current multi-agent security models. Our findings\ndemonstrate that only 5.9% of tested models (1/17) proved resistant to all\nattack vectors, with the majority exhibiting context-dependent security\nbehaviors that create exploitable blind spots. Our findings also highlight the\nneed to increase awareness and research on the security risks of LLMs, showing\na paradigm shift in cybersecurity threats, where AI tools themselves become\nsophisticated attack vectors."

To address this challenge, we introduce\nsemantic entropy (SE), which quantifies the semantic diversity of parallel\nmodel responses and serves as a robust indicator of reasoning quality due to\nits strong negative correlation with accuracy..."

                "summary": "Automated text evaluation has long been a central issue in Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP). Recently, the field has shifted toward using Large Language\nModels (LLMs) as evaluators-a trend known as the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. While\npromising and easily adaptable across tasks, this approach has seen limited\nexploration in multilingual contexts.

A1 has no hand-crafted heuristics and\nprovides the agent with six domain-specific tools that enable autonomous\nvulnerability discovery. The agent can flexibly leverage these tools to\nunderstand smart contract behavior, generate exploit strategies, test them on\nblockchain states, and refine approaches based on execution feedback. All\noutputs are concretely validated to eliminate false positives.\n  The evaluation across 36 real-world vulnerable contracts on Ethereum and\nBinance Smart Chain demonstrates a 62.96% (17 out of 27) success rate on the\nVERITE benchmark. Beyond the VERITE dataset, A1 identified 9 additional\nvulnerable contracts, with 5 cases occurring after the strongest model's\ntraining cutoff date. Across all 26 successful cases, A1 extracts up to 8.59\nmillion USD per case and 9.33 million USD total. Through 432 experiments across\nsix LLMs, we analyze iteration-wise performance showing diminishing returns\nwith average marginal gains of +9.7%, +3.7%, +5.1%, and +2.8% for iterations\n2-5 respectively, with per-experiment costs ranging $0.01-$3.59. A Monte Carlo\nanalysis of 19 historical attacks shows success probabilities of 85.9%-88.8%\nwithout detection delays.\n  We investigate whether an attacker or a defender benefits most from deploying\nA1 as a continuous on-chain scanning system. Our model shows that OpenAI's\no3-pro maintains profitability up to a 30.0 days scanning delay at 0.100%\nvulnerability incidence rates, while faster models require >=1.000% rates to\nbreak-even. The findings exposes a troubling asymmetry: at 0.1% vulnerability\nrates, attackers achieve an on-chain scanning profitability at a \\$6000 exploit\nvalue, while defenders require \\$60000, raising fundamental questions about\nwhether AI agents inevitably favor exploitation over defense.",

                    "value": "We present A1, an agentic execution driven system that transforms any LLM\ninto an end-to-end exploit generator. A1 has no hand-crafted heuristics and\nprovides the agent with six domain-specific tools that enable autonomous\nvulnerability discovery. The agent can flexibly leverage these tools to\nunderstand smart contract behavior, generate exploit strategies, test them on\nblockchain states, and refine approaches based on execution feedback. All\noutputs are concretely validated to eliminate false positives.\n  The evaluation across 36 real-world vulnerable contracts on Ethereum and\nBinance Smart Chain demonstrates a 62.96% (17 out of 27) success rate on the\nVERITE benchmark. Beyond the VERITE dataset, A1 identified 9 additional\nvulnerable contracts, with 5 cases occurring after the strongest model's\ntraining cutoff date. Across all 26 successful cases, A1 extracts up to 8.59\nmillion USD per case and 9.33 million USD total. Through 432 experiments across\nsix LLMs, we analyze iteration-wise performance showing diminishing returns\nwith average marginal gains of +9.7%, +3.7%, +5.1%, and +2.8% for iterations\n2-5 respectively, with per-experiment costs ranging $0.01-$3.59. A Monte Carlo\nanalysis of 19 historical attacks shows success probabilities of 85.9%-88.8%\nwithout detection delays.\n  We investigate whether an attacker or a defender benefits most from deploying\nA1 as a continuous on-chain scanning system. Our model shows that OpenAI's\no3-pro maintains profitability up to a 30.0 days scanning delay at 0.100%\nvulnerability incidence rates, while faster models require >=1.000% rates to\nbreak-even. The findings exposes a troubling asymmetry: at 0.1% vulnerability\nrates, attackers achieve an on-chain scanning profitability at a \\$6000 exploit\nvalue, while defenders require \\$60000, raising fundamental questions about\nwhether AI agents inevitably favor exploitation over defense."

To help mitigate these limitations, we\npreviously introduced 'PenTest++', an AI-augmented system combining automation\nwith generative AI supporting ethical hacking workflows. However, a key\nlimitation of PenTest++ was its lack of support for privilege escalation, a\ncrucial element of ethical hacking. In this paper we present 'PenTest2.0', a\nsubstantial evolution of PenTest++ supporting automated privilege escalation\ndriven entirely by Large Language Model reasoning. It also incorporates several\nsignificant enhancements: 'Retrieval-Augmented Generation', including both\none-line and offline modes; 'Chain-of-Thought' prompting for intermediate\nreasoning; persistent 'PenTest Task Trees' to track goal progression across\nturns; and the optional integration of human-authored hints. We describe how it\noperates, present a proof-of-concept prototype, and discuss its benefits and\nlimitations. We also describe application of the system to a controlled Linux\ntarget, showing it can carry out multi-turn, adaptive privilege escalation. We\nexplain the rationale behind its core design choices, and provide comprehensive\ntesting results and cost analysis. Our findings indicate that 'PenTest2.0'\nrepresents a meaningful step toward practical, scalable, AI-automated\npenetration testing, whilst highlighting the shortcomings of generative AI\nsystems, particularly their sensitivity to prompt structure, execution context,\nand semantic drift, reinforcing the need for further research and refinement in\nthis emerging space.\n  Keywords: AI, Ethical Hacking, Privilege Escalation, GenAI, ChatGPT, LLM\n(Large Language Model), HITL (Human-in-the-Loop)",

Learning 3D language\nfields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D\nscenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target\nobjects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods\nstruggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language\nqueries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from\ninadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D\nscenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural\nrepresentation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial\nreasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature\nfield for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in\nlanguage queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial\nrelations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial\nrelation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner\nincorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical\nfeature field. This field represents language and instance features using\ndistilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model\n(SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a\nhierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial\nrelation in the language query.

Existing approaches mainly rely on predefined rewrite\nrules, but they handle a limited subset of queries and can cause performance\nregressions. This limitation stems from three challenges of rule-based query\nrewrite: (1) it is hard to discover and verify new rules, (2) fixed rewrite\nrules do not generalize to new query patterns, and (3) some rewrite techniques\ncannot be expressed as fixed rules. Motivated by the fact that human experts\nexhibit significantly better rewrite ability but suffer from scalability, and\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated nearly human-level semantic and\nreasoning abilities, we propose a new approach of using LLMs to rewrite SQL\nqueries beyond rules. Due to the hallucination problems in LLMs, directly\napplying LLMs often leads to nonequivalent and suboptimal queries. To address\nthis issue, we propose QUITE (query rewrite), a training-free and\nfeedback-aware system based on LLM agents that rewrites SQL queries into\nsemantically equivalent forms with significantly better performance, covering a\nbroader range of query patterns and rewrite strategies compared to rule-based\nmethods. Firstly, we design a multi-agent framework controlled by a finite\nstate machine (FSM) to equip LLMs with the ability to use external tools and\nenhance the rewrite process with real-time database feedback.

In\nthis paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and\nidentify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts\nbetween the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal\nfluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these\ninstabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration\nperformance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive\nGradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD\nintegrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up\nstrategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum\n(ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive\nexperiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD\nsignificantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art\nperformance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results.

This work explores parameter pruning to\nimprove parameter efficiency while maintaining recommendation quality, thereby\nenabling easier deployment. Unlike existing approaches that focus primarily on\ninter-layer redundancy, we uncover intra-layer redundancy within components\nsuch as self-attention and MLP modules. Building on this analysis, we propose a\nmore fine-grained pruning approach that integrates both intra-layer and\nlayer-wise pruning. Specifically, we introduce a three-stage pruning strategy\nthat progressively prunes parameters at different levels and parts of the\nmodel, moving from intra-layer to layer-wise pruning, or from width to depth.\nEach stage also includes a performance restoration step using distillation\ntechniques, helping to strike a balance between performance and parameter\nefficiency. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach:\nacross three datasets, our models achieve an average of 88% of the original\nmodel's performance while pruning more than 95% of the non-embedding\nparameters. This underscores the potential of our method to significantly\nreduce resource requirements without greatly compromising recommendation\nquality.

                    "value": "LLM-based recommender systems have made significant progress; however, the\ndeployment cost associated with the large parameter volume of LLMs still\nhinders their real-world applications. This work explores parameter pruning to\nimprove parameter efficiency while maintaining recommendation quality, thereby\nenabling easier deployment. Unlike existing approaches that focus primarily on\ninter-layer redundancy, we uncover intra-layer redundancy within components\nsuch as self-attention and MLP modules. Building on this analysis, we propose a\nmore fine-grained pruning approach that integrates both intra-layer and\nlayer-wise pruning. Specifically, we introduce a three-stage pruning strategy\nthat progressively prunes parameters at different levels and parts of the\nmodel, moving from intra-layer to layer-wise pruning, or from width to depth.\nEach stage also includes a performance restoration step using distillation\ntechniques, helping to strike a balance between performance and parameter\nefficiency. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach:\nacross three datasets, our models achieve an average of 88% of the original\nmodel's performance while pruning more than 95% of the non-embedding\nparameters. This underscores the potential of our method to significantly\nreduce resource requirements without greatly compromising recommendation\nquality.

                "summary": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a powerful architecture for\ncomputer vision tasks due to their ability to model long-range dependencies and\nglobal contextual relationships. However, their substantial compute and memory\ndemands hinder efficient deployment in scenarios with strict energy and\nbandwidth limitations. In this work, we propose OptoViT, the first near-sensor,\nregion-aware ViT accelerator leveraging silicon photonics (SiPh) for real-time\nand energy-efficient vision processing. Opto-ViT features a hybrid\nelectronic-photonic architecture, where the optical core handles\ncompute-intensive matrix multiplications using Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting\nLasers (VCSELs) and Microring Resonators (MRs), while nonlinear functions and\nnormalization are executed electronically. To reduce redundant computation and\npatch processing, we introduce a lightweight Mask Generation Network (MGNet)\nthat identifies regions of interest in the current frame and prunes irrelevant\npatches before ViT encoding. We further co-optimize the ViT backbone using\nquantization-aware training and matrix decomposition tailored for photonic\nconstraints. Experiments across device fabrication, circuit and architecture\nco-design, to classification, detection, and video tasks demonstrate that\nOptoViT achieves 100.4 KFPS/W with up to 84% energy savings with less than 1.6%\naccuracy loss, while enabling scalable and efficient ViT deployment at the\nedge.",

We further propose an anatomy-based contrastive learning procedure\nto improve the generalization of anatomical features, coupled with a matching\nloss for pathological features to prioritize clinically relevant regions.\nAdditionally, a feature gating mechanism is employed to filter out low-quality\nconcept features.

LLMs, as zero-shot planners themselves, are still\nnot capable of directly generating valid plans for complex planning problems\nsuch as multi-constraint or long-horizon tasks. On the other hand, many\nframeworks aiming to solve complex planning problems often rely on\ntask-specific preparatory efforts, such as task-specific in-context examples\nand pre-defined critics/verifiers, which limits their cross-task generalization\ncapability. In this paper, we tackle these challenges by observing that the\ncore of many planning problems lies in optimization problems: searching for the\noptimal solution (best plan) with goals subject to constraints (preconditions\nand effects of decisions). With LLMs' commonsense, reasoning, and programming\ncapabilities, this opens up the possibilities of a universal LLM-based approach\nto planning problems. Inspired by this observation, we propose LLMFP, a\ngeneral-purpose framework that leverages LLMs to capture key information from\nplanning problems and formally formulate and solve them as optimization\nproblems from scratch, with no task-specific examples needed. We apply LLMFP to\n9 planning problems, ranging from multi-constraint decision making to\nmulti-step planning problems, and demonstrate that LLMFP achieves on average\n83.7% and 86.8% optimal rate across 9 tasks for GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet,\nsignificantly outperforming the best baseline (direct planning with OpenAI\no1-preview) with 37.6% and 40.7% improvements.

ATF integrates seamlessly with\nexisting models (e.g., TAPAS, TAPEX) without retraining. Experiments show that\nATF reduces table cells by 70%, boosting performance on out-of-domain TableQA\ntasks while causing slight performance drops on Table Fact Verification, where\nfull-table context is more critical.

We propose ATF (Adaptive Table\nFiltering Framework), a modular and question-aware filtering pipeline that\nprunes uninformative columns and rows using LLM-generated column descriptions,\nclustering, and sparse-dense alignment scores. ATF integrates seamlessly with\nexisting models (e.g., TAPAS, TAPEX) without retraining. Experiments show that\nATF reduces table cells by 70%, boosting performance on out-of-domain TableQA\ntasks while causing slight performance drops on Table Fact Verification, where\nfull-table context is more critical. These results highlight ATF's ability to\nadaptively balance informativeness and minimalism across tasks."

A popular method for evaluating these capabilities is the\nneedle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) test, which involves retrieving a \"needle\"\n(relevant information) from a \"haystack\" (long irrelevant context). Extensions\nof this approach include increasing distractors, fact chaining, and in-context\nreasoning. However, in these benchmarks, models can exploit existing literal\nmatches between the needle and haystack to simplify the task. To address this,\nwe introduce NoLiMa, a benchmark extending NIAH with a carefully designed\nneedle set, where questions and needles have minimal lexical overlap, requiring\nmodels to infer latent associations to locate the needle within the haystack.\nWe evaluate 13 popular LLMs that claim to support contexts of at least 128K\ntokens. While they perform well in short contexts (<1K), performance degrades\nsignificantly as context length increases. At 32K, for instance, 11 models drop\nbelow 50% of their strong short-length baselines. Even GPT-4o, one of the\ntop-performing exceptions, experiences a reduction from an almost-perfect\nbaseline of 99.3% to 69.7%. Our analysis suggests these declines stem from the\nincreased difficulty the attention mechanism faces in longer contexts when\nliteral matches are absent, making it harder to retrieve relevant information.\nEven models enhanced with reasoning capabilities or CoT prompting struggle to\nmaintain performance in long contexts.

One major limitation of most\nexisting Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL\nin nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully\nutilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time,\nposing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To\nthis end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating\nMix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable\non-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix\nconsists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient\nwith an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2)\nKL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and\nflexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from\nefficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our\nexperiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base\nmodels. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with\n0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B\nmodel) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math\nreasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and\nMATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level\nperformance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of\nrollout data volume.

At the same\ntime, existing diagnostic methods either depend on expensive multi-point\ninstrumentation or stringent modelling assumptions that are untenable under\nsingle-sensor constraints. This paper proposes a Fractional-Order\nMemory-Enhanced Attack-Diagnosis Scheme (FO-MADS) that achieves low-latency\nfault localisation and cyber-attack detection using only one VPQ\n(Voltage-Power-Reactive-power) sensor. FO-MADS first constructs a dual\nfractional-order feature library by jointly applying Caputo and\nGr\\\"unwald-Letnikov derivatives, thereby amplifying micro-perturbations and\nslow drifts in the VPQ signal. A two-stage hierarchical classifier then\npinpoints the affected inverter and isolates the faulty IGBT switch,\neffectively alleviating class imbalance. Robustness is further strengthened\nthrough Progressive Memory-Replay Adversarial Training (PMR-AT), whose\nattack-aware loss is dynamically re-weighted via Online Hard Example Mining\n(OHEM) to prioritise the most challenging samples. Experiments on a\nfour-inverter microgrid testbed comprising 1 normal and 24 fault classes under\nfour attack scenarios demonstrate diagnostic accuracies of 96.6 % (bias), 94.0\n% (noise), 92.8 % (data replacement), and 95.7 % (replay), while sustaining\n96.7 % under attack-free conditions.

                "summary": "Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) considerably changed how\ntechnologies can influence language. While previous technologies could mediate\nor assist humans, there is now a tendency to offload the task of writing itself\nto these technologies, enabling them to change our linguistic ecosystem more\ndirectly. While they provide us quick access to information and impressively\nfluent output, beneath their apparent sophistication lies a subtle, more\ninsidious threat: the gradual decline and loss of linguistic diversity.

Comparative evaluation reveals substantial advantages over\ntraditional approaches: while a CRNN baseline achieved 99.8\\% synthetic\naccuracy, it suffered severe degradation to 72.5\\% on real documents. Our\napproach demonstrates effective synthetic-to-real domain transfer, providing a\ncost-effective solution deployable on accessible infrastructure. This work\nestablishes a transferable framework for endangered language OCR that removes\ntechnical and financial barriers in digital humanities, enabling historians and\nlinguists to process historical archives without specialized computing\nresources.

                "summary": "Open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding aims to localize target objects based on\nfree-form language queries, which is crucial for embodied AI applications such\nas autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality. Learning 3D language\nfields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D\nscenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target\nobjects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods\nstruggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language\nqueries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from\ninadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D\nscenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural\nrepresentation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial\nreasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature\nfield for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in\nlanguage queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial\nrelations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial\nrelation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner\nincorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical\nfeature field. This field represents language and instance features using\ndistilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model\n(SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a\nhierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial\nrelation in the language query. Extensive experiments show that our framework\ncan be seamlessly integrated into different neural representations,\noutperforming baseline models in 3D visual grounding while empowering their\nspatial reasoning capability.",

                    "value": "Open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding aims to localize target objects based on\nfree-form language queries, which is crucial for embodied AI applications such\nas autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality. Learning 3D language\nfields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D\nscenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target\nobjects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods\nstruggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language\nqueries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from\ninadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D\nscenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural\nrepresentation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial\nreasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature\nfield for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in\nlanguage queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial\nrelations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial\nrelation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner\nincorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical\nfeature field. This field represents language and instance features using\ndistilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model\n(SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a\nhierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial\nrelation in the language query. Extensive experiments show that our framework\ncan be seamlessly integrated into different neural representations,\noutperforming baseline models in 3D visual grounding while empowering their\nspatial reasoning capability."

Existing approaches mainly rely on predefined rewrite\nrules, but they handle a limited subset of queries and can cause performance\nregressions. This limitation stems from three challenges of rule-based query\nrewrite: (1) it is hard to discover and verify new rules, (2) fixed rewrite\nrules do not generalize to new query patterns, and (3) some rewrite techniques\ncannot be expressed as fixed rules. Motivated by the fact that human experts\nexhibit significantly better rewrite ability but suffer from scalability, and\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated nearly human-level semantic and\nreasoning abilities, we propose a new approach of using LLMs to rewrite SQL\nqueries beyond rules. Due to the hallucination problems in LLMs, directly\napplying LLMs often leads to nonequivalent and suboptimal queries. To address\nthis issue, we propose QUITE (query rewrite), a training-free and\nfeedback-aware system based on LLM agents that rewrites SQL queries into\nsemantically equivalent forms with significantly better performance, covering a\nbroader range of query patterns and rewrite strategies compared to rule-based\nmethods. Firstly, we design a multi-agent framework controlled by a finite\nstate machine (FSM) to equip LLMs with the ability to use external tools and\nenhance the rewrite process with real-time database feedback. Secondly, we\ndevelop a rewrite middleware to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate\noptimized query equivalents. Finally, we employ a novel hint injection\ntechnique to improve execution plans for rewritten queries. Extensive\nexperiments show that QUITE reduces query execution time by up to 35.8% over\nstate-of-the-art approaches and produces 24.1% more rewrites than prior\nmethods, covering query cases that earlier systems did not handle.",

Motivated by the fact that human experts\nexhibit significantly better rewrite ability but suffer from scalability, and\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated nearly human-level semantic and\nreasoning abilities, we propose a new approach of using LLMs to rewrite SQL\nqueries beyond rules. Due to the hallucination problems in LLMs, directly\napplying LLMs often leads to nonequivalent and suboptimal queries. To address\nthis issue, we propose QUITE (query rewrite), a training-free and\nfeedback-aware system based on LLM agents that rewrites SQL queries into\nsemantically equivalent forms with significantly better performance, covering a\nbroader range of query patterns and rewrite strategies compared to rule-based\nmethods. Firstly, we design a multi-agent framework controlled by a finite\nstate machine (FSM) to equip LLMs with the ability to use external tools and\nenhance the rewrite process with real-time database feedback. Secondly, we\ndevelop a rewrite middleware to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate\noptimized query equivalents. Finally, we employ a novel hint injection\ntechnique to improve execution plans for rewritten queries. Extensive\nexperiments show that QUITE reduces query execution time by up to 35.8% over\nstate-of-the-art approaches and produces 24.1% more rewrites than prior\nmethods, covering query cases that earlier systems did not handle."

Due to the unique\naerodynamic characteristics and flight constraints of fixed-wing UAVs,\nachieving accurate and fast stable path following remains difficult, especially\nin low-altitude mountainous terrains, urban landscapes, and under wind\ndisturbances. Most existing path-following guidance laws often struggle to\nensure fast stabilization under unknown bounded disturbances while maintaining\nsufficient robustness, and there is a lack of research on optimizing robustness\nfor non-smooth paths under flight constraints. This paper addresses these\nissues by proposing a constraints-based robust path-following controller.\nFirstly, from the perspective of global random attractor, we innovatively\nintroduce robustness metrics that quantify both the exponential convergence\nrate and the range of the ultimate attractor set. Secondly, building on these\nmetrics, we develop a robust longitudinal-lateral look-ahead pursuit (RLLP)\nguidance law for fixed-wing UAVs, specifically considering the flight path\nangle and track angle under external disturbances. Thirdly, we also derive an\noptimized version (Optimal-RLLP) to enhance the robustness metrics, and\nelaborate on the sufficient conditions for fast finite-time stability, ensuring\nthe guidance law achieves finite-time stability and robustness with reduced\nsensitivity to constrained uncertainties. The simulation results validate the\nproposed guidance law's feasibility, optimality and robustness under\natmospheric disturbances using a high-fidelity simulation platform and provide\nkey principle for practical deployment.",

However, its large storage requirements and high\ncomputational cost pose challenges for practical deployment. Post-training\nquantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective strategy for efficient\ndeployment, but we identify two key challenges in SAM that hinder the\neffectiveness of existing PTQ methods: the heavy-tailed and skewed distribution\nof post-GELU activations, and significant inter-channel variation in linear\nprojection activations. To address these challenges, we propose AHCPTQ, an\naccurate and hardware-efficient PTQ method for SAM. AHCPTQ introduces\nhardware-compatible Hybrid Log-Uniform Quantization (HLUQ) to manage post-GELU\nactivations, employing log2 quantization for dense small values and uniform\nquantization for sparse large values to enhance quantization resolution.\nAdditionally, AHCPTQ incorporates Channel-Aware Grouping (CAG) to mitigate\ninter-channel variation by progressively clustering activation channels with\nsimilar distributions, enabling them to share quantization parameters and\nimproving hardware efficiency. The combination of HLUQ and CAG not only\nenhances quantization effectiveness but also ensures compatibility with\nefficient hardware execution. For instance, under the W4A4 configuration on the\nSAM-L model, AHCPTQ achieves 36.6% mAP on instance segmentation with the DINO\ndetector, while achieving a 7.89x speedup and 8.64x energy efficiency over its\nfloating-point counterpart in FPGA implementation.",

Current Large Language Models (LLMs), while\nadept at text-to-SQL translation, have not been rigorously evaluated on the\nmore challenging task of debugging SQL issues. To address this gap, we\nintroduce BIRD-CRITIC, a new SQL issue debugging benchmark comprising 530\nPostgreSQL tasks (BIRD-CRITIC-PG) and 570 multi-dialect tasks\n(BIRD-CRITIC-Multi), distilled from authentic user issues and replayed within\nnew environments to facilitate rigorous evaluation. Baseline evaluations\nunderscore the task's complexity, with the leading reasoning model O3-Mini\nachieving only 38.87% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 33.33% on\nBIRD-CRITIC-Multi. Meanwhile, advancing open-source models for database tasks\nis crucial for empowering local development while safeguarding data privacy.\nTherefore, we present Six-Gym (Sql-fIX-Gym), a training environment for\nelevating open-source model capabilities for SQL issue debugging. This\nenvironment leverages SQL-Rewind strategy, which automatically generates\nexecutable issue-solution datasets by reverse-engineering issues from verified\nSQLs. However, popular trajectory-based fine-tuning methods do not explore\nsubstantial supervisory signals. We further propose f-Plan Boosting, which\nextracts high-level debugging plans from SQL solutions, enabling teacher LLMs\nto produce 73.7% more successful trajectories for training. We integrate these\ncomponents into an open-source agent, Bird-Fixer. Based on Qwen-2.5-Coder-14B,\nBird-Fixer achieves 38.11% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 29.65% on\nBIRD-CRITIC-Multi, surpassing leading proprietary models such as\nClaude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4.1, marking a significant step toward democratizing\nsophisticated SQL-debugging capabilities.

                    "value": "Resolution of complex SQL issues persists as a significant bottleneck in\nreal-world database applications. Current Large Language Models (LLMs), while\nadept at text-to-SQL translation, have not been rigorously evaluated on the\nmore challenging task of debugging SQL issues. To address this gap, we\nintroduce BIRD-CRITIC, a new SQL issue debugging benchmark comprising 530\nPostgreSQL tasks (BIRD-CRITIC-PG) and 570 multi-dialect tasks\n(BIRD-CRITIC-Multi), distilled from authentic user issues and replayed within\nnew environments to facilitate rigorous evaluation. Baseline evaluations\nunderscore the task's complexity, with the leading reasoning model O3-Mini\nachieving only 38.87% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 33.33% on\nBIRD-CRITIC-Multi. Meanwhile, advancing open-source models for database tasks\nis crucial for empowering local development while safeguarding data privacy.\nTherefore, we present Six-Gym (Sql-fIX-Gym), a training environment for\nelevating open-source model capabilities for SQL issue debugging. This\nenvironment leverages SQL-Rewind strategy, which automatically generates\nexecutable issue-solution datasets by reverse-engineering issues from verified\nSQLs. However, popular trajectory-based fine-tuning methods do not explore\nsubstantial supervisory signals. We further propose f-Plan Boosting, which\nextracts high-level debugging plans from SQL solutions, enabling teacher LLMs\nto produce 73.7% more successful trajectories for training. We integrate these\ncomponents into an open-source agent, Bird-Fixer. Based on Qwen-2.5-Coder-14B,\nBird-Fixer achieves 38.11% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 29.65% on\nBIRD-CRITIC-Multi, surpassing leading proprietary models such as\nClaude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4.1, marking a significant step toward democratizing\nsophisticated SQL-debugging capabilities.

However, despite their strong\nperformance, LLMs introduce important legal/ ethical concerns, particularly\nregarding privacy, data protection, and transparency. Due to these concerns,\nthis work explores the use of Named- Entity Recognition (NER) to facilitate the\nprivacy-preserving training (or adaptation) of LLMs. We propose a framework\nthat uses NER technologies to anonymize sensitive information in text data,\nsuch as personal identities or geographic locations. An evaluation of the\nproposed privacy-preserving learning framework was conducted to measure its\nimpact on user privacy and system performance in a particular high-stakes and\nsensitive setup: AI-based resume scoring for recruitment processes. The study\ninvolved two language models (BERT and RoBERTa) and six anonymization\nalgorithms (based on Presidio, FLAIR, BERT, and different versions of GPT)\napplied to a database of 24,000 candidate profiles. The findings indicate that\nthe proposed privacy preservation techniques effectively maintain system\nperformance while playing a critical role in safeguarding candidate\nconfidentiality, thus promoting trust in the experimented scenario. On top of\nthe proposed privacy-preserving approach, we also experiment applying an\nexisting approach that reduces the gender bias in LLMs, thus finally obtaining\nour proposed Privacyand Bias-aware LLMs (PBa-LLMs).

                    "value": "The use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in highstakes AI-based\napplications has increased significantly in recent years, especially since the\nemergence of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, despite their strong\nperformance, LLMs introduce important legal/ ethical concerns, particularly\nregarding privacy, data protection, and transparency. Due to these concerns,\nthis work explores the use of Named- Entity Recognition (NER) to facilitate the\nprivacy-preserving training (or adaptation) of LLMs. We propose a framework\nthat uses NER technologies to anonymize sensitive information in text data,\nsuch as personal identities or geographic locations. An evaluation of the\nproposed privacy-preserving learning framework was conducted to measure its\nimpact on user privacy and system performance in a particular high-stakes and\nsensitive setup: AI-based resume scoring for recruitment processes. The study\ninvolved two language models (BERT and RoBERTa) and six anonymization\nalgorithms (based on Presidio, FLAIR, BERT, and different versions of GPT)\napplied to a database of 24,000 candidate profiles. The findings indicate that\nthe proposed privacy preservation techniques effectively maintain system\nperformance while playing a critical role in safeguarding candidate\nconfidentiality, thus promoting trust in the experimented scenario. On top of\nthe proposed privacy-preserving approach, we also experiment applying an\nexisting approach that reduces the gender bias in LLMs, thus finally obtaining\nour proposed Privacyand Bias-aware LLMs (PBa-LLMs). Note that the proposed\nPBa-LLMs have been evaluated in a particular setup (resume scoring), but are\ngenerally applicable to any other LLM-based AI application."

Fully exploiting these\ncapabilities requires a unified design that bridges system-level optimization\nwith multi-target parameter estimation. This paper proposes an end-to-end graph\nlearning approach to close this gap, modeling the entire cell-free ISAC network\nas a heterogeneous graph to jointly design the AP mode selection, user\nassociation, precoding, and echo signal processing for multi-target position\nand velocity estimation. In particular, we propose two novel heterogeneous\ngraph learning frameworks: a dynamic graph learning framework and a lightweight\nmirror-based graph attention network (mirror-GAT) framework.

                    "value": "Cell-free integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems have emerged as\na promising paradigm for sixth-generation (6G) networks, enabling simultaneous\nhigh-rate data transmission and high-precision radar sensing through\ncooperative distributed access points (APs). Fully exploiting these\ncapabilities requires a unified design that bridges system-level optimization\nwith multi-target parameter estimation. This paper proposes an end-to-end graph\nlearning approach to close this gap, modeling the entire cell-free ISAC network\nas a heterogeneous graph to jointly design the AP mode selection, user\nassociation, precoding, and echo signal processing for multi-target position\nand velocity estimation. In particular, we propose two novel heterogeneous\ngraph learning frameworks: a dynamic graph learning framework and a lightweight\nmirror-based graph attention network (mirror-GAT) framework. The dynamic graph\nlearning framework employs structural and temporal attention mechanisms\nintegrated with a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN),\nenabling superior performance and robustness in cell-free ISAC environments.\nConversely, the mirror-GAT framework significantly reduces computational\ncomplexity and signaling overhead through a bi-level iterative structure with\nshare adjacency.

For\nbiosensing, nanophotonic platforms achieve unprecedented sensitivity in\ndetecting biomolecules, pathogens, and pollutants, enabling real-time\ndiagnostics and environmental monitoring. Medical applications leverage\ntailored light-matter interactions for precision photothermal therapy,\nimage-guided surgery, and early disease detection. Furthermore, nanophotonics\nunderpins next-generation optical neural networks and neuromorphic computing,\noffering ultra-fast, energy-efficient alternatives to von Neumann\narchitectures. Despite rapid growth, challenges in scalability, fabrication\ncosts, and material stability persist. Future advancements will rely on novel\nmaterials, AI-driven design optimization, and multidisciplinary approaches to\nenable scalable, low-cost deployment. This review summarizes recent progress\nand highlights future trends, including novel material systems,\nmultidisciplinary approaches, and enhanced computational capabilities, to pave\nthe way for transformative applications in this rapidly evolving field."

Automatic airway segmentation is\ntherefore a prerequisite for enabling rapid bronchoscopic navigation and the\nclinical deployment of bronchoscopic robotic systems. Although convolutional\nneural network methods have gained considerable attention in airway\nsegmentation, the unique tree-like structure of airways poses challenges for\nconventional and deformable convolutions, which often fail to focus on fine\nairway structures, leading to missed segments and discontinuities. To address\nthis issue, this study proposes a novel tubular feature extraction network,\nnamed TfeNet. TfeNet introduces a novel direction-aware convolution operation\nthat first applies spatial rotation transformations to adjust the sampling\npositions of linear convolution kernels. The deformed kernels are then\nrepresented as line segments or polylines in 3D space. Furthermore, a tubular\nfeature fusion module (TFFM) is designed based on asymmetric convolution and\nresidual connection strategies, enhancing the network's focus on subtle airway\nstructures. Extensive experiments conducted on one public dataset and two\ndatasets used in airway segmentation challenges demonstrate that the proposed\nTfeNet achieves more accuracy and continuous airway structure predictions\ncompared with existing methods. In particular, TfeNet achieves the highest\noverall score of 94.95% on the current largest airway segmentation dataset,\nAirway Tree Modeling(ATM22), and demonstrates advanced performance on the lung\nfibrosis dataset(AIIB23).

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across\nvarious NLP tasks but struggle with code-mixed (or code-switched) language\nunderstanding. For example, prior work benchmarking the performance of\nmultilingual LLMs on code-mixed translation tasks has demonstrated that current\nstate-of-the-art multilingual LLMs are ineffective in dealing with code-mixed\nlanguages. However, the question of how to improve the capability of\nmultilingual LLMs to handle code-mixed language has not received any attention\nto date. In this paper, we tackle this research gap by proposing CHAI, a novel\ngeneral-purpose framework for improving the ability of multilingual LLMs to\nhandle code-mixed languages. CHAI relies on three novel contributions made in\nthis paper. First, we explore the ability of LLMs to provide accurate\nannotations for code-mixed translation tasks. Second, we leverage this ability\nof LLMs as annotators to generate preference data for code-mixed translation\ntasks at scale, which are then used within a reinforcement learning from AI\nfeedback (RLAIF) procedure to improve LLMs' capability on code-mixed tasks.\nThird, we conduct a rigorous experimental evaluation across various real-world\ndatasets and settings. Our analysis shows that CHAI-powered LLMs outperform\nstate-of-the-art open-source LLMs by 25.66% (in terms of win rate adjudicated\nby human annotators) in code-mixed translation tasks. This work represents a\nfirst step towards developing more inclusive code-mixed LLMs.",

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across\nvarious NLP tasks but struggle with code-mixed (or code-switched) language\nunderstanding. For example, prior work benchmarking the performance of\nmultilingual LLMs on code-mixed translation tasks has demonstrated that current\nstate-of-the-art multilingual LLMs are ineffective in dealing with code-mixed\nlanguages. However, the question of how to improve the capability of\nmultilingual LLMs to handle code-mixed language has not received any attention\nto date. In this paper, we tackle this research gap by proposing CHAI, a novel\ngeneral-purpose framework for improving the ability of multilingual LLMs to\nhandle code-mixed languages. CHAI relies on three novel contributions made in\nthis paper. First, we explore the ability of LLMs to provide accurate\nannotations for code-mixed translation tasks. Second, we leverage this ability\nof LLMs as annotators to generate preference data for code-mixed translation\ntasks at scale, which are then used within a reinforcement learning from AI\nfeedback (RLAIF) procedure to improve LLMs' capability on code-mixed tasks.\nThird, we conduct a rigorous experimental evaluation across various real-world\ndatasets and settings. Our analysis shows that CHAI-powered LLMs outperform\nstate-of-the-art open-source LLMs by 25.66% (in terms of win rate adjudicated\nby human annotators) in code-mixed translation tasks. This work represents a\nfirst step towards developing more inclusive code-mixed LLMs."
