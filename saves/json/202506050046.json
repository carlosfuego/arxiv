This observation suggests that information of\nthe segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into\nthe separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by\nthis insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates\ninference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens.\nAdditionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration.\nExperimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and\npost-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the\nLlama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the\nGSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance.

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, yet ensuring\ntheir outputs conform to strict structural or grammatical constraints remains\nchallenging, which is critical in function calls and domain-specific language\n(DSL) generation. Constrained decoding with context-free grammar is a flexible\napproach to guarantee LLMs' adherence to a specific format by dynamically\nbuilding a token logits mask. However, creating this mask requires checking the\nvalidity of all tokens in the LLM vocabulary at every decoding step, which\noften incurs significant overheads in existing constrained decoding engines. To\naddress this challenge, we propose $\\textbf{ZapFormat}$, a novel\n$\\textbf{dynamic pruning}$ strategy based on the Earley algorithm that\nidentifies and eliminates invalid or redundant Earley states in real-time,\nsignificantly reducing memory occupation of the Earley algorithm's states. This\nfurther enables us to use a state cache to speed up structured generations on a\nlarge number of queries. We implemented ZapFormat in a new constrained decoding\nengine called Formatron which also incorporates existing optimizations. Through\ncomprehensive experiments on structured generation tasks, including JSON\ngeneration, JSON Schema validation, and semantic parsing, we demonstrate that\nFormatron not only $\\textbf{consistently maintains}$ high-precision compliant\noutputs but also achieves $\\textbf{significant improvements}$ in inference\nspeed up to 2x compared to state-of-the-art implementations. More importantly,\nFormatron is generally applicable across various LLM architectures. We release\nFormatron as open source at https://github.com/Dan-wanna-M/formatron.",

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, yet ensuring\ntheir outputs conform to strict structural or grammatical constraints remains\nchallenging, which is critical in function calls and domain-specific language\n(DSL) generation. Constrained decoding with context-free grammar is a flexible\napproach to guarantee LLMs' adherence to a specific format by dynamically\nbuilding a token logits mask. However, creating this mask requires checking the\nvalidity of all tokens in the LLM vocabulary at every decoding step, which\noften incurs significant overheads in existing constrained decoding engines. To\naddress this challenge, we propose $\\textbf{ZapFormat}$, a novel\n$\\textbf{dynamic pruning}$ strategy based on the Earley algorithm that\nidentifies and eliminates invalid or redundant Earley states in real-time,\nsignificantly reducing memory occupation of the Earley algorithm's states. This\nfurther enables us to use a state cache to speed up structured generations on a\nlarge number of queries. We implemented ZapFormat in a new constrained decoding\nengine called Formatron which also incorporates existing optimizations. Through\ncomprehensive experiments on structured generation tasks, including JSON\ngeneration, JSON Schema validation, and semantic parsing, we demonstrate that\nFormatron not only $\\textbf{consistently maintains}$ high-precision compliant\noutputs but also achieves $\\textbf{significant improvements}$ in inference\nspeed up to 2x compared to state-of-the-art implementations. More importantly,\nFormatron is generally applicable across various LLM architectures. We release\nFormatron as open source at https://github.com/Dan-wanna-M/formatron."

While\npromising, they commonly rely on two optimistic assumptions: 1) full access to\nthe parameters of a PTM, and 2) sufficient memory capacity to cache all\nintermediate activations for gradient computation. However, in most real-world\napplications, PTMs serve as black-box APIs or proprietary software without full\nparameter accessibility. Besides, it is hard to meet a large memory requirement\nfor modern PTMs. This work proposes black-box visual prompting (BlackVIP),\nwhich efficiently adapts the PTMs without knowledge of their architectures or\nparameters. BlackVIP has two components: 1) Coordinator and 2) simultaneous\nperturbation stochastic approximation with gradient correction (SPSA-GC). The\nCoordinator designs input-dependent visual prompts, which allow the target PTM\nto adapt in the wild. SPSA-GC efficiently estimates the gradient of PTM to\nupdate Coordinator. Besides, we introduce a variant, BlackVIP-SE, which\nsignificantly reduces the runtime and computational cost of BlackVIP. Extensive\nexperiments on 19 datasets demonstrate that BlackVIPs enable robust adaptation\nto diverse domains and tasks with minimal memory requirements. We further\nprovide a theoretical analysis on the generalization of visual prompting\nmethods by presenting their connection to the certified robustness of\nrandomized smoothing, and presenting an empirical support for improved\nrobustness.",

To address these challenges, we propose QuickVideo, a\nsystem-algorithm co-design that substantially accelerates long-video\nunderstanding to support real-time downstream applications. It comprises three\nkey innovations: QuickDecoder, a parallelized CPU-based video decoder that\nachieves 2-3 times speedup by splitting videos into keyframe-aligned intervals\nprocessed concurrently; QuickPrefill, a memory-efficient prefilling method\nusing KV-cache pruning to support more frames with less GPU memory; and an\noverlapping scheme that overlaps CPU video decoding with GPU inference.\nTogether, these components infernece time reduce by a minute on long video\ninputs, enabling scalable, high-quality video understanding even on limited\nhardware. Experiments show that QuickVideo generalizes across durations and\nsampling rates, making long video processing feasible in practice.",

Existing methods\nfor WSN anomaly detection often face challenges such as the limited extraction\nof spatiotemporal correlation features, the absence of sample labels, few\nanomaly samples, and an imbalanced sample distribution. To address these\nissues, a spatiotemporal correlation detection model (MTAD-RD) considering both\nmodel architecture and a two-stage training strategy perspective is proposed.\nIn terms of model structure design, the proposed MTAD-RD backbone network\nincludes a retentive network (RetNet) enhanced by a cross-retention (CR)\nmodule, a multigranular feature fusion module, and a graph attention network\nmodule to extract internode correlation information. This proposed model can\nintegrate the intermodal correlation features and spatial features of WSN\nneighbor nodes while extracting global information from time series data.\nMoreover, its serialized inference characteristic can remarkably reduce\ninference overhead. For model training, a two-stage training approach was\ndesigned. First, a contrastive learning proxy task was designed for time series\ndata with graph structure information in WSNs, enabling the backbone network to\nlearn transferable features from unlabeled data using unsupervised contrastive\nlearning methods, thereby addressing the issue of missing sample labels in the\ndataset. Then, a caching-based sample sampler was designed to divide samples\ninto few-shot and contrastive learning data. A specific joint loss function was\ndeveloped to jointly train the dual-graph discriminator network to address the\nproblem of sample imbalance effectively. In experiments carried out on real\npublic datasets, the designed MTAD-RD anomaly detection method achieved an F1\nscore of 90.97%, outperforming existing supervised WSN anomaly detection\nmethods.",

However, natural language exhibits inherent semantic\nhierarchies and nuanced geometric structure, which current LLMs do not capture\ncompletely owing to their reliance on Euclidean operations. Recent studies have\nalso shown that not respecting the geometry of token embeddings leads to\ntraining instabilities and degradation of generative capabilities. These\nfindings suggest that shifting to non-Euclidean geometries can better align\nlanguage models with the underlying geometry of text. We thus propose to\noperate fully in Hyperbolic space, known for its expansive, scale-free, and\nlow-distortion properties. We thus introduce HELM, a family of HypErbolic Large\nLanguage Models, offering a geometric rethinking of the Transformer-based LLM\nthat addresses the representational inflexibility, missing set of necessary\noperations, and poor scalability of existing hyperbolic LMs. We additionally\nintroduce a Mixture-of-Curvature Experts model, HELM-MICE, where each expert\noperates in a distinct curvature space to encode more fine-grained geometric\nstructure from text, as well as a dense model, HELM-D. For HELM-MICE, we\nfurther develop hyperbolic Multi-Head Latent Attention (HMLA) for efficient,\nreduced-KV-cache training and inference. For both models, we develop essential\nhyperbolic equivalents of rotary positional encodings and RMS normalization. We\nare the first to train fully hyperbolic LLMs at billion-parameter scale, and\nevaluate them on well-known benchmarks such as MMLU and ARC, spanning STEM\nproblem-solving, general knowledge, and commonsense reasoning. Our results show\nconsistent gains from our HELM architectures -- up to 4% -- over popular\nEuclidean architectures used in LLaMA and DeepSeek, highlighting the efficacy\nand enhanced reasoning afforded by hyperbolic geometry in large-scale LM\npretraining.",

                "summary": "Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently in multi-region setups\nremains a challenge. Due to cost and GPU availability concerns, providers\ntypically deploy LLMs in multiple regions using instance with long-term\ncommitments, like reserved instances or on-premise clusters, which are often\nunderutilized due to their region-local traffic handling and diurnal traffic\nvariance. In this paper, we introduce SkyLB, a locality-aware multi-region load\nbalancer for LLM inference that aggregates regional diurnal patterns through\ncross-region traffic handling. By doing so, SkyLB enables providers to reserve\ninstances based on expected global demand, rather than peak demand in each\nindividual region. Meanwhile, SkyLB preserves KV-Cache locality and a balanced\nload, ensuring cost efficiency without sacrificing performance. SkyLB achieves\nthis with a cache-aware cross-region traffic handler and a selective pushing\nload balancing mechanism based on checking pending requests. Our evaluation on\nreal-world workloads shows that it achieves 1.12-2.06x higher throughput and\n1.74-6.30x lower latency compared to existing load balancers, while reducing\ntotal serving cost by 25%.",

The performance heterogeneity inherent in S-NUCA systems\ncomplicates task scheduling due to varying cache access latencies across cores.\nThis paper introduces a novel QoS management policy to maintain application\nexecution within predefined Quality of Service (QoS) targets, measured using\nthe Application Heartbeats framework. QoS metrics like Heartbeats ensure\npredictable application performance in dynamic computing environments. The\nproposed policy dynamically controls QoS by orchestrating task migrations\nwithin the S-NUCA many-core system and adjusting the clock frequency of cores.\nAfter satisfying the QoS objectives, the policy optimizes energy efficiency,\nreducing overall system energy consumption without compromising performance\nconstraints. Our work leverages the state-of-the-art multi-/many-core simulator\n{\\em HotSniper}. We have extended it with two key components: an integrated\nheartbeat framework for precise, application-specific performance monitoring,\nand our QoS management policy that maintains application QoS requirements while\nminimizing the system's energy consumption.

                    "value": "Optimizing performance and energy efficiency in many-core processors,\nespecially within Non-Uniform Cache Access (NUCA) architectures, remains a\ncritical challenge. The performance heterogeneity inherent in S-NUCA systems\ncomplicates task scheduling due to varying cache access latencies across cores.\nThis paper introduces a novel QoS management policy to maintain application\nexecution within predefined Quality of Service (QoS) targets, measured using\nthe Application Heartbeats framework. QoS metrics like Heartbeats ensure\npredictable application performance in dynamic computing environments. The\nproposed policy dynamically controls QoS by orchestrating task migrations\nwithin the S-NUCA many-core system and adjusting the clock frequency of cores.\nAfter satisfying the QoS objectives, the policy optimizes energy efficiency,\nreducing overall system energy consumption without compromising performance\nconstraints. Our work leverages the state-of-the-art multi-/many-core simulator\n{\\em HotSniper}. We have extended it with two key components: an integrated\nheartbeat framework for precise, application-specific performance monitoring,\nand our QoS management policy that maintains application QoS requirements while\nminimizing the system's energy consumption. Experimental evaluations\ndemonstrate that our approach effectively maintains desired QoS levels and\nachieves 18.7\\% energy savings compared to state-of-the-art scheduling methods."

The core idea is that, instead of\ngenerating an entire video on a single GPU, we parallelize both temporal frames\nand model layers across GPUs. However, a naive implementation of this division\nfaces a key limitation: since diffusion models require synchronized noise\nlevels across frames, this implementation leads to the serialization of\noriginal parallelisms. We leverage a block-wise denoising scheme to handle\nthis. Namely, we process a sequence of frame blocks through the pipeline with\nprogressively decreasing noise levels. Each GPU handles a specific block and\nlayer subset while passing previous results to the next GPU, enabling\nasynchronous computation and communication. To further optimize performance, we\nincorporate two key enhancements. Firstly, a feature cache is implemented on\neach GPU to store and reuse features from the prior block as context,\nminimizing inter-GPU communication and redundant computation. Secondly, we\nemploy a coordinated noise initialization strategy, ensuring globally\nconsistent temporal dynamics by sharing initial noise patterns across GPUs\nwithout extra resource costs. Together, these enable fast, artifact-free, and\ninfinitely long video generation.

Quantization\nis a promising approach for compressing KV cache activations; however, existing\nsolutions fail to represent activations accurately in sub-4-bit precision. Our\nwork, KVQuant, facilitates low precision KV cache quantization by incorporating\nseveral novel methods: (i) Per-Channel Key Quantization, where we adjust the\ndimension along which we quantize the Key activations to better match the\ndistribution; (ii) Pre-RoPE Key Quantization, where we quantize Key activations\nbefore the rotary positional embedding to mitigate its impact on quantization;\n(iii) Non-Uniform KV Cache Quantization, where we derive per-layer\nsensitivity-weighted non-uniform datatypes that better represent the\ndistributions; and (iv) Per-Vector Dense-and-Sparse Quantization, where we\nisolate outliers separately for each vector to minimize skews in quantization\nranges. By applying our method to the LLaMA, Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral\nmodels, we achieve < 0.1 perplexity degradation with 3-bit quantization on both\nWikitext-2 and C4, outperforming existing approaches. Our method enables\nserving LLaMA-7B with a context length of up to 1 million on a single A100-80GB\nGPU and up to 10 million on an 8-GPU system. We develop custom CUDA kernels for\nKVQuant, showing that we can achieve up to ~1.7x speedups, compared to baseline\nfp16 matrix-vector multiplications, for the LLaMA-7B model.",

However, since practical video caching networks involve various\nparties (e.g., users, isp, and csp) that do not wish to reveal information such\nas past history to each other, privacy-preserving solutions are required.\nMotivated by this, we propose a proactive caching method based on users'\nprivacy-preserving multi-slot future demand predictions -- obtained from a\ntrained Transformer -- to optimize revenue. Specifically, we first use a\nprivacy-preserving fl algorithm to train a Transformer to predict multi-slot\nfuture demands of the users. However, prediction accuracy is not perfect and\ndecreases the farther into the future the prediction is done. We model the\nimpact of prediction errors invoking the file popularities, based on which we\nformulate a long-term system revenue optimization to make the cache placement\ndecisions. As the formulated problem is NP-hard, we use a greedy algorithm to\nefficiently obtain an approximate solution. Simulation results validate that\n(i) the fl solution achieves results close to the centralized\n(non-privacy-preserving) solution and (ii) optimization of revenue may provide\ndifferent solutions than the classical chr criterion.",

However, since practical video caching networks involve various\nparties (e.g., users, isp, and csp) that do not wish to reveal information such\nas past history to each other, privacy-preserving solutions are required.\nMotivated by this, we propose a proactive caching method based on users'\nprivacy-preserving multi-slot future demand predictions -- obtained from a\ntrained Transformer -- to optimize revenue. Specifically, we first use a\nprivacy-preserving fl algorithm to train a Transformer to predict multi-slot\nfuture demands of the users. However, prediction accuracy is not perfect and\ndecreases the farther into the future the prediction is done. We model the\nimpact of prediction errors invoking the file popularities, based on which we\nformulate a long-term system revenue optimization to make the cache placement\ndecisions. As the formulated problem is NP-hard, we use a greedy algorithm to\nefficiently obtain an approximate solution. Simulation results validate that\n(i) the fl solution achieves results close to the centralized\n(non-privacy-preserving) solution and (ii) optimization of revenue may provide\ndifferent solutions than the classical chr criterion."

However, state-of-the-art diffusion\nmodels (e.g., Dream 7B, LLaDA 8B) suffer from slow inference. While they match\nthe quality of similarly sized Autoregressive (AR) Models (e.g., Qwen2.5 7B,\nLlama3 8B), their iterative denoising requires multiple full-sequence forward\npasses, resulting in high computational costs and latency, particularly for\nlong input prompts and long-context scenarios. Furthermore, parallel token\ngeneration introduces token incoherence problems, and current sampling\nheuristics suffer from significant quality drops with decreasing denoising\nsteps. We address these limitations with two training-free techniques. First,\nwe propose FreeCache, a Key-Value (KV) approximation caching technique that\nreuses stable KV projections across denoising steps, effectively reducing the\ncomputational cost of DLM inference. Second, we introduce Guided Diffusion, a\ntraining-free method that uses a lightweight pretrained autoregressive model to\nsupervise token unmasking, dramatically reducing the total number of denoising\niterations without sacrificing quality. We conduct extensive evaluations on\nopen-source reasoning benchmarks, and our combined methods deliver up to a 34x\nend-to-end speedup without compromising accuracy.

In production environments, image\nediting typically involves a mask that specifies the regions of an image\ntemplate to be edited. The use of masks provides direct control over the\nediting process and introduces sparsity in the model inference. In this paper,\nwe present InstGenIE, a system that efficiently serves image editing requests.\nThe key insight behind InstGenIE is that image editing only modifies the masked\nregions of image templates while preserving the original content in the\nunmasked areas.

To mitigate the high cache loading\noverhead, InstGenIE employs a bubble-free pipeline scheme that overlaps\ncomputation with cache loading. Additionally, to reduce queuing latency in\nonline serving while improving the GPU utilization, InstGenIE proposes a novel\ncontinuous batching strategy for diffusion model serving, allowing newly\narrived requests to join the running batch in just one step of denoising\ncomputation, without waiting for the entire batch to complete. As heterogeneous\nmasks induce imbalanced loads, InstGenIE also develops a load balancing\nstrategy that takes into account the loads of both computation and cache\nloading.

Existing solutions such as \"keep-alive\" or \"pre-warming\"\nare costly and unreliable under bursty workloads. We propose universal workers,\nwhich are computational units capable of executing any function with minimal\ninitialization overhead.

Post-training KV Cache\nquantization has emerged as a promising compression technique and has been\nextensively studied in short-context scenarios. However, directly applying\nexisting methods to long-CoT LLMs causes significant performance degradation\ndue to the following two reasons: (1) Large cumulative error: Existing methods\nfail to adequately leverage available memory, and they directly quantize the KV\nCache during each decoding step, leading to large cumulative quantization\nerror. (2) Short-context calibration: Due to Rotary Positional Embedding\n(RoPE), the use of short-context data during calibration fails to account for\nthe distribution of less frequent channels in the Key Cache, resulting in\nperformance loss. We propose Progressive Mixed-Precision KV Cache Quantization\n(PM-KVQ) for long-CoT LLMs to address the above issues in two folds: (1) To\nreduce cumulative error, we design a progressive quantization strategy to\ngradually lower the bit-width of KV Cache in each block. Then, we propose\nblock-wise memory allocation to assign a higher bit-width to more sensitive\ntransformer blocks. (2) To increase the calibration length without additional\noverhead, we propose a new calibration strategy with positional interpolation\nthat leverages short calibration data with positional interpolation to\napproximate the data distribution of long-context data.

To this end, we\nintroduce the Native-resolution diffusion Transformer (NiT), an architecture\ndesigned to explicitly model varying resolutions and aspect ratios within its\ndenoising process. Free from the constraints of fixed formats, NiT learns\nintrinsic visual distributions from images spanning a broad range of\nresolutions and aspect ratios. Notably, a single NiT model simultaneously\nachieves the state-of-the-art performance on both ImageNet-256x256 and 512x512\nbenchmarks. Surprisingly, akin to the robust zero-shot capabilities seen in\nadvanced large language models, NiT, trained solely on ImageNet, demonstrates\nexcellent zero-shot generalization performance.

Furthermore, we show that HardNet is expressive and retains the\nuniversal approximation capabilities of neural networks. We demonstrate the\nversatility and effectiveness of HardNet across various applications: learning\nwith piecewise constraints, learning optimization solvers with guaranteed\nfeasibility, and optimizing control policies in safety-critical systems."

This\nraises the question: do SAEs represent features that possess structure at odds\nwith their motivating hypothesis?

To answer these questions, we take a construction-based\napproach and re-contextualize the popular matching pursuits (MP) algorithm from\nsparse coding to design MP-SAE -- an SAE that unrolls its encoder into a\nsequence of residual-guided steps, allowing it to capture hierarchical and\nnonlinearly accessible features. Comparing this architecture with existing SAEs\non a mixture of synthetic and natural data settings, we show: (i) hierarchical\nconcepts induce conditionally orthogonal features, which existing SAEs are\nunable to faithfully capture, and (ii) the nonlinear encoding step of MP-SAE\nrecovers highly meaningful features, helping us unravel shared structure in the\nseemingly dichotomous representation spaces of different modalities in a\nvision-language model, hence demonstrating the assumption that useful features\nare solely linearly accessible is insufficient. We also show that the\nsequential encoder principle of MP-SAE affords an additional benefit of\nadaptive sparsity at inference time, which may be of independent interest.\nOverall, we argue our results provide credence to the idea that\ninterpretability should begin with the phenomenology of representations, with\nmethods emerging from assumptions that fit it.",

Adopting a novel CLIP-based\narchitecture, our framework aligns 100M+ POIs, nationwide remote sensing\nimagery, and structured demographic statistics with a billion-edge mobility\ngraph. By tokenizing spatial locations into grid cells inspired by Vision\nTransformers, we establish a unified representation space bridging mobility\npatterns and multimodal features. To rigorously evaluate the general-purpose\neffectiveness of MobCLIP, we construct a benchmark dataset composed of 11\ndownstream prediction tasks across social, economic, and natural domains.\nExperiments show that MobCLIP, with four input modalities and a compact\n128-dimensional representation space, achieves significantly superior\ngeneral-purpose predictive performances than state-of-the-art models by an\naverage of 35%. Thanks to the effective integration of human-centric\nmodalities, the performance gain is particularly profound in human-centric\ntasks, such as energy consumption (+260%), offline retail consumption amount\n(+98%), and crime cases (+95%) predictions.

Notably, ProbeX is the first\nprobing method specifically designed to learn from the weights of a single\nhidden model layer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ProbeX by predicting\nthe categories in a model's training dataset based only on its weights.\nExcitingly, ProbeX can map the weights of Stable Diffusion into a\nweight-language embedding space, enabling model search via text, i.e.,\nzero-shot model classification.",

While effective, these linear classifiers are\ncomputationally expensive, especially when dealing with larger models that have\nmany parameters. To address this, we introduce Probing Experts (ProbeX), a\ntheoretically motivated and lightweight method. Notably, ProbeX is the first\nprobing method specifically designed to learn from the weights of a single\nhidden model layer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ProbeX by predicting\nthe categories in a model's training dataset based only on its weights.\nExcitingly, ProbeX can map the weights of Stable Diffusion into a\nweight-language embedding space, enabling model search via text, i.e.,\nzero-shot model classification."

This paper\nintroduces a novel reflective multi-agent method designed to address these\nchallenges in the context of legally compliant persuasion. Our approach employs\nspecialized agents--a Factor Analyst and an Argument Polisher--in an iterative\nrefinement process to generate 3-ply legal arguments (plaintiff, defendant,\nrebuttal). We evaluate Reflective Multi-Agent against single-agent,\nenhanced-prompt single-agent, and non-reflective multi-agent baselines using\nfour diverse LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-4-Maverick-17b-128e,\nLlama-4-Scout-17b-16e) across three legal scenarios: \"arguable\", \"mismatched\",\nand \"non-arguable\". Results demonstrate Reflective Multi-Agent's significant\nsuperiority in successful abstention (preventing generation when arguments\ncannot be grounded), marked improvements in hallucination accuracy (reducing\nfabricated and misattributed factors), particularly in \"non-arguable\"\nscenarios, and enhanced factor utilization recall (improving the use of\nprovided case facts). These findings suggest that structured reflection within\na multi-agent framework offers a robust computable method for fostering ethical\npersuasion and mitigating manipulation in LLM-based legal argumentation\nsystems, a critical step towards trustworthy AI in law.

In this work, we introduce\nDyePack, a framework that leverages backdoor attacks to identify models that\nused benchmark test sets during training, without requiring access to the loss,\nlogits, or any internal details of the model. Like how banks mix dye packs with\ntheir money to mark robbers, DyePack mixes backdoor samples with the test data\nto flag models that trained on it. We propose a principled design incorporating\nmultiple backdoors with stochastic targets, enabling exact false positive rate\n(FPR) computation when flagging every model. This provably prevents false\naccusations while providing strong evidence for every detected case of\ncontamination. We evaluate DyePack on five models across three datasets,\ncovering both multiple-choice and open-ended generation tasks. For\nmultiple-choice questions, it successfully detects all contaminated models with\nguaranteed FPRs as low as 0.000073% on MMLU-Pro and 0.000017% on Big-Bench-Hard\nusing eight backdoors. For open-ended generation tasks, it generalizes well and\nidentifies all contaminated models on Alpaca with a guaranteed false positive\nrate of just 0.127% using six backdoors.",

Like how banks mix dye packs with\ntheir money to mark robbers, DyePack mixes backdoor samples with the test data\nto flag models that trained on it. We propose a principled design incorporating\nmultiple backdoors with stochastic targets, enabling exact false positive rate\n(FPR) computation when flagging every model. This provably prevents false\naccusations while providing strong evidence for every detected case of\ncontamination. We evaluate DyePack on five models across three datasets,\ncovering both multiple-choice and open-ended generation tasks. For\nmultiple-choice questions, it successfully detects all contaminated models with\nguaranteed FPRs as low as 0.000073% on MMLU-Pro and 0.000017% on Big-Bench-Hard\nusing eight backdoors. For open-ended generation tasks, it generalizes well and\nidentifies all contaminated models on Alpaca with a guaranteed false positive\nrate of just 0.127% using six backdoors."

However,\nwriting unit tests manually is laborious, especially for strong typed languages\nlike Java, motivating the need for automated approaches. Traditional methods\nprimarily rely on search-based or randomized algorithms to generate tests that\nachieve high code coverage and produce regression oracles, which are derived\nfrom the program's current behavior rather than its intended functionality.\nRecent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled oracle generation\nfrom natural language descriptions. However, existing LLM-based methods often\nrequire LLM fine-tuning or rely on external tools such as EvoSuite for test\nprefix generation.\n  In this work, we propose CANDOR, a novel end-to-end, prompt-based LLM\nframework for automated JUnit test generation. CANDOR orchestrates multiple\nspecialized LLM agents to generate JUnit tests, including both high-quality\ntest prefixes and accurate oracles. To mitigate the notorious hallucinations in\nLLMs, we introduce a novel strategy that engages multiple reasoning LLMs in a\npanel discussion and generate accurate oracles based on consensus.\nAdditionally, to reduce the verbosity of reasoning LLMs' outputs, we propose a\nnovel dual-LLM pipeline to produce concise and structured oracle evaluations.\n  Our experiments on the HumanEvalJava and LeetCodeJava datasets show that\nCANDOR can generate accurate oracles and is slightly better than EvoSuite in\ngenerating tests with high line coverage and clearly superior in terms of\nmutation score. Moreover, CANDOR significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art, prompt-based test generator LLM-Empirical, achieving\nimprovements of 15.8 to 25.1 percentage points in oracle correctness on both\ncorrect and faulty source code.

In addition, we introduce a\nflexible inference strategy termed Random Reordering Re-Construction (R3C),\nwhich is specifically adapted for diverse VRP tasks and further boosts the\nperformance of the multi-task model. Experimental results on 6 seen and 10\nunseen VRP variants with up to 1000 nodes indicate that our proposed method\nconsistently achieves superior performance on both uniform and real-world\nbenchmarks, demonstrating robust generalization abilities."

Given a set of sentences and the Beck's Depression\nInventory - II (BDI) questionnaire, participants were tasked with submitting up\nto 1,000 sentences per depression symptom in the BDI, sorted by relevance.\nParticipant submissions were evaluated according to standard Information\nRetrieval (IR) metrics, including Average Precision (AP) and R-Precision\n(R-PREC). The provided training data, however, consisted of sentences labeled\nas to whether a given sentence was relevant or not w.r.t. one of BDI's\nsymptoms. Due to this labeling limitation, we framed our development as a\nbinary classification task for each BDI symptom, and evaluated accordingly. To\nthat end, we split the available labeled data into training and validation\nsets, and explored foundation model fine-tuning, sentence similarity, Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) prompting, and ensemble techniques. The validation results\nrevealed that fine-tuning foundation models yielded the best performance,\nparticularly when enhanced with synthetic data to mitigate class imbalance. We\nalso observed that the optimal approach varied by symptom. Based on these\ninsights, we devised five independent test runs, two of which used ensemble\nmethods. These runs achieved the highest scores in the official IR evaluation,\noutperforming submissions from 16 other teams.",

We then demonstrate that RL-finetuned models, even after exhibiting\nperformance plateaus, can generate correct refinements on persistently failed\nproblems by leveraging natural language feedback in the form of critiques.\nBuilding on this insight, we propose Critique-GRPO, an online RL framework that\nintegrates both natural language and numerical feedback for effective policy\noptimization. Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn from initial responses and\ncritique-guided refinements simultaneously while maintaining exploration.\nExtensive experiments using Qwen2.5-7B-Base and Qwen3-8B-Base show that\nCritique-GRPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based\nfine-tuning approaches across eight challenging mathematical, STEM, and general\nreasoning tasks, improving average pass@1 scores by approximately 4.5% and 5%,\nrespectively. Notably, Critique-GRPO surpasses a strong baseline that\nincorporates expert demonstrations within online RL.

However, recent studies have shown that existing watermarking\nschemes are vulnerable to watermark removal and ambiguity attacks. Besides, the\nvague criteria for determining watermark presence further increase the\nlikelihood of such attacks. In this paper, we propose a secure DNN watermarking\nscheme named ChainMarks, which generates secure and robust watermarks by\nintroducing a cryptographic chain into the trigger inputs and utilizes a\ntwo-phase Monte Carlo method for determining watermark presence. First,\nChainMarks generates trigger inputs as a watermark dataset by repeatedly\napplying a hash function over a secret key, where the target labels associated\nwith trigger inputs are generated from the digital signature of model owner.\nThen, the watermarked model is produced by training a DNN over both the\noriginal and watermark datasets. To verify watermarks, we compare the predicted\nlabels of trigger inputs with the target labels and determine ownership with a\nmore accurate decision threshold that considers the classification probability\nof specific models. Experimental results show that ChainMarks exhibits higher\nlevels of robustness and security compared to state-of-the-art watermarking\nschemes. With a better marginal utility, ChainMarks provides a higher\nprobability guarantee of watermark presence in DNN models with the same level\nof watermark accuracy.",

Besides, the\nvague criteria for determining watermark presence further increase the\nlikelihood of such attacks. In this paper, we propose a secure DNN watermarking\nscheme named ChainMarks, which generates secure and robust watermarks by\nintroducing a cryptographic chain into the trigger inputs and utilizes a\ntwo-phase Monte Carlo method for determining watermark presence. First,\nChainMarks generates trigger inputs as a watermark dataset by repeatedly\napplying a hash function over a secret key, where the target labels associated\nwith trigger inputs are generated from the digital signature of model owner.\nThen, the watermarked model is produced by training a DNN over both the\noriginal and watermark datasets. To verify watermarks, we compare the predicted\nlabels of trigger inputs with the target labels and determine ownership with a\nmore accurate decision threshold that considers the classification probability\nof specific models. Experimental results show that ChainMarks exhibits higher\nlevels of robustness and security compared to state-of-the-art watermarking\nschemes. With a better marginal utility, ChainMarks provides a higher\nprobability guarantee of watermark presence in DNN models with the same level\nof watermark accuracy."

Using MAEBE with the Greatest\nGood Benchmark (and a novel double-inversion question technique), we\ndemonstrate that: (1) LLM moral preferences, particularly for Instrumental\nHarm, are surprisingly brittle and shift significantly with question framing,\nboth in single agents and ensembles. (2) The moral reasoning of LLM ensembles\nis not directly predictable from isolated agent behavior due to emergent group\ndynamics. (3) Specifically, ensembles exhibit phenomena like peer pressure\ninfluencing convergence, even when guided by a supervisor, highlighting\ndistinct safety and alignment challenges. Our findings underscore the necessity\nof evaluating AI systems in their interactive, multi-agent contexts."

This development,\ncombined with the rapid spread of AI-generated content online, creates a series\nof societal risks, particularly with the emergence of \"deep fakes\" that\nimpersonate real individuals. Watermarking, a technique that involves embedding\ninformation within images and other content to indicate their AI-generated\nnature, has emerged as a primary mechanism to address the risks posed by\nAI-generated content. Indeed, watermarking and AI labelling measures are now\nbecoming a legal requirement in many jurisdictions, including under the 2024\nEuropean Union AI Act. Despite the widespread use of AI image generation\nsystems, the current status of the implementation of such measures remains\nlargely unexamined. Moreover, the practical implications of the AI Act's\nwatermarking and labelling requirements have not previously been studied. The\npresent paper therefore both provides an empirical analysis of 50 widely used\nAI systems for image generation, embedded into a legal analysis of the AI Act.\nIn our legal analysis, we identify four categories of generative AI image\ndeployment scenarios relevant under the AI Act and outline how the legal\nobligations apply in each category. In our empirical analysis, we find that\nonly a minority number of AI image generators currently implement adequate\nwatermarking (38%) and deep fake labelling (8%) practices. In response, we\nsuggest a range of avenues of how the implementation of these legally mandated\ntechniques can be improved, and publicly share our tooling for the easy\ndetection of watermarks in images.",

However, code coverage metrics -- such as line and branch coverage\n-- remain overly emphasized in reported research, despite being weak indicators\nof a test suite's fault-detection capability. In contrast, \\textit{mutation\nscore} offers a more reliable and stringent measure, as demonstrated in our\nfindings where some test suites achieve 100\\% coverage but only 4\\% mutation\nscore. Although a few studies consider mutation score, the effectiveness of\nLLMs in killing mutants remains underexplored.\n  In this paper, we propose MUTGEN, a mutation-guided, LLM-based test\ngeneration approach that incorporates mutation feedback directly into the\nprompt. Evaluated on 204 subjects from two benchmarks, MUTGEN significantly\noutperforms both EvoSuite and vanilla prompt-based strategies in terms of\nmutation score. Furthermore, MUTGEN introduces an iterative generation\nmechanism that pushes the limits of LLMs in killing additional mutants. Our\nstudy also provide insights into the limitations of LLM-based generation,\nanalyzing the reasons for live and uncovered mutants, and the impact of\ndifferent mutation operators on generation effectiveness.",

                    "value": "Unit tests play a vital role in uncovering potential faults in software.\nWhile tools like EvoSuite focus on maximizing code coverage, recent advances in\nlarge language models (LLMs) have shifted attention toward LLM-based test\ngeneration. However, code coverage metrics -- such as line and branch coverage\n-- remain overly emphasized in reported research, despite being weak indicators\nof a test suite's fault-detection capability. In contrast, \\textit{mutation\nscore} offers a more reliable and stringent measure, as demonstrated in our\nfindings where some test suites achieve 100\\% coverage but only 4\\% mutation\nscore. Although a few studies consider mutation score, the effectiveness of\nLLMs in killing mutants remains underexplored.\n  In this paper, we propose MUTGEN, a mutation-guided, LLM-based test\ngeneration approach that incorporates mutation feedback directly into the\nprompt. Evaluated on 204 subjects from two benchmarks, MUTGEN significantly\noutperforms both EvoSuite and vanilla prompt-based strategies in terms of\nmutation score. Furthermore, MUTGEN introduces an iterative generation\nmechanism that pushes the limits of LLMs in killing additional mutants. Our\nstudy also provide insights into the limitations of LLM-based generation,\nanalyzing the reasons for live and uncovered mutants, and the impact of\ndifferent mutation operators on generation effectiveness."

The provided training data, however, consisted of sentences labeled\nas to whether a given sentence was relevant or not w.r.t. one of BDI's\nsymptoms. Due to this labeling limitation, we framed our development as a\nbinary classification task for each BDI symptom, and evaluated accordingly. To\nthat end, we split the available labeled data into training and validation\nsets, and explored foundation model fine-tuning, sentence similarity, Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) prompting, and ensemble techniques. The validation results\nrevealed that fine-tuning foundation models yielded the best performance,\nparticularly when enhanced with synthetic data to mitigate class imbalance. We\nalso observed that the optimal approach varied by symptom. Based on these\ninsights, we devised five independent test runs, two of which used ensemble\nmethods. These runs achieved the highest scores in the official IR evaluation,\noutperforming submissions from 16 other teams.",

By combining\nState Space Duality (SSD)'s temporal decay properties with a time-aware\nmodeling design, our model dynamically prioritizes key modality information,\novercoming limitations of Transformer-based approaches. The framework\nimplements a constrained two-stage process: (1) sequence-level cross-modal\nalignment via shared projection matrices, followed by (2) temporal fusion using\nour newly designed Cross-SSD module and dual-channel Fourier adaptive\nfiltering. This architecture maintains semantic consistency while suppressing\nnoise propagation.MMM4Rec achieves rapid fine-tuning convergence with simple\ncross-entropy loss, significantly improving multi-modal recommendation accuracy\nwhile maintaining strong transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nMMM4Rec's state-of-the-art performance, achieving the maximum 31.78% NDCG@10\nimprovement over existing models and exhibiting 10 times faster average\nconvergence speed when transferring to large-scale downstream datasets."

In this work, we propose a novel jailbreak\nparadigm, Simple Assistive Task Linkage (SATA), which can effectively\ncircumvent LLM safeguards and elicit harmful responses. Specifically, SATA\nfirst masks harmful keywords within a malicious query to generate a relatively\nbenign query containing one or multiple [MASK] special tokens. It then employs\na simple assistive task such as a masked language model task or an element\nlookup by position task to encode the semantics of the masked keywords.\nFinally, SATA links the assistive task with the masked query to jointly perform\nthe jailbreak. Extensive experiments show that SATA achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance and outperforms baselines by a large margin.

Current methods for improvement typically rely on\nsplitting long contexts into fixed-length chunks. However, fixed truncation\nrisks separating semantically relevant content, leading to ambiguity and\ncompromising accurate understanding. To overcome this limitation, we propose a\nstraightforward approach for dynamically separating and selecting chunks of\nlong context, facilitating a more streamlined input for LLMs. In particular, we\ncompute semantic similarities between adjacent sentences, using lower\nsimilarities to adaptively divide long contexts into variable-length chunks. We\nfurther train a question-aware classifier to select sensitive chunks that are\ncritical for answering specific questions. Experimental results on both\nsingle-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks show that the proposed\napproach consistently outperforms strong baselines. Notably, it maintains\nrobustness across a wide range of input lengths, handling sequences of up to\n256k tokens.

Current methods for improvement typically rely on\nsplitting long contexts into fixed-length chunks. However, fixed truncation\nrisks separating semantically relevant content, leading to ambiguity and\ncompromising accurate understanding. To overcome this limitation, we propose a\nstraightforward approach for dynamically separating and selecting chunks of\nlong context, facilitating a more streamlined input for LLMs. In particular, we\ncompute semantic similarities between adjacent sentences, using lower\nsimilarities to adaptively divide long contexts into variable-length chunks. We\nfurther train a question-aware classifier to select sensitive chunks that are\ncritical for answering specific questions. Experimental results on both\nsingle-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks show that the proposed\napproach consistently outperforms strong baselines. Notably, it maintains\nrobustness across a wide range of input lengths, handling sequences of up to\n256k tokens.

To\novercome this issue, we utilize the fact that LLM output is invariant under\ncertain orthogonal transformations of weight matrices. This insight can be\nleveraged to identify transformations that significantly improve the\ncompressibility of weights within structured classes. The proposed approach is\napplicable to various types of structured matrices that support efficient\nprojection operations. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/GrishKate/ProcrustesGPT",

This paper presents a systematic empirical study to\ninvestigate the fine-grained data contamination on code intelligence tasks. Our\nstudy involves diverse representative PLMs, namely RoBERTa and GPT-2, and LLMs,\nnamely LLaMA and StarCoder, covering three major tasks: code translation, code\ngeneration, and code summarization. We categorize contamination scenarios into\nfour types according to the code intelligence practice, namely input-only,\noutput-only, unpaired, and paired contamination settings, and construct\ncorresponding experimental and control groups for exploration.\n  Experimental results show that, under the pre-training, fine-tuning, and\ninference paradigm adopted by PLMs, even deliberately injecting paired\ncontamination does not lead to significant performance overestimation. But\ndirect inference or small-scale fine-tuning uncovers the contamination effects.\nIn contrast, LLMs with pre-training and inference paradigm are significantly\naffected by the paired contamination. Apart from the above, other contamination\nscenarios have no impact on both PLMs and LLMs. Our findings challenge the\nconventional belief that contamination inevitably leads to performance\noverestimation, providing new insights into the evaluation and deployment of\ncode intelligence models.",

A key question that now preoccupies\nthe AI community concerns the capabilities and limitations of these models,\nwith trustworthiness emerging as a central issue, particularly as LLMs are\nincreasingly applied in sensitive fields like healthcare and finance, where\nerrors can have serious consequences. However, most previous studies on the\ntrustworthiness of LLMs have been limited to a single language, typically the\npredominant one in the dataset, such as English. In response to the growing\nglobal deployment of LLMs, we introduce XTRUST, the first comprehensive\nmultilingual trustworthiness benchmark. XTRUST encompasses a diverse range of\ntopics, including illegal activities, hallucination, out-of-distribution (OOD)\nrobustness, physical and mental health, toxicity, fairness, misinformation,\nprivacy, and machine ethics, across 10 different languages. Using XTRUST, we\nconduct an empirical evaluation of the multilingual trustworthiness of five\nwidely used LLMs, offering an in-depth analysis of their performance across\nlanguages and tasks. Our results indicate that many LLMs struggle with certain\nlow-resource languages, such as Arabic and Russian, highlighting the\nconsiderable room for improvement in the multilingual trustworthiness of\ncurrent language models. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/LluckyYH/XTRUST.",
