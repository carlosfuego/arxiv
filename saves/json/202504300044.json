Such storage inefficiency delivers poor serving performance under high\nrequest rates.\n  In this paper, we identify that the advantage of the disaggregated system\nlies in the disaggregated computation, i.e., partitioning the computational\nresource to enable the asynchronous computation of two phases. Thus, we propose\na novel LLM serving system, semi-PD, characterized by disaggregated computation\nand unified storage. In semi-PD, we introduce a computation resource controller\nto achieve disaggregated computation at the streaming multi-processor (SM)\nlevel, and a unified memory manager to manage the asynchronous memory access\nfrom both phases. semi-PD has a low-overhead resource adjustment mechanism\nbetween the two phases, and a service-level objective (SLO) aware dynamic\npartitioning algorithm to optimize the SLO attainment. Compared to\nstate-of-the-art systems, semi-PD maintains lower latency at higher request\nrates, reducing the average end-to-end latency per request by 1.27-2.58x on\nDeepSeek series models, and serves 1.55-1.72x more requests adhering to latency\nconstraints on Llama series models.",

In this paper, we show new types of side channels\nthrough the file system that break this logical isolation. The file system\nplays a critical role in the operating system, managing all I/O activities\nbetween the application layer and the physical storage device. We observe that\nthe file system implementation is shared, leading to timing leakage when using\ncommon I/O system calls. Specifically, we found that modern operating systems\ntake advantage of any flush operation (which saves cached blocks in memory to\nthe SSD or disk) to flush all of the I/O buffers, even those used by other\nisolation domains. Thus, by measuring the delay of syncfs, the attacker can\ninfer the I/O behavior of victim programs. We then demonstrate a syncfs covert\nchannel attack on multiple file systems, including both Linux native file\nsystems and the Windows file system, achieving a maximum bandwidth of 5 Kbps\nwith an error rate of 0.15% on Linux and 7.6 Kbps with an error rate of 1.9% on\nWindows. In addition, we construct three side-channel attacks targeting both\nLinux and Android devices. On Linux devices, we implement a website\nfingerprinting attack and a video fingerprinting attack by tracking the write\npatterns of temporary buffering files. On Android devices, we design an\napplication fingerprinting attack that leaks application write patterns during\nboot-up. The attacks achieve over 90% F1 score, precision, and recall. Finally,\nwe demonstrate that these attacks can be exploited across containers\nimplementing a container detection technique and a cross-container covert\nchannel attack.",

While HBM-based acceleration offers high bandwidth, its\ncapacity remains constrained. Offloading data to host-side DIMMs improves\ncapacity but introduces costly data swapping overhead. We identify that the\ncritical memory bottleneck lies in the decoding phase of multi-head attention\n(MHA) exclusively, which demands substantial capacity for storing KV caches and\nhigh bandwidth for attention computation. Our key insight reveals this\noperation uniquely aligns with modern DIMM-based processing-in-memory (PIM)\narchitectures, which offers scalability of both capacity and bandwidth.\n  Based on this observation and insight, we propose L3, a hardware-software\nco-designed system integrating DIMM-PIM and GPU devices. L3 introduces three\ninnovations: First, hardware redesigns resolve data layout mismatches and\ncomputational element mismatches in DIMM-PIM, enhancing LLM inference\nutilization. Second, communication optimization enables hiding the data\ntransfer overhead with the computation. Third, an adaptive scheduler\ncoordinates GPU-DIMM-PIM operations to maximize parallelism between devices.\nEvaluations using real-world traces show L3 achieves up to 6.1$\\times$ speedup\nover state-of-the-art HBM-PIM solutions while significantly improving batch\nsizes.",

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly require processing long text\nsequences, but GPU memory limitations force difficult trade-offs between memory\ncapacity and bandwidth. While HBM-based acceleration offers high bandwidth, its\ncapacity remains constrained. Offloading data to host-side DIMMs improves\ncapacity but introduces costly data swapping overhead. We identify that the\ncritical memory bottleneck lies in the decoding phase of multi-head attention\n(MHA) exclusively, which demands substantial capacity for storing KV caches and\nhigh bandwidth for attention computation. Our key insight reveals this\noperation uniquely aligns with modern DIMM-based processing-in-memory (PIM)\narchitectures, which offers scalability of both capacity and bandwidth.\n  Based on this observation and insight, we propose L3, a hardware-software\nco-designed system integrating DIMM-PIM and GPU devices. L3 introduces three\ninnovations: First, hardware redesigns resolve data layout mismatches and\ncomputational element mismatches in DIMM-PIM, enhancing LLM inference\nutilization. Second, communication optimization enables hiding the data\ntransfer overhead with the computation. Third, an adaptive scheduler\ncoordinates GPU-DIMM-PIM operations to maximize parallelism between devices.\nEvaluations using real-world traces show L3 achieves up to 6.1$\\times$ speedup\nover state-of-the-art HBM-PIM solutions while significantly improving batch\nsizes."

Edge\ncaching, which caches AR objects closer to the user, provides a promising\nsolution. However, existing edge caching approaches do not consider AR-specific\nfeatures such as AR object sizes, user interactions, and physical location.\nThis paper investigates how to further optimize edge caching by employing\nAR-aware prefetching techniques. We present SPAARC, a Spatial Proximity and\nAssociation-based Prefetching policy specifically designed for MAR Caches.\nSPAARC intelligently prioritizes the caching of virtual objects based on their\nassociation with other similar objects and the user's proximity to them. It\nalso considers the recency of associations and uses a lazy fetching strategy to\nefficiently manage edge resources and maximize Quality of Experience (QoE).\n  Through extensive evaluation using both synthetic and real-world workloads,\nwe demonstrate that SPAARC significantly improves cache hit rates compared to\nstandard caching algorithms, achieving gains ranging from 3% to 40% while\nreducing the need for on-demand data retrieval from the cloud. Further, we\npresent an adaptive tuning algorithm that automatically tunes SPAARC parameters\nto achieve optimal performance.

                "summary": "The efficiency of Large Language Model~(LLM) inference is often constrained\nby substantial memory bandwidth and capacity demands. Existing techniques, such\nas pruning, quantization, and mixture of experts/depth, reduce memory capacity\nand/or bandwidth consumption at the cost of slight degradation in inference\nquality. This paper introduces a design solution that further alleviates memory\nbottlenecks by enhancing the on-chip memory controller in AI accelerators to\nachieve two main objectives: (1) significantly reducing memory capacity and\nbandwidth usage through lossless block compression~(e.g., LZ4 and ZSTD) of\nmodel weights and key-value (KV) cache without compromising inference quality,\nand (2) enabling memory bandwidth and energy consumption to scale\nproportionally with context-dependent dynamic quantization. These goals are\naccomplished by equipping the on-chip memory controller with mechanisms to\nimprove fine-grained bit-level accessibility and compressibility of weights and\nKV cache through LLM-aware configuration of in-memory placement and\nrepresentation.

                    "value": "The efficiency of Large Language Model~(LLM) inference is often constrained\nby substantial memory bandwidth and capacity demands. Existing techniques, such\nas pruning, quantization, and mixture of experts/depth, reduce memory capacity\nand/or bandwidth consumption at the cost of slight degradation in inference\nquality. This paper introduces a design solution that further alleviates memory\nbottlenecks by enhancing the on-chip memory controller in AI accelerators to\nachieve two main objectives: (1) significantly reducing memory capacity and\nbandwidth usage through lossless block compression~(e.g., LZ4 and ZSTD) of\nmodel weights and key-value (KV) cache without compromising inference quality,\nand (2) enabling memory bandwidth and energy consumption to scale\nproportionally with context-dependent dynamic quantization. These goals are\naccomplished by equipping the on-chip memory controller with mechanisms to\nimprove fine-grained bit-level accessibility and compressibility of weights and\nKV cache through LLM-aware configuration of in-memory placement and\nrepresentation. Experimental results on publicly available LLMs demonstrate the\neffectiveness of this approach, showing memory footprint reductions of 25.2\\%\nfor model weights and 46.9\\% for KV cache.

Specifically, we convert half of the attention heads to nearly\nfree streaming heads in both the prefilling and decoding stages. Additionally,\nwe find that only a constant number of KV pages is required to preserve\nlong-context and reasoning capabilities, irrespective of context length. We\nthen design a hierarchical KV page selection policy that dynamically prunes KV\npages based on query-centric similarity. On average, LServe accelerates LLM\nprefilling by up to 2.9x and decoding by 1.3-2.1x over vLLM, maintaining\nlong-context accuracy. Code is released at\nhttps://github.com/mit-han-lab/omniserve."

However,\nexisting simulators lack the fidelity to model these heterogeneous,\nmulti-engine workflows, limiting their ability to inform architectural\ndecisions.\n  To address this gap, we introduce HERMES, a Heterogeneous Multi-stage LLM\ninference Execution Simulator. HERMES models diverse request stages; including\nRAG, KV retrieval, reasoning, prefill, and decode across complex hardware\nhierarchies. HERMES supports heterogeneous clients executing multiple models\nconcurrently unlike prior frameworks while incorporating advanced batching\nstrategies and multi-level memory hierarchies. By integrating real hardware\ntraces with analytical modeling, HERMES captures critical trade-offs such as\nmemory bandwidth contention, inter-cluster communication latency, and batching\nefficiency in hybrid CPU-accelerator deployments. Through case studies, we\nexplore the impact of reasoning stages on end-to-end latency, optimal batching\nstrategies for hybrid pipelines, and the architectural implications of remote\nKV cache retrieval. HERMES empowers system designers to navigate the evolving\nlandscape of LLM inference, providing actionable insights into optimizing\nhardware-software co-design for next-generation AI workloads."

Numerous recent approaches like\nLinformer, Longformer, Performer, and Structured state space models (SSMs).,\nhave not fully resolved this problem. All these models strive to reduce the\nquadratic time complexity of the attention mechanism while minimizing the loss\nin quality due to the effective compression of the long context. Inspired by\nthe cache and virtual memory principle in computers, where in case of a cache\nmiss, not only the needed data is retrieved from the memory, but the adjacent\ndata is also obtained, we apply this concept to handling long contexts by\ndividing it into small segments. In our design, we retrieve the nearby segments\nin an uncompressed form when high segment-level attention occurs at the\ncompressed level. Our en-hancements for handling long context include\naggregating four attention mechanisms consisting of short sliding window\nattention, long compressed segmented attention, dynamically retrieving top k\nhigh attention uncompressed segments, and overlapping segments in long segment\nattention to avoid segment fragmentation. These enhancements result in an\narchitecture that outperforms ex-isting SOTA architectures with an average\nperplexity improvement of 8.5% over similar model sizes.",

Numerous recent approaches like\nLinformer, Longformer, Performer, and Structured state space models (SSMs).,\nhave not fully resolved this problem. All these models strive to reduce the\nquadratic time complexity of the attention mechanism while minimizing the loss\nin quality due to the effective compression of the long context. Inspired by\nthe cache and virtual memory principle in computers, where in case of a cache\nmiss, not only the needed data is retrieved from the memory, but the adjacent\ndata is also obtained, we apply this concept to handling long contexts by\ndividing it into small segments. In our design, we retrieve the nearby segments\nin an uncompressed form when high segment-level attention occurs at the\ncompressed level. Our en-hancements for handling long context include\naggregating four attention mechanisms consisting of short sliding window\nattention, long compressed segmented attention, dynamically retrieving top k\nhigh attention uncompressed segments, and overlapping segments in long segment\nattention to avoid segment fragmentation. These enhancements result in an\narchitecture that outperforms ex-isting SOTA architectures with an average\nperplexity improvement of 8.5% over similar model sizes."

We demonstrate that FAR achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in both short- and long-video generation, providing a simple yet\neffective baseline for video autoregressive modeling.

We\npropose Memory-efficient Offloaded Mini-sequence Inference (MOM), a method that\npartitions critical layers into smaller \"mini-sequences\" and integrates\nseamlessly with KV cache offloading. Experiments on various Llama, Qwen, and\nMistral models demonstrate that MOM reduces peak memory usage by over 50\\% on\naverage. On Meta-Llama-3.2-8B, MOM extends the maximum context length from 155k\nto 455k tokens on a single A100 80GB GPU, while keeping outputs identical and\nnot compromising accuracy.

We\npropose Memory-efficient Offloaded Mini-sequence Inference (MOM), a method that\npartitions critical layers into smaller \"mini-sequences\" and integrates\nseamlessly with KV cache offloading. Experiments on various Llama, Qwen, and\nMistral models demonstrate that MOM reduces peak memory usage by over 50\\% on\naverage. On Meta-Llama-3.2-8B, MOM extends the maximum context length from 155k\nto 455k tokens on a single A100 80GB GPU, while keeping outputs identical and\nnot compromising accuracy.

We also introduce a disk-based shared KV cache management system, called\nShared RAG-DCache, for multi-instance LLM RAG service environments. This\nsystem, together with an optimal system configuration, improves both throughput\nand latency under given resource constraints. Shared RAG-DCache exploits the\nlocality of documents related to user queries in RAG, as well as the queueing\ndelay in LLM inference services. It proactively generates and stores disk KV\ncaches for query-related documents and shares them across multiple LLM\ninstances to enhance inference performance. In experiments on a single host\nequipped with 2 GPUs and 1 CPU, Shared RAG-DCache achieved a 15~71% increase in\nthroughput and up to a 12~65% reduction in latency, depending on the resource\nconfiguration.",

It proactively generates and stores disk KV\ncaches for query-related documents and shares them across multiple LLM\ninstances to enhance inference performance. In experiments on a single host\nequipped with 2 GPUs and 1 CPU, Shared RAG-DCache achieved a 15~71% increase in\nthroughput and up to a 12~65% reduction in latency, depending on the resource\nconfiguration."

To raise awareness of this problem, we study an interaction between\ntwo state-of-the art defenses in this paper, timing obfuscations of remote\ncache lines (TORC) and delaying speculative changes to remote cache lines\n(DSRC). TORC mitigates cache-hit based attacks and DSRC mitigates speculative\ncoherence state change attacks.\n  We observe that DSRC enables coherence information to be retrieved into the\nprocessor core, where it is out of the reach of timing obfuscations to protect.\nThis creates an unforeseen consequence that redo operations can be triggered\nwithin the core to detect the presence or absence of remote cache lines, which\nconstitutes a security vulnerability. We demonstrate that a new covert channel\nattack is possible using this vulnerability. We propose two ways to mitigate\nthe attack, whose performance varies depending on an application's cache usage.\nOne way is to never send remote exclusive coherence state (E) information to\nthe core even if it is created. The other way is to never create a remote E\nstate, which is responsible for triggering redos.\n  We demonstrate the timing difference caused by this microarchitectural\ndefense assumption violation using GEM5 simulations.

In RAG scenarios, by defining each passage\nas a block, Block-attention enables us to reuse the KV states of passages that\nhave been seen before, thereby significantly reducing the latency and the\ncomputation overhead during inference. The implementation of Block-attention\ninvolves block segmentation, position re-encoding, and fine-tuning the LLM to\nadapt to the Block-attention mechanism.

It is well known that both DL- and\nFL-SOTs originate from the SOT-material and DL-SOT dominates the current-driven\nswitching process while FL-SOT contributes limitedly, resulting in an\nincubation time (several nanoseconds) during collinear magnetization switching\nwith the spin polarization because of the DL attributes. Here we report a\nFL-SOT originated from the ferromagnet, different from the origin of DL-SOT,\nand demonstrate that it dominates the collinear magnetization switching. We\nshow that the FL-SOT and resultant collinear switching can be modulated, one\norder of magnitude and sign reversal, by controlling the ferromagnet. Because\nof no incubation time and higher charge-to-spin efficiencies in the FL\nswitching, we further show that the switching time can be down to 200 ps with\none order lower critical switching current density compared to DL switching.\nThese results indicate that the FL switching may provide a practical solution\nfor magnetic memory in speed-priority cache applications.",

It is well known that both DL- and\nFL-SOTs originate from the SOT-material and DL-SOT dominates the current-driven\nswitching process while FL-SOT contributes limitedly, resulting in an\nincubation time (several nanoseconds) during collinear magnetization switching\nwith the spin polarization because of the DL attributes. Here we report a\nFL-SOT originated from the ferromagnet, different from the origin of DL-SOT,\nand demonstrate that it dominates the collinear magnetization switching. We\nshow that the FL-SOT and resultant collinear switching can be modulated, one\norder of magnitude and sign reversal, by controlling the ferromagnet. Because\nof no incubation time and higher charge-to-spin efficiencies in the FL\nswitching, we further show that the switching time can be down to 200 ps with\none order lower critical switching current density compared to DL switching.\nThese results indicate that the FL switching may provide a practical solution\nfor magnetic memory in speed-priority cache applications."

This\ndesign reduces token count by 22x over existing methods in representing one\nhour of long-term observations while effectively encoding fine-granularity of\nthe present. By interleaving these tokens in our multimodal cache, ProVideLLM\nensures sub-linear scaling of memory and compute with video length, enabling\nper-frame streaming inference at 10 FPS and streaming dialogue at 25 FPS, with\na minimal 2GB GPU memory footprint.

We test our approach with Llama 3.2 1B (draft) and Llama 3.1 8B\n(target) models on zero-shot GSM8K reasoning, where it achieves up to 1.5x more\naccepted tokens per verification cycle with under 1% degradation in answer\naccuracy compared to standard speculative decoding and over 2x with small loss\nin accuracy. When applied to the LiveCodeBench benchmark, our approach\nautomatically detects other, programming-specific important tokens and shows\nsimilar speedups, demonstrating its ability to generalize across tasks."

These challenges arise from the considerable manual coding effort\nrequired, repetitive manual execution of multiple EDA tools, and the need for\nin-depth domain expertise to navigate complex designs.Here, we present UVM^2,\nan automated verification framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs)\nto generate UVM testbenches and iteratively refine them using coverage\nfeedback, significantly reducing manual effort while maintaining rigorous\nverification standards.To evaluate UVM^2, we introduce a benchmark suite\ncomprising Register Transfer Level (RTL) designs of up to 1.6K lines of\ncode.The results show that UVM^2 reduces testbench setup time by up to UVM^2\ncompared to experienced engineers, and achieve average code and function\ncoverage of 87.44% and 89.58%, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions by\n20.96% and 23.51%, respectively."

Here, we present the\nemission surfaces of the exoALMA sources in $^{12}$CO $J=3-2$, $^{13}$CO\n$J=3-2$, and CS $J=7-6$.

Additionally, we search for substructure in the\nsurfaces and radial intensity profiles; we find evidence of localized\nsubstructure in the emission surfaces and peak intensity profiles of nearly\nevery disk, with this substructure often being co-incident between molecular\ntracers, intensity profiles, and kinematic perturbations.

Hardware accelerators are being explored to further enhance their\nperformance, but current solutions are often limited by application specificity\nand the latency of encoding and similarity search. This paper presents a\ngeneralized, reconfigurable on-chip training and inference architecture for\nHDC, utilizing spin-orbit-torque magnetic random access memory (SOT-MRAM) based\ncontent-addressable memory (SOT-CAM). The proposed SOT-CAM array integrates\nstorage and computation, enabling in-memory execution of key HDC operations:\nbinding (bitwise multiplication), permutation (bit shfiting), and efficient\nsimilarity search. Furthermore, a novel bit drop method-based permutation\nbacked by holographic information representation of HDC is proposed which\nreplaces conventional permutation execution in hardware resulting in a 6x\nlatency improvement, and an HDC-specific adder reduces energy and area by 1.51X\nand 1.43x, respectively. To mitigate the parasitic effect of interconnects in\nthe similarity search, a four-stage voltage scaling scheme has been proposed to\nensure an accurate representation of the Hamming distance. Benchmarked at 7nm,\nthe architecture achieves energy reductions of 21.5x, 552.74x, 1.45x, and\n282.57x for addition, permutation, multiplication, and search operations,\nrespectively, compared to CMOS-based HDC. Against state-of-the-art HDC\naccelerators, it achieves a 2.27x lower energy consumption and outperforms CPU\nand eGPU implementations by 2702x and 23161x, respectively, with less than 3%\ndrop in accuracy.",

The\nlimitation stems from SDS's inherent accumulation of view-independent biases\nduring optimization, which progressively diverges from the ideal text alignment\ndirection.

Additionally, we introduce an LLM-layout\ninitialization that significantly accelerates optimization convergence through\nsemantic-aware spatial configuration. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate\nthat our framework, CoherenDream, establishes state-of-the-art performance in\ntext-aligned 3D generation across multiple benchmarks, including T$^3$Bench and\nTIFA subset.

For this setting,\nwe provide a modified algorithm, DiSC-UCB2, and we show that the modified\nalgorithm achieves the same regret and communication bounds. We empirically\nvalidated the performance of our algorithm on synthetic data and real-world\nMovielens-100K data."

However, existing approaches using LLMs face limitations in\ngrounding their outputs within the physical environment and aligning with the\ncapabilities of the robot. This challenge becomes even more pronounced with\nsmaller language models, which are more computationally efficient but less\nrobust in task planning and execution. In this paper, we present a novel\nmodular architecture designed to enhance the robustness of LLM-driven robotics\nby addressing these grounding and alignment issues. We formalize the task\nplanning problem within a goal-conditioned POMDP framework, identify key\nfailure modes in LLM-driven planning, and propose targeted design principles to\nmitigate these issues. Our architecture introduces an ``expected outcomes''\nmodule to prevent mischaracterization of subgoals and a feedback mechanism to\nenable real-time error recovery. Experimental results, both in simulation and\non physical robots, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves task\nsuccess rates for pick-and-place and manipulation tasks compared to both larger\nLLMs and standard baselines. Through hardware experiments, we also demonstrate\nhow our architecture can be run efficiently and locally. This work highlights\nthe potential of smaller, locally-executable LLMs in robotics and provides a\nscalable, efficient solution for robust task execution.",

However, due to the lack of\nsystematic integration and utilization of knowledge, existing PIDSes still\nrequire significant manual intervention for practical deployment, making full\nautomation challenging. This paper presents a disruptive innovation by\ncategorizing PIDSes according to the types of knowledge they utilize. In\nresponse to the prevalent issue of ``knowledge silos problem'' in existing\nresearch, we introduce a novel knowledge-driven provenance-based intrusion\ndetection framework, powered by large language models (LLMs). We also present\nOmniSec, a best practice system built upon this framework. By integrating\nattack representation knowledge, threat intelligence knowledge, and benign\nbehavior knowledge, OmniSec outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on\npublic benchmark datasets. OmniSec is available online at\nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/PIDS-with-LLM-613B."

                "summary": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the preferred models for node\nclassification in graph data due to their robust capabilities in integrating\ngraph structures and attributes. However, these models heavily depend on a\nsubstantial amount of high-quality labeled data for training, which is often\ncostly to obtain. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), a promising\napproach is to utilize their exceptional zero-shot capabilities and extensive\nknowledge for node labeling. Despite encouraging results, this approach either\nrequires numerous queries to LLMs or suffers from reduced performance due to\nnoisy labels generated by LLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce\nLocle, an active self-training framework that does Label-free node\nClassification with LLMs cost-Effectively. Locle iteratively identifies small\nsets of \"critical\" samples using GNNs and extracts informative pseudo-labels\nfor them with both LLMs and GNNs, serving as additional supervision signals to\nenhance model training. Specifically, Locle comprises three key components: (i)\nan effective active node selection strategy for initial annotations; (ii) a\ncareful sample selection scheme to identify \"critical\" nodes based on label\ndisharmonicity and entropy; and (iii) a label refinement module that combines\nLLMs and GNNs with a rewired topology. Extensive experiments on five benchmark\ntext-attributed graph datasets demonstrate that Locle significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods under the same query budget to LLMs in terms of\nlabel-free node classification. Notably, on the DBLP dataset with 14.3k nodes,\nLocle achieves an 8.08% improvement in accuracy over the state-of-the-art at a\ncost of less than one cent.

As environments and tasks become\ncomplicated, the need to embed higher intelligence to infer from the\nsurroundings and act on them has become necessary. Although most methods\nutilize techniques to estimate grasp pose by treating the problem via pure\nsampling-based approaches in the six-degree-of-freedom space or as a learning\nproblem, they usually fail in real-life settings owing to poor generalization\nacross domains. In addition, the time taken to generate the grasp plan and the\nlack of repeatability, owing to sampling inefficiency and the probabilistic\nnature of existing grasp planning approaches, severely limits their application\nin real-world tasks. This paper presents a lightweight analytical approach\ntowards robotic grasp planning, particularly antipodal grasps, with little to\nno sampling in the six-degree-of-freedom space. The proposed grasp planning\nalgorithm is formulated as an optimization problem towards estimating grasp\npoints on the object surface instead of directly estimating the end-effector\npose. To this extent, a soft-region-growing algorithm is presented for\neffective plane segmentation, even in the case of curved surfaces. An\noptimization-based quality metric is then used for the evaluation of grasp\npoints to ensure indirect force closure. The proposed grasp framework is\ncompared with the existing state-of-the-art grasp planning approach, Grasp pose\ndetection (GPD), as a baseline over multiple simulated objects. The\neffectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison to GPD is also evaluated\nin a real-world setting using image and point-cloud data, with the planned\ngrasps being executed using a ROBOTIQ gripper and UR5 manipulator.",

Although most methods\nutilize techniques to estimate grasp pose by treating the problem via pure\nsampling-based approaches in the six-degree-of-freedom space or as a learning\nproblem, they usually fail in real-life settings owing to poor generalization\nacross domains. In addition, the time taken to generate the grasp plan and the\nlack of repeatability, owing to sampling inefficiency and the probabilistic\nnature of existing grasp planning approaches, severely limits their application\nin real-world tasks. This paper presents a lightweight analytical approach\ntowards robotic grasp planning, particularly antipodal grasps, with little to\nno sampling in the six-degree-of-freedom space. The proposed grasp planning\nalgorithm is formulated as an optimization problem towards estimating grasp\npoints on the object surface instead of directly estimating the end-effector\npose. To this extent, a soft-region-growing algorithm is presented for\neffective plane segmentation, even in the case of curved surfaces. An\noptimization-based quality metric is then used for the evaluation of grasp\npoints to ensure indirect force closure. The proposed grasp framework is\ncompared with the existing state-of-the-art grasp planning approach, Grasp pose\ndetection (GPD), as a baseline over multiple simulated objects. The\neffectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison to GPD is also evaluated\nin a real-world setting using image and point-cloud data, with the planned\ngrasps being executed using a ROBOTIQ gripper and UR5 manipulator."

Our approach\ncombines traditional natural language processing and machine learning\ntechniques implemented in the Annif toolkit with innovative LLM-based methods\nfor translation and synthetic data generation, and merging predictions from\nmonolingual models. The system ranked first in the all-subjects category and\nsecond in the tib-core-subjects category in the quantitative evaluation, and\nfourth in qualitative evaluations. These findings demonstrate the potential of\ncombining traditional XMTC algorithms with modern LLM techniques to improve the\naccuracy and efficiency of subject indexing in multilingual contexts.",

The task\nrequired creating subject predictions for bibliographic records from the\nbilingual TIBKAT database using the GND subject vocabulary. Our approach\ncombines traditional natural language processing and machine learning\ntechniques implemented in the Annif toolkit with innovative LLM-based methods\nfor translation and synthetic data generation, and merging predictions from\nmonolingual models. The system ranked first in the all-subjects category and\nsecond in the tib-core-subjects category in the quantitative evaluation, and\nfourth in qualitative evaluations. These findings demonstrate the potential of\ncombining traditional XMTC algorithms with modern LLM techniques to improve the\naccuracy and efficiency of subject indexing in multilingual contexts."

While the role of supermassive\nblack holes is well studied, the effects of stellar-mass black holes on their\nsurroundings, particularly in inducing structures in the interstellar medium\n(ISM), remain under explored.\n  This study focuses on the black hole X-ray binary GRS 1915+105, renowned for\nits active jets, and the primary aim is to unveil and characterise the impact\nof GRS 1915+105 on its environment by identifying structures induced by jet-ISM\ninteraction. Methods: We observed GRS 1915+105 with MeerKAT for a total\nexposure time of 14~hr, and we obtained the deepest image of GRS 1915+105 to\ndate. Using a previously proposed self-similar model for large-scale jets, we\ninferred the properties of both the jets and the ISM, providing insights into\nthe jet-ISM interaction site.\n  Our observations revealed a bow shock structure near GRS 1915+105, likely\ninduced by a jet interacting with the ISM and blowing an overpressured cavity\nin the medium. We constrained the ISM density to 100--160 particles\\,cm$^{-3}$\nwhile assuming a temperature range of 10$^4$--10$^6$\\,K, which implies a bow\nshock expansion velocity of $20\\,{\\rm km\\,s}^{-1}<\\dot{L} <\\,360\\,{\\rm\nkm\\,s}^{-1}$. We estimate that the jet responsible for the formation of the bow\nshock has an age between 0.09 and 0.22 Myr, and the time-averaged energy rate\nConclusions: Our results confirm that in stellar-mass black holes, the energy\ndissipated through jets can be comparable to the accretion energy, and through\nthe interaction of the jet with the ISM, such energy is transferred back to the\nenvironment.\n  This feedback mechanism mirrors the powerful influence of supermassive black\nholes on their environments, underscoring the significant role a black hole's\nactivity has in shaping its surroundings.",

                "summary": "While delta Scuti stars are the most numerous class of kappa-mechanism\npulsators in the instability strip, the short periods and small peak-to-peak\namplitudes have left them understudied and underutilized. Recently, large-scale\ntime-domain surveys have significantly increased the number of identified delta\nScuti stars. Notably, the Tsinghua University-Ma Huateng Telescopes for Survey\n(TMTS), with its high-cadence observations at 1-minute intervals, has\nidentified thousands of delta Scuti stars, greatly expanding the sample of\nthese short-period pulsating variables. Using the delta Scuti stars from the\nTMTS catalogs of Periodic Variable Stars, we cross-matched the dataset with\nPan-STARRS1, 2MASS, and WISE to obtain photometric measurements across optical\nand infrared bands. Parallax data, used as Bayesian priors, were retrieved from\nGaia DR3, and line-of-sight dust extinction priors were estimated from a\nthree-dimensional dust map. Using PyMC, we performed a simultaneous\ndetermination of the 11-band P-L relations of delta Scuti stars, which not only\nyields precise measurements of these relations, but also greatly improves\nconstraints on the distance moduli and color excesses, as evidenced by the\nreduced uncertainties in the posterior distributions. Furthermore, our\nmethodology enables an independent estimation of the color excess through the\nP-L relations, offering a potential complement to existing 3-D dust maps.\nMoreover, by cross-matching with LAMOST DR7, we investigated the influence of\nmetallicity on the P-L relations. Our analysis reveals that incorporating\nmetallicity might reduce the intrinsic scatter at longer wavelengths. However,\nthis result does not achieve 3 sigma significance, leaving open the possibility\nthat the observed reduction is attributable to statistical fluctuations.",

We\nidentify the primary issue behind these low-quality renderings as a visibility\nmismatch between geometry and appearance, stemming from using these two\nmodalities together. To address this problem, we present CE-NPBG, a new\napproach for novel view synthesis (NVS) in large-scale autonomous driving\nscenes. Our method is a neural point-based technique that leverages two\nmodalities: posed images (cameras) and synchronized raw 3D point clouds\n(LiDAR). We first employ a connectivity relationship graph between appearance\nand geometry, which retrieves points from a large 3D point cloud map observed\nfrom the current camera perspective and uses them for rendering. By leveraging\nthis connectivity, our method significantly improves rendering quality and\nenhances run-time and scalability by using only a small subset of points from\nthe large 3D point cloud map. Our approach associates neural descriptors with\nthe points and uses them to synthesize views. To enhance the encoding of these\ndescriptors and elevate rendering quality, we propose a joint adversarial and\npoint rasterization training. During training, we pair an image-synthesizer\nnetwork with a multi-resolution discriminator. At inference, we decouple them\nand use the image-synthesizer to generate novel views. We also integrate our\nproposal into the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting work to highlight its benefits\nfor improved rendering and scalability.",

                    "value": "Current point-based approaches encounter limitations in scalability and\nrendering quality when using large 3D point cloud maps because using them\ndirectly for novel view synthesis (NVS) leads to degraded visualizations. We\nidentify the primary issue behind these low-quality renderings as a visibility\nmismatch between geometry and appearance, stemming from using these two\nmodalities together. To address this problem, we present CE-NPBG, a new\napproach for novel view synthesis (NVS) in large-scale autonomous driving\nscenes. Our method is a neural point-based technique that leverages two\nmodalities: posed images (cameras) and synchronized raw 3D point clouds\n(LiDAR). We first employ a connectivity relationship graph between appearance\nand geometry, which retrieves points from a large 3D point cloud map observed\nfrom the current camera perspective and uses them for rendering. By leveraging\nthis connectivity, our method significantly improves rendering quality and\nenhances run-time and scalability by using only a small subset of points from\nthe large 3D point cloud map. Our approach associates neural descriptors with\nthe points and uses them to synthesize views. To enhance the encoding of these\ndescriptors and elevate rendering quality, we propose a joint adversarial and\npoint rasterization training. During training, we pair an image-synthesizer\nnetwork with a multi-resolution discriminator. At inference, we decouple them\nand use the image-synthesizer to generate novel views. We also integrate our\nproposal into the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting work to highlight its benefits\nfor improved rendering and scalability."

However, the motifs previously considered are\neither limited to a handful of nodes and edges, or do not include triangles,\nwhich are thought to be of critical relevance to understand the dynamics of\nsocial systems. Thus, we introduce a new class of motifs, that include these\ntriangles, are not limited in their number of nodes or edges, and yet can be\nmined efficiently in any temporal network. Referring to these motifs as the\nedge-centered motifs, we show analytically how they subsume the Egocentric\nTemporal Neighborhoods motifs of the literature. We also confirm in empirical\ndata that the edge-centered motifs bring relevant information with respect to\nthe Egocentric motifs by using a principle of maximum entropy. Then, we show\nhow mining for the edge-centered motifs in a network can be used to probe for\nspatial correlations in the underlying dynamics that have produced that\nnetwork. We deduce an approximate formula for the distribution of the\nedge-centered motifs in empirical networks of social face-to-face interactions.\nIn the last section of this paper, we explore how the statistics of the\nedge-centered motifs can be used to infer the complete topology of the network\nthey were sampled from. This leads to the needs of mathematical development,\nthat we inaugurate here under the name of graph tiling theory.",

                    "value": "Motifs are thought to be some fundamental components of social face-to-face\ninteraction temporal networks. However, the motifs previously considered are\neither limited to a handful of nodes and edges, or do not include triangles,\nwhich are thought to be of critical relevance to understand the dynamics of\nsocial systems. Thus, we introduce a new class of motifs, that include these\ntriangles, are not limited in their number of nodes or edges, and yet can be\nmined efficiently in any temporal network. Referring to these motifs as the\nedge-centered motifs, we show analytically how they subsume the Egocentric\nTemporal Neighborhoods motifs of the literature. We also confirm in empirical\ndata that the edge-centered motifs bring relevant information with respect to\nthe Egocentric motifs by using a principle of maximum entropy. Then, we show\nhow mining for the edge-centered motifs in a network can be used to probe for\nspatial correlations in the underlying dynamics that have produced that\nnetwork. We deduce an approximate formula for the distribution of the\nedge-centered motifs in empirical networks of social face-to-face interactions.\nIn the last section of this paper, we explore how the statistics of the\nedge-centered motifs can be used to infer the complete topology of the network\nthey were sampled from. This leads to the needs of mathematical development,\nthat we inaugurate here under the name of graph tiling theory."

In this paper, we introduce a novel learning\nparadigm -- Modular Machine Learning (MML) -- as an essential approach toward\nnew-generation LLMs. MML decomposes the complex structure of LLMs into three\ninterdependent components: modular representation, modular model, and modular\nreasoning, aiming to enhance LLMs' capability of counterfactual reasoning,\nmitigating hallucinations, as well as promoting fairness, safety, and\ntransparency. Specifically, the proposed MML paradigm can: i) clarify the\ninternal working mechanism of LLMs through the disentanglement of semantic\ncomponents; ii) allow for flexible and task-adaptive model design; iii) enable\ninterpretable and logic-driven decision-making process. We present a feasible\nimplementation of MML-based LLMs via leveraging advanced techniques such as\ndisentangled representation learning, neural architecture search and\nneuro-symbolic learning. We critically identify key challenges, such as the\nintegration of continuous neural and discrete symbolic processes, joint\noptimization, and computational scalability, present promising future research\ndirections that deserve further exploration. Ultimately, the integration of the\nMML paradigm with LLMs has the potential to bridge the gap between statistical\n(deep) learning and formal (logical) reasoning, thereby paving the way for\nrobust, adaptable, and trustworthy AI systems across a wide range of real-world\napplications.",

In this paper, we introduce\nTD-EVAL (Turn and Dialogue-level Evaluation), a two-step evaluation framework\nthat unifies fine-grained turn-level analysis with holistic dialogue-level\ncomparisons. At turn level, we evaluate each response along three TOD-specific\ndimensions: conversation cohesion, backend knowledge consistency, and policy\ncompliance. Meanwhile, we design TOD Agent Arena that uses pairwise comparisons\nto provide a measure of dialogue-level quality. Through experiments on MultiWOZ\n2.4 and {\\tau}-Bench, we demonstrate that TD-EVAL effectively identifies the\nconversational errors that conventional metrics miss. Furthermore, TD-EVAL\nexhibits better alignment with human judgments than traditional and LLM-based\nmetrics.

This paper presents a novel method at the intersection\nof artificial intelligence and medicine, aiming to develop machine learning\nmodels with direct real-world applications in surgical contexts. We propose a\nmulti-modal framework that leverages recent advancements in computer vision and\nlarge language models to generate comprehensive video summaries. % The approach\nis structured in three key stages. First, surgical videos are divided into\nclips, and visual features are extracted at the frame level using visual\ntransformers.

Based on this research, guidelines for good interface design were\nempirically identified. The investigations on the UIs of teams participating in\ncompetitions are often based on external observations during UI application,\nwhich may miss some relevant requirements for UI flexibility. In this work, we\npresent an open-source and flexibly configurable user interface based on\nestablished guidelines and its exemplary use for wheeled, tracked, and walking\nrobots. We explain the design decisions and cover the insights we have gained\nduring its highly successful applications in multiple robotics competitions and\nevaluations. The presented UI can also be adapted for other robots with little\neffort and is available as open source."

To bridge this gap, this paper\nintroduces the ComsAmy, a challenging benchmark specifically designed for\nopen-set anomaly segmentation in complex scenarios.

In this context, honeypots play a vital role by acting as\ndecoy targets within ICS networks, or on the Internet, helping to detect, log,\nanalyze, and develop mitigations for ICS-specific cyber threats.

The key part of\nLODAP is a new module, namely Efficient Incremental Module (EIM). EIM is\ncomposed of normal convolutions and lightweight operations. During incremental\nlearning, EIM exploits some lightweight operations, called adapters, to\neffectively and efficiently learn features for new classes so that it can\nimprove the accuracy of incremental learning while reducing model complexity as\nwell as training overhead. The efficiency of LODAP is further enhanced by a\ndata pruning strategy that significantly reduces the training data, thereby\nlowering the training overhead. We conducted extensive experiments on the\nCIFAR-100 and Tiny- ImageNet datasets. Experimental results show that LODAP\nimproves the accuracy by up to 4.32\\% over existing methods while reducing\naround 50\\% of model complexity.

To fully utilize\npotential capacity and accommodate dynamic services, the DT must dynamically\nupdate in sync with deployed optical networks throughout their lifecycle,\nensuring low-margin operation. This paper proposes a dynamic-updating DT for\nthe lifecycle management of optical networks, employing a hybrid approach that\nintegrates data-driven and physics-informed techniques for fiber channel\nmodeling. This integration ensures both rapid calculation speed and high\nphysics consistency in optical performance prediction while enabling the\ndynamic updating of critical physical parameters for DT. The lifecycle\nmanagement of optical networks, covering accurate performance prediction at the\nnetwork deployment and dynamic updating during network operation, is\ndemonstrated through simulation in a large-scale network. Up to 100 times\nspeedup in prediction is observed compared to classical numerical methods. In\naddition, the fiber Raman gain strength, amplifier frequency-dependent gain\nprofile, and connector loss between fiber and amplifier on C and L bands can be\nsimultaneously updated. Moreover, the dynamic-updating DT is verified on a\nfield-trial C+L-band transmission link, achieving a maximum accuracy\nimprovement of 1.4 dB for performance estimation post-device replacement.\nOverall, the dynamic-updating DT holds promise for driving the next-generation\noptical networks towards lifecycle autonomous management.",

However, existing dietary\nrecommendation systems often lack adaptability, fail to consider real-world\nconstraints such as food ingredient availability, and require extensive user\ninput, making them impractical for sustainable and scalable daily use.

By building a\npersonalized nutrition database and leveraging prompt engineering, our approach\nenables LLMs to incorporate reliable nutritional references like the USDA\nnutrition database while maintaining flexibility and ease-of-use. We\ndemonstrate that LLMs have strong potential in generating accurate and\nuser-friendly food recommendations, addressing key limitations in existing\ndietary recommendation systems by providing structured, practical, and scalable\nmeal plans.

The AIR\nmodule guides LLM to deepen their understanding of code and tasks through a\nchain of thought, effectively mitigating hallucination risks in code\ngeneration. The evolutionary module fine-tunes and reconstructs the reward\nfunction, achieving a balance between exploration diversity and convergence\nstability for training. To validate our approach, we establish six challenging\ncoordination scenarios with varying complexity levels within the Yangtze River\nDelta transportation network simulation.

Most\nexisting benchmarks rely on medical exam-style questions or PubMed-derived\ntext, failing to capture the complexity of real-world electronic health record\n(EHR) data. Others focus narrowly on specific application scenarios, limiting\ntheir generalizability across broader clinical use. To address this gap, we\npresent BRIDGE, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 87 tasks\nsourced from real-world clinical data sources across nine languages. We\nsystematically evaluated 52 state-of-the-art LLMs (including DeepSeek-R1,\nGPT-4o, Gemini, and Llama 4) under various inference strategies. With a total\nof 13,572 experiments, our results reveal substantial performance variation\nacross model sizes, languages, natural language processing tasks, and clinical\nspecialties. Notably, we demonstrate that open-source LLMs can achieve\nperformance comparable to proprietary models, while medically fine-tuned LLMs\nbased on older architectures often underperform versus updated general-purpose\nmodels. The BRIDGE and its corresponding leaderboard serve as a foundational\nresource and a unique reference for the development and evaluation of new LLMs\nin real-world clinical text understanding.",

                    "value": "Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise for medical applications and\nare evolving rapidly, with new models being released at an accelerated pace.\nHowever, current evaluations of LLMs in clinical contexts remain limited. Most\nexisting benchmarks rely on medical exam-style questions or PubMed-derived\ntext, failing to capture the complexity of real-world electronic health record\n(EHR) data. Others focus narrowly on specific application scenarios, limiting\ntheir generalizability across broader clinical use. To address this gap, we\npresent BRIDGE, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 87 tasks\nsourced from real-world clinical data sources across nine languages. We\nsystematically evaluated 52 state-of-the-art LLMs (including DeepSeek-R1,\nGPT-4o, Gemini, and Llama 4) under various inference strategies. With a total\nof 13,572 experiments, our results reveal substantial performance variation\nacross model sizes, languages, natural language processing tasks, and clinical\nspecialties. Notably, we demonstrate that open-source LLMs can achieve\nperformance comparable to proprietary models, while medically fine-tuned LLMs\nbased on older architectures often underperform versus updated general-purpose\nmodels. The BRIDGE and its corresponding leaderboard serve as a foundational\nresource and a unique reference for the development and evaluation of new LLMs\nin real-world clinical text understanding."

In this\npaper, we introduce R-Sparse, a training-free activation sparsity approach\ncapable of achieving high sparsity levels in advanced LLMs. We conducted two\npreliminary investigations into how different components contribute to the\noutput within a single linear layer and found two key observations: (i) the\nnon-sparse components of the input function can be regarded as a few bias\nterms, and (ii) The full computation can be effectively approximated by an\nappropriate combination of input channels and weight singular values. Building\non this, we replace the linear layers in LLMs with a rank-aware sparse\ninference method that leverages the sparsity of input channels and singular\nvalue components, eliminating the need for active channel prediction like the\noutput sparsity based approaches. Experiments on Llama-2/3 and Mistral models\nacross ten diverse tasks demonstrate that R-Sparse achieves comparable\nperformance at 50% model-level sparsity, resulting in a significant 43%\nend-to-end efficient improvements with customized kernels.",

In this\npaper, we introduce R-Sparse, a training-free activation sparsity approach\ncapable of achieving high sparsity levels in advanced LLMs. We conducted two\npreliminary investigations into how different components contribute to the\noutput within a single linear layer and found two key observations: (i) the\nnon-sparse components of the input function can be regarded as a few bias\nterms, and (ii) The full computation can be effectively approximated by an\nappropriate combination of input channels and weight singular values. Building\non this, we replace the linear layers in LLMs with a rank-aware sparse\ninference method that leverages the sparsity of input channels and singular\nvalue components, eliminating the need for active channel prediction like the\noutput sparsity based approaches. Experiments on Llama-2/3 and Mistral models\nacross ten diverse tasks demonstrate that R-Sparse achieves comparable\nperformance at 50% model-level sparsity, resulting in a significant 43%\nend-to-end efficient improvements with customized kernels."

Despite safety\ntraining through reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) [ 32],\nlanguage models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety\nguardrails. Universal jailbreaks - prefixes that can circumvent alignment for\nany payload - are particularly concerning. We show empirically that jailbreak\ndetection systems face distribution shift, with detectors trained at one point\nin time performing poorly against newer exploits. To study this problem, we\nrelease JailbreaksOverTime, a comprehensive dataset of timestamped real user\ninteractions containing both benign requests and jailbreak attempts collected\nover 10 months. We propose a two-pronged method for defenders to detect new\njailbreaks and continuously update their detectors. First, we show how to use\ncontinuous learning to detect jailbreaks and adapt rapidly to new emerging\njailbreaks. While detectors trained at a single point in time eventually fail\ndue to drift, we find that universal jailbreaks evolve slowly enough for\nself-training to be effective. Retraining our detection model weekly using its\nown labels - with no new human labels - reduces the false negative rate from 4%\nto 0.3% at a false positive rate of 0.1%. Second, we introduce an unsupervised\nactive monitoring approach to identify novel jailbreaks. Rather than\nclassifying inputs directly, we recognize jailbreaks by their behavior,\nspecifically, their ability to trigger models to respond to known-harmful\nprompts. This approach has a higher false negative rate (4.1%) than supervised\nmethods, but it successfully identified some out-of-distribution attacks that\nwere missed by the continuous learning approach.",

In this approach, a subset of tokens in the\nin-context inputs are substituted with other (irrelevant) tokens, rendering\nEnglish sentences less comprehensible to human eye. However, by design, there\nis a latent, fixed pattern to this substitution, making it reversible. This\nbijective (reversible) cipher ensures that the task remains a well-defined task\nin some abstract sense, despite the transformations. It is a curious question\nif LLMs can solve ICL CIPHERS with a BIJECTIVE mapping, which requires\ndeciphering the latent cipher. We show that LLMs are better at solving ICL\nCIPHERS with BIJECTIVE mappings than the NON-BIJECTIVE (irreversible) baseline,\nproviding a novel approach to quantify ``learning'' in ICL.
