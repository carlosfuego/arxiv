As conversation\nhistories become longer, existing large language models face increasing\ncomputational and memory challenges, which hinder their ability to provide\nefficient and responsive interactions. Most current acceleration methods either\ncompress the context or optimize key value caching, but they often rely on\nfixed or position-based heuristics that do not adapt well to the dynamic and\nunpredictable patterns found in actual multi-turn conversations. In this paper,\nwe present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework\nfor large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two\nmain innovations. First, it performs online sparsification during the\nprefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the\nattention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value\ncompression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient\ncache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a\n\\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/TreeAILab/Multi-turn_Long-context_Benchmark_for_LLMs}{new\nbenchmark} with eleven multi-turn datasets that reflect realistic query\npositions and conversational dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat LoopServe consistently achieves superior effectiveness compared to\nexisting baselines and significantly accelerates LLM inference across a wide\nrange of long-context dialogue tasks.",

In this paper,\nwe present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework\nfor large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two\nmain innovations. First, it performs online sparsification during the\nprefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the\nattention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value\ncompression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient\ncache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a\n\\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/TreeAILab/Multi-turn_Long-context_Benchmark_for_LLMs}{new\nbenchmark} with eleven multi-turn datasets that reflect realistic query\npositions and conversational dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat LoopServe consistently achieves superior effectiveness compared to\nexisting baselines and significantly accelerates LLM inference across a wide\nrange of long-context dialogue tasks."

Both models\nare trained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal datasets sourced via\nresponsible web crawling, licensed corpora, and high-quality synthetic data,\nthen further refined with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on\na new asynchronous platform. The resulting models support several additional\nlanguages while understanding images and executing tool calls. In public\nbenchmarks and human evaluations, both the server model and the on-device model\nmatch or surpass comparably sized open baselines.\n  A new Swift-centric Foundation Models framework exposes guided generation,\nconstrained tool calling, and LoRA adapter fine-tuning, allowing developers to\nintegrate these capabilities with a few lines of code. The latest advancements\nin Apple Intelligence models are grounded in our Responsible AI approach with\nsafeguards like content filtering and locale-specific evaluation, as well as\nour commitment to protecting our users' privacy with innovations like Private\nCloud Compute.",

On the one hand, the low-level key-value (KV) cache working at the\ntoken level is widely adopted, albeit it incurs significant overhead as request\nvolume grows. On the other hand, instruction-level caching, which stores full\ninstruction-response pairs, is expected to play an increasingly crucial role.\nHowever, the high variability in the content and length of instructions make it\nrare for identical instructions to recur within a short time window, presenting\nchallenges for effective caching instruction-response pairs.

Lizard combines gated linear attention for global\ncontext compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory,\nforming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and\nfine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware\nalgorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive\nexperiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher\nmodel's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while\nsignificantly outperforming previous linearization methods.

While our lock does not provide strict FIFO\nadmission, it bounds bypass and has strong anti-starvation properties. The lock\nis compact, space efficient, and has been intentionally designed to be readily\nusable in real-world general purpose computing environments such as the linux\nkernel, pthreads, or C++. We show the lock exhibits high throughput under\ncontention and low latency in the uncontended case. The performance of\nReciprocating Locks is competitive with and often better than the best\nstate-of-the-art scalable spin locks."

                "summary": "Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very\nlarge context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in\ngeneration is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache,\nwhich scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often\nthe dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput\nand increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV\ncache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked\n(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present\nCompactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses\napproximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that\nCompactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining\n1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal\ncomputational overhead.

                    "value": "Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very\nlarge context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in\ngeneration is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache,\nwhich scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often\nthe dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput\nand increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV\ncache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked\n(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present\nCompactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses\napproximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that\nCompactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining\n1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal\ncomputational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated\ncompression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given\ncontext can support.

To\naddress this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers\nwith highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a\nfixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer\npairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention\ndynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern\nsimilarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable\naccuracy degradation.\n  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and\nefficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies\nbased on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a\nrecomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key\ninnovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical\ncontext for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the\nconversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to\nmitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model\ngeneration; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles\nbrought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV\ncaches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul\nachieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x\nreduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without\ncompromising generation quality.",

We reveal that conventional\ninference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform\npoorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like\nBest-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified\nchallenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high\ncomputational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM)\nevaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference\nscaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our\napproach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that\nsignificantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To\noperationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision\ntraining objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to\nprevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value\ncaching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree\nsearch. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method.\nAdditionally, we publicly release our trained multifurcation reward model\n(Saffron-1) and the accompanying token-level safety reward dataset (Safety4M)\nto accelerate future research in LLM safety.

However, existing serverless platforms lack efficient support for\nGPUs, hindering their ability to deliver high-performance inference. In this\npaper, we present Torpor, a serverless platform for GPU-efficient, low-latency\ninference. To enable efficient sharing of a node's GPUs among numerous\ninference functions, Torpor maintains models in main memory and dynamically\nswaps them onto GPUs upon request arrivals (i.e., late binding with model\nswapping).

However, existing serverless platforms lack efficient support for\nGPUs, hindering their ability to deliver high-performance inference. In this\npaper, we present Torpor, a serverless platform for GPU-efficient, low-latency\ninference. To enable efficient sharing of a node's GPUs among numerous\ninference functions, Torpor maintains models in main memory and dynamically\nswaps them onto GPUs upon request arrivals (i.e., late binding with model\nswapping).

To identify these\nheads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies\nhead-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis.

Pre-trained on 16T high-quality tokens, it supports a 256K context\nlength and is the first industry-deployed large-scale Mamba model. Our\ncomprehensive post-training strategy enhances capabilities via Supervised\nFine-Tuning (3M instructions), a novel Adaptive Long-short CoT Fusion method,\nMulti-round Deliberation Learning for iterative improvement, and a two-stage\nLarge-scale Reinforcement Learning process targeting STEM and general\ninstruction-following.

However, compared\nto attacks on other ML-based systems, attackers face a level of indirection as\nthey cannot interact directly with the learned model. Additionally, the\ndifference between the attack surface of learned and non-learned versions of\nthe same system is often subtle.

Fine-tuning LLMs with\nparameter-efficient adapters, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enables these\nmodels to efficiently adapt to downstream tasks without extensive retraining.\nDeploying fine-tuned LLMs on multi-tenant edge devices offers substantial\nbenefits, such as reduced latency, enhanced privacy, and personalized\nresponses. However, serving LLMs efficiently on resource-constrained edge\ndevices presents critical challenges, including the complexity of adapter\nselection for different tasks and memory overhead from frequent adapter\nswapping.

This paper introduces EdgeLoRA, an efficient\nsystem for serving LLMs on edge devices in multi-tenant environments. EdgeLoRA\nincorporates three key innovations: (1) an adaptive adapter selection mechanism\nto streamline the adapter configuration process; (2) heterogeneous memory\nmanagement, leveraging intelligent adapter caching and pooling to mitigate\nmemory operation overhead; and (3) batch LoRA inference, enabling efficient\nbatch processing to significantly reduce computational latency. Comprehensive\nevaluations using the Llama3.1-8B model demonstrate that EdgeLoRA significantly\noutperforms the status quo (i.e., llama.cpp) in terms of both latency and\nthroughput. The results demonstrate that EdgeLoRA can achieve up to a 4 times\nboost in throughput. Even more impressively, it can serve several orders of\nmagnitude more adapters simultaneously.

However, generating samples with\nuser-specified properties remains a challenge. Recent research proposes\nfine-tuning models to maximize rewards that capture desired properties, but\nthese methods require expensive training and are prone to mode collapse. In\nthis work, we present Feynman-Kac (FK) steering, an inference-time framework\nfor steering diffusion models with reward functions. FK steering works by\nsampling a system of multiple interacting diffusion processes, called\nparticles, and resampling particles at intermediate steps based on scores\ncomputed using functions called potentials. Potentials are defined using\nrewards for intermediate states and are selected such that a high value\nindicates that the particle will yield a high-reward sample. We explore various\nchoices of potentials, intermediate rewards, and samplers. We evaluate FK\nsteering on text-to-image and text diffusion models. For steering text-to-image\nmodels with a human preference reward, we find that FK steering a 0.8B\nparameter model outperforms a 2.6B parameter fine-tuned model on prompt\nfidelity, with faster sampling and no training. For steering text diffusion\nmodels with rewards for text quality and specific text attributes, we find that\nFK steering generates lower perplexity, more linguistically acceptable outputs\nand enables gradient-free control of attributes like toxicity. Our results\ndemonstrate that inference-time scaling and steering of diffusion models - even\nwith off-the-shelf rewards - can provide significant sample quality gains and\ncontrollability benefits.

While recent advances in LLMs show\npromise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low\nsuccess rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an\nautomated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.\n  CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task:\ntrained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250\nCUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the\nmodel also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures,\nachieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40,\nx14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.\nBeyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable\nproperties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns\nto combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers\nfundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious\nperformance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that\nharm performance.\n  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can\ntransform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer\nthrough speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain\nknowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning\nabilities to new kernels. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated\noptimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU\nefficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources.",

In this study, we quantitatively investigate this\nphenomenon within the framework of Ohmic dissipation arising from magnetic\ninduction in the atmosphere, one of the most promising mechanisms for\nexplaining the radius anomaly. We simulate the evolution of irradiated giant\nplanets with {\\tt MESA}, spanning the observed range of masses and equilibrium\ntemperatures, incorporating an internal source of Ohmic dissipation that\nextends to deep layers of the envelope. We infer average atmospheric wind\nintensities, averaged in the region $p\\lesssim 10$ bar, in the range 0.01-1\nkm/s in order to reproduce the range of observed radii, decreasing roughly\nlinearly with planetary mass, and much more steeply with equilibrium\ntemperature. This is consistent with the expected effects of magnetic drag from\nthe induced field, which is higher for more intense irradiation, via\nconductivity, and for larger masses, which have higher dynamo fields. Due to\nthe evolution of the dynamo field and the proportionality of the induced\ncurrents on it, the Ohmic efficiency typically decreases by at least one order\nof magnitude from 0.1 to 10 Gyr, at contrast with the common assumption of a\nconstant-in-time value. Notably, the extent of the main convective region, and\nthe associated heat flux supporting the dynamo, is reduced in the presence of\nstrong Ohmic dissipation, which in turn depends on the dynamo field strength,\ngenerating a non-trivial coupling of the latter with the atmospheric induction,\npotentially leading to an oscillatory behaviour of the field strength. These\nfindings remain generally valid even when accounting for a long-term increase\nin the main-sequence host star luminosity, although this case can more readily\nlead to HJ re-inflation, consistent with previous studies.",

In this study, we quantitatively investigate this\nphenomenon within the framework of Ohmic dissipation arising from magnetic\ninduction in the atmosphere, one of the most promising mechanisms for\nexplaining the radius anomaly. We simulate the evolution of irradiated giant\nplanets with {\\tt MESA}, spanning the observed range of masses and equilibrium\ntemperatures, incorporating an internal source of Ohmic dissipation that\nextends to deep layers of the envelope. We infer average atmospheric wind\nintensities, averaged in the region $p\\lesssim 10$ bar, in the range 0.01-1\nkm/s in order to reproduce the range of observed radii, decreasing roughly\nlinearly with planetary mass, and much more steeply with equilibrium\ntemperature. This is consistent with the expected effects of magnetic drag from\nthe induced field, which is higher for more intense irradiation, via\nconductivity, and for larger masses, which have higher dynamo fields. Due to\nthe evolution of the dynamo field and the proportionality of the induced\ncurrents on it, the Ohmic efficiency typically decreases by at least one order\nof magnitude from 0.1 to 10 Gyr, at contrast with the common assumption of a\nconstant-in-time value. Notably, the extent of the main convective region, and\nthe associated heat flux supporting the dynamo, is reduced in the presence of\nstrong Ohmic dissipation, which in turn depends on the dynamo field strength,\ngenerating a non-trivial coupling of the latter with the atmospheric induction,\npotentially leading to an oscillatory behaviour of the field strength. These\nfindings remain generally valid even when accounting for a long-term increase\nin the main-sequence host star luminosity, although this case can more readily\nlead to HJ re-inflation, consistent with previous studies."

While most existing proximal methods assume a\nunidirectional causal relationship between two primary variables, many social\nand biological systems exhibit complex feedback mechanisms that imply\nbidirectional causality. In this paper, using regression-based models, we\nextend the proximal framework to identify bidirectional causal effects in the\npresence of unmeasured confounding. We establish the identification of\nbidirectional causal effects and develop a sensitivity analysis method for\nviolations of the proxy structural conditions. Building on this identification\nresult, we derive bidirectional two-stage least squares estimators that are\nconsistent and asymptotically normal under standard regularity conditions.\nSimulation studies demonstrate that our approach delivers unbiased causal\neffect estimates and outperforms some standard methods. The simulation results\nalso confirm the reliability of the sensitivity analysis procedure. Applying\nour methodology to a state-level panel dataset from 1985 to 2014 in the United\nStates, we examine the bidirectional causal effects between abortion rates and\nmurder rates. The analysis reveals a consistent negative effect of abortion\nrates on murder rates, while also detecting a potential reciprocal effect from\nmurder rates to abortion rates that conventional unidirectional analyses have\nnot considered.",

In this paper, using regression-based models, we\nextend the proximal framework to identify bidirectional causal effects in the\npresence of unmeasured confounding. We establish the identification of\nbidirectional causal effects and develop a sensitivity analysis method for\nviolations of the proxy structural conditions. Building on this identification\nresult, we derive bidirectional two-stage least squares estimators that are\nconsistent and asymptotically normal under standard regularity conditions.\nSimulation studies demonstrate that our approach delivers unbiased causal\neffect estimates and outperforms some standard methods. The simulation results\nalso confirm the reliability of the sensitivity analysis procedure. Applying\nour methodology to a state-level panel dataset from 1985 to 2014 in the United\nStates, we examine the bidirectional causal effects between abortion rates and\nmurder rates. The analysis reveals a consistent negative effect of abortion\nrates on murder rates, while also detecting a potential reciprocal effect from\nmurder rates to abortion rates that conventional unidirectional analyses have\nnot considered."

Despite their fluency, LLMs tend to replicate patterns seen during\ntraining, limiting their ability to diverge creatively without extensive prompt\nengineering. Prior work has addressed this through domain-specific heuristics\nand structured prompting pipelines, but such solutions are brittle and\ndifficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic\nlatent-space ideation framework that enables controlled, scalable creativity by\nnavigating the continuous embedding space of ideas. Unlike prior methods, our\nframework requires no handcrafted rules and adapts easily to different domains,\ninput formats, and creative tasks.

To address these\nlimitations, we propose Depth3DLane, a novel dual-pathway framework that\nintegrates self-supervised monocular depth estimation to provide explicit\nstructural information, without the need for expensive sensors or additional\nground-truth depth data. Leveraging a self-supervised depth network to obtain a\npoint cloud representation of the scene, our bird's-eye view pathway extracts\nexplicit spatial information, while our front view pathway simultaneously\nextracts rich semantic information. Depth3DLane then uses 3D lane anchors to\nsample features from both pathways and infer accurate 3D lane geometry.\nFurthermore, we extend the framework to predict camera parameters on a\nper-frame basis and introduce a theoretically motivated fitting procedure to\nenhance stability on a per-segment basis. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat Depth3DLane achieves competitive performance on the OpenLane benchmark\ndataset. Furthermore, experimental results show that using learned parameters\ninstead of ground-truth parameters allows Depth3DLane to be applied in\nscenarios where camera calibration is infeasible, unlike previous methods.",

Leveraging a self-supervised depth network to obtain a\npoint cloud representation of the scene, our bird's-eye view pathway extracts\nexplicit spatial information, while our front view pathway simultaneously\nextracts rich semantic information. Depth3DLane then uses 3D lane anchors to\nsample features from both pathways and infer accurate 3D lane geometry.\nFurthermore, we extend the framework to predict camera parameters on a\nper-frame basis and introduce a theoretically motivated fitting procedure to\nenhance stability on a per-segment basis. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat Depth3DLane achieves competitive performance on the OpenLane benchmark\ndataset. Furthermore, experimental results show that using learned parameters\ninstead of ground-truth parameters allows Depth3DLane to be applied in\nscenarios where camera calibration is infeasible, unlike previous methods."

Using this framework, we formally define fair play and design\nappropriate metrics for it. Stemming from these definitions is an inherent\ntension between the coherence of the story, which measures how much it ``makes\nsense'', and the surprise it induces. We validate the framework by applying it\nto LLM-generated detective stories. This domain is appealing since we have an\nabundance of data, we can sample from the distribution generating the story,\nand the story-writing capabilities of LLMs are interesting in their own right.\nResults show that while LLM-generated stories may be unpredictable, they\ngenerally fail to balance the trade-off between surprise and fair play, which\ngreatly contributes to their poor quality.",

To address this gap, we propose\ntwo architectures: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, which\nintegrate comprehensive drug side effect knowledge into a Llama 3 8B language\nmodel. Through extensive evaluations on 19,520 drug side effect associations\n(covering 976 drugs and 3,851 side effect terms), our results demonstrate that\nGraphRAG achieves near-perfect accuracy in drug side effect retrieval.

                    "value": "Drug side effects are a major global health concern, necessitating advanced\nmethods for their accurate detection and analysis. While Large Language Models\n(LLMs) offer promising conversational interfaces, their inherent limitations,\nincluding reliance on black-box training data, susceptibility to\nhallucinations, and lack of domain-specific knowledge, hinder their reliability\nin specialized fields like pharmacovigilance. To address this gap, we propose\ntwo architectures: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, which\nintegrate comprehensive drug side effect knowledge into a Llama 3 8B language\nmodel. Through extensive evaluations on 19,520 drug side effect associations\n(covering 976 drugs and 3,851 side effect terms), our results demonstrate that\nGraphRAG achieves near-perfect accuracy in drug side effect retrieval. This\nframework offers a highly accurate and scalable solution, signifying a\nsignificant advancement in leveraging LLMs for critical pharmacovigilance\napplications."

When this\nhappens, a naive solution is to retrain the model from scratch after excluding\nthe undesired data. Although this guarantees that the target data have been\nforgotten, it is also prohibitively expensive for LLMs. Approximate unlearning\noffers a more efficient alternative, as it consists of ex post modifications of\nthe trained model itself to prevent undesirable results, but it lacks\nforgetting guarantees because it relies solely on empirical evidence. In this\nwork, we present DP2Unlearning, a novel LLM unlearning framework that offers\nformal forgetting guarantees at a significantly lower cost than retraining from\nscratch on the data to be retained.

                    "value": "Software engineers spend a significant amount of time reading code during the\nsoftware development process, especially in the age of large language models\n(LLMs) that can automatically generate code. However, little is known about the\nreadability of the LLM-generated code and whether it is still important from\npractitioners' perspectives in this new era. In this paper, we conduct a survey\nto explore the practitioners' perspectives on code readability in the age of\nLLMs and investigate the readability of our LLM-based software development\nagents framework, HULA, by comparing its generated code with human-written code\nin real-world scenarios. Overall, the findings underscore that (1) readability\nremains a critical aspect of software development; (2) the readability of our\nLLM-generated code is comparable to human-written code, fostering the\nestablishment of appropriate trust and driving the broad adoption of our\nLLM-powered software development platform."

We introduce\nTHEATER, a comprehensive benchmark to systematically evaluate this\nvulnerability-termed Reasoning Theater Bias (RTB)-by comparing LLMs and LRMs\nacross subjective preference and objective factual datasets. Through\ninvestigation of six bias types including Simple Cues and Fake\nChain-of-Thought, we uncover three key findings: (1) in a critical paradox,\nreasoning-specialized LRMs are consistently more susceptible to RTB than\ngeneral-purpose LLMs, particularly in subjective tasks; (2) this creates a\ntask-dependent trade-off, where LRMs show more robustness on factual tasks but\nless on subjective ones; and (3) we identify 'shallow reasoning'-plausible but\nflawed arguments-as the most potent form of RTB. To address this, we design and\nevaluate two prompting strategies: a targeted system prompt that improves\naccuracy by up to 12% on factual tasks but only 1-3% on subjective tasks, and a\nself-reflection mechanism that shows similarly limited effectiveness in the\nmore vulnerable subjective domains. Our work reveals that RTB is a deep-seated\nchallenge for LRM-based evaluation and provides a systematic framework for\ndeveloping more genuinely robust and trustworthy LRMs.",

                    "value": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1 and o1 are increasingly used\nas automated evaluators, raising critical questions about their vulnerability\nto the aesthetics of reasoning in LLM-as-a-judge settings. We introduce\nTHEATER, a comprehensive benchmark to systematically evaluate this\nvulnerability-termed Reasoning Theater Bias (RTB)-by comparing LLMs and LRMs\nacross subjective preference and objective factual datasets. Through\ninvestigation of six bias types including Simple Cues and Fake\nChain-of-Thought, we uncover three key findings: (1) in a critical paradox,\nreasoning-specialized LRMs are consistently more susceptible to RTB than\ngeneral-purpose LLMs, particularly in subjective tasks; (2) this creates a\ntask-dependent trade-off, where LRMs show more robustness on factual tasks but\nless on subjective ones; and (3) we identify 'shallow reasoning'-plausible but\nflawed arguments-as the most potent form of RTB. To address this, we design and\nevaluate two prompting strategies: a targeted system prompt that improves\naccuracy by up to 12% on factual tasks but only 1-3% on subjective tasks, and a\nself-reflection mechanism that shows similarly limited effectiveness in the\nmore vulnerable subjective domains. Our work reveals that RTB is a deep-seated\nchallenge for LRM-based evaluation and provides a systematic framework for\ndeveloping more genuinely robust and trustworthy LRMs."

Scalable and efficient large-scale training on\n1024 GPUs and more is enabled by a novel training paradigm for combined model-\nand data-parallelism, inspired by domain decomposition methods in classical\nnumerical models. Additionally, FourCastNet 3 enables rapid inference on a\nsingle GPU, producing a 60-day global forecast at 0.25{\\deg}, 6-hourly\nresolution in under 4 minutes. Its computational efficiency, medium-range\nprobabilistic skill, spectral fidelity, and rollout stability at subseasonal\ntimescales make it a strong candidate for improving meteorological forecasting\nand early warning systems through large ensemble predictions."

Extensive experiments on\nautonomous driving and general-domain video datasets demonstrate that PosePilot\nsignificantly enhances structural understanding and motion reasoning in both\ndiffusion-based and auto-regressive world models. By steering camera pose with\nself-supervised depth, PosePilot sets a new benchmark for pose controllability,\nenabling physically consistent, reliable viewpoint synthesis in generative\nworld models."

To address this\ncritical issue, we propose AutoSafe, the first framework that systematically\nenhances agent safety through fully automated synthetic data generation.\nConcretely, 1) we introduce an open and extensible threat model, OTS, which\nformalizes how unsafe behaviors emerge from the interplay of user instructions,\ninteraction contexts, and agent actions. This enables precise modeling of\nsafety risks across diverse scenarios. 2) we develop a fully automated data\ngeneration pipeline that simulates unsafe user behaviors, applies\nself-reflective reasoning to generate safe responses, and constructs a\nlarge-scale, diverse, and high-quality safety training dataset-eliminating the\nneed for hazardous real-world data collection. To evaluate the effectiveness of\nour framework, we design comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and\nreal-world safety benchmarks. Results demonstrate that AutoSafe boosts safety\nscores by 45% on average and achieves a 28.91% improvement on real-world tasks,\nvalidating the generalization ability of our learned safety strategies.

This enables precise modeling of\nsafety risks across diverse scenarios. 2) we develop a fully automated data\ngeneration pipeline that simulates unsafe user behaviors, applies\nself-reflective reasoning to generate safe responses, and constructs a\nlarge-scale, diverse, and high-quality safety training dataset-eliminating the\nneed for hazardous real-world data collection. To evaluate the effectiveness of\nour framework, we design comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and\nreal-world safety benchmarks. Results demonstrate that AutoSafe boosts safety\nscores by 45% on average and achieves a 28.91% improvement on real-world tasks,\nvalidating the generalization ability of our learned safety strategies. These\nresults highlight the practical advancement and scalability of AutoSafe in\nbuilding safer LLM-based agents for real-world deployment. We have released the\nproject page at https://auto-safe.github.io/."

In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an\nautomated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.\n  CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task:\ntrained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250\nCUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the\nmodel also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures,\nachieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40,\nx14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.\nBeyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable\nproperties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns\nto combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers\nfundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious\nperformance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that\nharm performance.\n  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can\ntransform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer\nthrough speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain\nknowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning\nabilities to new kernels.

In\nmanual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of\nfactual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity.

The generated notes demonstrate strong\nlongitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$,\nsurpassing the continuity observed in original notes. By restoring narrative\ncoherence across fragmented documentation, our system supports improved\ndownstream tasks such as summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical\ndecision support, offering a scalable solution for LLM-driven note synthesis in\nreal-world healthcare settings."

By integrating high-bandwidth\nHBM3E memory, an on-module photonic switch, and external DDR5 in a 2.5D\nelectro-optical system-in-package, the PFA offers up to 32 TB of shared memory\nalongside 115 Tbps of all-to-all digital switching. The Photonic FabricTM\nenables distributed AI training and inference to execute parallelism strategies\nmore efficiently. The Photonic Fabric removes the silicon beachfront constraint\nthat limits the fixed memory-to-compute ratio observed in virtually all current\nXPU accelerator designs. Replacing a local HBM stack on an XPU with a chiplet\nthat connects to the Photonic Fabric increases its memory capacity and\ncorrespondingly its memory bandwidth by offering a flexible path to scaling\nwell beyond the limitations of on-package HBM alone. We introduce CelestiSim, a\nlightweight analytical simulator validated on NVIDIA H100 and H200 systems. It\nis used to evaluate the performance of LLM reference and energy savings on PFA,\nwithout any significant change to the GPU core design. With the PFA, the\nsimulation results show that up to 3.66x throughput and 1.40x latency\nimprovements in LLM inference at 405B parameters, up to 7.04x throughput and\n1.41x latency improvements at 1T parameters, and 60-90% energy savings in data\nmovement for heavy collective operations in all LLM training scenarios.

Our\nmultitask self-aggregation behavior was able to scale well and achieve a\ncompact formation. We report scalability results from a series of simulation\ntrials with different configurations in the number of groups and the number of\nrobots per group.

                "summary": "The landscape of video recognition has evolved significantly, shifting from\ntraditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Transformer-based\narchitectures for improved accuracy. While 3D CNNs have been effective at\ncapturing spatiotemporal dynamics, recent Transformer models leverage\nself-attention to model long-range spatial and temporal dependencies. Despite\nachieving state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks, Transformers remain\ncomputationally expensive, particularly with dense video data. To address this,\nwe propose a lightweight Video Focal Modulation Network, DVFL-Net, which\ndistills spatiotemporal knowledge from a large pre-trained teacher into a\ncompact nano student model, enabling efficient on-device deployment. DVFL-Net\nutilizes knowledge distillation and spatial-temporal feature modulation to\nsignificantly reduce computation while preserving high recognition performance.\nWe employ forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence alongside spatio-temporal\nfocal modulation to effectively transfer both local and global context from the\nVideo-FocalNet Base (teacher) to the proposed VFL-Net (student).

                    "value": "The landscape of video recognition has evolved significantly, shifting from\ntraditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Transformer-based\narchitectures for improved accuracy. While 3D CNNs have been effective at\ncapturing spatiotemporal dynamics, recent Transformer models leverage\nself-attention to model long-range spatial and temporal dependencies. Despite\nachieving state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks, Transformers remain\ncomputationally expensive, particularly with dense video data. To address this,\nwe propose a lightweight Video Focal Modulation Network, DVFL-Net, which\ndistills spatiotemporal knowledge from a large pre-trained teacher into a\ncompact nano student model, enabling efficient on-device deployment. DVFL-Net\nutilizes knowledge distillation and spatial-temporal feature modulation to\nsignificantly reduce computation while preserving high recognition performance.\nWe employ forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence alongside spatio-temporal\nfocal modulation to effectively transfer both local and global context from the\nVideo-FocalNet Base (teacher) to the proposed VFL-Net (student).

Despite their fluency, LLMs tend to replicate patterns seen during\ntraining, limiting their ability to diverge creatively without extensive prompt\nengineering. Prior work has addressed this through domain-specific heuristics\nand structured prompting pipelines, but such solutions are brittle and\ndifficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic\nlatent-space ideation framework that enables controlled, scalable creativity by\nnavigating the continuous embedding space of ideas. Unlike prior methods, our\nframework requires no handcrafted rules and adapts easily to different domains,\ninput formats, and creative tasks. This paper introduces an early-stage\nprototype of our method, outlining the conceptual framework and preliminary\nresults highlighting its potential as a general-purpose co-ideator for human-AI\ncollaboration.",

Prior work has addressed this through domain-specific heuristics\nand structured prompting pipelines, but such solutions are brittle and\ndifficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic\nlatent-space ideation framework that enables controlled, scalable creativity by\nnavigating the continuous embedding space of ideas. Unlike prior methods, our\nframework requires no handcrafted rules and adapts easily to different domains,\ninput formats, and creative tasks. This paper introduces an early-stage\nprototype of our method, outlining the conceptual framework and preliminary\nresults highlighting its potential as a general-purpose co-ideator for human-AI\ncollaboration."

We present LearnLens, a modular, LLM-based system that generates\npersonalised, curriculum-aligned feedback in science education. LearnLens\ncomprises three components: (1) an error-aware assessment module that captures\nnuanced reasoning errors; (2) a curriculum-grounded generation module that uses\na structured, topic-linked memory chain rather than traditional\nsimilarity-based retrieval, improving relevance and reducing noise; and (3) an\neducator-in-the-loop interface for customisation and oversight. LearnLens\naddresses key challenges in existing systems, offering scalable, high-quality\nfeedback that empowers both teachers and students."

In\nthe case of direct, on-device model inference, selecting the appropriate model\nand device for specific tasks remains challenging. In this paper, we present\nAIvaluateXR, a comprehensive evaluation framework for benchmarking LLMs running\non XR devices. To demonstrate the framework, we deploy 17 selected LLMs across\nfour XR platforms: Magic Leap 2, Meta Quest 3, Vivo X100s Pro, and Apple Vision\nPro, and conduct an extensive evaluation. Our experimental setup measures four\nkey metrics: performance consistency, processing speed, memory usage, and\nbattery consumption. For each of the 68 model-device pairs, we assess\nperformance under varying string lengths, batch sizes, and thread counts,\nanalyzing the trade-offs for real-time XR applications. We propose a unified\nevaluation method based on the 3D Pareto Optimality theory to select the\noptimal device-model pairs from quality and speed objectives. Additionally, we\ncompare the efficiency of on-device LLMs with client-server and cloud-based\nsetups, and evaluate their accuracy on two interactive tasks. We believe our\nfindings offer valuable insight to guide future optimization efforts for LLM\ndeployment on XR devices. Our evaluation method can be used as standard\ngroundwork for further research and development in this emerging field.

For each of the 68 model-device pairs, we assess\nperformance under varying string lengths, batch sizes, and thread counts,\nanalyzing the trade-offs for real-time XR applications. We propose a unified\nevaluation method based on the 3D Pareto Optimality theory to select the\noptimal device-model pairs from quality and speed objectives. Additionally, we\ncompare the efficiency of on-device LLMs with client-server and cloud-based\nsetups, and evaluate their accuracy on two interactive tasks. We believe our\nfindings offer valuable insight to guide future optimization efforts for LLM\ndeployment on XR devices. Our evaluation method can be used as standard\ngroundwork for further research and development in this emerging field.

However, existing systems often face challenges: high model\ncomplexity hinders deployment in resource-constrained environments,\nunidirectional modal alignment neglects inter-modal relationships, and\nrobustness suffers when sensor data is missing. These issues impede efficient\nand robust multimodal perception in real-world IoT settings. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose GRAM-MAMBA. This framework utilizes the\nlinear-complexity Mamba model for efficient sensor time-series processing,\ncombined with an optimized GRAM matrix strategy for pairwise alignment among\nmodalities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional single-modality\nalignment. Inspired by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce an adaptive\nlow-rank layer compensation strategy to handle missing modalities\npost-training. This strategy freezes the pre-trained model core and irrelevant\nadaptive layers, fine-tuning only those related to available modalities and the\nfusion process. Extensive experiments validate GRAM-MAMBA's effectiveness. On\nthe SPAWC2021 indoor positioning dataset, the pre-trained model shows lower\nerror than baselines; adapting to missing modalities yields a 24.5% performance\nboost by training less than 0.2% of parameters. On the USC-HAD human activity\nrecognition dataset, it achieves 93.55% F1 and 93.81% Overall Accuracy (OA),\noutperforming prior work; the update strategy increases F1 by 23% while\ntraining less than 0.3% of parameters.

This framework utilizes the\nlinear-complexity Mamba model for efficient sensor time-series processing,\ncombined with an optimized GRAM matrix strategy for pairwise alignment among\nmodalities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional single-modality\nalignment. Inspired by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce an adaptive\nlow-rank layer compensation strategy to handle missing modalities\npost-training. This strategy freezes the pre-trained model core and irrelevant\nadaptive layers, fine-tuning only those related to available modalities and the\nfusion process. Extensive experiments validate GRAM-MAMBA's effectiveness. On\nthe SPAWC2021 indoor positioning dataset, the pre-trained model shows lower\nerror than baselines; adapting to missing modalities yields a 24.5% performance\nboost by training less than 0.2% of parameters. On the USC-HAD human activity\nrecognition dataset, it achieves 93.55% F1 and 93.81% Overall Accuracy (OA),\noutperforming prior work; the update strategy increases F1 by 23% while\ntraining less than 0.3% of parameters. These results highlight GRAM-MAMBA's\npotential for achieving efficient and robust multimodal perception in\nresource-constrained environments."

We compare models trained on\nindividual judges' past rulings (specialist models) with a judge-agnostic model\ntrained on aggregated data (generalist models). The prediction pipeline is a\nhybrid approach combining large language models (LLMs) for structured feature\nextraction and ML models for outcome prediction (RF, XGB and SVC). Our results\nshow that specialist models consistently achieve higher predictive accuracy\nthan the general model, with top-performing models reaching F1 scores as high\nas 92.85%, compared to the generalist model's 82.63% trained on 20x to 100x\nmore samples. Specialist models capture stable individual patterns that are not\ntransferable to other judges.

This creates the risk that policies will behave as if in pursuit\nof the proxy goal, rather than the intended goal, in deployment -- a phenomenon\nknown as goal misgeneralization. In this paper, we formalize this problem\nsetting in order to theoretically study the possibility of goal\nmisgeneralization under different training objectives. We show that goal\nmisgeneralization is possible under approximate optimization of the maximum\nexpected value (MEV) objective, but not the minimax expected regret (MMER)\nobjective. We then empirically show that the standard MEV-based training method\nof domain randomization exhibits goal misgeneralization in\nprocedurally-generated grid-world environments, whereas current regret-based\nunsupervised environment design (UED) methods are more robust to goal\nmisgeneralization (though they don't find MMER policies in all cases).

To evaluate the effectiveness of\nour framework, we design comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and\nreal-world safety benchmarks.

Using clinical human evaluations of responses is\nexpensive, unscalable, and not conducive to the continuous iterative\ndevelopment of RAG systems. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRID -\nan Automated and Scalable TRIaD for evaluating clinical QA systems leveraging\nRAG - consisting of three metrics: Context Relevance (CR), Refusal Accuracy\n(RA), and Conversational Faithfulness (CF). Our novel evaluation metric, CF, is\ndesigned to better capture the faithfulness of a model's response to the\nknowledge base without penalising conversational elements. To validate our\ntriad, we curate a dataset of over 200 real-world patient questions posed to an\nLLM-based QA agent during surgical follow-up for cataract surgery - the highest\nvolume operation in the world - augmented with clinician-selected questions for\nemergency, clinical, and non-clinical out-of-domain scenarios. We demonstrate\nthat CF can predict human ratings of faithfulness better than existing\ndefinitions for conversational use cases. Furthermore, we show that evaluation\nusing our triad consisting of CF, RA, and CR exhibits alignment with clinician\nassessment for inappropriate, harmful, or unhelpful responses. Finally, using\nnine different LLMs, we demonstrate that the three metrics can closely agree\nwith human evaluations, highlighting the potential of these metrics for use in\nLLM-driven automated evaluation pipelines. We also publish the prompts and\ndatasets for these experiments, providing valuable resources for further\nresearch and development.",

In this paper, we propose FireQ, a co-designed PTQ\nframework and an INT4-FP8 matrix multiplication kernel that accelerates LLM\ninference across all linear layers. Specifically, FireQ quantizes linear layer\nweights and key-values to INT4, and activations and queries to FP8,\nsignificantly enhancing throughput. Additionally, we introduce a three-stage\npipelining for the prefill phase, which modifies the FlashAttention-3 kernel,\neffectively reducing time-to-first-token in the prefill phase. To minimize\naccuracy loss from quantization, we develop novel outlier smoothing techniques\ntailored separately for linear and attention layers. In linear layers, we\nexplicitly use per-tensor scaling to prevent underflow caused by the FP8\nquantization scaling factor of INT4 quantization, and channel-wise scaling to\ncompensate for coarse granularity of INT4. In attention layers, we address\nquantization challenges posed by rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) by\ncombining pre-RoPE and post-RoPE scaling strategies. FireQ significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 1.68x faster inference in\nfeed-forward network layers on Llama2-7B and 1.26x faster prefill phase\nperformance on Llama3-8B compared to QServe, with negligible accuracy loss.",

To\naddress these issues, we propose HeCoFuse, a unified framework designed for\ncooperative perception across mixed sensor setups where nodes may carry Cameras\n(C), LiDARs (L), or both. By introducing a hierarchical fusion mechanism that\nadaptively weights features through a combination of channel-wise and spatial\nattention, HeCoFuse can tackle critical challenges such as cross-modality\nfeature misalignment and imbalanced representation quality. In addition, an\nadaptive spatial resolution adjustment module is employed to balance\ncomputational cost and fusion effectiveness. To enhance robustness across\ndifferent configurations, we further implement a cooperative learning strategy\nthat dynamically adjusts fusion type based on available modalities. Experiments\non the real-world TUMTraf-V2X dataset demonstrate that HeCoFuse achieves 43.22%\n3D mAP under the full sensor configuration (LC+LC), outperforming the CoopDet3D\nbaseline by 1.17%, and reaches an even higher 43.38% 3D mAP in the L+LC\nscenario, while maintaining 3D mAP in the range of 21.74% to 43.38% across nine\nheterogeneous sensor configurations.

Image restoration\nhas emerged as a core solution to this challenge and has been widely discussed\nin the literature. Although recent transformer-based approaches have made\nremarkable progress in image restoration, their increasing system complexity\nposes significant challenges for real-time processing, particularly in\nreal-world deployment scenarios. To this end, most existing methods attempt to\nsimplify the self-attention mechanism, such as by channel self-attention or\nstate space model. However, these methods primarily focus on network\narchitecture while neglecting the inherent characteristics of image restoration\nitself. In this context, we explore a pyramid Wavelet-Fourier iterative\npipeline to demonstrate the potential of Wavelet-Fourier processing for image\nrestoration. Inspired by the above findings, we propose a novel and efficient\nrestoration baseline, named Pyramid Wavelet-Fourier Network (PW-FNet).\nSpecifically, PW-FNet features two key design principles: 1) at the inter-block\nlevel, integrates a pyramid wavelet-based multi-input multi-output structure to\nachieve multi-scale and multi-frequency bands decomposition; and 2) at the\nintra-block level, incorporates Fourier transforms as an efficient alternative\nto self-attention mechanisms, effectively reducing computational complexity\nwhile preserving global modeling capability.

                    "value": "Natural image quality is often degraded by adverse weather conditions,\nsignificantly impairing the performance of downstream tasks. Image restoration\nhas emerged as a core solution to this challenge and has been widely discussed\nin the literature. Although recent transformer-based approaches have made\nremarkable progress in image restoration, their increasing system complexity\nposes significant challenges for real-time processing, particularly in\nreal-world deployment scenarios. To this end, most existing methods attempt to\nsimplify the self-attention mechanism, such as by channel self-attention or\nstate space model. However, these methods primarily focus on network\narchitecture while neglecting the inherent characteristics of image restoration\nitself. In this context, we explore a pyramid Wavelet-Fourier iterative\npipeline to demonstrate the potential of Wavelet-Fourier processing for image\nrestoration. Inspired by the above findings, we propose a novel and efficient\nrestoration baseline, named Pyramid Wavelet-Fourier Network (PW-FNet).\nSpecifically, PW-FNet features two key design principles: 1) at the inter-block\nlevel, integrates a pyramid wavelet-based multi-input multi-output structure to\nachieve multi-scale and multi-frequency bands decomposition; and 2) at the\nintra-block level, incorporates Fourier transforms as an efficient alternative\nto self-attention mechanisms, effectively reducing computational complexity\nwhile preserving global modeling capability. Extensive experiments on tasks\nsuch as image deraining, raindrop removal, image super-resolution, motion\ndeblurring, image dehazing, image desnowing and underwater/low-light\nenhancement demonstrate that PW-FNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art\nmethods in restoration quality but also achieves superior efficiency, with\nsignificantly reduced parameter size, computational cost and inference time."

While recent\nresearch has primarily focused on using LLMs to classify text as either\nhuman-written and machine-generated texts, our study focus on characterizing\nthese texts using a set of linguistic features across different linguistic\nlevels such as morphology, syntax, and semantics. We select a dataset of\nhuman-written and machine-generated texts spanning 8 domains and produced by 11\ndifferent LLMs. We calculate different linguistic features such as dependency\nlength and emotionality and we use them for characterizing human-written and\nmachine-generated texts along with different sampling strategies, repetition\ncontrols and model release date. Our statistical analysis reveals that\nhuman-written texts tend to exhibit simpler syntactic structures and more\ndiverse semantic content. Furthermore, we calculate the variability of our set\nof features across models and domains. Both human and machine texts show\nstylistic diversity across domains, with humans displaying greater variation in\nour features. Finally, we apply style embeddings to further test variability\namong human-written and machine-generated texts. Notably, newer models output\ntext that is similarly variable, pointing to an homogenization of\nmachine-generated texts.",

                    "value": "The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly\nimproved their ability to generate natural language, making texts generated by\nLLMs increasingly indistinguishable from human-written texts. While recent\nresearch has primarily focused on using LLMs to classify text as either\nhuman-written and machine-generated texts, our study focus on characterizing\nthese texts using a set of linguistic features across different linguistic\nlevels such as morphology, syntax, and semantics. We select a dataset of\nhuman-written and machine-generated texts spanning 8 domains and produced by 11\ndifferent LLMs. We calculate different linguistic features such as dependency\nlength and emotionality and we use them for characterizing human-written and\nmachine-generated texts along with different sampling strategies, repetition\ncontrols and model release date. Our statistical analysis reveals that\nhuman-written texts tend to exhibit simpler syntactic structures and more\ndiverse semantic content. Furthermore, we calculate the variability of our set\nof features across models and domains. Both human and machine texts show\nstylistic diversity across domains, with humans displaying greater variation in\nour features. Finally, we apply style embeddings to further test variability\namong human-written and machine-generated texts. Notably, newer models output\ntext that is similarly variable, pointing to an homogenization of\nmachine-generated texts."
