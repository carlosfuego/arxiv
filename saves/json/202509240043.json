We present\nSpiffy, a speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates dLLM inference by\n$\\mathbf{2.8{-}3.1\\times}$ while provably preserving the model's output\ndistribution. This work addresses the unique challenges involved in applying\nideas from speculative decoding of AR-LLMs to the dLLM setting. Spiffy proposes\ndraft states by leveraging the dLLM's distribution itself in an\nauto-speculative manner. This approach is efficient and effective, and\neliminates the overheads of training and running an independent draft model. To\nstructure the candidate draft states, we propose a novel directed draft graph\nwhich is uniquely designed to take advantage of the bidirectional, block-wise\nnature of dLLM generation and can be verified in parallel by the dLLM. To\nfurther optimize the structure of these draft graphs, we introduce an\nefficient, offline calibration algorithm that procedurally determines\nhigh-quality graph configurations.

Crucially, Spiffy is also complementary to other recent\ninnovations in improving dLLM generation speeds such as KV-caching and\nmulti-token unmasking.

Under the same (default) settings, our\nmethod achieves improved performance and faster inference, along with a\n4.95$\\times$ reduction in data transmission bandwidth consumption."

Under\nstrict memory budgets, eviction enables denser frame sampling, which improves\nreconstruction accuracy compared to the baseline. Experiments across video\ndepth estimation (Sintel, KITTI), 3D reconstruction (7-Scenes, NRGBD), and\ncamera pose estimation (Sintel, TUM-dynamics) show that our approach closely\nmatches StreamVGGT at a fraction of the memory and makes long-horizon streaming\ninference more practical.",

We\nthus propose FalconFS, a DFS optimized for deep learning pipelines with the\nstateless-client architecture. Specifically, instead of performing client-side\npath resolution and caching, FalconFS efficiently resolves paths on the server\nside using hybrid metadata indexing and lazy namespace replication. FalconFS\nalso boosts server concurrency with concurrent request merging and provides\neasy deployment with VFS shortcut. Evaluations against CephFS and Lustre show\nthat FalconFS achieves up to 5.72$\\times$ throughput for small file read/write\nand up to 12.81$\\times$ throughput for deep learning model training.

                    "value": "Client-side metadata caching has long been considered an effective method for\naccelerating metadata operations in distributed file systems (DFSs). However,\nwe have found that client-side state (e.g., caching) is not only ineffective\nbut also consumes valuable memory resources in the deep learning pipelines. We\nthus propose FalconFS, a DFS optimized for deep learning pipelines with the\nstateless-client architecture. Specifically, instead of performing client-side\npath resolution and caching, FalconFS efficiently resolves paths on the server\nside using hybrid metadata indexing and lazy namespace replication. FalconFS\nalso boosts server concurrency with concurrent request merging and provides\neasy deployment with VFS shortcut. Evaluations against CephFS and Lustre show\nthat FalconFS achieves up to 5.72$\\times$ throughput for small file read/write\nand up to 12.81$\\times$ throughput for deep learning model training. FalconFS\nhas been running in Huawei autonomous driving system's production environment\nwith 10,000 NPUs for one year."

The main\nchallenges in this task are preserving the identity of the reference portrait,\naccurately transferring target expressions, and maintaining long-term temporal\nconsistency while ensuring generation efficiency. To address identity\npreservation and accurate expression retargeting, we enhance Stable Diffusion\nwith two key components: a expression-aware landmarks as explicit motion\nsignals, which improve motion alignment, support exaggerated expressions, and\nreduce identity leakage; and a fine-grained facial loss that leverages both\nexpression and facial masks to better capture subtle expressions and faithfully\npreserve the reference appearance. With these components, our model supports\ncontrollable and expressive animation across diverse portrait types, including\nreal faces, cartoons, sculptures, and animals. However, diffusion-based\nframeworks typically struggle to efficiently generate long-term stable\nanimation results, which remains a core challenge in this task. To address\nthis, we propose a progressive generation strategy for stable long-term\nanimation, and introduce a Taylor-interpolated cache, achieving a 2.6X lossless\nacceleration. These two strategies ensure that our method produces high-quality\nresults efficiently, making it user-friendly and accessible.

                    "value": "We present Follow-Your-Emoji-Faster, an efficient diffusion-based framework\nfor freestyle portrait animation driven by facial landmarks. The main\nchallenges in this task are preserving the identity of the reference portrait,\naccurately transferring target expressions, and maintaining long-term temporal\nconsistency while ensuring generation efficiency. To address identity\npreservation and accurate expression retargeting, we enhance Stable Diffusion\nwith two key components: a expression-aware landmarks as explicit motion\nsignals, which improve motion alignment, support exaggerated expressions, and\nreduce identity leakage; and a fine-grained facial loss that leverages both\nexpression and facial masks to better capture subtle expressions and faithfully\npreserve the reference appearance. With these components, our model supports\ncontrollable and expressive animation across diverse portrait types, including\nreal faces, cartoons, sculptures, and animals. However, diffusion-based\nframeworks typically struggle to efficiently generate long-term stable\nanimation results, which remains a core challenge in this task. To address\nthis, we propose a progressive generation strategy for stable long-term\nanimation, and introduce a Taylor-interpolated cache, achieving a 2.6X lossless\nacceleration. These two strategies ensure that our method produces high-quality\nresults efficiently, making it user-friendly and accessible.

It effectively alleviates the inefficiency problem caused\nby high computational requirements by caching similar features in the inference\nprocess of the diffusion model. In this paper, we analyze existing feature\ncaching methods from the perspective of information utilization, and point out\nthat relying solely on historical information will lead to constrained accuracy\nand speed performance. And we propose a novel paradigm that introduces future\ninformation via self-speculation based on the information similarity at the\nsame time step across different iteration times. Based on this paradigm, we\npresent \\textit{SpecDiff}, a training-free multi-level feature caching strategy\nincluding a cached feature selection algorithm and a multi-level feature\nclassification algorithm. (1) Feature selection algorithm based on\nself-speculative information. \\textit{SpecDiff} determines a dynamic importance\nscore for each token based on self-speculative information and historical\ninformation, and performs cached feature selection through the importance\nscore. (2) Multi-level feature classification algorithm based on feature\nimportance scores. \\textit{SpecDiff} classifies tokens by leveraging the\ndifferences in feature importance scores and introduces a multi-level feature\ncalculation strategy. Extensive experiments show that \\textit{SpecDiff}\nachieves average 2.80 \\times, 2.74 \\times , and 3.17\\times speedup with\nnegligible quality loss in Stable Diffusion 3, 3.5, and FLUX compared to RFlow\non NVIDIA A800-80GB GPU.

It effectively alleviates the inefficiency problem caused\nby high computational requirements by caching similar features in the inference\nprocess of the diffusion model. In this paper, we analyze existing feature\ncaching methods from the perspective of information utilization, and point out\nthat relying solely on historical information will lead to constrained accuracy\nand speed performance. And we propose a novel paradigm that introduces future\ninformation via self-speculation based on the information similarity at the\nsame time step across different iteration times. Based on this paradigm, we\npresent \\textit{SpecDiff}, a training-free multi-level feature caching strategy\nincluding a cached feature selection algorithm and a multi-level feature\nclassification algorithm. (1) Feature selection algorithm based on\nself-speculative information. \\textit{SpecDiff} determines a dynamic importance\nscore for each token based on self-speculative information and historical\ninformation, and performs cached feature selection through the importance\nscore. (2) Multi-level feature classification algorithm based on feature\nimportance scores. \\textit{SpecDiff} classifies tokens by leveraging the\ndifferences in feature importance scores and introduces a multi-level feature\ncalculation strategy. Extensive experiments show that \\textit{SpecDiff}\nachieves average 2.80 \\times, 2.74 \\times , and 3.17\\times speedup with\nnegligible quality loss in Stable Diffusion 3, 3.5, and FLUX compared to RFlow\non NVIDIA A800-80GB GPU. By merging speculative and historical information,\n\\textit{SpecDiff} overcomes the speedup-accuracy trade-off bottleneck, pushing\nthe Pareto frontier of speedup and accuracy in the efficient diffusion model\ninference."

To address\nthis, previous works propose retaining a small fraction of KV cache based on\ntoken importance.

Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that this numerical boundary is highly sensitive to which layers of\nthe infrastructure are included in the models. To our knowledge, this study\nprovides the first quantitative cross-country comparison of 15 European\nhigh-voltage networks, linking topological properties with vulnerability\ncharacteristics."

This improves caching\nefficiency, as accessing one item often implies the need for others. Prior work\nhas explored only 2 item pairwise packing. In this paper, we extend the concept\nto general K packing, allowing variable size bundles for improved flexibility\nand performance. We formulate the K PackCache problem from a content delivery\nnetwork CDN operator perspective, aiming to minimize total cost comprising two\ncomponents: transfer cost modeled as a base cost plus a linearly increasing\nterm with the number of items packed, and memory rental cost for caching, which\ndepends on how long and how much is stored. Overpacking increases cost due to\nlow utility, underpacking leads to missed sharing opportunities. We propose an\nonline algorithm, Adaptive K PackCache AKPC, which dynamically forms, merges,\nand splits data cliques based on user access patterns and content correlation.\nOur approach supports batch requests, enables approximate clique merging, and\noffers a formal competitive guarantee. Through extensive evaluation on the\nNetflix and Spotify datasets, AKPC reduces total cost by up to 63 and 55\npercentage over online baselines, respectively, and achieves performance within\n15 and 13 percentage of the optimal. This demonstrates its scalability and\neffectiveness for real world caching systems.",

Although this scheme is simple to implement, it\ntends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect\nor omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose\nJudge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This\nmethod only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost. By\nconcatenating the soft token list at the end of the input sequence, we train\nthese tokens' attention map to the original input sequence to align with that\nof the actual decoded tokens. In this way, the queries corresponding to the\nsoft tokens can effectively capture global information and better evaluate the\nimportance of the keys and values within the KV cache, thus maintaining\ndecoding quality when KV cache is evicted.

We validate our approach through experiments conducted on models\nsuch as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, using benchmarks\nincluding LongBench, RULER, and Needle-in-a-Haystack.

                "summary": "Diffusion transformers have gained significant attention in recent years for\ntheir ability to generate high-quality images and videos, yet still suffer from\na huge computational cost due to their iterative denoising process. Recently,\nfeature caching has been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by\ncaching the feature computation in previous timesteps and reusing it in the\nfollowing timesteps, which leverage the temporal similarity of diffusion models\nwhile ignoring the similarity in the spatial dimension. In this paper, we\nintroduce Cluster-Driven Feature Caching (ClusCa) as an orthogonal and\ncomplementary perspective for previous feature caching. Specifically, ClusCa\nperforms spatial clustering on tokens in each timestep, computes only one token\nin each cluster and propagates their information to all the other tokens, which\nis able to reduce the number of tokens by over 90%. Extensive experiments on\nDiT, FLUX and HunyuanVideo demonstrate its effectiveness in both text-to-image\nand text-to-video generation. Besides, it can be directly applied to any\ndiffusion transformer without requirements for training. For instance, ClusCa\nachieves 4.96x acceleration on FLUX with an ImageReward of 99.49%, surpassing\nthe original model by 0.51%.

                "summary": "As multicore systems continue to scale, cache coherence has emerged as a\ncritical determinant of system performance, with coherence behavior and task\nexecution closely intertwined, reshaping inter-task dependencies. Task graph\nmodeling provides a structured way to capture such dependencies and serves as\nthe foundation for many system-level design strategies. However, these\nstrategies typically rely on predefined task graphs, while many real-world\napplications lack explicit graphs and exhibit dynamic, data-dependent behavior,\nlimiting the effectiveness of static approaches. To address this, several task\ngraph modeling methods for realistic workloads have been developed. Yet, they\neither rely on implicit techniques that use application-specific features\nwithout producing explicit graphs, or they generate graphs tailored to fixed\nscheduling models, which limits generality. More importantly, they often\noverlook coherence interactions, creating a gap between design assumptions and\nactual runtime behavior. To overcome these limitations, we propose CoTAM, a\nCoherence-Aware Task Graph Modeling framework for realistic workloads that\nconstructs a unified task graph reflecting runtime behavior. CoTAM analyzes the\nimpact of coherence by decoupling its effects from overall execution,\nquantifies its influence through a learned weighting scheme, and infers\ninter-task dependencies for coherence-aware graph generation. Extensive\nexperiments show that CoTAM outperforms implicit methods, bridging the gap\nbetween dynamic workload behavior and existing designs while demonstrating the\nimportance of incorporating cache coherence into task graph modeling for\naccurate and generalizable system-level analysis.",

                    "value": "As multicore systems continue to scale, cache coherence has emerged as a\ncritical determinant of system performance, with coherence behavior and task\nexecution closely intertwined, reshaping inter-task dependencies. Task graph\nmodeling provides a structured way to capture such dependencies and serves as\nthe foundation for many system-level design strategies. However, these\nstrategies typically rely on predefined task graphs, while many real-world\napplications lack explicit graphs and exhibit dynamic, data-dependent behavior,\nlimiting the effectiveness of static approaches. To address this, several task\ngraph modeling methods for realistic workloads have been developed. Yet, they\neither rely on implicit techniques that use application-specific features\nwithout producing explicit graphs, or they generate graphs tailored to fixed\nscheduling models, which limits generality. More importantly, they often\noverlook coherence interactions, creating a gap between design assumptions and\nactual runtime behavior. To overcome these limitations, we propose CoTAM, a\nCoherence-Aware Task Graph Modeling framework for realistic workloads that\nconstructs a unified task graph reflecting runtime behavior. CoTAM analyzes the\nimpact of coherence by decoupling its effects from overall execution,\nquantifies its influence through a learned weighting scheme, and infers\ninter-task dependencies for coherence-aware graph generation. Extensive\nexperiments show that CoTAM outperforms implicit methods, bridging the gap\nbetween dynamic workload behavior and existing designs while demonstrating the\nimportance of incorporating cache coherence into task graph modeling for\naccurate and generalizable system-level analysis."

By per-head soft voting mechanism,\nTokenSelect selectively involves a few critical KV cache tokens in attention\ncalculation without sacrificing accuracy. To further accelerate TokenSelect, we\ndesign the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query\nsimilarity and implemented the efficient Paged Dot Product Kernel,\nsignificantly reducing the selection overhead. A comprehensive evaluation of\nTokenSelect demonstrates up to $23.84\\times$ speedup in attention computation\nand up to $2.28\\times$ acceleration in end-to-end latency, while providing\nsuperior performance compared to state-of-the-art long-context inference\nmethods.",

Rather than caching keys and\nvalues separately, MLA stores their compressed latent representations, reducing\nmemory overhead while maintaining the performance. While MLA improves memory\nefficiency without compromising language model accuracy, its major limitation\nlies in its integration during the pre-training phase, requiring models to be\ntrained from scratch. This raises a key question: can we use MLA's benefits\nfully or partially in models that have already been pre-trained with different\nattention mechanisms? In this paper, we propose X-EcoMLA to deploy post\ntraining distillation to enable the upcycling of Transformer-based attention\ninto an efficient hybrid MLA variant through lightweight post-training\nadaptation, bypassing the need for extensive pre-training.

We demonstrate that this dual approach to\nscaling yields state-of-the-art results on established formal mathematics\nbenchmarks. \\texttt{BFS-Prover-V2} achieves 95.08\\% and 41.4\\% on the MiniF2F\nand ProofNet test sets respectively. While demonstrated in the domain of formal\nmathematics, the RL and inference techniques presented in this work are of\nbroader interest and may be applied to other domains requiring long-horizon\nmulti-turn reasoning and complex search."

However, as sequence length\nincreases, the KV cache quickly becomes a major memory bottleneck. To address\nthis, we propose PagedEviction, a novel fine-grained, structured KV cache\npruning strategy that enhances the memory efficiency of vLLM's PagedAttention.\nUnlike existing approaches that rely on attention-based token importance or\nevict tokens across different vLLM pages, PagedEviction introduces an efficient\nblock-wise eviction algorithm tailored for paged memory layouts. Our method\nintegrates seamlessly with PagedAttention without requiring any modifications\nto its CUDA attention kernels. We evaluate PagedEviction across\nLlama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, and Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct models\non the LongBench benchmark suite, demonstrating improved memory usage with\nbetter accuracy than baselines on long context tasks.",

However, as sequence length\nincreases, the KV cache quickly becomes a major memory bottleneck. To address\nthis, we propose PagedEviction, a novel fine-grained, structured KV cache\npruning strategy that enhances the memory efficiency of vLLM's PagedAttention.\nUnlike existing approaches that rely on attention-based token importance or\nevict tokens across different vLLM pages, PagedEviction introduces an efficient\nblock-wise eviction algorithm tailored for paged memory layouts. Our method\nintegrates seamlessly with PagedAttention without requiring any modifications\nto its CUDA attention kernels. We evaluate PagedEviction across\nLlama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, and Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct models\non the LongBench benchmark suite, demonstrating improved memory usage with\nbetter accuracy than baselines on long context tasks."

Evaluations on\nmillions of realistic requests demonstrate that IC-Cache improves LLM serving\nthroughput by 1.4-5.9x and reduces latency by 28-71% without hurting response\nquality."

In addition\nto preserving the compositional semantics while computing system behaviors,\nalgorithms have to cater to the explosion in the number of locations in the\nparallel product automaton. In this paper, we propose a bounded reachability\nanalysis algorithm for compositional hybrid systems with piecewise affine\ndynamics, based on the principle of counterexample guided abstraction\nrefinement (CEGAR).

In addition\nto preserving the compositional semantics while computing system behaviors,\nalgorithms have to cater to the explosion in the number of locations in the\nparallel product automaton. In this paper, we propose a bounded reachability\nanalysis algorithm for compositional hybrid systems with piecewise affine\ndynamics, based on the principle of counterexample guided abstraction\nrefinement (CEGAR).

OnePiece has been deployed in the main personalized search scenario\nof Shopee and achieves consistent online gains across different key business\nmetrics, including over $+2\\%$ GMV/UU and a $+2.90\\%$ increase in advertising\nrevenue."

This mitigates\nthe complexity of applying MLLMs directly to vast action spaces. We also\ndemonstrate a chain-of-thought strategy enabling MLLMs to discover novel user\ninterests by first understanding video content and then identifying relevant\nyet unexplored interest clusters. Through live experiments within a commercial\nshort-form video platform serving billions of users, we show that our\nMLLM-powered approach significantly improves both recommendation serendipity\nand user satisfaction."

To address this limitation, TempSamp-R1 leverages ground-truth\nannotations as off-policy supervision to provide temporally precise guidance,\neffectively compensating for the sparsity and misalignment in on-policy\nsolutions. To further stabilize training and reduce variance in reward-based\nupdates, TempSamp-R1 provides a non-linear soft advantage computation method\nthat dynamically reshapes the reward feedback via an asymmetric transformation.\nBy employing a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training paradigm, TempSamp-R1\noptimizes a single unified model to support both CoT and non-CoT inference\nmodes, enabling efficient handling of queries with varying reasoning\ncomplexity.

The performance of a given algorithm\ndepends on specific problem characteristics such as its scale, objectives, and\nconstraints. This creates a need for a data-driven recommendation method to\nguide algorithm selection in automated design systems. This paper introduces a\nnew recommendation method to make such expertise accessible, based on a\nKnowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG RAG) framework. To\naddress this, a domain-specific knowledge graph is constructed from published\nliterature. The method then employs a multi-faceted retrieval mechanism to\ngather relevant evidence from this knowledge graph using three distinct\napproaches, which include a precise graph-based search, flexible vector-based\nsearch, and high-level cluster-based search. The retrieved evidence is utilized\nby a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate algorithm recommendations with\ndata-driven reasoning. The proposed KG-RAG method is compared against a\ncommercial LLM chatbot with access to the knowledge base as a table, across a\nseries of diverse, real-world FLP test cases. Based on recommendation accuracy\nand reasoning capability, the proposed method performed significantly better\nthan the commercial LLM chatbot.",

                    "value": "Selecting a solution algorithm for the Facility Layout Problem (FLP), an\nNP-hard optimization problem with a multiobjective trade-off, is a complex task\nthat requires deep expert knowledge. The performance of a given algorithm\ndepends on specific problem characteristics such as its scale, objectives, and\nconstraints. This creates a need for a data-driven recommendation method to\nguide algorithm selection in automated design systems. This paper introduces a\nnew recommendation method to make such expertise accessible, based on a\nKnowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG RAG) framework. To\naddress this, a domain-specific knowledge graph is constructed from published\nliterature. The method then employs a multi-faceted retrieval mechanism to\ngather relevant evidence from this knowledge graph using three distinct\napproaches, which include a precise graph-based search, flexible vector-based\nsearch, and high-level cluster-based search. The retrieved evidence is utilized\nby a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate algorithm recommendations with\ndata-driven reasoning. The proposed KG-RAG method is compared against a\ncommercial LLM chatbot with access to the knowledge base as a table, across a\nseries of diverse, real-world FLP test cases. Based on recommendation accuracy\nand reasoning capability, the proposed method performed significantly better\nthan the commercial LLM chatbot."

While this approach greatly enhances performance,\nit also incurs significant training costs. In this paper, we investigate how to\neffectively bridge vision-language (VL) representations to action (A). We\nintroduce VLA-Adapter, a novel paradigm designed to reduce the reliance of VLA\nmodels on large-scale VLMs and extensive pre-training. To this end, we first\nsystematically analyze the effectiveness of various VL conditions and present\nkey findings on which conditions are essential for bridging perception and\naction spaces. Based on these insights, we propose a lightweight Policy module\nwith Bridge Attention, which autonomously injects the optimal condition into\nthe action space. In this way, our method achieves high performance using only\na 0.5B-parameter backbone, without any robotic data pre-training. Extensive\nexperiments on both simulated and real-world robotic benchmarks demonstrate\nthat VLA-Adapter not only achieves state-of-the-art level performance, but also\noffers the fast inference speed reported to date. Furthermore, thanks to the\nproposed advanced bridging paradigm, VLA-Adapter enables the training of a\npowerful VLA model in just 8 hours on a single consumer-grade GPU, greatly\nlowering the barrier to deploying the VLA model.

In networks, hybrid exploit chains are critical because of their linkable\nvulnerabilities. Moreover, developing hybrid exploit chains is challenging\nbecause it requires understanding the diverse and independent dependencies and\noutcomes. We present hybrid chains encompassing privilege escalation (PE) and\nremote code execution (RCE) exploits.

PDDL exploit and network descriptions then use\noff-the-shelf AI planners to find multiple exploit chains. ALFA-Chains finds 12\nunknown chains on an example with a known three-step chain.

ALFA-Chains is efficient, finding\nan exploit chain in 0.01 seconds in an enterprise network with 83\nvulnerabilities, 20 hosts, and 6 subnets.

However, current methods struggle to fully leverage the textual\nmodality, relying on supervised pretrained models, which limits semantic\nextraction in unsupervised robotic environments, particularly with significant\nmodality loss. These methods also tend to be computationally intensive, leading\nto high resource consumption in real-world applications. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Multi Modal Mamba Enhanced Transformer (M3ET), a\nlightweight model designed for efficient multimodal learning, particularly on\nmobile platforms. By incorporating the Mamba module and a semantic-based\nadaptive attention mechanism, M3ET optimizes feature fusion, alignment, and\nmodality reconstruction. Our experiments show that M3ET improves cross-task\nperformance, with a 2.3 times increase in pretraining inference speed. In\nparticular, the core VQA task accuracy of M3ET remains at 0.74, while the\nmodel's parameter count is reduced by 0.67. Although performance on the EQA\ntask is limited, M3ET's lightweight design makes it well suited for deployment\non resource-constrained robotic platforms.",

In this paper,\nwe study generative verifiers, which perform verification by generating\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning followed by a binary verdict. We\nsystematically analyze verification dynamics across three dimensions - problem\ndifficulty, generator capability, and verifier generation capability - with\nempirical studies on 12 benchmarks across mathematical reasoning, knowledge,\nand natural language reasoning tasks using 14 open-source models (2B to 72B\nparameter range) and GPT-4o. Our experiments reveal three key findings about\nverification effectiveness: (1) Easy problems allow verifiers to more reliably\ncertify correct responses; (2) Weak generators produce errors that are easier\nto detect than strong generators; (3) Verification ability is generally\ncorrelated with the verifier's own problem-solving capability, but this\nrelationship varies with problem difficulty. These findings reveal\nopportunities to optimize basic verification strategies in TTS applications.\nFirst, given the same verifier, some weak generators can nearly match stronger\nones in post-verification TTS performance (e.g., the Gemma2-9B to Gemma2-27B\nperformance gap shrinks by 75.5%). Second, we identify cases where strong\nverifiers offer limited advantage over weak ones, as both fail to provide\nmeaningful verification gains, suggesting that verifier scaling alone cannot\novercome fundamental verification challenges.",

Despite these behaviours deviating from common\nnormative standards for belief updating, we argue that such 'biases' are not\ninherently cognitive flaws, but rather an adaptive response to the significant\npragmatic and cognitive costs associated with revising one's beliefs. This\npaper introduces a formal framework that aims to model the influence of these\ncosts on our belief updating mechanisms.\n  We treat belief updating as a motivated variational decision, where agents\nweigh the perceived 'utility' of a belief against the informational cost\nrequired to adopt a new belief state, quantified by the Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence from the prior to the variational posterior. We perform\ncomputational experiments to demonstrate that simple instantiations of this\nresource-rational model can be used to qualitatively emulate commonplace human\nbehaviours, including confirmation bias and attitude polarisation. In doing so,\nwe suggest that this framework makes steps toward a more holistic account of\nthe motivated Bayesian mechanics of belief change and provides practical\ninsights for predicting, compensating for, and correcting deviations from\ndesired belief updating processes.",

This\npaper introduces a formal framework that aims to model the influence of these\ncosts on our belief updating mechanisms.\n  We treat belief updating as a motivated variational decision, where agents\nweigh the perceived 'utility' of a belief against the informational cost\nrequired to adopt a new belief state, quantified by the Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence from the prior to the variational posterior. We perform\ncomputational experiments to demonstrate that simple instantiations of this\nresource-rational model can be used to qualitatively emulate commonplace human\nbehaviours, including confirmation bias and attitude polarisation. In doing so,\nwe suggest that this framework makes steps toward a more holistic account of\nthe motivated Bayesian mechanics of belief change and provides practical\ninsights for predicting, compensating for, and correcting deviations from\ndesired belief updating processes."

Meanwhile, scammers\ncontinually evolve their tactics by leveraging advances in Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to generate diverse scam variants that easily bypass existing\ndefenses.\n  To address this pressing problem, we introduce PsyScam, a benchmark designed\nto systematically capture the PTs employed in real-world scam reports, and\ninvestigate how LLMs can be utilized to generate variants of scams based on the\nPTs and the contexts provided by these scams. Specifically, we collect a wide\nrange of scam reports and ground its annotations of employed PTs in\nwell-established cognitive and psychological theories. We further demonstrate\nLLMs' capabilities in generating through two downstream tasks: scam completion,\nand scam augmentation. Experimental results show that PsyScam presents\nsignificant challenges to existing models in both detecting and generating scam\ncontent based on the PTs used by real-world scammers.

In this paper, we\nintroduce Orcust, a framework that integrates Principle-Constrained Reward\nModeling (PCRM) and Online VM-Grounded Trajectory Construction (OVTC) to\nenhance reasoning reliability and data efficiency in interactive GUI tasks.

At the same time, the ability of Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to process dialects remains largely understudied. To address this gap,\nwe use Bavarian as a case study and investigate the lexical dialect\nunderstanding capability of LLMs by examining how well they recognize and\ntranslate dialectal terms across different parts-of-speech. To this end, we\nintroduce DiaLemma, a novel annotation framework for creating dialect variation\ndictionaries from monolingual data only, and use it to compile a ground truth\ndataset consisting of 100K human-annotated German-Bavarian word pairs. We\nevaluate how well nine state-of-the-art LLMs can judge Bavarian terms as\ndialect translations, inflected variants, or unrelated forms of a given German\nlemma.

At the same time, the ability of Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to process dialects remains largely understudied. To address this gap,\nwe use Bavarian as a case study and investigate the lexical dialect\nunderstanding capability of LLMs by examining how well they recognize and\ntranslate dialectal terms across different parts-of-speech. To this end, we\nintroduce DiaLemma, a novel annotation framework for creating dialect variation\ndictionaries from monolingual data only, and use it to compile a ground truth\ndataset consisting of 100K human-annotated German-Bavarian word pairs. We\nevaluate how well nine state-of-the-art LLMs can judge Bavarian terms as\ndialect translations, inflected variants, or unrelated forms of a given German\nlemma.

Synthetic CT (sCT) aims to translate CBCT to\nhigh-quality CT-like images for improved anatomical accuracy and dosimetric\nprecision. Although deep learning approaches have shown promise, they often\nface limitations in generalizability and detail preservation.

To address these challenges, we introduce\nthe FS-VisPR framework, an adaptive visual program reasoning approach that\nbalances fast reasoning for simple queries with slow reasoning for difficult\nones. First, we design efficient visual modules (e.g., key clip retrieval and\nsubtitle retrieval) to support long-form video tasks. Then, we construct a\ndiverse and high-quality fast-slow reasoning dataset with a strong LLM to align\nopen-source language models' ability to generate visual program workflows as\nFS-LLM. Next, we design a fast-slow reasoning framework with FS-LLM: Simple\nqueries are directly solved by VideoLLMs, while difficult ones invoke visual\nprogram reasoning, motivated by human-like reasoning processes. During this\nprocess, low-confidence fast-thinking answers will trigger a second-stage\nslow-reasoning process, and a fallback mechanism to fast reasoning is activated\nif the program execution fails. Moreover, we improve visual programs through\nparameter search during both training and inference. By adjusting the\nparameters of the visual modules within the program, multiple variants are\ngenerated: during training, programs that yield correct answers are selected,\nwhile during inference, the program with the highest confidence result is\napplied.

Experimental results show that our method reduces\ntool-use errors, achieving 3-12% relative improvements over strong baselines\nacross diverse model series and approaches. Moreover, our framework enhances\nthe robustness, interpretability, and transparency of tool-using agents,\nadvancing the development of more reliable AI assistants for real-world\napplications."

Specifically,\nwe use AlphaEvolve (an LLM coding agent) to study two settings:\n  a) Average-case hardness for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set: We improve a\nrecent result of Kunisky and Yu to obtain near-optimal upper and (conditional)\nlower bounds on certification algorithms for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set on\nrandom 3- and 4-regular graphs. Our improved lower bounds are obtained by\nconstructing nearly extremal Ramanujan graphs on as many as $163$ nodes, using\nAlphaEvolve. Additionally, via analytical arguments we strengthen the upper\nbounds to settle the computational hardness of these questions up to an error\nin the third decimal place.\n  b) Worst-case Hardness of Approximation for MAX-k-CUT: We obtain new\ninapproximability results, proving that it is NP-hard to approximate MAX-4-CUT\nand MAX-3-CUT within factors of $0.987$ and $0.9649$ respectively, using\nAlphaEvolve to discover new gadget reductions. Our MAX-4-CUT result improves\nupon the SOTA of $0.9883$, and our MAX-3-CUT result improves on the current\nbest gadget-based inapproximability result of $0.9853$, but falls short of\nimproving the SOTA of $16/17$ that relies on a custom PCP, rather than a gadget\nreduction from \"standard\" H{\\aa}stad-style PCPs.\n  A key technical challenge we faced: verifying a candidate construction\nproduced by AlphaEvolve is costly (often requiring exponential time). In both\nsettings above, our results were enabled by using AlphaEvolve itself to evolve\nthe verification procedure to be faster (sometimes by $10,000\\times$). We\nconclude with a discussion of norms by which to assess the assistance from AI\nin developing proofs.",

Specifically,\nwe use AlphaEvolve (an LLM coding agent) to study two settings:\n  a) Average-case hardness for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set: We improve a\nrecent result of Kunisky and Yu to obtain near-optimal upper and (conditional)\nlower bounds on certification algorithms for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set on\nrandom 3- and 4-regular graphs. Our improved lower bounds are obtained by\nconstructing nearly extremal Ramanujan graphs on as many as $163$ nodes, using\nAlphaEvolve. Additionally, via analytical arguments we strengthen the upper\nbounds to settle the computational hardness of these questions up to an error\nin the third decimal place.\n  b) Worst-case Hardness of Approximation for MAX-k-CUT: We obtain new\ninapproximability results, proving that it is NP-hard to approximate MAX-4-CUT\nand MAX-3-CUT within factors of $0.987$ and $0.9649$ respectively, using\nAlphaEvolve to discover new gadget reductions. Our MAX-4-CUT result improves\nupon the SOTA of $0.9883$, and our MAX-3-CUT result improves on the current\nbest gadget-based inapproximability result of $0.9853$, but falls short of\nimproving the SOTA of $16/17$ that relies on a custom PCP, rather than a gadget\nreduction from \"standard\" H{\\aa}stad-style PCPs.\n  A key technical challenge we faced: verifying a candidate construction\nproduced by AlphaEvolve is costly (often requiring exponential time). In both\nsettings above, our results were enabled by using AlphaEvolve itself to evolve\nthe verification procedure to be faster (sometimes by $10,000\\times$). We\nconclude with a discussion of norms by which to assess the assistance from AI\nin developing proofs."

However, such flexibility\nintroduces new vulnerabilities, such as switch misreporting led load imbalance,\nwhich in turn make such immersive environment vulnerable to severe quality\ndegradation. In this paper, we present a hybrid machine learning (ML)-based\nnetwork anomaly detection framework that identifies such stealthy misreporting\nby capturing temporal inconsistencies in switch-reported loads, and thereby\ncounter potentially catastrophic quality degradation of hosted immersive\napplication. The detection system combines unsupervised anomaly scoring with\nsupervised classification to robustly distinguish malicious behavior. Data\ncollected from a realistic testbed deployment under both benign and adversarial\nconditions is used to train and evaluate the model. Experimental results show\nthat the framework achieves high recall in detecting misreporting behavior,\nmaking it effective for early and reliable detection in SDN environments.",

                    "value": "The ability to centrally control network infrastructure using a programmable\nmiddleware has made Software-Defined Networking (SDN) ideal for emerging\napplications, such as immersive environments. However, such flexibility\nintroduces new vulnerabilities, such as switch misreporting led load imbalance,\nwhich in turn make such immersive environment vulnerable to severe quality\ndegradation. In this paper, we present a hybrid machine learning (ML)-based\nnetwork anomaly detection framework that identifies such stealthy misreporting\nby capturing temporal inconsistencies in switch-reported loads, and thereby\ncounter potentially catastrophic quality degradation of hosted immersive\napplication. The detection system combines unsupervised anomaly scoring with\nsupervised classification to robustly distinguish malicious behavior. Data\ncollected from a realistic testbed deployment under both benign and adversarial\nconditions is used to train and evaluate the model. Experimental results show\nthat the framework achieves high recall in detecting misreporting behavior,\nmaking it effective for early and reliable detection in SDN environments."

In networks, hybrid exploit chains are critical because of their linkable\nvulnerabilities. Moreover, developing hybrid exploit chains is challenging\nbecause it requires understanding the diverse and independent dependencies and\noutcomes. We present hybrid chains encompassing privilege escalation (PE) and\nremote code execution (RCE) exploits. These chains are executable and can span\nlarge networks, where numerous potential exploit combinations arise from the\nlarge array of network assets, their hardware, software, configurations, and\nvulnerabilities. The chains are generated by ALFA-Chains, an AI-supported\nframework for the automated discovery of multi-step PE and RCE exploit chains\nin networks across arbitrary environments and segmented networks. Through an\nLLM-based classification, ALFA-Chains describes exploits in Planning Domain\nDescription Language (PDDL). PDDL exploit and network descriptions then use\noff-the-shelf AI planners to find multiple exploit chains. ALFA-Chains finds 12\nunknown chains on an example with a known three-step chain. A red-team exercise\nvalidates the executability with Metasploit. ALFA-Chains is efficient, finding\nan exploit chain in 0.01 seconds in an enterprise network with 83\nvulnerabilities, 20 hosts, and 6 subnets. In addition, it is scalable, it finds\nan exploit chain in an industrial network with 114 vulnerabilities, 200 hosts,\nand 6 subnets in 3.16 seconds.

In this paper,\nwe study generative verifiers, which perform verification by generating\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning followed by a binary verdict. We\nsystematically analyze verification dynamics across three dimensions - problem\ndifficulty, generator capability, and verifier generation capability - with\nempirical studies on 12 benchmarks across mathematical reasoning, knowledge,\nand natural language reasoning tasks using 14 open-source models (2B to 72B\nparameter range) and GPT-4o. Our experiments reveal three key findings about\nverification effectiveness: (1) Easy problems allow verifiers to more reliably\ncertify correct responses; (2) Weak generators produce errors that are easier\nto detect than strong generators; (3) Verification ability is generally\ncorrelated with the verifier's own problem-solving capability, but this\nrelationship varies with problem difficulty. These findings reveal\nopportunities to optimize basic verification strategies in TTS applications.\nFirst, given the same verifier, some weak generators can nearly match stronger\nones in post-verification TTS performance (e.g., the Gemma2-9B to Gemma2-27B\nperformance gap shrinks by 75.5%). Second, we identify cases where strong\nverifiers offer limited advantage over weak ones, as both fail to provide\nmeaningful verification gains, suggesting that verifier scaling alone cannot\novercome fundamental verification challenges.",

To\nbridge this gap, we propose an evaluation framework rooted in learning sciences\nand tailored to asynchronous forum discussions, a common VTA deployment context\nin ALE. We construct classifiers using expert annotations of VTA responses on a\ndiverse set of forum posts. We evaluate the effectiveness of our classifiers,\nidentifying approaches that improve accuracy as well as challenges that hinder\ngeneralization. Our work establishes a foundation for theory-driven evaluation\nof VTA systems, paving the way for more pedagogically effective AI in\neducation."

Specifically, we collect a wide\nrange of scam reports and ground its annotations of employed PTs in\nwell-established cognitive and psychological theories. We further demonstrate\nLLMs' capabilities in generating through two downstream tasks: scam completion,\nand scam augmentation.

                "summary": "Scaling up the deployment of autonomous excavators is of great economic and\nsocietal importance. Yet it remains a challenging problem, as effective systems\nmust robustly handle unseen worksite conditions and new hardware\nconfigurations. Current state-of-the-art approaches rely on highly engineered,\ntask-specific controllers, which require extensive manual tuning for each new\nscenario. In contrast, recent advances in large-scale pretrained models have\nshown remarkable adaptability across tasks and embodiments in domains such as\nmanipulation and navigation, but their applicability to heavy construction\nmachinery remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce ExT, a unified\nopen-source framework for large-scale demonstration collection, pretraining,\nand fine-tuning of multitask excavation policies. ExT policies are first\ntrained on large-scale demonstrations collected from a mix of experts, then\nfine-tuned either with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning\nfine-tuning (RLFT) to specialize to new tasks or operating conditions. Through\nboth simulation and real-world experiments, we show that pretrained ExT\npolicies can execute complete excavation cycles with centimeter-level accuracy,\nsuccessfully transferring from simulation to real machine with performance\ncomparable to specialized single-task controllers. Furthermore, in simulation,\nwe demonstrate that ExT's fine-tuning pipelines allow rapid adaptation to new\ntasks, out-of-distribution conditions, and machine configurations, while\nmaintaining strong performance on previously learned tasks. These results\nhighlight the potential of ExT to serve as a foundation for scalable and\ngeneralizable autonomous excavation.",

                    "value": "Scaling up the deployment of autonomous excavators is of great economic and\nsocietal importance. Yet it remains a challenging problem, as effective systems\nmust robustly handle unseen worksite conditions and new hardware\nconfigurations. Current state-of-the-art approaches rely on highly engineered,\ntask-specific controllers, which require extensive manual tuning for each new\nscenario. In contrast, recent advances in large-scale pretrained models have\nshown remarkable adaptability across tasks and embodiments in domains such as\nmanipulation and navigation, but their applicability to heavy construction\nmachinery remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce ExT, a unified\nopen-source framework for large-scale demonstration collection, pretraining,\nand fine-tuning of multitask excavation policies. ExT policies are first\ntrained on large-scale demonstrations collected from a mix of experts, then\nfine-tuned either with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning\nfine-tuning (RLFT) to specialize to new tasks or operating conditions. Through\nboth simulation and real-world experiments, we show that pretrained ExT\npolicies can execute complete excavation cycles with centimeter-level accuracy,\nsuccessfully transferring from simulation to real machine with performance\ncomparable to specialized single-task controllers. Furthermore, in simulation,\nwe demonstrate that ExT's fine-tuning pipelines allow rapid adaptation to new\ntasks, out-of-distribution conditions, and machine configurations, while\nmaintaining strong performance on previously learned tasks. These results\nhighlight the potential of ExT to serve as a foundation for scalable and\ngeneralizable autonomous excavation."

The best way to study this significant phenomenon is\nby non-invasive monitoring of beehives using the sounds produced by various\nbody movements that give out audio signals which can be exploited for various\npredictions related to the objectives mentioned above. This study investigates\nthe application of Convolutional Neural Networks to classify and monitor\ndifferent hive states with the help of joint time and frequency image\nrepresentations such as Spectrogram, Mel-Spectrogram, Smoothed-Spectrogram, and\nCochleagram. Our findings indicate that the Cochleagram outperformed all the\nother representations, achieving an accuracy of 98.31% on unseen data.\nFurthermore, we employed various strategies including pruning, quantization,\nand knowledge distillation to optimize the network and prevent any potential\nissues with model size. With these optimizations, the network size was lowered\nby 91.8% and the inference time was accelerated by 66%, increasing its\nsuitability for real-time applications. Thus our study emphasizes the\nsignificance of using optimization approaches to minimize model size, avoid\ndeployment problems, and expedite inference for real-time application as well\nas the selection of an appropriate time-frequency representation for optimal\nperformance.",

However, previous approaches often rely on\nclosed-source models, lack systematic reasoning, and struggle with long-form\nvideo question answering (videoQA). To address these challenges, we introduce\nthe FS-VisPR framework, an adaptive visual program reasoning approach that\nbalances fast reasoning for simple queries with slow reasoning for difficult\nones. First, we design efficient visual modules (e.g., key clip retrieval and\nsubtitle retrieval) to support long-form video tasks. Then, we construct a\ndiverse and high-quality fast-slow reasoning dataset with a strong LLM to align\nopen-source language models' ability to generate visual program workflows as\nFS-LLM. Next, we design a fast-slow reasoning framework with FS-LLM: Simple\nqueries are directly solved by VideoLLMs, while difficult ones invoke visual\nprogram reasoning, motivated by human-like reasoning processes. During this\nprocess, low-confidence fast-thinking answers will trigger a second-stage\nslow-reasoning process, and a fallback mechanism to fast reasoning is activated\nif the program execution fails. Moreover, we improve visual programs through\nparameter search during both training and inference. By adjusting the\nparameters of the visual modules within the program, multiple variants are\ngenerated: during training, programs that yield correct answers are selected,\nwhile during inference, the program with the highest confidence result is\napplied. Experiments show that FS-VisPR improves both efficiency and\nreliability in visual program workflows.

Documents are\npre-encoded offline, while queries arrive in real-time, necessitating an\nefficient online query encoder. Although LLMs significantly enhance retrieval\ncapabilities, serving deeply parameterized LLMs slows down query inference\nthroughput and increases demands for online deployment resources. In this\npaper, we propose LightRetriever, a novel LLM-based retriever with extremely\nlightweight query encoders. Our method retains a full-sized LLM for document\nencoding, but reduces the workload of query encoding to no more than an\nembedding lookup. Compared to serving a full LLM on an A800 GPU, our method\nachieves over 1000x speedup in query encoding and over 10x increase in\nend-to-end retrieval throughput. Extensive experiments on large-scale retrieval\nbenchmarks show that LightRetriever generalizes well across diverse tasks,\nmaintaining an average of 95% retrieval performance.",

A held-out\npanel of LLM judges, including Claude 3.5 Haiku, evaluated solution quality\nusing a comparative framework. Results show a consistent gap, with English\nsolutions consistently rated highest, and Arabic often ranked lower. These\nfindings highlight persistent linguistic bias and the need for more equitable\nmultilingual AI systems in education."

OTAS addresses the limitations of\nopen-vocabulary segmentation models by extracting semantic structure directly\nfrom the output tokens of pre-trained vision models. By clustering semantically\nsimilar structures across single and multiple views and grounding them in\nlanguage, OTAS reconstructs a geometrically consistent feature field that\nsupports open-vocabulary segmentation queries. Our method operates in a\nzero-shot manner, without scene-specific fine-tuning, and achieves real-time\nperformance of up to ~17 fps. On the Off-Road Freespace Detection dataset, OTAS\nyields a modest IoU improvement over fine-tuned and open-vocabulary 2D\nsegmentation baselines. In 3D segmentation on TartanAir, it achieves up to a\n151% relative IoU improvement compared to existing open-vocabulary mapping\nmethods. Real-world reconstructions further demonstrate OTAS' applicability to\nrobotic deployment. Code and a ROS 2 node are available at\nhttps://otas-segmentation.github.io/.",

Direct transfer from data-rich to data-scarce cities is\nunreliable because only a limited subset of source patterns truly benefits the\ntarget domain, whereas indiscriminate transfer risks introducing noise and\nnegative transfer. We present STRATA-TS (Selective TRAnsfer via TArget-aware\nretrieval for Time Series), a framework that combines domain-adapted retrieval\nwith reasoning-capable large models to improve forecasting in scarce data\nregimes. STRATA-TS employs a patch-based temporal encoder to identify source\nsubsequences that are semantically and dynamically aligned with the target\nquery. These retrieved exemplars are then injected into a retrieval-guided\nreasoning stage, where an LLM performs structured inference over target inputs\nand retrieved support. To enable efficient deployment, we distill the reasoning\nprocess into a compact open model via supervised fine-tuning. Extensive\nexperiments on three parking availability datasets across Singapore,\nNottingham, and Glasgow demonstrate that STRATA-TS consistently outperforms\nstrong forecasting and transfer baselines, while providing interpretable\nknowledge transfer pathways.",

Direct transfer from data-rich to data-scarce cities is\nunreliable because only a limited subset of source patterns truly benefits the\ntarget domain, whereas indiscriminate transfer risks introducing noise and\nnegative transfer. We present STRATA-TS (Selective TRAnsfer via TArget-aware\nretrieval for Time Series), a framework that combines domain-adapted retrieval\nwith reasoning-capable large models to improve forecasting in scarce data\nregimes. STRATA-TS employs a patch-based temporal encoder to identify source\nsubsequences that are semantically and dynamically aligned with the target\nquery. These retrieved exemplars are then injected into a retrieval-guided\nreasoning stage, where an LLM performs structured inference over target inputs\nand retrieved support. To enable efficient deployment, we distill the reasoning\nprocess into a compact open model via supervised fine-tuning. Extensive\nexperiments on three parking availability datasets across Singapore,\nNottingham, and Glasgow demonstrate that STRATA-TS consistently outperforms\nstrong forecasting and transfer baselines, while providing interpretable\nknowledge transfer pathways."
