Their acceleration features, such as caches and\npipelining, often result in execution times below the worst-case. Thus, a\nprobabilistic approach ensuring constraint satisfaction within a probability\nthreshold is more suitable than worst-case guarantees for these systems.

Achieving this requires strong performance\nisolation to ensure that one container's RDMA workload does not degrade the\nperformance of others, thereby maintaining critical security assurances.\nHowever, existing isolation techniques are difficult to apply effectively due\nto the complexity of microarchitectural resource management within RDMA NICs\n(RNICs). This paper experimentally analyzes two types of resource exhaustion\nattacks on NVIDIA BlueField-3: (i) state saturation attacks and (ii) pipeline\nsaturation attacks. Our results show that state saturation attacks can cause up\nto a 93.9% loss in bandwidth, a 1,117x increase in latency, and a 115% rise in\ncache misses for victim containers, while pipeline saturation attacks lead to\nsevere link-level congestion and significant amplification, where small verb\nrequests result in disproportionately high resource consumption. To mitigate\nthese threats and restore predictable security assurances, we propose HT-Verbs,\na threshold-driven framework based on real-time per-container RDMA verb\ntelemetry and adaptive resource classification that partitions RNIC resources\ninto hot, warm, and cold tiers and throttles abusive workloads without\nrequiring hardware modifications.",

Achieving this requires strong performance\nisolation to ensure that one container's RDMA workload does not degrade the\nperformance of others, thereby maintaining critical security assurances.\nHowever, existing isolation techniques are difficult to apply effectively due\nto the complexity of microarchitectural resource management within RDMA NICs\n(RNICs). This paper experimentally analyzes two types of resource exhaustion\nattacks on NVIDIA BlueField-3: (i) state saturation attacks and (ii) pipeline\nsaturation attacks. Our results show that state saturation attacks can cause up\nto a 93.9% loss in bandwidth, a 1,117x increase in latency, and a 115% rise in\ncache misses for victim containers, while pipeline saturation attacks lead to\nsevere link-level congestion and significant amplification, where small verb\nrequests result in disproportionately high resource consumption. To mitigate\nthese threats and restore predictable security assurances, we propose HT-Verbs,\na threshold-driven framework based on real-time per-container RDMA verb\ntelemetry and adaptive resource classification that partitions RNIC resources\ninto hot, warm, and cold tiers and throttles abusive workloads without\nrequiring hardware modifications."

Long video generation presents\nchallenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing\nmodels can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to\nbidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for\nfaster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory\nchallenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based\ngeneration, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are\ncritical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in\nreal time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,\nespecially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt\ntransitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level\nAR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states\nwith new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable\nlong video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);\nand short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as\nframe sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.\nWith these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model\nto minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains\n20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both\nshort and long videos.

We envision a future where\nInternet communication will be dominated by \"prompts\" sent to generative AI\nmodels. For this, we will need proxies that provide similar functions to HTTP\nproxies (e.g., caching, routing, compression) while dealing with unique\nchallenges and opportunities of prompt-based communication. As a first step\ntoward supporting prompt-based communication, we present LLMBridge, an LLM\nproxy designed for cost-conscious users, such as those in developing regions\nand education (e.g., students, instructors). LLMBridge supports three key\noptimizations: model selection (routing prompts to the most suitable model),\ncontext management (intelligently reducing the amount of context), and semantic\ncaching (serving prompts using local models and vector databases). These\noptimizations introduce trade-offs between cost and quality, which applications\nnavigate through a high-level, bidirectional interface. As case studies, we\ndeploy LLMBridge in two cost-sensitive settings: a WhatsApp-based Q&A service\nand a university classroom environment. The WhatsApp service has been live for\nover twelve months, serving 100+ users and handling more than 14.7K requests.\nIn parallel, we exposed LLMBridge to students across three computer science\ncourses over a semester, where it supported diverse LLM-powered applications -\nsuch as reasoning agents and chatbots - and handled an average of 500 requests\nper day. We report on deployment experiences across both settings and use the\ncollected workloads to benchmark the effectiveness of various cost-optimization\nstrategies, analyzing their trade-offs in cost, latency, and response quality.",

To enable efficient inference, we design a\nstreaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory\nstructure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic\nretrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional\nKV-cache.

The\ndesign principles and characterization techniques presented here are broadly\napplicable to precision measurements probing fundamental symmetries in\nmolecules, atoms, and neutrons."

Our method employs\ndual-dimension detection combining efficient grayscale pixel difference\nanalysis with attention-based semantic relevance assessment, enabling selective\ntemporal token fusion through hard fusion strategies and keyframe anchoring to\nprevent error accumulation.

Our method employs\ndual-dimension detection combining efficient grayscale pixel difference\nanalysis with attention-based semantic relevance assessment, enabling selective\ntemporal token fusion through hard fusion strategies and keyframe anchoring to\nprevent error accumulation. Comprehensive experiments across LIBERO,\nSimplerEnv, and real robot tasks demonstrate consistent improvements: 4.0\npercentage points average on LIBERO (72.4\\% vs 68.4\\% baseline),\ncross-environment validation on SimplerEnv (4.8\\% relative improvement), and\n8.7\\% relative improvement on real robot tasks. Our approach proves\nmodel-agnostic, working across OpenVLA and VLA-Cache architectures. Notably,\nTTF reveals that selective Query matrix reuse in attention mechanisms enhances\nrather than compromises performance, suggesting promising directions for direct\nKQV matrix reuse strategies that achieve computational acceleration while\nimproving task success rates."

Current context compression methods predominantly rely on\nautoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress\ncontextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to\nacquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a\nfundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge\nfrom actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial\nfor real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel\nmethod that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture\nthat is equipped with this compression capability \\textit{a priori}. Instead of\ntraining models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly\nselects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates\ncontextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving\nrepresentations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need\nfor autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly\nleveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor\nembeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2)\nbidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture\ninformation from the entire context. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC\nconsistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various\ncompression ratios.

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various\ndomains, yet deploying them on mobile devices remains an arduous challenge due\nto their extensive computational and memory demands. While lightweight LLMs\nhave been developed to fit mobile environments, they suffer from degraded model\naccuracy. In contrast, sparsity-based techniques minimize DRAM usage by\nselectively transferring only relevant neurons to DRAM while retaining the full\nmodel in external storage, such as flash. However, such approaches are\ncritically limited by numerous I/O operations, particularly on smartphones with\nsevere IOPS constraints.\n  In this paper, we propose Neuralink, a novel approach that accelerates LLM\ninference on smartphones by optimizing neuron placement in flash memory.\nNeuralink leverages the concept of Neuron Co-Activation, where neurons\nfrequently activated together are linked to facilitate continuous read access\nand optimize I/O efficiency.

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various\ndomains, yet deploying them on mobile devices remains an arduous challenge due\nto their extensive computational and memory demands. While lightweight LLMs\nhave been developed to fit mobile environments, they suffer from degraded model\naccuracy. In contrast, sparsity-based techniques minimize DRAM usage by\nselectively transferring only relevant neurons to DRAM while retaining the full\nmodel in external storage, such as flash. However, such approaches are\ncritically limited by numerous I/O operations, particularly on smartphones with\nsevere IOPS constraints.\n  In this paper, we propose Neuralink, a novel approach that accelerates LLM\ninference on smartphones by optimizing neuron placement in flash memory.\nNeuralink leverages the concept of Neuron Co-Activation, where neurons\nfrequently activated together are linked to facilitate continuous read access\nand optimize I/O efficiency.

                "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown that generative pretraining can\ndistill vast world knowledge into compact token representations. While LLMs\nencapsulate extensive world knowledge, they remain limited in modeling the\nbehavioral knowledge contained within user interaction histories. User behavior\nforms a distinct modality, where each action, defined by multi-dimensional\nattributes such as time, context, and transaction type, constitutes a\nbehavioral token. Modeling these high-cardinality sequences is challenging, and\ndiscriminative models often falter under limited supervision. To bridge this\ngap, we extend generative pretraining to user behavior, learning transferable\nrepresentations from unlabeled behavioral data analogous to how LLMs learn from\ntext.

While LLMs\nencapsulate extensive world knowledge, they remain limited in modeling the\nbehavioral knowledge contained within user interaction histories. User behavior\nforms a distinct modality, where each action, defined by multi-dimensional\nattributes such as time, context, and transaction type, constitutes a\nbehavioral token. Modeling these high-cardinality sequences is challenging, and\ndiscriminative models often falter under limited supervision. To bridge this\ngap, we extend generative pretraining to user behavior, learning transferable\nrepresentations from unlabeled behavioral data analogous to how LLMs learn from\ntext.

In this paper we describe our efforts in\nporting an Intel x86-64 benchmark suite for cache-based timing vulnerabilities\nto RISC-V. We then use this benchmark to evaluate the security of three\ncommercially available RISC-V processors, the T-Head C910 and the SiFive U54\nand U74 cores. We observe that the C910 processor exhibits more distinct timing\ntypes than the other processors, leading to the assumption that code running on\nthe C910 would be exposed to more microarchitectural vulnerability sources. In\naddition, our evaluation reveals that $65.9\\%$ of the vulnerabilities covered\nby the benchmark exist in all processors, while only $6.8\\%$ are absent from\nall cores. Our work, in particular the ported benchmark, aims to support RISC-V\nprocessor designers to identify leakage sources early in their designs and to\nsupport the development of countermeasures.",

However, it exhibits low communication efficiency,\nrestricting its practical applicability. This inefficiency stems from the\nmismatch between the Ring AllGather communication primitive it adopts and the\nAlltoAll topology of modern accelerators. A Ring AllGather primitive is\ncomposed of iterations of ring-styled data transfer, which can only utilize a\nvery limited fraction of an AlltoAll topology.\n  Inspired by the Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs, we\nidentify that modern accelerator topology can be decomposed into multiple\northogonal ring datapaths which can concurrently transfer data without\ninterference. Based on this, we further observe that the Ring AllGather\nprimitive can also be decomposed into the same number of concurrent ring-styled\ndata transfer at every iteration. Based on these insights, we propose TASP, a\ntopology-aware SP method for long-context LLMs that fully utilizes the\ncommunication capacity of modern accelerators via topology decomposition and\nprimitive decomposition. Experimental results on both single-node and\nmulti-node NVIDIA H100 systems and a single-node AMD MI300X system demonstrate\nthat TASP achieves higher communication efficiency than Ring Attention on these\nmodern accelerator topologies and achieves up to 3.58 speedup than Ring\nAttention and its variant Zigzag-Ring Attention.

Stacked\nintelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have emerged as a promising technology for\nadvanced wave-domain signal processing, where mobile SIMs can outperform fixed\ncounterparts. In this paper, we propose a novel unmanned aerial vehicle\n(UAV)-mounted SIM (UAV-SIM) assisted communication system within low-altitude\neconomy (LAE) networks, where UAVs act as both cache-enabled base stations and\nmobile SIM carriers to enhance uplink transmissions. To maximize network\ncapacity, we formulate a UAV-SIM-based joint optimization problem (USBJOP) that\nintegrates user association, UAV-SIM three-dimensional positioning, and\nmulti-layer SIM phase shift design. Due to the non-convexity and NP-hardness of\nUSBJOP, we decompose it into three subproblems, which are the association\nbetween UAV-SIMs and users optimization problem (AUUOP), the UAV location\noptimization problem (ULOP), and the UAV-SIM phase shifts optimization problem\n(USPSOP). Then, we solve them through an alternating optimization strategy.\nSpecifically, AUUOP and ULOP are transformed into convex forms solvable via the\nCVX tool, while USPSOP is addressed by a generative artificial intelligence\n(GAI)-based hybrid optimization algorithm. Simulation results show that the\nproposed approach achieves approximately 1.5 times higher network capacity\ncompared with suboptimal schemes, effectively mitigates multi-user interference\nwith increasing SIM layers and meta-atoms, and reduces runtime by 10\\% while\nmaintaining solution quality, thereby demonstrating its practicality for\nreal-world deployments.",

To address this gap, we introduce\nAudioMarathon, a benchmark designed to evaluate both understanding and\ninference efficiency on long-form audio. AudioMarathon provides a diverse set\nof tasks built upon three pillars: long-context audio inputs with durations\nranging from 90.0 to 300.0 seconds, which correspond to encoded sequences of\n2,250 to 7,500 audio tokens, respectively, full domain coverage across speech,\nsound, and music, and complex reasoning that requires multi-hop inference. We\nevaluate state-of-the-art LALMs and observe clear performance drops as audio\nlength grows. We also study acceleration techniques and analyze the trade-offs\nof token pruning and KV cache eviction. The results show large gaps across\ncurrent LALMs and highlight the need for better temporal reasoning and\nmemory-efficient architectures.

While recent methods have explored quantizing the cache,\nevicting tokens, or using binary sketches for keys (e.g., Loki), these\napproaches often provide an incomplete solution by leaving one component (like\nvalues) uncompressed or by discarding context information. This paper\nintroduces the Hybrid One-Bit KV Cache (H1B-KV), a comprehensive compression\nscheme that radically reduces memory usage without sacrificing context. H1B-KV\nrepresents each key vector using a 1-bit binary sketch, enabling\nhardware-friendly bitwise attention, and further compresses value vectors using\n4-bit quantization. This holistic, hybrid approach allows a 7-billion parameter\nLLM to handle an 8k-token context with under 60 MB of cache memory - a 70x\nreduction. We demonstrate that after a lightweight finetuning, H1B-KV matches\nfull-precision performance not only on perplexity benchmarks but also on\ncomplex downstream tasks like mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), multi-task\nunderstanding (MMLU), and code generation (HumanEval). Our results show H1B-KV\nsignificantly outperforms leading quantization (KIVI), token eviction\n(SparseLLM), and key-only sketching (Loki) methods in quality-per-byte,\nestablishing it as a robust solution for deploying LLMs in memory-constrained\nenvironments.",

While recent methods have explored quantizing the cache,\nevicting tokens, or using binary sketches for keys (e.g., Loki), these\napproaches often provide an incomplete solution by leaving one component (like\nvalues) uncompressed or by discarding context information. This paper\nintroduces the Hybrid One-Bit KV Cache (H1B-KV), a comprehensive compression\nscheme that radically reduces memory usage without sacrificing context. H1B-KV\nrepresents each key vector using a 1-bit binary sketch, enabling\nhardware-friendly bitwise attention, and further compresses value vectors using\n4-bit quantization. This holistic, hybrid approach allows a 7-billion parameter\nLLM to handle an 8k-token context with under 60 MB of cache memory - a 70x\nreduction. We demonstrate that after a lightweight finetuning, H1B-KV matches\nfull-precision performance not only on perplexity benchmarks but also on\ncomplex downstream tasks like mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), multi-task\nunderstanding (MMLU), and code generation (HumanEval). Our results show H1B-KV\nsignificantly outperforms leading quantization (KIVI), token eviction\n(SparseLLM), and key-only sketching (Loki) methods in quality-per-byte,\nestablishing it as a robust solution for deploying LLMs in memory-constrained\nenvironments."

Our threshold-based\nstrategy optimizes probing and scheduling, significantly improving average\nsystem throughput by exploiting cooperative caching, satellite-terrestrial link\ntransmission, and time diversity from dynamic user requests. Simulation results\nvalidate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed strategies."

Our experiments focus on\nthe low-resource Indic language Hindi and compare translations generated by\nGoogle Cloud Translation (GCP) and Llama-3.1-405B. The results highlight the\npromise of selective translation as a practical and effective method for\nimproving multilingual alignment in LLMs."

To address this, we introduce the\nGAPS framework, a multidimensional paradigm for evaluating \\textbf{G}rounding\n(cognitive depth), \\textbf{A}dequacy (answer completeness),\n\\textbf{P}erturbation (robustness), and \\textbf{S}afety. Critically, we\ndeveloped a fully automated, guideline-anchored pipeline to construct a\nGAPS-aligned benchmark end-to-end, overcoming the scalability and subjectivity\nlimitations of prior work. Our pipeline assembles an evidence neighborhood,\ncreates dual graph and tree representations, and automatically generates\nquestions across G-levels. Rubrics are synthesized by a DeepResearch agent that\nmimics GRADE-consistent, PICO-driven evidence review in a ReAct loop. Scoring\nis performed by an ensemble of large language model (LLM) judges. Validation\nconfirmed our automated questions are high-quality and align with clinician\njudgment. Evaluating state-of-the-art models on the benchmark revealed key\nfailure modes: performance degrades sharply with increased reasoning depth\n(G-axis), models struggle with answer completeness (A-axis), and they are\nhighly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations (P-axis) as well as certain\nsafety issues (S-axis). This automated, clinically-grounded approach provides a\nreproducible and scalable method for rigorously evaluating AI clinician systems\nand guiding their development toward safer, more reliable clinical practice.",

To address this, we introduce the\nGAPS framework, a multidimensional paradigm for evaluating \\textbf{G}rounding\n(cognitive depth), \\textbf{A}dequacy (answer completeness),\n\\textbf{P}erturbation (robustness), and \\textbf{S}afety. Critically, we\ndeveloped a fully automated, guideline-anchored pipeline to construct a\nGAPS-aligned benchmark end-to-end, overcoming the scalability and subjectivity\nlimitations of prior work. Our pipeline assembles an evidence neighborhood,\ncreates dual graph and tree representations, and automatically generates\nquestions across G-levels. Rubrics are synthesized by a DeepResearch agent that\nmimics GRADE-consistent, PICO-driven evidence review in a ReAct loop. Scoring\nis performed by an ensemble of large language model (LLM) judges. Validation\nconfirmed our automated questions are high-quality and align with clinician\njudgment. Evaluating state-of-the-art models on the benchmark revealed key\nfailure modes: performance degrades sharply with increased reasoning depth\n(G-axis), models struggle with answer completeness (A-axis), and they are\nhighly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations (P-axis) as well as certain\nsafety issues (S-axis). This automated, clinically-grounded approach provides a\nreproducible and scalable method for rigorously evaluating AI clinician systems\nand guiding their development toward safer, more reliable clinical practice."

This study analyzed confirmed dengue cases in\nRecife from 2015 to 2024 using a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model\nimplemented in R-INLA, combining a BYM2 spatial structure with an RW1 temporal\ncomponent. Covariates included population density, household size, income,\ndrainage channels, lagged precipitation, and mean temperature. Population\ndensity and household size had positive effects on dengue risk, while income\nand channel presence were protective. Lagged precipitation increased risk, and\nhigher temperatures showed an inverse association, suggesting thermal\nthresholds for vector activity. The model achieved good fit (DIC=65817;\nWAIC=64506) and stable convergence, with moderate residual spatial\nautocorrelation (phi=0.06) and a smooth temporal trend between 2016 and 2019.\nSpatio-temporal estimates revealed persistent high-risk clusters in northern\nand western Recife, overlapping with areas of higher density and social\nvulnerability. Beyond reproducing historical patterns, the Bayesian model\nsupports probabilistic forecasting and early warning systems.

The method learns a dynamic, block-triangular velocity field in the\njoint space of data and parameters, which results in a deterministic transport\nmap from a source distribution to the desired posterior. The inverse map, named\nvector rank, is accessible by reversibly integrating the velocity over time. It\nis advantageous to leverage the dynamic design: proper constraints on the\nvelocity yield a monotone map, which leads to a conditional Brenier map,\nenabling a fast and simultaneous generation of Bayesian credible sets whose\ncontours correspond to level sets of Monge-Kantorovich data depth. Our approach\nis computationally lighter compared to GAN-based and diffusion-based\ncounterparts, and is capable of capturing complex posterior structures.\nFinally, frequentist theoretical guarantee on the consistency of the recovered\nposterior distribution, and of the corresponding Bayesian credible sets, is\nprovided.",

The method learns a dynamic, block-triangular velocity field in the\njoint space of data and parameters, which results in a deterministic transport\nmap from a source distribution to the desired posterior. The inverse map, named\nvector rank, is accessible by reversibly integrating the velocity over time. It\nis advantageous to leverage the dynamic design: proper constraints on the\nvelocity yield a monotone map, which leads to a conditional Brenier map,\nenabling a fast and simultaneous generation of Bayesian credible sets whose\ncontours correspond to level sets of Monge-Kantorovich data depth. Our approach\nis computationally lighter compared to GAN-based and diffusion-based\ncounterparts, and is capable of capturing complex posterior structures.\nFinally, frequentist theoretical guarantee on the consistency of the recovered\nposterior distribution, and of the corresponding Bayesian credible sets, is\nprovided."

                "summary": "Continual learning is an online paradigm where a learner continually\naccumulates knowledge from different tasks encountered over sequential time\nsteps. Importantly, the learner is required to extend and update its knowledge\nwithout forgetting about the learning experience acquired from the past, and\nwhile avoiding the need to retrain from scratch. Given its sequential nature\nand its resemblance to the way humans think, continual learning offers an\nopportunity to address several challenges which currently stand in the way of\nwidening the range of applicability of deep models to further real-world\nproblems. The continual need to update the learner with data arriving\nsequentially strikes inherent congruence between continual learning and\nBayesian inference which provides a principal platform to keep updating the\nprior beliefs of a model given new data, without completely forgetting the\nknowledge acquired from the old data. This survey inspects different settings\nof Bayesian continual learning, namely task-incremental learning and\nclass-incremental learning. We begin by discussing definitions of continual\nlearning along with its Bayesian setting, as well as the links with related\nfields, such as domain adaptation, transfer learning and meta-learning.\nAfterwards, we introduce a taxonomy offering a comprehensive categorization of\nalgorithms belonging to the Bayesian continual learning paradigm. Meanwhile, we\nanalyze the state-of-the-art while zooming in on some of the most prominent\nBayesian continual learning algorithms to date. Furthermore, we shed some light\non links between continual learning and developmental psychology, and\ncorrespondingly introduce analogies between both fields. We follow that with a\ndiscussion of current challenges, and finally conclude with potential areas for\nfuture research on Bayesian continual learning.",

For semantic\nscene understanding tasks, we categorize fusion approaches into encoder-decoder\nframeworks, attention-based architectures, and graph neural networks.\nMeanwhile, we also analyze the architectural characteristics and practical\nimplementations of these fusion strategies in key tasks such as simultaneous\nlocalization and mapping (SLAM), 3D object detection, navigation, and\nmanipulation. We compare the evolutionary paths and applicability of VLMs based\non large language models (LLMs) with traditional multimodal fusion\nmethods.Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of commonly used\ndatasets, evaluating their applicability and challenges in real-world robotic\nscenarios. Building on this analysis, we identify key challenges in current\nresearch, including cross-modal alignment, efficient fusion, real-time\ndeployment, and domain adaptation. We propose future directions such as\nself-supervised learning for robust multimodal representations, structured\nspatial memory and environment modeling to enhance spatial intelligence, and\nthe integration of adversarial robustness and human feedback mechanisms to\nenable ethically aligned system deployment.

Existing benchmarks often do not\nfully capture the unique challenges of decentralized coordination when agents\noperate with incomplete spatio-temporal information. To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce SwarmBench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the\nswarm intelligence capabilities of LLMs acting as decentralized agents.\nSwarmBench features five foundational MAS coordination tasks (Pursuit,\nSynchronization, Foraging, Flocking, Transport) within a configurable 2D grid\nenvironment, forcing agents to rely solely on local sensory input ($k\\times k$\nview) and local communication. We propose metrics for coordination\neffectiveness and analyze emergent group dynamics. Zero-shot evaluations of\nleading LLMs (e.g., deepseek-v3, o4-mini) reveal significant task-dependent\nperformance variations. While some rudimentary coordination is observed, our\nresults indicate that current LLMs significantly struggle with robust\nlong-range planning and adaptive strategy formation under the uncertainty\ninherent in these decentralized scenarios. Assessing LLMs under such swarm-like\nconstraints is crucial for understanding their utility in future decentralized\nintelligent systems. We release SwarmBench as an open, extensible toolkit-built\non a customizable physical system-providing environments, prompts, evaluation\nscripts, and comprehensive datasets. This aims to foster reproducible research\ninto LLM-based MAS coordination and the theoretical underpinnings of emergent\ncollective behavior under severe informational decentralization.

To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce SwarmBench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the\nswarm intelligence capabilities of LLMs acting as decentralized agents.\nSwarmBench features five foundational MAS coordination tasks (Pursuit,\nSynchronization, Foraging, Flocking, Transport) within a configurable 2D grid\nenvironment, forcing agents to rely solely on local sensory input ($k\\times k$\nview) and local communication. We propose metrics for coordination\neffectiveness and analyze emergent group dynamics. Zero-shot evaluations of\nleading LLMs (e.g., deepseek-v3, o4-mini) reveal significant task-dependent\nperformance variations. While some rudimentary coordination is observed, our\nresults indicate that current LLMs significantly struggle with robust\nlong-range planning and adaptive strategy formation under the uncertainty\ninherent in these decentralized scenarios. Assessing LLMs under such swarm-like\nconstraints is crucial for understanding their utility in future decentralized\nintelligent systems. We release SwarmBench as an open, extensible toolkit-built\non a customizable physical system-providing environments, prompts, evaluation\nscripts, and comprehensive datasets. This aims to foster reproducible research\ninto LLM-based MAS coordination and the theoretical underpinnings of emergent\ncollective behavior under severe informational decentralization.

Instead, they are characterized by interwoven\nand often conflicting perspectives, divergent concerns, goals, emotional\ntendencies, as well as implicit assumptions and background knowledge about\nusage scenarios. To accurately understand such explicit public intent, an LLM\nmust go beyond parsing individual sentences; it must integrate multi-source\nsignals, reason over inconsistencies, and adapt to evolving discourse, similar\nto how experts in fields like politics, economics, or finance approach complex,\nuncertain environments. Despite the importance of this capability, no\nlarge-scale benchmark currently exists for evaluating LLMs on real-world human\nintent understanding, primarily due to the challenges of collecting real-world\npublic discussion data and constructing a robust evaluation pipeline. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce \\bench, the first dynamic, live evaluation benchmark\nspecifically designed for intent understanding, particularly in the consumer\ndomain. \\bench is the largest and most diverse benchmark of its kind,\nsupporting real-time updates while preventing data contamination through an\nautomated curation pipeline."

Informing our\nlikelihood function with the NS radius data from GW170817 and using a\nmeta-model with 9-parameters capable of mimicking most NS EOSs available in the\nliterature, we conduct a Bayesian quantification of the observability and\nunderlying EOSs of twin stars.

Standard tidal models reproduce Weywot's semimajor axis\nbut cannot account for Quaoar's slow 17.7hr rotation without invoking an\nunrealistically massive satellite or external torques, suggesting that\nnon-tidal processes - such as a largely primordial spin, early satellite loss,\nor a retrograde secondary giant impact - must have influenced Quaoar's\nrotational evolution."

Nevertheless, most methods\noften assume identical encoders for all agents, which does not hold true when\nthese models are deployed in real-world applications. To realize collaborative\nperception in actual heterogeneous scenarios, existing methods usually align\nneighbor features to those of the ego vehicle, which is vulnerable to noise\nfrom domain gaps and thus fails to address feature discrepancies effectively.\nMoreover, they adopt transformer-based modules for domain adaptation, which\ncauses the model inference inefficiency on mobile devices. To tackle these\nissues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages\nDomain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios.\nThe CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight\nSpatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation\n(DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI)\nloss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the\nneighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight\nconvolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution\ndiscrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation\nmodules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter\ncaptures task-related information.

We\nexplore to what extent this latent correction capability extends to Automated\nProgram Repair (APR) by investigating Round-Trip Translation (RTT): translating\ncode from one programming language into another programming or natural language\nand back, using Large Language Models (LLMs). We hypothesize that RTT restores\npatterns most commonly seen in the LLM's training corpora through regression\ntoward the mean, replacing infrequent bugs with more frequent, natural,\nbug-free code. To test this hypothesis, we employ nine LLMs and four common APR\nbenchmarks in Java, and perform a detailed quantitative and qualitative\nanalysis of RTT-generated patches.

To address this\nstorage bottleneck, we present AdaLog, a lightweight and adaptive system\ndesigned to improve the storage efficiency of user behavior log in ML-embedded\nmobile apps, without compromising model inference accuracy or latency.

To\nsolve these issues, AdaLog first formulates the elimination of feature-level\nredundant data as a maximum weighted matching problem in hypergraphs, and\nproposes a hierarchical algorithm for efficient on-device deployment. Then,\nAdaLog employs a virtually hashed attribute design to distribute heterogeneous\nbehaviors into a few log files with physically dense storage. Finally, to\nensure scalability to dynamic user behavior patterns, AdaLog designs an\nincremental update mechanism to minimize the I/O operations needed for adapting\noutdated behavior log. We implement a prototype of AdaLog and deploy it into\npopular mobile apps in collaboration with our industry partner.

However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains\nchallenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands.\nWhile post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted\ntechnique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely\nunexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing\ndiffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of\nactivation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that\ndominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit\nquantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority\nof values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model\nvariants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width,\nquantization method, task category, and model type. Through this\nmulti-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization\nbehavior of dLLMs under different configurations.

Our benchmarking indicates almost no accuracy loss between GPU and\nLoihi 2 implementations, while classification on Loihi 2 is up to 18x faster\nand uses 250x less energy than on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano."

We propose two dynamic and\nscalable pilot assignment strategies designed for practical deployment in such\nnetworks. First, we present a low complexity centralized algorithm that\nsequentially assigns pilots to user equipments (UEs) to minimize the global\nchannel estimation errors across serving access points (APs). This improves the\nchannel estimation quality and reduces interference among UEs, enhancing the\nspectral efficiency. Second, we develop a fully distributed algorithm that uses\na priority-based pilot selection approach. In this algorithm, each selected AP\nminimizes estimation error using only local information and offers candidate\npilots to the UEs. Every UE then selects a suitable pilot based on AP priority.\nThis approach ensures consistency and minimizes interference while\nsignificantly reducing pilot contamination. The method requires no global\ncoordination, maintains low signaling overhead, and adapts dynamically to the\nUE deployment. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority of our\nproposed schemes in terms of network throughput when compared to other\nstate-of-the-art benchmark schemes.",

                    "value": "Pilot contamination remains a major bottleneck in realizing the full\npotential of distributed massive MIMO systems. We propose two dynamic and\nscalable pilot assignment strategies designed for practical deployment in such\nnetworks. First, we present a low complexity centralized algorithm that\nsequentially assigns pilots to user equipments (UEs) to minimize the global\nchannel estimation errors across serving access points (APs). This improves the\nchannel estimation quality and reduces interference among UEs, enhancing the\nspectral efficiency. Second, we develop a fully distributed algorithm that uses\na priority-based pilot selection approach. In this algorithm, each selected AP\nminimizes estimation error using only local information and offers candidate\npilots to the UEs. Every UE then selects a suitable pilot based on AP priority.\nThis approach ensures consistency and minimizes interference while\nsignificantly reducing pilot contamination. The method requires no global\ncoordination, maintains low signaling overhead, and adapts dynamically to the\nUE deployment. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority of our\nproposed schemes in terms of network throughput when compared to other\nstate-of-the-art benchmark schemes."

Another advantage is the shared solutions between original and\nrevised problems: we explicitly guide the LLMs to generate distracting\nconditions that do not alter the original solutions, thus avoiding the need to\ngenerate new solutions. This framework is efficient and easy to deploy,\nreducing the overhead of generating MWPs with distracting conditions while\nmaintaining data quality."

Many recent detectors report\nnear-perfect accuracy, often boasting AUROC scores above 99\\%. However, these\nclaims typically assume fixed generation settings, leaving open the question of\nhow robust such systems are to changes in decoding strategies. In this work, we\nsystematically examine how sampling-based decoding impacts detectability, with\na focus on how subtle variations in a model's (sub)word-level distribution\naffect detection performance. We find that even minor adjustments to decoding\nparameters - such as temperature, top-p, or nucleus sampling - can severely\nimpair detector accuracy, with AUROC dropping from near-perfect levels to 1\\%\nin some settings. Our findings expose critical blind spots in current detection\nmethods and emphasize the need for more comprehensive evaluation protocols.

                    "value": "As texts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) are ever more common and\noften indistinguishable from human-written content, research on automatic text\ndetection has attracted growing attention. Many recent detectors report\nnear-perfect accuracy, often boasting AUROC scores above 99\\%. However, these\nclaims typically assume fixed generation settings, leaving open the question of\nhow robust such systems are to changes in decoding strategies. In this work, we\nsystematically examine how sampling-based decoding impacts detectability, with\na focus on how subtle variations in a model's (sub)word-level distribution\naffect detection performance. We find that even minor adjustments to decoding\nparameters - such as temperature, top-p, or nucleus sampling - can severely\nimpair detector accuracy, with AUROC dropping from near-perfect levels to 1\\%\nin some settings. Our findings expose critical blind spots in current detection\nmethods and emphasize the need for more comprehensive evaluation protocols.

However, these speech-adapted LLMs consistently underperform\ntheir text-based counterparts--and even cascaded pipelines--on language\nunderstanding tasks. We term this shortfall the text-speech understanding gap:\nthe performance drop observed when a speech-adapted LLM processes spoken inputs\nrelative to when the original text-based LLM processes the equivalent text.\nRecent approaches to narrowing this gap either rely on large-scale speech\nsynthesis of text corpora, which is costly and heavily dependent on synthetic\ndata, or on large-scale proprietary speech datasets, which are not\nreproducible. As a result, there remains a need for more data-efficient\nalternatives for closing the text-speech understanding gap. In this work, we\nanalyze the gap as driven by two factors: (i) forgetting of text capabilities\nduring adaptation, and (ii) cross-modal misalignment between speech and text.\nBased on this analysis, we introduce SALAD--Sample-efficient Alignment with\nLearning through Active selection and cross-modal Distillation--which combines\ncross-modal distillation with targeted synthetic data to improve alignment\nwhile mitigating forgetting. Applied to 3B and 7B LLMs, SALAD achieves\ncompetitive performance with a strong open-weight model across broad-domain\nbenchmarks in knowledge, language understanding, and reasoning, while training\non over an order of magnitude less speech data from public corpora.",

However, these speech-adapted LLMs consistently underperform\ntheir text-based counterparts--and even cascaded pipelines--on language\nunderstanding tasks. We term this shortfall the text-speech understanding gap:\nthe performance drop observed when a speech-adapted LLM processes spoken inputs\nrelative to when the original text-based LLM processes the equivalent text.\nRecent approaches to narrowing this gap either rely on large-scale speech\nsynthesis of text corpora, which is costly and heavily dependent on synthetic\ndata, or on large-scale proprietary speech datasets, which are not\nreproducible. As a result, there remains a need for more data-efficient\nalternatives for closing the text-speech understanding gap. In this work, we\nanalyze the gap as driven by two factors: (i) forgetting of text capabilities\nduring adaptation, and (ii) cross-modal misalignment between speech and text.\nBased on this analysis, we introduce SALAD--Sample-efficient Alignment with\nLearning through Active selection and cross-modal Distillation--which combines\ncross-modal distillation with targeted synthetic data to improve alignment\nwhile mitigating forgetting. Applied to 3B and 7B LLMs, SALAD achieves\ncompetitive performance with a strong open-weight model across broad-domain\nbenchmarks in knowledge, language understanding, and reasoning, while training\non over an order of magnitude less speech data from public corpora."

However, existing sparse attention methods leave a crucial\nlimitation unresolved: the size of the key-value (KV) cache remains unreduced,\nwhich constrains on-GPU batch sizes and throttles decoding throughput,\nespecially in large-scale batched inference. In this paper, we show that\ntrainable sparse attention naturally exhibits strong locality in token\nselection across adjacent decoding steps, thereby enabling KV cache offloading\nwithout altering the underlying attention computation. However, the inherent\nlocality remains insufficient to achieve efficient offloading, as the transfer\nof selected KV pairs between the CPU and GPU continues to dominate the overall\ndecoding cost. Building on this insight, we present NOSA, a trainable sparse\nattention framework designed to natively support KV cache offloading. NOSA\nintroduces explicit locality constraints by decomposing token selection into\nquery-aware and query-agnostic components, thereby reducing KV transfers while\npreserving the same attention computation as used during training.

                    "value": "Trainable sparse attention has emerged as a promising solution to address the\ndecoding efficiency bottleneck of LLMs in long-context processing,\nsignificantly saving memory accesses while minimally impacting task\nperformance. However, existing sparse attention methods leave a crucial\nlimitation unresolved: the size of the key-value (KV) cache remains unreduced,\nwhich constrains on-GPU batch sizes and throttles decoding throughput,\nespecially in large-scale batched inference. In this paper, we show that\ntrainable sparse attention naturally exhibits strong locality in token\nselection across adjacent decoding steps, thereby enabling KV cache offloading\nwithout altering the underlying attention computation. However, the inherent\nlocality remains insufficient to achieve efficient offloading, as the transfer\nof selected KV pairs between the CPU and GPU continues to dominate the overall\ndecoding cost. Building on this insight, we present NOSA, a trainable sparse\nattention framework designed to natively support KV cache offloading. NOSA\nintroduces explicit locality constraints by decomposing token selection into\nquery-aware and query-agnostic components, thereby reducing KV transfers while\npreserving the same attention computation as used during training. We pretrain\na 1B-parameter model with NOSA and conduct extensive benchmarks, showing that\nit preserves near-lossless performance while achieving up to a 2.3x improvement\nin decoding throughput compared with the vanilla trainable sparse attention\nbaseline (InfLLM-V2)."

Prior work on adversarial robustness in NLP has\nemphasized text attacks that affect many models equally, leaving open the\nquestion of whether it is possible to selectively degrade or enhance\nperformance while minimally affecting other models. We formalize this problem\nand study selective adversarial attacks on MMLU - a widely used benchmark\ndesigned to measure a language model's broad general knowledge and reasoning\nability across different subjects. Using canonical attacks integrated into\nTextAttack framework, we introduce a protocol for selectivity assessment,\ndevelop a custom constraint to increase selectivity of attacks and propose a\nsurrogate-LLM pipeline that generates selective perturbations. Empirically, we\nfind that selective adversarial attacks exist and can materially alter relative\nrankings, challenging the fairness, reproducibility, and transparency of\nleaderboard-driven evaluation. Our results motivate perturbation-aware\nreporting and robustness diagnostics for LLM evaluation and demonstrate that\neven subtle edits can shift comparative judgments.",

We formalize this problem\nand study selective adversarial attacks on MMLU - a widely used benchmark\ndesigned to measure a language model's broad general knowledge and reasoning\nability across different subjects. Using canonical attacks integrated into\nTextAttack framework, we introduce a protocol for selectivity assessment,\ndevelop a custom constraint to increase selectivity of attacks and propose a\nsurrogate-LLM pipeline that generates selective perturbations. Empirically, we\nfind that selective adversarial attacks exist and can materially alter relative\nrankings, challenging the fairness, reproducibility, and transparency of\nleaderboard-driven evaluation. Our results motivate perturbation-aware\nreporting and robustness diagnostics for LLM evaluation and demonstrate that\neven subtle edits can shift comparative judgments."

                "summary": "The reasoning pattern of Large language models (LLMs) remains opaque, and\nReinforcement learning (RL) typically applies uniform credit across an entire\ngeneration, blurring the distinction between pivotal and routine steps. This\nwork positions attention as a privileged substrate that renders the internal\nlogic of LLMs legible, not merely as a byproduct of computation, but as a\nmechanistic blueprint of reasoning itself. We first distinguish attention heads\nbetween locally and globally focused information processing and reveal that\nlocally focused heads produce a sawtooth pattern near the diagonal indicating\nphrasal chunks, while globally focused heads expose tokens that exert broad\ndownstream influence over future tokens. We formalize these with two metrics:\n1) Windowed Average Attention Distance, which measures the extent of backward\nattention within a clipped window; 2) Future Attention Influence, which\nquantifies a token's global importance as the average attention it receives\nfrom subsequent tokens. Taken together, these signals reveal a recurring\npreplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs a long-range\ncontextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediately\nfollowed by or coincides with a semantic anchor token that organizes subsequent\nreasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce three novel RL strategies\nthat dynamically perform targeted credit assignment to critical nodes (preplan\ntokens, anchor tokens, and their temporal coupling) and show consistent\nperformance gains across various reasoning tasks. By aligning optimization with\nthe model's intrinsic reasoning rhythm, we aim to transform opaque optimization\ninto an actionable structure-aware process, hoping to offer a potential step\ntoward more transparent and effective optimization of LLM reasoning.",

                    "value": "The reasoning pattern of Large language models (LLMs) remains opaque, and\nReinforcement learning (RL) typically applies uniform credit across an entire\ngeneration, blurring the distinction between pivotal and routine steps. This\nwork positions attention as a privileged substrate that renders the internal\nlogic of LLMs legible, not merely as a byproduct of computation, but as a\nmechanistic blueprint of reasoning itself. We first distinguish attention heads\nbetween locally and globally focused information processing and reveal that\nlocally focused heads produce a sawtooth pattern near the diagonal indicating\nphrasal chunks, while globally focused heads expose tokens that exert broad\ndownstream influence over future tokens. We formalize these with two metrics:\n1) Windowed Average Attention Distance, which measures the extent of backward\nattention within a clipped window; 2) Future Attention Influence, which\nquantifies a token's global importance as the average attention it receives\nfrom subsequent tokens. Taken together, these signals reveal a recurring\npreplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs a long-range\ncontextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediately\nfollowed by or coincides with a semantic anchor token that organizes subsequent\nreasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce three novel RL strategies\nthat dynamically perform targeted credit assignment to critical nodes (preplan\ntokens, anchor tokens, and their temporal coupling) and show consistent\nperformance gains across various reasoning tasks. By aligning optimization with\nthe model's intrinsic reasoning rhythm, we aim to transform opaque optimization\ninto an actionable structure-aware process, hoping to offer a potential step\ntoward more transparent and effective optimization of LLM reasoning."

Due to anycast's crucial role in the modern Internet,\nearlier research introduced tools to perform anycast censuses. The first,\niGreedy, uses latency measurements from geographically dispersed locations to\nmap anycast deployments. The second, MAnycast2, uses anycast to perform a\ncensus of other anycast networks. MAnycast2's advantage is speed and coverage\nbut suffers from problems with accuracy, while iGreedy is highly accurate but\nslower using author-defined probing rates and costlier.

Due to anycast's crucial role in the modern Internet,\nearlier research introduced tools to perform anycast censuses. The first,\niGreedy, uses latency measurements from geographically dispersed locations to\nmap anycast deployments. The second, MAnycast2, uses anycast to perform a\ncensus of other anycast networks. MAnycast2's advantage is speed and coverage\nbut suffers from problems with accuracy, while iGreedy is highly accurate but\nslower using author-defined probing rates and costlier.

Combining a bottom-up engineering\napproach with a short-run economic impact assessment, the study begins by\nmapping existing and emerging RECs in Italy. We identify key characteristics of\nRECs, such as average installed capacity, institutional profiles of members,\ntypes of renewable systems used, and distribution across Italy's electricity\nmarket zones. This mapping yields representative REC configurations, which are\nemployed within a bottom-up engineering model to generate energy injection and\nself-consumption profiles for different REC prosumer and producer categories\n(residential, public, small and medium enterprise, non-profit organization, and\nstandalone installation), considering the different levels of solar irradiance\nin Italy based on latitude. These zonal results, aggregated on an hourly basis,\ninform the implementation of the synthetic counterfactual approach, which\ndevelops alternative scenarios (e.g., 5 GW target for REC-driven capacity set\nby Italian policy for 2027) to assess the impact of REC-driven injection and\nself-consumption on the Italian day-ahead power market. The findings suggest\nthat REC deployment can increase equilibrium quantities during daylight in most\nof the time, while decreasing equilibrium quantities mostly during the cold\nmonths, as electrified heating drives greater self-consumption and offsets\nlower grid injections. Both positive and negative effects on equilibrium\nquantities suggest that REC deployment also has a potential to reduce wholesale\nelectricity prices. Moreover, by reducing grid exchanges through higher\nself-consumption, REC proliferation can alleviate pressure on the distribution\nsystem.",

                    "value": "This paper evaluates the economic impact of Renewable Energy Communities\n(RECs) on the Italian wholesale power market. Combining a bottom-up engineering\napproach with a short-run economic impact assessment, the study begins by\nmapping existing and emerging RECs in Italy. We identify key characteristics of\nRECs, such as average installed capacity, institutional profiles of members,\ntypes of renewable systems used, and distribution across Italy's electricity\nmarket zones. This mapping yields representative REC configurations, which are\nemployed within a bottom-up engineering model to generate energy injection and\nself-consumption profiles for different REC prosumer and producer categories\n(residential, public, small and medium enterprise, non-profit organization, and\nstandalone installation), considering the different levels of solar irradiance\nin Italy based on latitude. These zonal results, aggregated on an hourly basis,\ninform the implementation of the synthetic counterfactual approach, which\ndevelops alternative scenarios (e.g., 5 GW target for REC-driven capacity set\nby Italian policy for 2027) to assess the impact of REC-driven injection and\nself-consumption on the Italian day-ahead power market. The findings suggest\nthat REC deployment can increase equilibrium quantities during daylight in most\nof the time, while decreasing equilibrium quantities mostly during the cold\nmonths, as electrified heating drives greater self-consumption and offsets\nlower grid injections. Both positive and negative effects on equilibrium\nquantities suggest that REC deployment also has a potential to reduce wholesale\nelectricity prices. Moreover, by reducing grid exchanges through higher\nself-consumption, REC proliferation can alleviate pressure on the distribution\nsystem."

To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce SwarmBench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the\nswarm intelligence capabilities of LLMs acting as decentralized agents.\nSwarmBench features five foundational MAS coordination tasks (Pursuit,\nSynchronization, Foraging, Flocking, Transport) within a configurable 2D grid\nenvironment, forcing agents to rely solely on local sensory input ($k\\times k$\nview) and local communication. We propose metrics for coordination\neffectiveness and analyze emergent group dynamics. Zero-shot evaluations of\nleading LLMs (e.g., deepseek-v3, o4-mini) reveal significant task-dependent\nperformance variations. While some rudimentary coordination is observed, our\nresults indicate that current LLMs significantly struggle with robust\nlong-range planning and adaptive strategy formation under the uncertainty\ninherent in these decentralized scenarios. Assessing LLMs under such swarm-like\nconstraints is crucial for understanding their utility in future decentralized\nintelligent systems. We release SwarmBench as an open, extensible toolkit-built\non a customizable physical system-providing environments, prompts, evaluation\nscripts, and comprehensive datasets.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a\nstandard interface for such extensions, but current implementations rely solely\non semantic matching between users' requests and server function descriptions,\nwhich makes current deployments and simulation testbeds fragile under latency\nfluctuations or server failures.

Moreover,\nRTT uniquely generates plausible patches for 46 bugs that were missed by LLMs\nspecifically fine-tuned for APR. While this demonstrates the viability of RTT\nfor APR, we also observe limitations, such as a lower overall bug fix rate than\nthe state-of-the-art and diluting the original coding style. We analyze the\nimpact of these limitations and discuss the potential of using RTT as a\ncomplementary component in APR frameworks.

While this demonstrates the viability of RTT\nfor APR, we also observe limitations, such as a lower overall bug fix rate than\nthe state-of-the-art and diluting the original coding style. We analyze the\nimpact of these limitations and discuss the potential of using RTT as a\ncomplementary component in APR frameworks.

These models typically\nrely on rich input features derived from historical user behaviors to capture\nuser intents. However, as ML-driven services become more prevalent, recording\nnecessary user behavior data imposes substantial storage cost on mobile apps,\nleading to lower system responsiveness and more app uninstalls. To address this\nstorage bottleneck, we present AdaLog, a lightweight and adaptive system\ndesigned to improve the storage efficiency of user behavior log in ML-embedded\nmobile apps, without compromising model inference accuracy or latency. We\nidentify two key inefficiencies in current industrial practices of user\nbehavior log: (i) redundant logging of overlapping behavior data across\ndifferent features and models, and (ii) sparse storage caused by storing\nbehaviors with heterogeneous attribute descriptions in a single log file. To\nsolve these issues, AdaLog first formulates the elimination of feature-level\nredundant data as a maximum weighted matching problem in hypergraphs, and\nproposes a hierarchical algorithm for efficient on-device deployment. Then,\nAdaLog employs a virtually hashed attribute design to distribute heterogeneous\nbehaviors into a few log files with physically dense storage. Finally, to\nensure scalability to dynamic user behavior patterns, AdaLog designs an\nincremental update mechanism to minimize the I/O operations needed for adapting\noutdated behavior log. We implement a prototype of AdaLog and deploy it into\npopular mobile apps in collaboration with our industry partner. Evaluations on\nreal-world user data show that AdaLog reduces behavior log size by 19% to 44%\nwith minimal system overhead (only 2 seconds latency and 15 MB memory usage),\nproviding a more efficient data foundation for broader adoption of on-device\nML.",

                "summary": "WiFi-based gesture recognition has emerged as a promising RF sensing paradigm\nfor enabling non-contact and privacy-preserving human-computer interaction in\nAIoT environments. However, existing methods often suffer from limited\ngeneralization and semantic expressiveness due to the domain-sensitive nature\nof Channel State Information and the lack of high-level gesture abstraction. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel generalization framework, termed\nLarge-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment (GLSDA), which leverages\nthe semantic prior of pre-trained large foundation models to enhance gesture\nrepresentation learning in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.\nSpecifically, we first design a dual-path CSI encoding pipeline that captures\ngeometric and dynamic gesture patterns via CSI-Ratio phase sequences and\nDoppler spectrograms.

                    "value": "WiFi-based gesture recognition has emerged as a promising RF sensing paradigm\nfor enabling non-contact and privacy-preserving human-computer interaction in\nAIoT environments. However, existing methods often suffer from limited\ngeneralization and semantic expressiveness due to the domain-sensitive nature\nof Channel State Information and the lack of high-level gesture abstraction. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel generalization framework, termed\nLarge-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment (GLSDA), which leverages\nthe semantic prior of pre-trained large foundation models to enhance gesture\nrepresentation learning in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.\nSpecifically, we first design a dual-path CSI encoding pipeline that captures\ngeometric and dynamic gesture patterns via CSI-Ratio phase sequences and\nDoppler spectrograms. These representations are then fed into a Multiscale\nSemantic Encoder, which learns robust temporal embeddings and aligns them with\ngesture semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms.

In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and\nbackPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian\nprobabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using\ngradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables\nclosed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we\nintroduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical\nknowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full\naccess to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.\nExtensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts\nwith superior scalability and robustness.",

Prevailing mitigation strategies, such as\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agentic working memories, improve\ninformation recall but still engage with fundamentally static knowledge sources\nand follow pre-defined single reasoning path. This hinders their ability to\npreserve factual and logical consistency of their responses in multi-turn\ndialogues while the context evolves over time. To address this issue, we\npropose D-SMART, a model-agnostic framework designed to maintain multi-turn\ndialogue consistency by enabling LLMs to build and reason over a dynamic,\nstructured representation of the conversational context. This is achieved via\ntwo synergistic components: (1) a Dynamic Structured Memory (DSM), which\nincrementally constructs and maintains an authoritative, OWL-compliant\nknowledge graph of the conversation; and (2) a Reasoning Tree (RT), which\nexecutes inferences as an explicit and traceable multi-step search over the\ngraph. As the popular-used quality score (judged by GPT-4) can overlook logical\nflaws, we introduce new NLI-based metrics to better measure multi-turn dialogue\nconsistency. Comprehensive experiments on the MT-Bench-101 benchmark show that\nD-SMART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, elevating the\ndialogue consistency score by over 48\\% for both proprietary and open-source\nmodels, and notably improves the quality score of the latter by up to 10.1\\%.",

To address this issue, we\npropose D-SMART, a model-agnostic framework designed to maintain multi-turn\ndialogue consistency by enabling LLMs to build and reason over a dynamic,\nstructured representation of the conversational context. This is achieved via\ntwo synergistic components: (1) a Dynamic Structured Memory (DSM), which\nincrementally constructs and maintains an authoritative, OWL-compliant\nknowledge graph of the conversation; and (2) a Reasoning Tree (RT), which\nexecutes inferences as an explicit and traceable multi-step search over the\ngraph. As the popular-used quality score (judged by GPT-4) can overlook logical\nflaws, we introduce new NLI-based metrics to better measure multi-turn dialogue\nconsistency. Comprehensive experiments on the MT-Bench-101 benchmark show that\nD-SMART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, elevating the\ndialogue consistency score by over 48\\% for both proprietary and open-source\nmodels, and notably improves the quality score of the latter by up to 10.1\\%."
