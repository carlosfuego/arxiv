Updates are non-destructive and\nhistoried, preserving epistemic lineage without catastrophic forgetting.\nZero-knowledge proofs facilitate verifiable, privacy-preserving inclusion\nattestations. Collectively, this architecture reframes memory not as a cache\nbut as a ledger - one whose contents are enforced by protocol, bound by\ncryptography, and constrained by formal logic. The result is not an intelligent\nagent that mimics thought, but an epistemic entity whose outputs are provably\nderived, temporally anchored, and impervious to post hoc revision. This design\nlays foundational groundwork for legal, economic, and high-assurance\ncomputational systems that require provable memory, unforgeable provenance, and\nstructural truth."

Addressing these issues requires\nfundamentally redesigned hardware-software integration. This paper introduces\nHuawei CloudMatrix, a next-generation AI datacenter architecture, realized in\nthe production-grade CloudMatrix384 supernode. It integrates 384 Ascend 910C\nNPUs and 192 Kunpeng CPUs interconnected via an ultra-high-bandwidth Unified\nBus (UB) network, enabling direct all-to-all communication and dynamic pooling\nof resources. These features optimize performance for communication-intensive\noperations, such as large-scale MoE expert parallelism and distributed\nkey-value cache access. To fully leverage CloudMatrix384, we propose\nCloudMatrix-Infer, an advanced LLM serving solution incorporating three core\ninnovations: a peer-to-peer serving architecture that independently scales\nprefill, decode, and caching; a large-scale expert parallelism strategy\nsupporting EP320 via efficient UB-based token dispatch; and hardware-aware\noptimizations including specialized operators, microbatch-based pipelining, and\nINT8 quantization. Evaluation with the DeepSeek-R1 model shows\nCloudMatrix-Infer achieves state-of-the-art efficiency: prefill throughput of\n6,688 tokens/s per NPU and decode throughput of 1,943 tokens/s per NPU (<50 ms\nTPOT). It effectively balances throughput and latency, sustaining 538 tokens/s\neven under stringent 15 ms latency constraints, while INT8 quantization\nmaintains model accuracy across benchmarks.",

In this\npaper, we propose CnC-PRAC, a PRAC implementation that addresses both\nperformance and energy overheads. Unlike prior works focusing on caching\nactivation counts to reduce their overheads, our key idea is to reorder and\ncoalesce accesses to activation counts located in the same physical row. Our\ndesign achieves this by decoupling counter access from the critical path of\ndata accesses. This enables optimizations such as buffering counter\nread-modify-write requests and coalescing requests to the same row. Together,\nthese enable a reduction in row activations for counter accesses by almost\n75%-83% compared to state-of-the-art solutions like Chronus and enable a PRAC\nimplementation with negligible slowdown and a minimal dynamic energy overhead\nof 0.84%-1% compared to insecure DDR5 DRAM.",

In\nthe Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4, we report for the first time that the sign of the\nthird-order NLHE reverses with decreasing temperature. Through scaling law\nanalysis, we think that the third-order NLHE at high (T > 23 K) and low (T < 23\nK) temperatures is dominated by Berry-connection polarizability (BCP) and\nimpurity scattering, respectively. The third-order NLHE response strength can\nbe effectively modulated by an additional applied in-plane constant electric\nfield. At the high temperature region, the BCP reduction induced by the\nelectric field leads to a decrease in the third-order NLHE response strength,\nwhile at the low temperature region, the electric field cause both BCP and\nimpurity scattering effects to weaken, resulting in a more significant\nmodulation of the third-order NLHE response strength. At 4 K and an electric\nfield strength of 0.3 kV/cm, the modulated relative response strength could\nreach up to 65.3%. This work provides a new means to explore the third-order\nNLHE and a valuable reference for the development of novel electronic devices.",

To achieve high throughput, IMPACT (i) eliminates\nexpensive cache bypassing steps required by processor-centric memory-based\ntiming attacks and (ii) leverages the intrinsic parallelism of PiM operations.\nWe showcase two applications of IMPACT. First, we build two covert channels\nthat leverage different PiM approaches (i.e., processing-near-memory and\nprocessing-using-memory) to establish high-throughput covert communication\nchannels. Our covert channels achieve 8.2 Mb/s and 14.8 Mb/s communication\nthroughput, respectively, which is 3.6x and 6.5x higher than the\nstate-of-the-art main memory-based covert channel. Second, we showcase a\nside-channel attack that leaks private information of concurrently-running\nvictim applications with a low error rate.

However, for many of\nthese applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different\nuser inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations\nin order to process user inputs quickly, as they are received. We propose\nSqueezed Attention to accelerate LLM applications where a large portion of the\ninput context is fixed.

During inference, we compare query tokens\nfrom the user input with the centroids to predict which keys from the fixed\ncontext are semantically relevant, and then compute exact attention using only\nthe important keys, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational costs. We also\npresent a hierarchical version of our algorithm which can reduce the complexity\nof attention from linear to logarithmic with respect to the fixed context\nlength.

In this work, we\npropose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a\npre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video\ngenerator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using\na single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to\nthe user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate\nthe next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores\nadversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation.\nThis not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for\none-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables\ntraining the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in\nreducing error accumulation during long video generation. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that our 8B model achieves real-time, 24fps, streaming video\ngeneration at 736x416 resolution on a single H100, or 1280x720 on 8xH100 up to\na minute long (1440 frames).

These techniques are often designed with a\npre-defined KV budget; however, as the optimal budget varies by different input\nlengths and task types, the existence of a fixed budget could result in\ninconsistent performance accepting inputs of diverse domains. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a new KV cache compression objective: to always ensure\nthe full-cache performance regardless of specific inputs, while maximizing KV\ncache pruning as much as possible. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel\nKV cache compression method dubbed DBudgetKV, which features an attention-based\nmetric to signal when the remaining KV cache is unlikely to match the\nfull-cache performance, then halting the pruning process. Empirical evaluation\nspanning diverse context lengths, task types, and model sizes suggests that our\nmethod achieves lossless KV pruning effectively and robustly, exceeding 25%\ncompression ratio on average.

                    "value": "To alleviate memory burden during inference of large language models (LLMs),\nnumerous studies have focused on compressing the KV cache by exploring aspects\nsuch as attention sparsity. These techniques are often designed with a\npre-defined KV budget; however, as the optimal budget varies by different input\nlengths and task types, the existence of a fixed budget could result in\ninconsistent performance accepting inputs of diverse domains. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a new KV cache compression objective: to always ensure\nthe full-cache performance regardless of specific inputs, while maximizing KV\ncache pruning as much as possible. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel\nKV cache compression method dubbed DBudgetKV, which features an attention-based\nmetric to signal when the remaining KV cache is unlikely to match the\nfull-cache performance, then halting the pruning process. Empirical evaluation\nspanning diverse context lengths, task types, and model sizes suggests that our\nmethod achieves lossless KV pruning effectively and robustly, exceeding 25%\ncompression ratio on average. Furthermore, our method is easy to integrate\nwithin LLM inference, not only optimizing memory space, but also showing\nreduced inference time compared to existing methods."

In this work, we propose ParallelComp, a parallel long-context\ncompression method that effectively overcomes the memory bottleneck, enabling\n8B-parameter LLMs to extrapolate from 8K to 128K tokens on a single A100 80GB\nGPU in a training-free setting. ParallelComp splits the input into chunks,\ndynamically evicting redundant chunks and irrelevant tokens, supported by a\nparallel KV cache eviction mechanism. Importantly, we present a systematic\ntheoretical and empirical analysis of attention biases in parallel\nattention-including the attention sink, recency bias, and middle bias-and\nreveal that these biases exhibit distinctive patterns under ultra-long context\nsettings. We further design a KV cache eviction technique to mitigate this\nphenomenon. Experimental results show that ParallelComp enables an 8B model\n(trained on 8K context) to achieve 91.17% of GPT-4's performance under\nultra-long contexts, outperforming closed-source models such as Claude-2 and\nKimi-Chat.

LoRa backbone of\nthe network handles the web page transmission from the requester and receiver\ndevices. LoRaWeb implements a synchronization procedure to address the\naforementioned challenges for effective message exchange between requesters and\nresponders. The system implements a caching mechanism to reduce latency and\ncontention. Additionally, it implements a message-slicing mechanism in the\napplication layer to overcome the hardware limitations on the message length.\nThe actual hardware-based implementation results indicate seamless deployment,\nand the results indicate an average access time of ~$0.95 S$ for a $1.5 KB$ and\n~$6 S$ for a $10 KB$ size web page.",

Specifically,\ntechnical challenges like payload size limitation, low data rate, and\ncontentions in multi-user setups limit the applicability of LoRa for web\napplications. Hence, we propose LoRaWeb, which enables web access over LoRa\nnetworks. The LoRaWeb hardware tethers a WiFi hotspot to which the client\ndevices connect and access the web pages using a web browser. LoRa backbone of\nthe network handles the web page transmission from the requester and receiver\ndevices. LoRaWeb implements a synchronization procedure to address the\naforementioned challenges for effective message exchange between requesters and\nresponders. The system implements a caching mechanism to reduce latency and\ncontention. Additionally, it implements a message-slicing mechanism in the\napplication layer to overcome the hardware limitations on the message length.\nThe actual hardware-based implementation results indicate seamless deployment,\nand the results indicate an average access time of ~$0.95 S$ for a $1.5 KB$ and\n~$6 S$ for a $10 KB$ size web page."

Across all experimental cases, LightSLH provides the lowest\noverhead among current provable protection strategies, including 0\\% overhead\nin 50\\% cases. Notably, the analysis of LightSLH reveals two previously unknown\nsecurity issues: (1) The compiler can introduce risks overlooked by LLSCT, a\nhardening method proven secure at the LLVM IR level. We successfully construct\na side channel by exploiting compiler-inserted stack loads, confirming this\nrisk. (2) Memory access patterns generated by the scatter-gather algorithm\nstill depend on secrets, even for observers with cache line granularity. These\nfindings and results highlight the importance of applying accurate protections\nto specific instructions."

We reveal that conventional\ninference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform\npoorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like\nBest-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified\nchallenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high\ncomputational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM)\nevaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference\nscaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our\napproach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that\nsignificantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To\noperationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision\ntraining objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to\nprevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value\ncaching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree\nsearch. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method.\nAdditionally, we publicly release our trained multifurcation reward model\n(Saffron-1) and the accompanying token-level safety reward dataset (Safety4M)\nto accelerate future research in LLM safety.

                    "value": "We present the first system for physically based, neural inverse rendering\nfrom multi-viewpoint videos of propagating light. Our approach relies on a\ntime-resolved extension of neural radiance caching -- a technique that\naccelerates inverse rendering by storing infinite-bounce radiance arriving at\nany point from any direction. The resulting model accurately accounts for\ndirect and indirect light transport effects and, when applied to captured\nmeasurements from a flash lidar system, enables state-of-the-art 3D\nreconstruction in the presence of strong indirect light. Further, we\ndemonstrate view synthesis of propagating light, automatic decomposition of\ncaptured measurements into direct and indirect components, as well as novel\ncapabilities such as multi-view time-resolved relighting of captured scenes."

This step negatively affects key Service Level Objectives (SLOs),\nsuch as time to first token (TTFT) and time per output token (TPOT).

To address the limitation, we propose a training-free compression\nframework (AsymKV) that combines homogeneity-based key merging with a\nmathematically proven lossless value compression. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that AsymKV consistently outperforms existing long-context methods\nacross various tasks and base models. For example, on LLaMA3.1-8B, AsymKV\nachieves an average score of 43.95 on LongBench, surpassing SOTA methods like\nH$_2$O (38.89) by a large margin."

MARCO's core technical contribution lies in its\nunique combination of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with Conformal\nPrediction (CP) to accelerate the hardware/software co-design process for\ndeploying deep neural networks. Unlike conventional once-for-all (OFA) supernet\napproaches that require extensive pretraining, MARCO decomposes the NAS task\ninto a hardware configuration agent (HCA) and a Quantization Agent (QA). The\nHCA optimizes high-level design parameters, while the QA determines per-layer\nbit-widths under strict memory and latency budgets using a shared reward signal\nwithin a centralized-critic, decentralized-execution (CTDE) paradigm. A key\ninnovation is the integration of a calibrated CP surrogate model that provides\nstatistical guarantees (with a user-defined miscoverage rate) to prune\nunpromising candidate architectures before incurring the high costs of partial\ntraining or hardware simulation. This early filtering drastically reduces the\nsearch space while ensuring that high-quality designs are retained with a high\nprobability. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100\ndemonstrate that MARCO achieves a 3-4x reduction in total search time compared\nto an OFA baseline while maintaining near-baseline accuracy (within 0.3%).\nFurthermore, MARCO also reduces inference latency.

Unlike existing\nmethods that devise specialized strategies for either forward or inverse\nproblems under full or partial observation, our approach unifies these tasks\nunder a single, flexible generative framework. Specifically, we recast\nPDE-solving as a generalized inpainting problem, e.g., treating forward\nprediction as inferring missing spatiotemporal information of future states\nfrom initial conditions. To this end, we design a transformer-based\narchitecture that conditions on arbitrary patterns of known data to infer\nmissing values across time and space.

                    "value": "We present a unified framework for solving partial differential equations\n(PDEs) using video-inpainting diffusion transformer models. Unlike existing\nmethods that devise specialized strategies for either forward or inverse\nproblems under full or partial observation, our approach unifies these tasks\nunder a single, flexible generative framework. Specifically, we recast\nPDE-solving as a generalized inpainting problem, e.g., treating forward\nprediction as inferring missing spatiotemporal information of future states\nfrom initial conditions. To this end, we design a transformer-based\narchitecture that conditions on arbitrary patterns of known data to infer\nmissing values across time and space.

While LLMs have shown promising capabilities in generating\n``believable'' human behaviors, evaluating their ability to mimic real user\nbehaviors remains an open challenge, largely due to the lack of high-quality,\npublicly available datasets that capture both the observable actions and the\ninternal reasoning of an actual human user. To address this gap, we introduce\nOPERA, a novel dataset of Observation, Persona, Rationale, and Action collected\nfrom real human participants during online shopping sessions. OPERA is the\nfirst public dataset that comprehensively captures: user personas, browser\nobservations, fine-grained web actions, and self-reported just-in-time\nrationales. We developed both an online questionnaire and a custom browser\nplugin to gather this dataset with high fidelity. Using OPERA, we establish the\nfirst benchmark to evaluate how well current LLMs can predict a specific user's\nnext action and rationale with a given persona and <observation, action,\nrationale> history. This dataset lays the groundwork for future research into\nLLM agents that aim to act as personalized digital twins for human.",

                    "value": "Can large language models (LLMs) accurately simulate the next web action of a\nspecific user? While LLMs have shown promising capabilities in generating\n``believable'' human behaviors, evaluating their ability to mimic real user\nbehaviors remains an open challenge, largely due to the lack of high-quality,\npublicly available datasets that capture both the observable actions and the\ninternal reasoning of an actual human user. To address this gap, we introduce\nOPERA, a novel dataset of Observation, Persona, Rationale, and Action collected\nfrom real human participants during online shopping sessions. OPERA is the\nfirst public dataset that comprehensively captures: user personas, browser\nobservations, fine-grained web actions, and self-reported just-in-time\nrationales. We developed both an online questionnaire and a custom browser\nplugin to gather this dataset with high fidelity. Using OPERA, we establish the\nfirst benchmark to evaluate how well current LLMs can predict a specific user's\nnext action and rationale with a given persona and <observation, action,\nrationale> history. This dataset lays the groundwork for future research into\nLLM agents that aim to act as personalized digital twins for human."

                "summary": "Recommender systems have been widely used in various large-scale\nuser-oriented platforms for many years. However, compared to the rapid\ndevelopments in the AI community, recommendation systems have not achieved a\nbreakthrough in recent years. For instance, they still rely on a multi-stage\ncascaded architecture rather than an end-to-end approach, leading to\ncomputational fragmentation and optimization inconsistencies, and hindering the\neffective application of key breakthrough technologies from the AI community in\nrecommendation scenarios.\n  To address these issues, we propose OneRec, which reshapes the recommendation\nsystem through an end-to-end generative approach and achieves promising\nresults. Firstly, we have enhanced the computational FLOPs of the current\nrecommendation model by 10 $\\times$ and have identified the scaling laws for\nrecommendations within certain boundaries. Secondly, reinforcement learning\ntechniques, previously difficult to apply for optimizing recommendations, show\nsignificant potential in this framework. Lastly, through infrastructure\noptimizations, we have achieved 23.7% and 28.8% Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU)\non flagship GPUs during training and inference, respectively, aligning closely\nwith the LLM community. This architecture significantly reduces communication\nand storage overhead, resulting in operating expense that is only 10.6% of\ntraditional recommendation pipelines. Deployed in Kuaishou/Kuaishou Lite APP,\nit handles 25% of total queries per second, enhancing overall App Stay Time by\n0.54% and 1.24%, respectively.

                    "value": "Recommender systems have been widely used in various large-scale\nuser-oriented platforms for many years. However, compared to the rapid\ndevelopments in the AI community, recommendation systems have not achieved a\nbreakthrough in recent years. For instance, they still rely on a multi-stage\ncascaded architecture rather than an end-to-end approach, leading to\ncomputational fragmentation and optimization inconsistencies, and hindering the\neffective application of key breakthrough technologies from the AI community in\nrecommendation scenarios.\n  To address these issues, we propose OneRec, which reshapes the recommendation\nsystem through an end-to-end generative approach and achieves promising\nresults. Firstly, we have enhanced the computational FLOPs of the current\nrecommendation model by 10 $\\times$ and have identified the scaling laws for\nrecommendations within certain boundaries. Secondly, reinforcement learning\ntechniques, previously difficult to apply for optimizing recommendations, show\nsignificant potential in this framework. Lastly, through infrastructure\noptimizations, we have achieved 23.7% and 28.8% Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU)\non flagship GPUs during training and inference, respectively, aligning closely\nwith the LLM community. This architecture significantly reduces communication\nand storage overhead, resulting in operating expense that is only 10.6% of\ntraditional recommendation pipelines. Deployed in Kuaishou/Kuaishou Lite APP,\nit handles 25% of total queries per second, enhancing overall App Stay Time by\n0.54% and 1.24%, respectively. Additionally, we have observed significant\nincreases in metrics such as 7-day Lifetime, which is a crucial indicator of\nrecommendation experience. We also provide practical lessons and insights\nderived from developing, optimizing, and maintaining a production-scale\nrecommendation system with significant real-world impact."

In this work, we present MetaScore, a new dataset consisting of 963K\nmusical scores paired with rich metadata, including free-form user-annotated\ntags, collected from an online music forum. To approach text-to-music\ngeneration, We employ a pretrained large language model (LLM) to generate\npseudo-natural language captions for music from its metadata tags. With the\nLLM-enhanced MetaScore, we train a text-conditioned music generation model that\nlearns to generate symbolic music from the pseudo captions, allowing control of\ninstruments, genre, composer, complexity and other free-form music descriptors.\nIn addition, we train a tag-conditioned system that supports a predefined set\nof tags available in MetaScore. Our experimental results show that both the\nproposed text-to-music and tags-to-music models outperform a baseline\ntext-to-music model in a listening test. While a concurrent work Text2MIDI also\nsupports free-form text input, our models achieve comparable performance.\nMoreover, the text-to-music system offers a more natural interface than the\ntags-to-music model, as it allows users to provide free-form natural language\nprompts.",

In this paper, we aim to model\nthe relationships between modalities more purposefully, thereby achieving more\nefficient and flexible modality alignments. To this end, we propose\nStream-Omni, a large language-vision-speech model with efficient modality\nalignments, which can simultaneously support interactions under various\nmodality combinations. Stream-Omni employs LLM as the backbone and aligns the\nvision and speech to the text based on their relationships. For vision that is\nsemantically complementary to text, Stream-Omni uses sequence-dimension\nconcatenation to achieve vision-text alignment. For speech that is semantically\nconsistent with text, Stream-Omni introduces a CTC-based layer-dimension\nmapping to achieve speech-text alignment. In this way, Stream-Omni can achieve\nmodality alignments with less data (especially speech), enabling the transfer\nof text capabilities to other modalities. Experiments on various benchmarks\ndemonstrate that Stream-Omni achieves strong performance on visual\nunderstanding, speech interaction, and vision-grounded speech interaction\ntasks.

Further, we introduce EvolvTrip, a perspective-aware\ntemporal knowledge graph that tracks psychological development throughout\nnarratives. Our experiments demonstrate that EvolvTrip consistently enhances\nperformance of LLMs across varying scales, even in challenging extended-context\nscenarios. EvolvTrip proves to be particularly valuable for smaller models,\npartially bridging the performance gap with larger LLMs and showing great\ncompatibility with lengthy narratives. Our findings highlight the importance of\nexplicit representation of temporal character mental states in narrative\ncomprehension and offer a foundation for more sophisticated character\nunderstanding. Our data and code are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/Bernard-Yang/EvolvTrip."

                "summary": "Human mobility simulation plays a crucial role in various real-world\napplications. Recently, to address the limitations of traditional data-driven\napproaches, researchers have explored leveraging the commonsense knowledge and\nreasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to accelerate human\nmobility simulation.

Extensive\nexperiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our approach significantly improves\nboth detection and topology reasoning metrics, achieving +3.1 in DET$_l$, +5.3\nin TOP$_{ll}$, +4.9 in TOP$_{lt}$, and an overall +4.4 in OLS, setting a new\nstate-of-the-art.

Second, an abstention policy decides\nwhether the cascade model response is sufficiently certain or requires human\nintervention. Moreover, we incorporate an online learning mechanism in the\nframework that can leverage human feedback to improve decision quality over\ntime. We demonstrate this approach to general question-answering (ARC-Easy and\nARC-Challenge) and medical question-answering (MedQA and MedMCQA).

Unlike LLMs,\nwhich rely on increasing model size for better generalisation, SLMs designed\nfor edge applications are expected to have adaptivity to the deployment\nenvironments and energy efficiency given the device battery life constraints,\nwhich are not addressed in datacenter-deployed LLMs. This paper addresses these\ntwo requirements by proposing a training-free token embedding compression\napproach using Tensor-Train Decomposition (TTD). Each pre-trained token\nembedding vector is converted into a lower-dimensional Matrix Product State\n(MPS). We comprehensively evaluate the extracted low-rank structures across\ncompression ratio, language task performance, latency, and energy consumption\non a typical low-end device, i.e. Raspberry Pi. Taking the sub-billion\nparameter versions of GPT-2/Cerebres-GPT and OPT models as examples, our\napproach achieves a comparable language task performance to the original model\nwith around $2.0\\times$ embedding layer compression, while the energy\nconsumption of a single query drops by half.",

                    "value": "Small Language Models (SLMs, or on-device LMs) have significantly fewer\nparameters than Large Language Models (LLMs). They are typically deployed on\nlow-end devices, like mobile phones and single-board computers. Unlike LLMs,\nwhich rely on increasing model size for better generalisation, SLMs designed\nfor edge applications are expected to have adaptivity to the deployment\nenvironments and energy efficiency given the device battery life constraints,\nwhich are not addressed in datacenter-deployed LLMs. This paper addresses these\ntwo requirements by proposing a training-free token embedding compression\napproach using Tensor-Train Decomposition (TTD). Each pre-trained token\nembedding vector is converted into a lower-dimensional Matrix Product State\n(MPS). We comprehensively evaluate the extracted low-rank structures across\ncompression ratio, language task performance, latency, and energy consumption\non a typical low-end device, i.e. Raspberry Pi. Taking the sub-billion\nparameter versions of GPT-2/Cerebres-GPT and OPT models as examples, our\napproach achieves a comparable language task performance to the original model\nwith around $2.0\\times$ embedding layer compression, while the energy\nconsumption of a single query drops by half."

Most\nprevious methods typically encode 3D point and 2D image features separately,\nneglecting interactions between 2D semantics and 3D object properties, as well\nas the spatial relationships within the 3D environment. This limitation not\nonly hinders comprehensive representations of 3D scene, but also compromises\ntraining and inference efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a\nunified Instance-aware 3D Large Multi-modal Model (Inst3D-LMM) to deal with\nmultiple 3D scene understanding tasks simultaneously. To obtain the\nfine-grained instance-level visual tokens, we first introduce a novel\nMulti-view Cross-Modal Fusion (MCMF) module to inject the multi-view 2D\nsemantics into their corresponding 3D geometric features. For scene-level\nrelation-aware tokens, we further present a 3D Instance Spatial Relation\n(3D-ISR) module to capture the intricate pairwise spatial relationships among\nobjects. Additionally, we perform end-to-end multi-task instruction tuning\nsimultaneously without the subsequent task-specific fine-tuning.

We approach this problem with the\nmindset and resources of a reasonably sophisticated threat actor, and create a\ndataset of 505,159 AI-generated social media posts from a combination of\nopen-source, closed-source, and fine-tuned LLMs, covering 11 different\ncontroversial topics. We show that while the posts can be detected under\ntypical research assumptions about knowledge of and access to the generating\nmodels, under the more realistic assumption that an attacker will not release\ntheir fine-tuned model to the public, detectability drops dramatically. This\nresult is confirmed with a human study. Ablation experiments highlight the\nvulnerability of various detection algorithms to fine-tuned LLMs. This result\nhas implications across all detection domains, since fine-tuning is a generally\napplicable and realistic LLM use case."

In this paper, we propose\nBlock-wise Adaptive Caching(BAC), a method to accelerate Diffusion Policy by\ncaching intermediate action features. BAC achieves lossless action generation\nacceleration by adaptively updating and reusing cached features at the block\nlevel, based on a key observation that feature similarities vary non-uniformly\nacross timesteps and locks. To operationalize this insight, we first propose\nthe Adaptive Caching Scheduler, designed to identify optimal update timesteps\nby maximizing the global feature similarities between cached and skipped\nfeatures. However, applying this scheduler for each block leads to signiffcant\nerror surges due to the inter-block propagation of caching errors, particularly\nwithin Feed-Forward Network (FFN) blocks. To mitigate this issue, we develop\nthe Bubbling Union Algorithm, which truncates these errors by updating the\nupstream blocks with signiffcant caching errors before downstream FFNs. As a\ntraining-free plugin, BAC is readily integrable with existing transformer-based\nDiffusion Policy and vision-language-action models. Extensive experiments on\nmultiple robotic benchmarks demonstrate that BAC achieves up to 3x inference\nspeedup for free.",

For the first time, we apply spherical persistent homology\nto galaxy survey data through the algorithm TopoS2, which is optimized for\ncurved-sky analyses and HEALPix compatibility. Employing a simulation-based\ninference framework with the Gower Street simulation suite, specifically\ndesigned to mimic DES Y3 data properties, we extract topological summary\nstatistics from convergence maps across multiple smoothing scales and redshift\nbins. After neural network compression of these statistics, we estimate the\nlikelihood function and validate our analysis against baryonic feedback\neffects, finding minimal biases (under $0.3\\sigma$) in the\n$\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}-S_8$ plane. Assuming the $w$CDM model, our combined Betti\nnumbers and second moments analysis yields $S_8 = 0.821 \\pm 0.018$ and\n$\\Omega_\\mathrm{m} = 0.304\\pm0.037$-constraints 70% tighter than those from\ncosmic shear two-point statistics in the same parameter plane.

We couple the energy of each jet outburst to the surrounding\ngas inside spherical shells, allowing us to estimate the fraction of NTP to\ntotal pressure induced in the cluster. We predict the mean profile for this NTP\nfraction over the source population in a variety of cluster environments and\nfor different AGN jet duty cycles. For typical gas and dark matter profiles,\nthe mean NTP fraction peaks at ~4-6% when the AGN jets are active for 10-30% of\nthe total AGN lifecycle. These predictions are in good agreement with\nobservational constraints, suggesting that AGN feedback imparts only small\nnon-thermal contributions to the cluster's core. Furthermore, we find a\nrelationship between the peak in the mean NTP fraction and the AGN jet duty\ncycle in a given cluster environment. Applying this to Hitomi measurements of\nthe NTP in the Perseus cluster, we infer an AGN jet duty cycle that is\nconsistent with independent evidence of Perseus' AGN jet activity.

Current temporal action localization methods\ntypically rely on annotated action and object categories of interactions for\noptimization, which leads to domain bias and low deployment efficiency.\nAlthough some recent works have achieved zero-shot temporal action localization\n(ZS-TAL) with large vision-language models (VLMs), their coarse-grained\nestimations and open-loop pipelines hinder further performance improvements for\ntemporal interaction localization (TIL). To address these issues, we propose a\nnovel zero-shot TIL approach dubbed EgoLoc to locate the timings of grasp\nactions for human-object interaction in egocentric videos.

MARCO's core technical contribution lies in its\nunique combination of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with Conformal\nPrediction (CP) to accelerate the hardware/software co-design process for\ndeploying deep neural networks.

                "summary": "Phishing attacks remain one of the most prevalent and persistent\ncybersecurity threat with attackers continuously evolving and intensifying\ntactics to evade the general detection system. Despite significant advances in\nartificial intelligence and machine learning, faithfully reproducing the\ninterpretable reasoning with classification and explainability that underpin\nphishing judgments remains challenging. Due to recent advancement in Natural\nLanguage Processing, Large Language Models (LLMs) show a promising direction\nand potential for improving domain specific phishing classification tasks.\nHowever, enhancing the reliability and robustness of classification models\nrequires not only accurate predictions from LLMs but also consistent and\ntrustworthy explanations aligning with those predictions. Therefore, a key\nquestion remains: can LLMs not only classify phishing emails accurately but\nalso generate explanations that are reliably aligned with their predictions and\ninternally self-consistent? To answer these questions, we have fine-tuned\ntransformer based models, including BERT, Llama models, and Wizard, to improve\ndomain relevance and make them more tailored to phishing specific distinctions,\nusing Binary Sequence Classification, Contrastive Learning (CL) and Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO).

                    "value": "Phishing attacks remain one of the most prevalent and persistent\ncybersecurity threat with attackers continuously evolving and intensifying\ntactics to evade the general detection system. Despite significant advances in\nartificial intelligence and machine learning, faithfully reproducing the\ninterpretable reasoning with classification and explainability that underpin\nphishing judgments remains challenging. Due to recent advancement in Natural\nLanguage Processing, Large Language Models (LLMs) show a promising direction\nand potential for improving domain specific phishing classification tasks.\nHowever, enhancing the reliability and robustness of classification models\nrequires not only accurate predictions from LLMs but also consistent and\ntrustworthy explanations aligning with those predictions. Therefore, a key\nquestion remains: can LLMs not only classify phishing emails accurately but\nalso generate explanations that are reliably aligned with their predictions and\ninternally self-consistent? To answer these questions, we have fine-tuned\ntransformer based models, including BERT, Llama models, and Wizard, to improve\ndomain relevance and make them more tailored to phishing specific distinctions,\nusing Binary Sequence Classification, Contrastive Learning (CL) and Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO). To that end, we examined their performance in\nphishing classification and explainability by applying the ConsistenCy measure\nbased on SHAPley values (CC SHAP), which measures prediction explanation token\nalignment to test the model's internal faithfulness and consistency and uncover\nthe rationale behind its predictions and reasoning.

To address it, we introduce consistency distillation training to\npredict multiple correct action tokens in each iteration, thereby achieving\nacceleration.

Although distillation brings acceptable\nspeedup, we identify that certain inefficient iterations remain a critical\nbottleneck. To tackle this, we propose an early-exit decoding strategy that\nmoderately relaxes convergence conditions, which further improves average\ninference efficiency. Experimental results show that the proposed method\nachieves more than 4 times inference acceleration across different baselines\nwhile maintaining high task success rates in both simulated and real-world\nrobot tasks.

We conclude that evidence presented in the\noriginal paper fails to support claims that min-p improves quality, diversity,\nor a trade-off between quality and diversity."

This encourages the\nemergenece of model context protocol (MCP), which defines the standard on how\nshould a LLM interact with external services, such as \\api and data. However,\nas MCP becomes the de facto standard for LLM agent systems, it also introduces\nnew safety risks.

In\nthis position paper, we advocate the research community in LLM safety to pay\nclose attention to the new safety risks issues introduced by MCP, and develop\nnew techniques to build safe MCP-powered agent systems. To establish our\nposition, we argue with three key parts. (1) We first construct \\framework, a\ncontrolled framework to examine safety issues in MCP-powered agent systems.

While sequence-dimension concatenation is\nstraightforward for modality integration, it often relies heavily on\nlarge-scale data to learn modality alignments. In this paper, we aim to model\nthe relationships between modalities more purposefully, thereby achieving more\nefficient and flexible modality alignments. To this end, we propose\nStream-Omni, a large language-vision-speech model with efficient modality\nalignments, which can simultaneously support interactions under various\nmodality combinations. Stream-Omni employs LLM as the backbone and aligns the\nvision and speech to the text based on their relationships. For vision that is\nsemantically complementary to text, Stream-Omni uses sequence-dimension\nconcatenation to achieve vision-text alignment. For speech that is semantically\nconsistent with text, Stream-Omni introduces a CTC-based layer-dimension\nmapping to achieve speech-text alignment. In this way, Stream-Omni can achieve\nmodality alignments with less data (especially speech), enabling the transfer\nof text capabilities to other modalities. Experiments on various benchmarks\ndemonstrate that Stream-Omni achieves strong performance on visual\nunderstanding, speech interaction, and vision-grounded speech interaction\ntasks.

Attackers\nexploit the perceived urgency and authenticity of voice communication to\nmanipulate victims, often posing as legitimate entities like banks or tech\nsupport. Vishing is a particularly serious threat as it bypasses security\ncontrols designed to protect information. In this work, we study the potential\nfor vishing attacks to escalate with the advent of AI. In theory, AI-powered\nsoftware bots may have the ability to automate these attacks by initiating\nconversations with potential victims via phone calls and deceiving them into\ndisclosing sensitive information. To validate this thesis, we introduce ViKing,\nan AI-powered vishing system developed using publicly available AI technology.\nIt relies on a Large Language Model (LLM) as its core cognitive processor to\nsteer conversations with victims, complemented by a pipeline of speech-to-text\nand text-to-speech modules that facilitate audio-text conversion in phone\ncalls. Through a controlled social experiment involving 240 participants, we\ndiscovered that ViKing has successfully persuaded many participants to reveal\nsensitive information, even those who had been explicitly warned about the risk\nof vishing campaigns. Interactions with ViKing's bots were generally considered\nrealistic. From these findings, we conclude that tools like ViKing may already\nbe accessible to potential malicious actors, while also serving as an\ninvaluable resource for cyber awareness programs.",

In this work, we study the potential\nfor vishing attacks to escalate with the advent of AI. In theory, AI-powered\nsoftware bots may have the ability to automate these attacks by initiating\nconversations with potential victims via phone calls and deceiving them into\ndisclosing sensitive information. To validate this thesis, we introduce ViKing,\nan AI-powered vishing system developed using publicly available AI technology.\nIt relies on a Large Language Model (LLM) as its core cognitive processor to\nsteer conversations with victims, complemented by a pipeline of speech-to-text\nand text-to-speech modules that facilitate audio-text conversion in phone\ncalls. Through a controlled social experiment involving 240 participants, we\ndiscovered that ViKing has successfully persuaded many participants to reveal\nsensitive information, even those who had been explicitly warned about the risk\nof vishing campaigns. Interactions with ViKing's bots were generally considered\nrealistic. From these findings, we conclude that tools like ViKing may already\nbe accessible to potential malicious actors, while also serving as an\ninvaluable resource for cyber awareness programs."

However,\ncultural value misalignments may exist in generated texts, such as the\nmisrepresentation of historical facts, the erosion of cultural identity, and\nthe oversimplification of complex cultural narratives, which may lead to severe\nconsequences. Therefore, investigating value misalignment in the context of LLM\nfor cultural heritage is crucial for mitigating these risks, yet there has been\na significant lack of systematic and comprehensive study and investigation in\nthis area. To fill this gap, we systematically assess the reliability of LLMs\nin generating culturally aligned texts for cultural heritage-related tasks. We\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation by compiling an extensive set of 1066 query\ntasks covering 5 widely recognized categories with 17 aspects within the\nknowledge framework of cultural heritage across 5 open-source LLMs, and examine\nboth the type and rate of cultural value misalignments in the generated texts.\nUsing both automated and manual approaches, we effectively detect and analyze\nthe cultural value misalignments in LLM-generated texts. Our findings are\nconcerning: over 65% of the generated texts exhibit notable cultural\nmisalignments, with certain tasks demonstrating almost complete misalignment\nwith key cultural values. Beyond these findings, this paper introduces a\nbenchmark dataset and a comprehensive evaluation workflow that can serve as a\nvaluable resource for future research aimed at enhancing the cultural\nsensitivity and reliability of LLMs.",

Notably, replacing our\nproposed state-space block with a conventional Transformer results in\nsubstantial performance degradation, highlighting the advantages of state-space\nmodeling for effectively compressing multi-frame video data. Our framework\nemphasizes resource-conscious efficiency, making it practical for real-world\ndeployments. We validate its scalability and generality across multiple\nbenchmarks, achieving the dual objectives of efficient resource usage and\ncomprehensive video understanding."

In\nthis paper, we propose X-Scene, a novel framework for large-scale driving scene\ngeneration that achieves both geometric intricacy and appearance fidelity,\nwhile offering flexible controllability. Specifically, X-Scene supports\nmulti-granular control, including low-level conditions such as user-provided or\ntext-driven layout for detailed scene composition and high-level semantic\nguidance such as user-intent and LLM-enriched text prompts for efficient\ncustomization. To enhance geometrical and visual fidelity, we introduce a\nunified pipeline that sequentially generates 3D semantic occupancy and the\ncorresponding multiview images, while ensuring alignment between modalities.\nAdditionally, we extend the generated local region into a large-scale scene\nthrough consistency-aware scene outpainting, which extrapolates new occupancy\nand images conditioned on the previously generated area, enhancing spatial\ncontinuity and preserving visual coherence. The resulting scenes are lifted\ninto high-quality 3DGS representations, supporting diverse applications such as\nscene exploration.

To leverage\nthese probabilities, this article tests two novel strategies: requesting\npercentage likelihoods for scores and extracting the probabilities of\nalternative tokens in the responses. The probability estimates were then used\nto calculate weighted average scores. Both strategies were evaluated with five\niterations of ChatGPT 4o-mini on 96,800 articles submitted to the UK Research\nExcellence Framework (REF) 2021, using departmental average REF2021 quality\nscores as a proxy for article quality. The data was analysed separately for\neach of the 34 field-based REF Units of Assessment. For the first strategy,\nexplicit requests for tables of score percentage likelihoods substantially\ndecreased the value of the scores (lower correlation with the proxy quality\nindicator). In contrast, weighed averages of score token probabilities slightly\nincreased the correlation with the quality proxy indicator and these\nprobabilities reasonably accurately reflected ChatGPT's outputs.

We present a method\nthat leverages pretrained vision transformer foundation models to estimate\nremaining lifespan from facial and whole-body images, alongside robust\nuncertainty quantification. We show that predictive uncertainty varies\nsystematically with the true remaining lifespan, and that this uncertainty can\nbe effectively modeled by learning a Gaussian distribution for each sample. Our\napproach achieves state-of-the-art mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.48 years on\nan established Dataset, and further improves to 4.79 and 5.07 years MAE on two\nnew, higher-quality datasets curated and published in this work. Importantly,\nour models provide well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, as demonstrated by a\nbucketed expected calibration error of 0.62 years.

This necessitates shifting intelligence to\nthe sensor edge. Due to their event-driven nature, Spiking Neural Networks\n(SNNs) offer a promising pathway toward energy-efficient on-device processing.\nThis paper investigates a recurrent SNN for simultaneous regression (flow,\npressure, pump speed) and multi-label classification (normal, overpressure,\ncavitation) for an industrial progressing cavity pump (PCP) using 3-axis\nvibration data. Furthermore, we provide energy consumption estimates comparing\nthe SNN approach on conventional (x86, ARM) and neuromorphic (Loihi) hardware\nplatforms.

RealHiTBench also includes a diverse collection of tables with intricate\nstructures, spanning a wide range of task types. Our experimental results,\nusing 25 state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrate that RealHiTBench is indeed a\nchallenging benchmark. Moreover, we also develop TreeThinker, a tree-based\npipeline that organizes hierarchical headers into a tree structure for enhanced\ntabular reasoning, validating the importance of improving LLMs' perception of\ntable hierarchies. We hope that our work will inspire further research on\ntabular data reasoning and the development of more robust models. The code and\ndata are available at https://github.com/cspzyy/RealHiTBench.",

Our\nfindings reveal that, while LLMs perform best in English and worst in Basque\n(the lowest-resourced language), overall truthfulness discrepancies across\nlanguages are smaller than anticipated. Furthermore, we show that\nLLM-as-a-Judge correlates more closely with human judgments than\nmultiple-choice metrics, and that informativeness plays a critical role in\ntruthfulness assessment. Our results also indicate that machine translation\nprovides a viable approach for extending truthfulness benchmarks to additional\nlanguages, offering a scalable alternative to professional translation.\nFinally, we observe that universal knowledge questions are better handled\nacross languages than context- and time-dependent ones, highlighting the need\nfor truthfulness evaluations that account for cultural and temporal\nvariability.

A Genetic\nAlgorithm (GA) is used to optimize key technical parameters, such as reactor\ncapacity, fuel enrichment, tail enrichment, refueling interval, and discharge\nburnup, to minimize the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). Base case results are\nvalidated using Simulated Annealing (SA). By incorporating Probability\nDistribution Functions (PDFs) for fuel cycle costs, the study identifies\noptimal configurations under uncertainty. Methodologically, it introduces a\nnovel framework combining probabilistic cost modeling with evolutionary\noptimization. Results show that microreactors can remain cost-competitive, with\nLCOEs ranging from \\$48.21/MWh to \\$78.32/MWh when supported by the Production\nTax Credit (PTC). High reactor capacity, low fuel enrichment, moderate tail\nenrichment and refueling intervals, and high discharge burnup enhance cost\nefficiency. Among all factors, overnight capital cost (OCC) has the most\nsignificant impact on LCOE, while O&M and fuel cost uncertainties have lesser\neffects. The analysis highlights how energy policies like the PTC can reduce\nLCOE by 22-24%, improving viability despite cost variability. Compared to\nconventional nuclear, coal, and renewable sources like offshore wind, hydro,\nand biomass, optimized microreactors show strong economic potential.

Our\nbenchmark emphasizes two distinct settings to test reasoning complexity: one\nwith immediate feedback upon incorrect decisions, and the other requiring\nmodels to independently trace back and revise earlier choices after failure. As\npart of this benchmark, we also construct a new dataset designed to test LLMs'\nLTM within narrative-driven environments. We further validate the effectiveness\nof our approach through detailed experiments. Experimental results demonstrate\nthe benchmark's ability to robustly and reliably assess LTM in LLMs."

In this study, we evaluate 12 pre-trained LLMs and one\nspecialized fact-verifier, including frontier LLMs and open-weight reasoning\nLLMs, using a collection of examples from 14 fact-checking benchmarks. We share\nthree findings intended to guide future development of more robust fact\nverifiers. First, we highlight the importance of addressing annotation errors\nand ambiguity in datasets, demonstrating that approximately 16\\% of ambiguous\nor incorrectly labeled data substantially influences model rankings. Neglecting\nthis issue may result in misleading conclusions during comparative evaluations,\nand we suggest using a systematic pipeline utilizing LLM-as-a-judge to help\nidentify these issues at scale. Second, we discover that frontier LLMs with\nfew-shot in-context examples, often overlooked in previous works, achieve\ntop-tier performance. We therefore recommend future studies include comparisons\nwith these simple yet highly effective baselines. Lastly, despite their\neffectiveness, frontier LLMs incur substantial costs, motivating the\ndevelopment of small, fine-tuned fact verifiers. We show that these small\nmodels still have room for improvement, particularly on instances that require\ncomplex reasoning. Encouragingly, we demonstrate that augmenting training with\nsynthetic multi-hop reasoning data significantly enhances their capabilities in\nsuch instances.
