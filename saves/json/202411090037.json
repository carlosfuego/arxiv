While these approaches incorporate support sets to maintain data\ndistribution consistency between knowledge cache and test sets, they often fall\nshort in terms of generalization on the test set, particularly when faced with\ntest data exhibiting substantial distributional variations.

We conduct a thorough evaluation of Hunyuan-Large's superior\nperformance across various benchmarks including language understanding and\ngeneration, logical reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, coding,\nlong-context, and aggregated tasks, where it outperforms LLama3.1-70B and\nexhibits comparable performance when compared to the significantly larger\nLLama3.1-405B model. Key practice of Hunyuan-Large include large-scale\nsynthetic data that is orders larger than in previous literature, a mixed\nexpert routing strategy, a key-value cache compression technique, and an\nexpert-specific learning rate strategy. Additionally, we also investigate the\nscaling laws and learning rate schedule of mixture of experts models, providing\nvaluable insights and guidances for future model development and optimization.\nThe code and checkpoints of Hunyuan-Large are released to facilitate future\ninnovations and applications.\n  Codes: https://github.com/Tencent/Hunyuan-Large\n  Models: https://huggingface.co/tencent/Tencent-Hunyuan-Large",

We present HOBBIT, a mixed precision expert\noffloading system to enable flexible and efficient MoE inference. Our key\ninsight is that dynamically replacing less critical cache-miss experts with low\nprecision versions can substantially reduce expert-loading latency while\npreserving model accuracy. HOBBIT introduces three innovative techniques that\nmap the natural hierarchy of MoE computation: (1) a token-level dynamic expert\nloading mechanism, (2) a layer-level adaptive expert prefetching technique, and\n(3) a sequence-level multidimensional expert caching policy. These innovations\nfully leverage the benefits of mixedprecision expert inference. By implementing\nHOBBIT on top of the renowned LLM inference framework Llama.cpp, we evaluate\nits performance across different edge devices with representative MoE models.\nThe results demonstrate that HOBBIT achieves up to a 9.93x speedup in decoding\ncompared to state-of-the-art MoE offloading systems.",

In this context, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite\nconstellations offer remarkable potential for efficient cache content broadcast\nin remote regions, thereby extending the reach of digital services. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content\nplacement using NTN.

Specifically, we dynamically\nselect content for placement via NTN links. This selection is based on\npopularity and suitability for delivery through NTN, while considering the\norbital motion of LEO satellites. Our system-level case studies, based on a\npractical LEO constellation, demonstrate the significant improvement in\nplacement speed compared to existing methods, which neglect network mobility.\nWe also demonstrate that NTN links significantly outperform standalone wireless\nTN solutions, particularly in the early stages of content delivery.

While traditional content\nrecommendations are oblivious to network conditions, the paradigm of\nNetwork-Friendly Recommendations (NFR) has recently emerged, favoring content\nthat improves network performance (e.g. cached near the user), while still\nbeing appealing to the user. However, NFR algorithms sometimes achieve their\ngoal by shrinking the pool of content recommended to users. The undesirable\nside-effect is reduced content diversity, a phenomenon known as\n``content/filter bubble''. This reduced diversity is problematic for both\nusers, who are prevented from exploring a broader range of content, and content\ncreators (e.g. YouTubers) whose content may be recommended less frequently,\nleading to perceived unfairness. In this paper, we first investigate - using\nreal data and state-of-the-art NFR schemes - the extent of this phenomenon. We\nthen formulate a ``Diverse-NFR'' optimization problem (i.e., network-friendly\nrecommendations with - sufficient - content diversity), and through a series of\ntransformation steps, we manage to reduce it to a linear program that can be\nsolved fast and optimally. Our findings show that Diverse-NFR can achieve high\nnetwork gains (comparable to non-diverse NFR) while maintaining diversity\nconstraints.

This paper presents a hidden dimension compression approach called\nPalu, a KV-Cache compression framework that utilizes low-rank projection to\nreduce inference-time LLM memory usage. Palu decomposes the linear layers into\nlow-rank matrices, caches compressed intermediate states, and reconstructs the\nfull keys and values on the fly. To improve accuracy, compression rate, and\nefficiency, Palu further encompasses (1) a medium-grained low-rank\ndecomposition scheme, (2) an efficient rank search algorithm, (3)\nlow-rank-aware quantization compatibility enhancements, and (4) optimized GPU\nkernels with operators fusion. Extensive experiments with popular LLMs show\nthat Palu compresses KV-Cache by 50% while maintaining strong accuracy and\ndelivering up to 1.89x on the RoPE-based attention module. When combined with\nquantization, Palu's inherent quantization-friendly design yields small to\nnegligible extra accuracy degradation while saving additional memory than\nquantization-only methods and achieving up to 2.91x speedup for the RoPE-based\nattention. Moreover, it maintains comparable or even better accuracy (up to\n1.19 lower perplexity) compared to quantization-only methods.

Self-attention requires the key-value (KV)\ncache of all previous sequences to be retrieved from memory at every decoding\nstep to retrieve context information, leading to two primary bottlenecks during\nbatch inference. First, there is a significant delay in obtaining the first\ntoken, as the information of the entire prompt must first be processed to\nprefill the KV cache. Second, computation of subsequent tokens is bottlenecked\nby the high memory I/O demand of fetching the entire KV cache, which grows\nlinearly with sequence length, incurring quadratic memory reads overall. We\ndesign the Block Transformer to strategically mitigate these costs, by\nincorporating coarsity and locality into an integrated global-to-local\narchitecture. At the lower layers, we aggregate tokens into fixed size blocks\nto apply attention across the entire sequence at coarse-grained detail, to\ncapture the global context while minimizing KV cache overhead. At upper layers,\nwe apply attention within each block to decode individual tokens, to model\nfine-grained details with a lightweight local KV cache. We pretrain vanilla and\nBlock Transformers from scratch and demonstrate that Block Transformers reach\n10--20x inference throughput compared to vanilla transformers with equivalent\nperplexity and zero-shot task performance.

Under the hood, language models support\nthis by running an autoregressive inference pass to provide a draft.\nConsequently, providing $k$ drafts to the user requires running an expensive\nlanguage model $k$ times. To alleviate the computation cost of running $k$\ninference passes, we propose Superposed Decoding, a new decoding algorithm that\ngenerates $k$ drafts at the computation cost of one autoregressive inference\npass. We achieve this by feeding a superposition of the most recent token\nembeddings from the $k$ drafts as input to the next decoding step of the\nlanguage model. At every inference step we combine the $k$ drafts with the\ntop-$k$ tokens to get $k^2$ new drafts and cache the $k$ most likely options,\nusing an n-gram interpolation with minimal compute overhead to filter out\nincoherent generations. Our experiments show that $k$ drafts from Superposed\nDecoding are at least as coherent and factual as Nucleus Sampling and Greedy\nDecoding respectively, while being at least $2.44\\times$ faster for $k\\ge3$. In\na compute-normalized setting, user evaluations demonstrably favor text\ngenerated by Superposed Decoding over Nucleus Sampling. Superposed Decoding can\nalso be combined with other decoding strategies, resulting in universal\ncoverage gains when scaling inference time compute.

                    "value": "Many applications today provide users with multiple auto-complete drafts as\nthey type, including GitHub's code completion, Gmail's smart compose, and\nApple's messaging auto-suggestions. Under the hood, language models support\nthis by running an autoregressive inference pass to provide a draft.\nConsequently, providing $k$ drafts to the user requires running an expensive\nlanguage model $k$ times. To alleviate the computation cost of running $k$\ninference passes, we propose Superposed Decoding, a new decoding algorithm that\ngenerates $k$ drafts at the computation cost of one autoregressive inference\npass. We achieve this by feeding a superposition of the most recent token\nembeddings from the $k$ drafts as input to the next decoding step of the\nlanguage model. At every inference step we combine the $k$ drafts with the\ntop-$k$ tokens to get $k^2$ new drafts and cache the $k$ most likely options,\nusing an n-gram interpolation with minimal compute overhead to filter out\nincoherent generations. Our experiments show that $k$ drafts from Superposed\nDecoding are at least as coherent and factual as Nucleus Sampling and Greedy\nDecoding respectively, while being at least $2.44\\times$ faster for $k\\ge3$. In\na compute-normalized setting, user evaluations demonstrably favor text\ngenerated by Superposed Decoding over Nucleus Sampling. Superposed Decoding can\nalso be combined with other decoding strategies, resulting in universal\ncoverage gains when scaling inference time compute.

To bridge the gap, we propose VL-Cache,\na novel KV cache compression recipe tailored for accelerating VLM inference. In\nthis paper, we first investigate the unique sparsity pattern of VLM attention\nby distinguishing visual and text tokens in prefill and decoding phases. Based\non these observations, we introduce a layer-adaptive sparsity-aware cache\nbudget allocation method that effectively distributes the limited cache budget\nacross different layers, further reducing KV cache size without compromising\naccuracy. Additionally, we develop a modality-aware token scoring policy to\nbetter evaluate the token importance. Empirical results on multiple benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that retaining only 10% of KV cache achieves accuracy\ncomparable to that with full cache. In a speed benchmark, our method\naccelerates end-to-end latency of generating 100 tokens by up to 2.33x and\nspeeds up decoding by up to 7.08x, while reducing the memory footprint of KV\ncache in GPU by 90%.",

In\nthis paper, we first investigate the unique sparsity pattern of VLM attention\nby distinguishing visual and text tokens in prefill and decoding phases. Based\non these observations, we introduce a layer-adaptive sparsity-aware cache\nbudget allocation method that effectively distributes the limited cache budget\nacross different layers, further reducing KV cache size without compromising\naccuracy. Additionally, we develop a modality-aware token scoring policy to\nbetter evaluate the token importance. Empirical results on multiple benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that retaining only 10% of KV cache achieves accuracy\ncomparable to that with full cache. In a speed benchmark, our method\naccelerates end-to-end latency of generating 100 tokens by up to 2.33x and\nspeeds up decoding by up to 7.08x, while reducing the memory footprint of KV\ncache in GPU by 90%."

Various dynamic sparse or TopK-based attention\napproximation methods have been proposed to leverage the common insight that\nattention is sparse. In this paper, we first show that TopK attention itself\nsuffers from quality degradation in certain downstream tasks because attention\nis not always as sparse as expected. Rather than selecting the keys and values\nwith the highest attention scores, sampling with theoretical guarantees can\nprovide a better estimation for attention output. To make the sampling-based\napproximation practical in LLM generation, we propose MagicPIG, a heterogeneous\nsystem based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). MagicPIG significantly\nreduces the workload of attention computation while preserving high accuracy\nfor diverse tasks. MagicPIG stores the LSH hash tables and runs the attention\ncomputation on the CPU, which allows it to serve longer contexts and larger\nbatch sizes with high approximation accuracy. MagicPIG can improve decoding\nthroughput by $1.9\\sim3.9\\times$ across various GPU hardware and achieve 110ms\ndecoding latency on a single RTX 4090 for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model with a\ncontext of 96k tokens.

To overcome\nthis issue, we introduce \\textit{adaptive negative proxies}, which are\ndynamically generated during testing by exploring actual OOD images, to align\nmore closely with the underlying OOD label space and enhance the efficacy of\nnegative proxy guidance. Specifically, our approach utilizes a feature memory\nbank to selectively cache discriminative features from test images,\nrepresenting the targeted OOD distribution.

The final\nscore for identifying OOD samples integrates static negative labels with our\nproposed adaptive proxies, effectively combining textual and visual knowledge\nfor enhanced performance.

Quantization\nis a promising approach for compressing KV cache activations; however, existing\nsolutions fail to represent activations accurately in sub-4-bit precision. Our\nwork, KVQuant, facilitates low precision KV cache quantization by incorporating\nseveral novel methods: (i) Per-Channel Key Quantization, where we adjust the\ndimension along which we quantize the Key activations to better match the\ndistribution; (ii) Pre-RoPE Key Quantization, where we quantize Key activations\nbefore the rotary positional embedding to mitigate its impact on quantization;\n(iii) Non-Uniform KV Cache Quantization, where we derive per-layer\nsensitivity-weighted non-uniform datatypes that better represent the\ndistributions; and (iv) Per-Vector Dense-and-Sparse Quantization, where we\nisolate outliers separately for each vector to minimize skews in quantization\nranges. By applying our method to the LLaMA, Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral\nmodels, we achieve < 0.1 perplexity degradation with 3-bit quantization on both\nWikitext-2 and C4, outperforming existing approaches. Our method enables\nserving LLaMA-7B with a context length of up to 1 million on a single A100-80GB\nGPU and up to 10 million on an 8-GPU system. We develop custom CUDA kernels for\nKVQuant, showing that we can achieve up to ~1.7x speedups, compared to baseline\nfp16 matrix-vector multiplications, for the LLaMA-7B model.",

                    "value": "LLMs are seeing growing use for applications which require large context\nwindows, and with these large context windows KV cache activations surface as\nthe dominant contributor to memory consumption during inference. Quantization\nis a promising approach for compressing KV cache activations; however, existing\nsolutions fail to represent activations accurately in sub-4-bit precision. Our\nwork, KVQuant, facilitates low precision KV cache quantization by incorporating\nseveral novel methods: (i) Per-Channel Key Quantization, where we adjust the\ndimension along which we quantize the Key activations to better match the\ndistribution; (ii) Pre-RoPE Key Quantization, where we quantize Key activations\nbefore the rotary positional embedding to mitigate its impact on quantization;\n(iii) Non-Uniform KV Cache Quantization, where we derive per-layer\nsensitivity-weighted non-uniform datatypes that better represent the\ndistributions; and (iv) Per-Vector Dense-and-Sparse Quantization, where we\nisolate outliers separately for each vector to minimize skews in quantization\nranges. By applying our method to the LLaMA, Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral\nmodels, we achieve < 0.1 perplexity degradation with 3-bit quantization on both\nWikitext-2 and C4, outperforming existing approaches. Our method enables\nserving LLaMA-7B with a context length of up to 1 million on a single A100-80GB\nGPU and up to 10 million on an 8-GPU system. We develop custom CUDA kernels for\nKVQuant, showing that we can achieve up to ~1.7x speedups, compared to baseline\nfp16 matrix-vector multiplications, for the LLaMA-7B model."

However, this approach is\ncomputationally expensive. To address this problem, we propose Transformer with\nresidual value (ResFormer) which approximates cross-layer attention through\nadding a residual connection from the values of the the first layer to all\nsubsequent layers. Based on this method, one variant is the Transformer with\nsingle layer value (SVFormer), where all layers share the same value embedding\nfrom first layer, reducing the KV cache by nearly 50%. Comprehensive empirical\nevidence demonstrates that ResFormer mitigates attention concentration problem\nin deeper layers and enhances representation across most layers, outperforming\nthe vanilla Transformer, DenseFormer, and NeuTRENO in training error as well as\ndownstream tasks. SVFormer trains significantly faster than the vanilla\nTransformer and performs better than other methods like GQA and CLA, with\nperformance influenced by sequence length and cumulative learning rate.",

Then, given a generation,\nRapidIn efficiently traverses the cached gradients to estimate the influence\nwithin minutes, achieving over a 6,326x speedup. Moreover, RapidIn supports\nmulti-GPU parallelization to substantially accelerate caching and retrieval.\nOur empirical result confirms the efficiency and effectiveness of RapidIn.",

                "summary": "The KV-Cache technique has become the standard for the inference of large\nlanguage models (LLMs). It caches states of self-attention to avoid\nrecomputation. Yet, it is widely criticized that KV-Cache can become a\nbottleneck of the LLM inference system, especially when confronted with\nultra-large models and long-context queries. A natural remedy is to discard the\nKV-Cache for less important tokens, with StreamingLLM as an example, but the\nused static eviction strategies cannot flexibly adapt to varying contexts.\nRemedies like H2O leverage accumulative attention scores to perform dynamic\neviction but suffer from the attention bias issue in capturing contextual\ninformation. This paper bridges this gap by devising a parameterized KV-Cache\neviction mechanism, dubbed as Attention-Gate, which accepts the whole context\nas input and yields eviction flags for each token to realize in-context\neviction. The subsequent self-attention module proceeds according to the flags\nand only the KV states for the remaining tokens need to be cached. The\nAttention-Gates can vary among different heads and layers and be trivially\nplugged into pre-trained LLMs, tuned by cost-effective continual pre-training\nor supervised fine-tuning objectives to acquire what to discard. The\ncomputational and memory overhead introduced by Attention-Gates is minimal. Our\nmethod is validated across multiple tasks, demonstrating both efficiency and\nadaptability. After a highly efficient continual pre-training, it achieves\nhigher average accuracy and evicts more tokens compared to traditional\ntraining-free methods.

                    "value": "The KV-Cache technique has become the standard for the inference of large\nlanguage models (LLMs). It caches states of self-attention to avoid\nrecomputation. Yet, it is widely criticized that KV-Cache can become a\nbottleneck of the LLM inference system, especially when confronted with\nultra-large models and long-context queries. A natural remedy is to discard the\nKV-Cache for less important tokens, with StreamingLLM as an example, but the\nused static eviction strategies cannot flexibly adapt to varying contexts.\nRemedies like H2O leverage accumulative attention scores to perform dynamic\neviction but suffer from the attention bias issue in capturing contextual\ninformation.

However, increasing the number of model\nlayers and the length of input sequences significantly escalates the memory\nrequired to store key-value (KV) cache, posing challenges for efficient\ninference. To mitigate this issue, we present SimLayerKV, a simple yet\neffective method that reduces inter-layer KV cache redundancies by selectively\ndropping cache in identified lazy layers. Our approach is based on the\nobservation that certain layers in long-context LLMs exhibit \"lazy\" behavior,\ncontributing less to modeling long-range dependencies compared to non-lazy\nlayers. By analyzing attention weight patterns, we find that the behavior of\nthese lazy layers is consistent across tokens during generation for a given\ninput. This insight motivates our SimLayerKV, which identifies lazy layers and\nreduces their KV cache accordingly. SimLayerKV is training-free, generalizable,\nand can be implemented with only seven lines of code. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on three representative LLMs, e.g., LLaMA2-7B, LLaMA3-8B, and\nMistral-7B across 16 tasks from the LongBench benchmark. The results\ndemonstrate that SimLayerKV achieves a KV cache compression ratio of 5$\\times$\nwith only a 1.2% performance drop when combined with 4-bit quantization.

In this work, we aim to accelerate diffusion models by quantizing\ntheir weights and activations to 4 bits. At such an aggressive level, both\nweights and activations are highly sensitive, where conventional post-training\nquantization methods for large language models like smoothing become\ninsufficient. To overcome this limitation, we propose SVDQuant, a new 4-bit\nquantization paradigm. Different from smoothing which redistributes outliers\nbetween weights and activations, our approach absorbs these outliers using a\nlow-rank branch. We first consolidate the outliers by shifting them from\nactivations to weights, then employ a high-precision low-rank branch to take in\nthe weight outliers with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This process eases\nthe quantization on both sides. However, na\\\"{\\i}vely running the low-rank\nbranch independently incurs significant overhead due to extra data movement of\nactivations, negating the quantization speedup. To address this, we co-design\nan inference engine Nunchaku that fuses the kernels of the low-rank branch into\nthose of the low-bit branch to cut off redundant memory access.

In this paper, we propose to change the static paradigm to an\ninteractive one, develop systems that proactively ask questions to gather more\ninformation and respond reliably, and introduce an benchmark - MediQ - to\nevaluate question-asking ability in LLMs. MediQ simulates clinical interactions\nconsisting of a Patient System and an adaptive Expert System; with potentially\nincomplete initial information, the Expert refrains from making diagnostic\ndecisions when unconfident, and instead elicits missing details via follow-up\nquestions. We provide a pipeline to convert single-turn medical benchmarks into\nan interactive format. Our results show that directly prompting\nstate-of-the-art LLMs to ask questions degrades performance, indicating that\nadapting LLMs to proactive information-seeking settings is nontrivial. We\nexperiment with abstention strategies to better estimate model confidence and\ndecide when to ask questions, improving diagnostic accuracy by 22.3%; however,\nperformance still lags compared to an (unrealistic in practice) upper bound\nwith complete information upfront.

In\nthe Chameleon 7B setting (autoregressive text-and-image generation), MoT\nmatches the dense baseline's performance using only 55.8\\% of the FLOPs. When\nextended to include speech, MoT reaches speech performance comparable to the\ndense baseline with only 37.2\\% of the FLOPs. In the Transfusion setting, where\ntext and image are trained with different objectives, a 7B MoT model matches\nthe image modality performance of the dense baseline with one third of the\nFLOPs, and a 760M MoT model outperforms a 1.4B dense baseline across key image\ngeneration metrics. System profiling further highlights MoT's practical\nbenefits, achieving dense baseline image quality in 47.2\\% of the wall-clock\ntime and text quality in 75.6\\% of the wall-clock time (measured on AWS\np4de.24xlarge instances with NVIDIA A100 GPUs)."

The limited access to source code in vital\nsystems - such as firmware, drivers, and proprietary software used in Critical\nInfrastructures (CI) - makes this analysis even more crucial on the binary\nlevel. Even with available source code, a semantic gap persists after\ncompilation between the source and the binary code executed by the processor.\nThis gap may hinder the detection of vulnerabilities in source code. That being\nsaid, current research on Large Language Models (LLMs) overlooks the\nsignificance of decompiled binaries in this area by focusing solely on source\ncode. In this work, we are the first to empirically uncover the substantial\nsemantic limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs when it comes to analyzing\nvulnerabilities in decompiled binaries, largely due to the absence of relevant\ndatasets. To bridge the gap, we introduce DeBinVul, a novel decompiled binary\ncode vulnerability dataset. Our dataset is multi-architecture and\nmulti-optimization, focusing on C/C++ due to their wide usage in CI and\nassociation with numerous vulnerabilities. Specifically, we curate 150,872\nsamples of vulnerable and non-vulnerable decompiled binary code for the task of\n(i) identifying; (ii) classifying; (iii) describing vulnerabilities; and (iv)\nrecovering function names in the domain of decompiled binaries. Subsequently,\nwe fine-tune state-of-the-art LLMs using DeBinVul and report on a performance\nincrease of 19%, 24%, and 21% in the capabilities of CodeLlama, Llama3, and\nCodeGen2 respectively, in detecting binary code vulnerabilities. Additionally,\nusing DeBinVul, we report a high performance of 80-90% on the vulnerability\nclassification task.

To facilitate the model training, we design a\ncomprehensive data construction and annotation pipeline that equips each CAD\nmodel with corresponding multimodal data. Our resulting dataset, named\nOmni-CAD, is the first multimodal CAD dataset that contains textual\ndescription, multi-view images, points, and command sequence for each CAD\nmodel.

However, they sometimes generate\nresponses that are logically coherent but factually incorrect or misleading,\nwhich is known as LLM hallucinations. Data-driven supervised methods train\nhallucination detectors by leveraging the internal states of LLMs, but\ndetectors trained on specific domains often struggle to generalize well to\nother domains.

Traditional methods have attempted to address\nthis challenge by employing learnable inversions and refinement models, but\nthese methods are primarily designed for 2D reconstruction and do not\ngeneralize well to 3D reconstruction. We introduce GANESH, a novel framework\ndesigned to enable simultaneous refinement and novel view synthesis from\nmulti-view lensless images. Unlike existing methods that require scene-specific\ntraining, our approach supports on-the-fly inference without retraining on each\nscene. Moreover, our framework allows us to tune our model to specific scenes,\nenhancing the rendering and refinement quality. To facilitate research in this\narea, we also present the first multi-view lensless dataset, LenslessScenes.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms current\napproaches in reconstruction accuracy and refinement quality.

In this work, we\npropose SYNTHEVAL, a hybrid behavioral testing framework that leverages large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to generate a wide range of test types for a\ncomprehensive evaluation of NLP models. SYNTHEVAL first generates sentences via\nLLMs using controlled generation, and then identifies challenging examples by\ncomparing the predictions made by LLMs with task-specific NLP models.

This approach requires\nbalancing on-device computations and communication costs, often achieved\nthrough compressed intermediate feature transmission. Conventional DNN\narchitectures require continuous data processing and floating point\nactivations, leading to considerable energy consumption and increased feature\nsizes, thus raising transmission costs. This challenge motivates exploring\nbinary, event-driven activations using spiking neural networks (SNNs), known\nfor their extreme energy efficiency. In this research, we propose\nSpikeBottleNet, a novel architecture for edge-cloud co-inference systems that\nintegrates a spiking neuron model to significantly reduce energy consumption on\nedge devices. A key innovation of our study is an intermediate feature\ncompression technique tailored for SNNs for efficient feature transmission.\nThis technique leverages a split computing approach to strategically place\nencoder-decoder bottleneck units within complex deep architectures like ResNet\nand MobileNet. Experimental results demonstrate that SpikeBottleNet achieves up\nto 256x bit compression in the final convolutional layer of ResNet, with\nminimal accuracy loss (0.16%). Additionally, our approach enhances edge device\nenergy efficiency by up to 144x compared to the baseline BottleNet, making it\nideal for resource-limited edge devices.",

Leveraging\ngraph features and molecular text representations, LLMs can tackle various\ntasks, such as predicting chemical reaction outcomes and describing molecular\nproperties. However, most current work overlooks the multi-level nature of\ngraph features. The impact of different feature levels on LLMs and the\nimportance of each level remain unexplored, and it is possible that different\nchemistry tasks require different feature levels. In this work, we first\ninvestigate the effect of feature granularity by fusing GNN-generated feature\ntokens, discovering that even reducing all tokens to a single token does not\nsignificantly impact performance. We then explore the effect of various feature\nlevels on performance, finding that both the quality of LLM-generated molecules\nand performance on different tasks benefit from different feature levels. We\nconclude with two key insights: (1) current molecular Multimodal LLMs(MLLMs)\nlack a comprehensive understanding of graph features, and (2) static processing\nis not sufficient for hierarchical graph feature.

This tool leverages a PINN\ntrained to predict P-wave travel times between arbitrary underground sources\nand surface receivers with a realistic 3D P-wave velocity structure model of\nthe Nankai Trough subduction zone that incorporates marine seismic survey data.\nThe PINN embeds physical laws, namely, the Eikonal equation, directly into the\nloss function of training and circumvents the need for labeled training data.\nTo address the training challenges posed by small-scale features in the\nvelocity model, we employed a simple domain decomposition approach and Fourier\nfeature embedding. Once trained, the PINN immediately infers the P-wave travel\ntime, enabling rapid hypocenter determination. The data size required to store\nNNs for travel time calculations is significantly smaller than those of\nconventional travel-time tables. HypoNet Nankai provides high flexibility for\naddition of new observation points. We verified HypoNet Nankai by comparing its\nperformance with a widely used grid-based numerical method for forward travel\ntime calculations and synthetic hypocenter determination. In both tests,\nHypoNet Nankai provided results consistent with those for the conventional\nmethod. HypoNet Nankai offers a rapid, accurate, and easy-to-use hypocenter\ndetermination method for the Nankai Trough subduction zone, with greater data\nefficiency and extendibility compared to conventional approaches.",

Once trained, the PINN immediately infers the P-wave travel\ntime, enabling rapid hypocenter determination. The data size required to store\nNNs for travel time calculations is significantly smaller than those of\nconventional travel-time tables. HypoNet Nankai provides high flexibility for\naddition of new observation points. We verified HypoNet Nankai by comparing its\nperformance with a widely used grid-based numerical method for forward travel\ntime calculations and synthetic hypocenter determination. In both tests,\nHypoNet Nankai provided results consistent with those for the conventional\nmethod. HypoNet Nankai offers a rapid, accurate, and easy-to-use hypocenter\ndetermination method for the Nankai Trough subduction zone, with greater data\nefficiency and extendibility compared to conventional approaches."

However, the labor-intensive nature of these benchmarks limits their\ntest scope, hindering their ability to generalize to the extensive variety of\nopen-world use cases and identify rare but crucial long-tail risks.\nAdditionally, these static tests fail to adapt to the rapid evolution of LLMs,\nmaking it hard to evaluate timely alignment issues. To address these\nchallenges, we propose ALI-Agent, an evaluation framework that leverages the\nautonomous abilities of LLM-powered agents to conduct in-depth and adaptive\nalignment assessments.

To gain a comprehensive understanding, it is essential to\nfind reliable tracers in less-explored regions like the bulge and the far side\nof the disk. Mira variables, which are well-studied and bright standard\ncandles, offer an excellent opportunity to trace intermediate and old\npopulations in these complex regions. We aim to isolate a clean sample of Miras\nin the Vista Variables in the V\\'ia L\\'actea survey using Gaussian process\nalgorithms. This sample will be used to study intermediate and old age\npopulations in the Galactic bulge and far disk. Near- and mid-infrared\ntime-series photometry were processed using Gaussian Process algorithms to\nidentify Mira variables and model their light curves. We calibrated selection\ncriteria with a visually inspected sample to create a high-purity sample of\nMiras, integrating multi-band photometry and kinematic data from proper\nmotions. We present a catalog of 3602 Mira variables. By analyzing photometry,\nwe classify them by O-rich or C-rich surface chemistry and derive\nselective-to-total extinction ratios of $A_{K_{s}}/E(J - K_{s}) = 0.471 \\pm\n0.01$ and $A_{K_{s}}/E(H - K_{s}) = 1.320 \\pm 0.020$. Using the Mira period-age\nrelation, we find evidence supporting the inside-out formation of the Milky Way\ndisk. The distribution of proper motions and distances aligns with the Galactic\nrotation curve and disk kinematics. We extend the rotation curve up to R$_{\\rm\nGC} \\sim 17 \\ \\rm{kpc}$ and find no strong evidence of the nuclear stellar disk\nin our Mira sample.

Our proposed OoD detector exploits the application of\nsupervised dimensionality reduction techniques to mitigate the effects of the\ncurse of dimensionality on the features extracted by the model. Furthermore, it\nutilizes high-resolution feature maps to identify potential unknown objects in\nan unsupervised fashion. Our experiments analyze the Pareto trade-off between\nthe performance detecting known and unknown objects resulting from different\nalgorithmic configurations and inference confidence thresholds. We also compare\nthe performance of our proposed algorithm to that of logits-based post-hoc OoD\nmethods, as well as possible fusion strategies.

In this paper, we draw attention to a common feature of\nrecent powerful LLMs, namely the alignment training, i.e., training LLMs to\ngenerate human-preferable texts. Our key finding is that as these aligned LLMs\nare trained to maximize the human preferences, they generate texts with higher\nestimated preferences even than human-written texts; thus, such texts are\neasily detected by using the reward model (i.e., an LLM trained to model human\npreference distribution). Based on this finding, we propose two training\nschemes to further improve the detection ability of the reward model, namely\n(i) continual preference fine-tuning to make the reward model prefer aligned\nLGTs even further and (ii) reward modeling of Human/LLM mixed texts (a\nrephrased texts from human-written texts using aligned LLMs), which serves as a\nmedian preference text corpus between LGTs and human-written texts to learn the\ndecision boundary better.

This approach facilitates cross-institutional collaboration and\nknowledge sharing while protecting sensitive data privacy, providing a viable\nsolution for further research and application in the medical field."

Unlike traditional offline methods\nthat rely on a fixed training set, ORI employs online backpropagation, updating\nthe model with each new data point, thereby allowing it to adapt to changing\nenvironments in real-time. A key innovation is the use of an adjacency matrix\nas a trainable parameter, optimized through a new adaptive learning rate\ntechnique called AdaRelation, which adjusts based on the historical sensitivity\nof the decoder to changes in the interaction graph. Additionally, a data\naugmentation method named Trajectory Mirror (TM) is introduced to improve\ngeneralization by exposing the model to varied trajectory patterns.\nExperimental results on both synthetic datasets and real-world data (CMU MoCap\nfor human motion) demonstrate that ORI significantly improves the accuracy and\nadaptability of relational inference in dynamic settings compared to existing\nmethods. This approach is model-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with\nvarious neural relational inference (NRI) architectures, and offers a robust\nsolution for real-time applications in complex, evolving systems.",

                    "value": "We introduce a novel framework, Online Relational Inference (ORI), designed\nto efficiently identify hidden interaction graphs in evolving multi-agent\ninteracting systems using streaming data. Unlike traditional offline methods\nthat rely on a fixed training set, ORI employs online backpropagation, updating\nthe model with each new data point, thereby allowing it to adapt to changing\nenvironments in real-time. A key innovation is the use of an adjacency matrix\nas a trainable parameter, optimized through a new adaptive learning rate\ntechnique called AdaRelation, which adjusts based on the historical sensitivity\nof the decoder to changes in the interaction graph. Additionally, a data\naugmentation method named Trajectory Mirror (TM) is introduced to improve\ngeneralization by exposing the model to varied trajectory patterns.\nExperimental results on both synthetic datasets and real-world data (CMU MoCap\nfor human motion) demonstrate that ORI significantly improves the accuracy and\nadaptability of relational inference in dynamic settings compared to existing\nmethods. This approach is model-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with\nvarious neural relational inference (NRI) architectures, and offers a robust\nsolution for real-time applications in complex, evolving systems."

To address this challenge, we propose a\ntwo-phase channel estimation scheme.

In the second phase, the subchannel estimation corresponding\nto different paths is formulated as a three-layer Bayesian inference problem.\nSpecifically, the first layer captures block sparsity in the angular domain,\nthe second layer promotes SnS property in the antenna domain, and the third\nlayer decouples the subchannels from the observed signals. To efficiently\nfacilitate Bayesian inference, we propose a novel three-layer generalized\napproximate message passing (TL-GAMP) algorithm based on structured variational\nmassage passing and belief propagation rules.

In this work, we aim to accelerate diffusion models by quantizing\ntheir weights and activations to 4 bits. At such an aggressive level, both\nweights and activations are highly sensitive, where conventional post-training\nquantization methods for large language models like smoothing become\ninsufficient. To overcome this limitation, we propose SVDQuant, a new 4-bit\nquantization paradigm. Different from smoothing which redistributes outliers\nbetween weights and activations, our approach absorbs these outliers using a\nlow-rank branch.

Further analyses show improved interactive\nperformance with filtering irrelevant contexts and reformatting conversations.\nOverall, we introduce a novel problem towards LLM reliability, an interactive\nMediQ benchmark and a novel question-asking system, and highlight directions to\nextend LLMs' information-seeking abilities in critical domains."

This raises an intriguing question:\ncan the capabilities of LLMs be harnessed to further improve multimodal\nrepresentation learning? The potential benefits of incorporating LLMs into CLIP\nare clear. LLMs' strong textual understanding can fundamentally improve CLIP's\nability to handle image captions, drastically enhancing its ability to process\nlong and complex texts, a well-known limitation of vanilla CLIP. Moreover, LLMs\nare trained on a vast corpus of text, possessing open-world knowledge.

In this paper, we propose LLM2CLIP, a novel\napproach that embraces the power of LLMs to unlock CLIP's potential. By\nfine-tuning the LLM in the caption space with contrastive learning, we extract\nits textual capabilities into the output embeddings, significantly improving\nthe output layer's textual discriminability. We then design an efficient\ntraining process where the fine-tuned LLM acts as a powerful teacher for CLIP's\nvisual encoder.

Our LLM model significantly\noutperformed traditional natural language processing techniques, especially in\ndetecting unknown DGAs.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their proficiency in\nreal-time detection tasks, making them ideal candidates for detecting DGAs. Our\nwork validates the effectiveness of fine-tuned LLMs for detecting DGAs and DNS\nexfiltration attacks. We developed LLM models and conducted comprehensive\nevaluation using a diverse dataset comprising 59 distinct real-world DGA\nmalware families and normal domain data. Our LLM model significantly\noutperformed traditional natural language processing techniques, especially in\ndetecting unknown DGAs.

Our approach enables flexible\ntree-structured speculation without the overhead of maintaining and\norchestrating additional models. SuffixDecoding builds and dynamically updates\nsuffix trees to capture patterns in the generated text, using them to construct\nspeculation trees through a principled scoring mechanism based on empirical\ntoken frequencies. SuffixDecoding requires only CPU memory which is plentiful\nand underutilized on typical LLM serving nodes. We demonstrate that\nSuffixDecoding achieves competitive speedups compared to model-based approaches\nacross diverse workloads including open-domain chat, code generation, and\ntext-to-SQL tasks. For open-ended chat and code generation tasks,\nSuffixDecoding achieves up to $1.4\\times$ higher output throughput than\nSpecInfer and up to $1.1\\times$ lower time-per-token (TPOT) latency. For a\nproprietary multi-LLM text-to-SQL application, SuffixDecoding achieves up to\n$2.9\\times$ higher output throughput and $3\\times$ lower latency than\nspeculative decoding.

This\nwork investigates the capabilities of eight Large Language Models in\nrecognizing lexical entailment relations among verbs through differently\ndevised prompting strategies and zero-/few-shot settings over verb pairs from\ntwo lexical databases, namely WordNet and HyperLex. Our findings unveil that\nthe models can tackle the lexical entailment recognition task with moderately\ngood performance, although at varying degree of effectiveness and under\ndifferent conditions.

Yet, their intricate semantic nuances pose a longstanding challenge.\nUnderstanding verb relations through the concept of lexical entailment is\ncrucial for comprehending sentence meanings and grasping verb dynamics. This\nwork investigates the capabilities of eight Large Language Models in\nrecognizing lexical entailment relations among verbs through differently\ndevised prompting strategies and zero-/few-shot settings over verb pairs from\ntwo lexical databases, namely WordNet and HyperLex. Our findings unveil that\nthe models can tackle the lexical entailment recognition task with moderately\ngood performance, although at varying degree of effectiveness and under\ndifferent conditions. Also, utilizing few-shot prompting can enhance the\nmodels' performance. However, perfectly solving the task arises as an unmet\nchallenge for all examined LLMs, which raises an emergence for further research\ndevelopments on this topic."

This has resulted in the recent\nresearch field of Safe RL, which aims to learn optimal policies that are safe.\nOne successful approach in that direction is probabilistic logic shields (PLS),\na model-based Safe RL technique that uses formal specifications based on\nprobabilistic logic programming, constraining an agent's policy to comply with\nthose specifications in a probabilistic sense.

In this\nwork, we bridge this gap by probing the representation spaces of 16 robust\nzero-shot CLIP vision encoders with various backbones (ResNets and ViTs) and\npretraining sets (OpenAI, LAION-400M, LAION-2B, YFCC15M, CC12M and {DataComp}),\nand comparing them to the representation spaces of less robust models with\nidentical backbones, but different (pre)training sets or objectives (CLIP\npretraining on ImageNet-Captions, and supervised training or finetuning on\nImageNet).Through this analysis, we generate three novel insights. Firstly, we\ndetect the presence of outlier features in robust zero-shot CLIP vision\nencoders, which to the best of our knowledge is the first time these are\nobserved in non-language and non-transformer models. Secondly, we find the\nexistence of outlier features to be an indication of ImageNet shift robustness\nin models, since we only find them in robust models in our analysis. Lastly, we\nalso investigate the number of unique encoded concepts in the representation\nspace and find zero-shot CLIP models to encode a higher number of unique\nconcepts in their representation space.

To address this, we introduce Tiny Time Mixers (TTM), a compact\nmodel (starting from 1M parameters) with effective transfer learning\ncapabilities, trained exclusively on public TS datasets. TTM, based on the\nlight-weight TSMixer architecture, incorporates innovations like adaptive\npatching, diverse resolution sampling, and resolution prefix tuning to handle\npre-training on varied dataset resolutions with minimal model capacity.\nAdditionally, it employs multi-level modeling to capture channel correlations\nand infuse exogenous signals during fine-tuning. TTM outperforms existing\npopular benchmarks in zero/few-shot forecasting by (4-40%), while reducing\ncomputational requirements significantly. Moreover, TTMs are lightweight and\ncan be executed even on CPU-only machines, enhancing usability and fostering\nwider adoption in resource-constrained environments.

Inspired by human\ncooperation schemes, CaPo improves cooperation efficiency with two phases: 1)\nmeta-plan generation, and 2) progress-adaptive meta-plan and execution. In the\nfirst phase, all agents analyze the task, discuss, and cooperatively create a\nmeta-plan that decomposes the task into subtasks with detailed steps, ensuring\na long-term strategic and coherent plan for efficient coordination. In the\nsecond phase, agents execute tasks according to the meta-plan and dynamically\nadjust it based on their latest progress (e.g., discovering a target object)\nthrough multi-turn discussions. This progress-based adaptation eliminates\nredundant actions, improving the overall cooperation efficiency of agents.\nExperimental results on the ThreeDworld Multi-Agent Transport and Communicative\nWatch-And-Help tasks demonstrate that CaPo achieves much higher task completion\nrate and efficiency compared with state-of-the-arts.",

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can elicit unintended and even harmful content\nwhen misaligned with human values, posing severe risks to users and society. To\nmitigate these risks, current evaluation benchmarks predominantly employ\nexpert-designed contextual scenarios to assess how well LLMs align with human\nvalues. However, the labor-intensive nature of these benchmarks limits their\ntest scope, hindering their ability to generalize to the extensive variety of\nopen-world use cases and identify rare but crucial long-tail risks.\nAdditionally, these static tests fail to adapt to the rapid evolution of LLMs,\nmaking it hard to evaluate timely alignment issues. To address these\nchallenges, we propose ALI-Agent, an evaluation framework that leverages the\nautonomous abilities of LLM-powered agents to conduct in-depth and adaptive\nalignment assessments. ALI-Agent operates through two principal stages:\nEmulation and Refinement. During the Emulation stage, ALI-Agent automates the\ngeneration of realistic test scenarios. In the Refinement stage, it iteratively\nrefines the scenarios to probe long-tail risks. Specifically, ALI-Agent\nincorporates a memory module to guide test scenario generation, a tool-using\nmodule to reduce human labor in tasks such as evaluating feedback from target\nLLMs, and an action module to refine tests. Extensive experiments across three\naspects of human values--stereotypes, morality, and legality--demonstrate that\nALI-Agent, as a general evaluation framework, effectively identifies model\nmisalignment. Systematic analysis also validates that the generated test\nscenarios represent meaningful use cases, as well as integrate enhanced\nmeasures to probe long-tail risks.

However, due to the limited context\nwindow of LLMs, this reranking paradigm requires a sliding window strategy to\niteratively handle larger candidate sets. This not only increases computational\ncosts but also restricts the LLM from fully capturing all the comparison\ninformation for all candidates. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nself-calibrated listwise reranking method, which aims to leverage LLMs to\nproduce global relevance scores for ranking. To achieve it, we first propose\nthe relevance-aware listwise reranking framework, which incorporates explicit\nlist-view relevance scores to improve reranking efficiency and enable global\ncomparison across the entire candidate set. Second, to ensure the comparability\nof the computed scores, we propose self-calibrated training that uses\npoint-view relevance assessments generated internally by the LLM itself to\ncalibrate the list-view relevance assessments.

                "summary": "The remarkable capabilities and easy accessibility of large language models\n(LLMs) have significantly increased societal risks (e.g., fake news\ngeneration), necessitating the development of LLM-generated text (LGT)\ndetection methods for safe usage. However, detecting LGTs is challenging due to\nthe vast number of LLMs, making it impractical to account for each LLM\nindividually; hence, it is crucial to identify the common characteristics\nshared by these models. In this paper, we draw attention to a common feature of\nrecent powerful LLMs, namely the alignment training, i.e., training LLMs to\ngenerate human-preferable texts. Our key finding is that as these aligned LLMs\nare trained to maximize the human preferences, they generate texts with higher\nestimated preferences even than human-written texts; thus, such texts are\neasily detected by using the reward model (i.e., an LLM trained to model human\npreference distribution). Based on this finding, we propose two training\nschemes to further improve the detection ability of the reward model, namely\n(i) continual preference fine-tuning to make the reward model prefer aligned\nLGTs even further and (ii) reward modeling of Human/LLM mixed texts (a\nrephrased texts from human-written texts using aligned LLMs), which serves as a\nmedian preference text corpus between LGTs and human-written texts to learn the\ndecision boundary better. We provide an extensive evaluation by considering six\ntext domains across twelve aligned LLMs, where our method demonstrates\nstate-of-the-art results.

                    "value": "The remarkable capabilities and easy accessibility of large language models\n(LLMs) have significantly increased societal risks (e.g., fake news\ngeneration), necessitating the development of LLM-generated text (LGT)\ndetection methods for safe usage. However, detecting LGTs is challenging due to\nthe vast number of LLMs, making it impractical to account for each LLM\nindividually; hence, it is crucial to identify the common characteristics\nshared by these models. In this paper, we draw attention to a common feature of\nrecent powerful LLMs, namely the alignment training, i.e., training LLMs to\ngenerate human-preferable texts. Our key finding is that as these aligned LLMs\nare trained to maximize the human preferences, they generate texts with higher\nestimated preferences even than human-written texts; thus, such texts are\neasily detected by using the reward model (i.e., an LLM trained to model human\npreference distribution). Based on this finding, we propose two training\nschemes to further improve the detection ability of the reward model, namely\n(i) continual preference fine-tuning to make the reward model prefer aligned\nLGTs even further and (ii) reward modeling of Human/LLM mixed texts (a\nrephrased texts from human-written texts using aligned LLMs), which serves as a\nmedian preference text corpus between LGTs and human-written texts to learn the\ndecision boundary better. We provide an extensive evaluation by considering six\ntext domains across twelve aligned LLMs, where our method demonstrates\nstate-of-the-art results.

Downstream, we seek to inspire\nfurther research on the phenomenon to deepen our understanding of LLMs -- and\nneural networks at large -- and improve existing architectures based on\n$\\mathcal{NC}$-related properties.

Furthermore,\nwe propose extending F1 score as an aggregated metric for long-form factuality.\nTo do so, we balance the percentage of supported facts in a response\n(precision) with the percentage of provided facts relative to a hyperparameter\nrepresenting a user's preferred response length (recall).\n  Empirically, we demonstrate that LLM agents can outperform crowdsourced human\nannotators - on a set of ~16k individual facts, SAFE agrees with crowdsourced\nhuman annotators 72% of the time, and on a random subset of 100 disagreement\ncases, SAFE wins 76% of the time.

Given the\nsensitive nature of such private data, it is desirable to fine-tune these\nmodels on edge devices to improve user trust. However, fine-tuning on\nresource-constrained edge devices presents significant challenges due to\nsubstantial memory and computational demands, as well as limited infrastructure\nsupport. We observe that inference engines (e.g., ExecuTorch) can be repurposed\nfor fine-tuning by leveraging zeroth-order (ZO) optimization, which uses\nmultiple forward passes to approximate gradients. However, directly applying ZO\nmethods on edge devices is impractical due to the high computational cost of\nmultiple model perturbations required to achieve accuracy improvements. Based\non these observations, we propose a memory- and computation-efficient LLM\nfine-tuning method for edge devices.

This study seeks to address these challenges by developing a multilingual\nlexicon designed for French and Tshiluba, now expanded to include translations\nin English, Afrikaans, Sepedi, and Zulu. The lexicon enhances cultural\nrelevance in sentiment classification by integrating language-specific\nsentiment scores. A comprehensive testing corpus is created to support\ntranslation and sentiment analysis tasks, with machine learning models such as\nRandom Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees, and Gaussian Naive\nBayes (GNB) trained to predict sentiment across low resource languages (LRLs).\nAmong them, the Random Forest model performed particularly well, capturing\nsentiment polarity and handling language-specific nuances effectively.\nFurthermore, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), a\nLarge Language Model (LLM), is applied to predict context-based sentiment with\nhigh accuracy, achieving 99% accuracy and 98% precision, outperforming other\nmodels. The BERT predictions were clarified using Explainable AI (XAI),\nimproving transparency and fostering confidence in sentiment classification.\nOverall, findings demonstrate that the proposed lexicon and machine learning\nmodels significantly enhance translation and sentiment analysis for LRLs in\nSouth Africa and the DRC, laying a foundation for future AI models that support\nunderrepresented languages, with applications across education, governance, and\nbusiness in multilingual contexts.",
