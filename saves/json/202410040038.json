                "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advances in supporting\nlong-context comprehension and processing tasks. However, scaling the\ngeneration inference of LLMs to such long contexts incurs significant\nadditional computation load, and demands a substantial GPU memory footprint to\nmaintain the key-value (KV) cache of transformer-based LLMs. Existing KV cache\ncompression methods, such as quantization, face memory bottlenecks as context\nlength increases, while static-sized caches, such as eviction, suffer from\ninefficient policies. These limitations restrict deployment on consumer-grade\ndevices like a single Nvidia 4090 GPU. To overcome this, we propose Locret, a\nframework for long-context LLM inference that introduces retaining heads to\nevaluate the causal importance of KV cache units, allowing for more accurate\neviction within a fixed cache size. Locret is fine-tuned on top of the frozen\nbackbone LLM using a minimal amount of data from standard long-context SFT\ndatasets. During inference, we evict low-importance cache units along with a\nchunked prefill pattern, significantly reducing peak GPU memory usage. We\nconduct an extensive empirical study to evaluate Locret, where the experimental\nresults show that Locret outperforms the recent competitive approaches,\nincluding InfLLM, Quantization, SirLLM, and MInference, in terms of memory\nefficiency and the quality of generated contents -- Locret achieves over a 20x\nand 8x KV cache compression ratio compared to the full KV cache for\nPhi-3-mini-128K and Llama-3.1-8B-instruct. Additionally, Locret can be combined\nwith other methods, such as quantization and token merging. To our knowledge,\nLocret is the first framework capable of deploying Llama-3.1-8B or similar\nmodels on a single Nvidia 4090 GPU, enabling 128K long-context inference\nwithout compromising generation quality, and requiring little additional system\noptimizations.",

To address this, two critical steps are often required: a\npretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length\nextension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural\nmodifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper\nargues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction\narchitecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but\nalso achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed\nLongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during\nlength extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention\npatterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink\n(initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are\nwell-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their\nGPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just\ntheoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to\nhave direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention\nlayers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency\nand long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data\nis sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.\n  We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its\neffectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts,\nLongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%,\ncompared to a full-attention baseline.

However, the memory cost\nof the Key and Value (KV) cache in attention significantly limits the practical\napplications of LLMs. Recent works have explored token pruning for KV cache\nreduction in LLMs, relying solely on attention scores as a token importance\nindicator. However, our investigation into value vector norms revealed a\nnotably non-uniform pattern questioning their reliance only on attention\nscores. Inspired by this, we propose a new method: Value-Aware Token Pruning\n(VATP) which uses both attention scores and the $ \\ell_{1} $ norm of value\nvectors to evaluate token importance. Extensive experiments on LLaMA2-7B-chat\nand Vicuna-v1.5-7B across 16 LongBench tasks demonstrate that VATP outperforms\nattention-score-only baselines in over 12 tasks, confirming the effectiveness\nof incorporating value vector norms into token importance evaluation of LLMs.",

                    "value": "Scaling the context size of large language models (LLMs) enables them to\nperform various new tasks, e.g., book summarization. However, the memory cost\nof the Key and Value (KV) cache in attention significantly limits the practical\napplications of LLMs. Recent works have explored token pruning for KV cache\nreduction in LLMs, relying solely on attention scores as a token importance\nindicator. However, our investigation into value vector norms revealed a\nnotably non-uniform pattern questioning their reliance only on attention\nscores. Inspired by this, we propose a new method: Value-Aware Token Pruning\n(VATP) which uses both attention scores and the $ \\ell_{1} $ norm of value\nvectors to evaluate token importance. Extensive experiments on LLaMA2-7B-chat\nand Vicuna-v1.5-7B across 16 LongBench tasks demonstrate that VATP outperforms\nattention-score-only baselines in over 12 tasks, confirming the effectiveness\nof incorporating value vector norms into token importance evaluation of LLMs."

                "summary": "The expensive fine-grained annotation and data scarcity have become the\nprimary obstacles for the widespread adoption of deep learning-based Whole\nSlide Images (WSI) classification algorithms in clinical practice. Unlike\nfew-shot learning methods in natural images that can leverage the labels of\neach image, existing few-shot WSI classification methods only utilize a small\nnumber of fine-grained labels or weakly supervised slide labels for training in\norder to avoid expensive fine-grained annotation. They lack sufficient mining\nof available WSIs, severely limiting WSI classification performance. To address\nthe above issues, we propose a novel and efficient dual-tier few-shot learning\nparadigm for WSI classification, named FAST. FAST consists of a dual-level\nannotation strategy and a dual-branch classification framework. Firstly, to\navoid expensive fine-grained annotation, we collect a very small number of WSIs\nat the slide level, and annotate an extremely small number of patches. Then, to\nfully mining the available WSIs, we use all the patches and available patch\nlabels to build a cache branch, which utilizes the labeled patches to learn the\nlabels of unlabeled patches and through knowledge retrieval for patch\nclassification. In addition to the cache branch, we also construct a prior\nbranch that includes learnable prompt vectors, using the text encoder of\nvisual-language models for patch classification. Finally, we integrate the\nresults from both branches to achieve WSI classification. Extensive experiments\non binary and multi-class datasets demonstrate that our proposed method\nsignificantly surpasses existing few-shot classification methods and approaches\nthe accuracy of fully supervised methods with only 0.22$\\%$ annotation costs.\nAll codes and models will be publicly available on\nhttps://github.com/fukexue/FAST.",

Unlike\nfew-shot learning methods in natural images that can leverage the labels of\neach image, existing few-shot WSI classification methods only utilize a small\nnumber of fine-grained labels or weakly supervised slide labels for training in\norder to avoid expensive fine-grained annotation. They lack sufficient mining\nof available WSIs, severely limiting WSI classification performance. To address\nthe above issues, we propose a novel and efficient dual-tier few-shot learning\nparadigm for WSI classification, named FAST. FAST consists of a dual-level\nannotation strategy and a dual-branch classification framework. Firstly, to\navoid expensive fine-grained annotation, we collect a very small number of WSIs\nat the slide level, and annotate an extremely small number of patches. Then, to\nfully mining the available WSIs, we use all the patches and available patch\nlabels to build a cache branch, which utilizes the labeled patches to learn the\nlabels of unlabeled patches and through knowledge retrieval for patch\nclassification. In addition to the cache branch, we also construct a prior\nbranch that includes learnable prompt vectors, using the text encoder of\nvisual-language models for patch classification. Finally, we integrate the\nresults from both branches to achieve WSI classification. Extensive experiments\non binary and multi-class datasets demonstrate that our proposed method\nsignificantly surpasses existing few-shot classification methods and approaches\nthe accuracy of fully supervised methods with only 0.22$\\%$ annotation costs.\nAll codes and models will be publicly available on\nhttps://github.com/fukexue/FAST."

To address this challenge, we propose TokenCache, a novel\npost-training acceleration method that leverages the token-based multi-block\narchitecture of transformers to reduce redundant computations among tokens\nacross inference steps. TokenCache specifically addresses three critical\nquestions in the context of diffusion transformers: (1) which tokens should be\npruned to eliminate redundancy, (2) which blocks should be targeted for\nefficient pruning, and (3) at which time steps caching should be applied to\nbalance speed and quality. In response to these challenges, TokenCache\nintroduces a Cache Predictor that assigns importance scores to tokens, enabling\nselective pruning without compromising model performance. Furthermore, we\npropose an adaptive block selection strategy to focus on blocks with minimal\nimpact on the network's output, along with a Two-Phase Round-Robin (TPRR)\nscheduling policy to optimize caching intervals throughout the denoising\nprocess. Experimental results across various models demonstrate that TokenCache\nachieves an effective trade-off between generation quality and inference speed\nfor diffusion transformers.

Compared to state-of-the-art NoCs, our system offers\nthree times the energy efficiency and more than double the link bandwidth.\nFurthermore, compared to a traditional AXI4-based multi-layer interconnect, our\nNoC achieves a 30% reduction in area, corresponding to a 47% increase in\nGFLOPSDP within the same floorplan."

The proposed system\nincorporates an additional, non-polluting prefetching mechanism to help\npopulate the long vector cache lines in advance to increase the hit rate by\nfurther exploiting the spatial locality on vector data. Its evaluation was\nconducted on the Cavatools simulator, comparing the performance to a standard\nconventional cache, over different typical vector benchmarks for several vector\nlengths. The results proved the proposed cache speeds up performance on\nstride-1 vector benchmarks, while hardly impacting non-stride-1's. In addition,\nthe prefetching feature consistently provided an additional value."

Despite recent advances in\nemploying optically active nanostructures in transmembrane potential sensing,\nthere remains room for improvement in terms of response time and sensitivity.\nHere, we report the development of such a nanosensor capable of detecting\nelectric fields with a submillisecond response time at the single particle\nlevel. We achieve this by using ferroelectric nanocrystals doped with rare\nearth ions producing upconversion (UC).

Despite recent advances in\nemploying optically active nanostructures in transmembrane potential sensing,\nthere remains room for improvement in terms of response time and sensitivity.\nHere, we report the development of such a nanosensor capable of detecting\nelectric fields with a submillisecond response time at the single particle\nlevel. We achieve this by using ferroelectric nanocrystals doped with rare\nearth ions producing upconversion (UC).

It is becoming popular in enterprise settings for daily business\noperations. For example, Copilot for Microsoft 365 has accumulated millions of\nbusinesses. However, the security implications of adopting such RAG-based\nsystems are unclear.\n  In this paper, we introduce ConfusedPilot, a class of security\nvulnerabilities of RAG systems that confuse Copilot and cause integrity and\nconfidentiality violations in its responses. First, we investigate a\nvulnerability that embeds malicious text in the modified prompt in RAG,\ncorrupting the responses generated by the LLM. Second, we demonstrate a\nvulnerability that leaks secret data, which leverages the caching mechanism\nduring retrieval. Third, we investigate how both vulnerabilities can be\nexploited to propagate misinformation within the enterprise and ultimately\nimpact its operations, such as sales and manufacturing. We also discuss the\nroot cause of these attacks by investigating the architecture of a RAG-based\nsystem. This study highlights the security vulnerabilities in today's RAG-based\nsystems and proposes design guidelines to secure future RAG-based systems.",

However, the security implications of adopting such RAG-based\nsystems are unclear.\n  In this paper, we introduce ConfusedPilot, a class of security\nvulnerabilities of RAG systems that confuse Copilot and cause integrity and\nconfidentiality violations in its responses. First, we investigate a\nvulnerability that embeds malicious text in the modified prompt in RAG,\ncorrupting the responses generated by the LLM. Second, we demonstrate a\nvulnerability that leaks secret data, which leverages the caching mechanism\nduring retrieval. Third, we investigate how both vulnerabilities can be\nexploited to propagate misinformation within the enterprise and ultimately\nimpact its operations, such as sales and manufacturing. We also discuss the\nroot cause of these attacks by investigating the architecture of a RAG-based\nsystem. This study highlights the security vulnerabilities in today's RAG-based\nsystems and proposes design guidelines to secure future RAG-based systems."

In the single-phase TPC, the proportional scintillation\nlight (S2) is generated in liquid xenon in close proximity to 10 {\\mu}m\ndiameter anode wires. The detector was characterized and the proportional\nscintillation process was studied using the 32.1 keV and 9.4 keV signals from\n83mKr decays. A charge gain factor g2 of up to (1.9 $\\pm$ 0.3) PE/electron was\nreached at an anode voltage 4.4 kV higher than the gate electrode 5 mm below\nit, corresponding to (29 $\\pm$ 6) photons emitted per ionization electron. The\nduration of S2 signals is dominated by electron diffusion and approaches the\nxenon de-excitation timescale for very short electron drift times. The electron\ndrift velocity and the longitudinal diffusion constant were measured at a drift\nfield of 470 V/cm. The results agree with the literature and demonstrate that a\nsingle-phase TPC can be operated successfully.",

To address these issues, we propose a\ntraining-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition\n(ASVD).

Additionally, we propose an efficient iterative calibration process\nto optimize layer-specific decomposition by addressing the varying sensitivity\nof different LLM layers. ASVD can compress a network by 10-20%, without\ncompromising the performance of LLMs. Based on the success of the low-rank\ndecomposition of projection matrices in the self-attention module, we further\nintroduce ASVD to compress the KV cache. By reducing the channel dimension of\nKV activations, memory requirements for KV cache can be largely reduced.

However, detailed experimental characterization of its\nintrinsic defects as well as its defect creation characteristics under electron\nirradiation are scarce. Here, we report on the creation and stability of a\nvariety of defect configurations under 60 kV electron irradiation in mono- and\nbilayer phosphorene including the first experimental reports of stable\nadatom-vacancy-complexes.

                    "value": "Phosphorene, a puckered two-dimensional allotrope of phosphorus, has sparked\nconsiderable interest in recent years due to its potential especially for\noptoelectronic applications with its layer-number-dependant direct band gap and\nstrongly bound excitons. However, detailed experimental characterization of its\nintrinsic defects as well as its defect creation characteristics under electron\nirradiation are scarce. Here, we report on the creation and stability of a\nvariety of defect configurations under 60 kV electron irradiation in mono- and\nbilayer phosphorene including the first experimental reports of stable\nadatom-vacancy-complexes.

                "summary": "Language-queried target sound extraction (TSE) aims to extract specific\nsounds from mixtures based on language queries. Traditional fully-supervised\ntraining schemes require extensively annotated parallel audio-text data, which\nare labor-intensive. We introduce a language-free training scheme, requiring\nonly unlabelled audio clips for TSE model training by utilizing the multi-modal\nrepresentation alignment nature of the contrastive language-audio pre-trained\nmodel (CLAP). In a vanilla language-free training stage, target audio is\nencoded using the pre-trained CLAP audio encoder to form a condition embedding\nfor the TSE model, while during inference, user language queries are encoded by\nCLAP text encoder. This straightforward approach faces challenges due to the\nmodality gap between training and inference queries and information leakage\nfrom direct exposure to target audio during training.

                    "value": "Language-queried target sound extraction (TSE) aims to extract specific\nsounds from mixtures based on language queries. Traditional fully-supervised\ntraining schemes require extensively annotated parallel audio-text data, which\nare labor-intensive. We introduce a language-free training scheme, requiring\nonly unlabelled audio clips for TSE model training by utilizing the multi-modal\nrepresentation alignment nature of the contrastive language-audio pre-trained\nmodel (CLAP). In a vanilla language-free training stage, target audio is\nencoded using the pre-trained CLAP audio encoder to form a condition embedding\nfor the TSE model, while during inference, user language queries are encoded by\nCLAP text encoder. This straightforward approach faces challenges due to the\nmodality gap between training and inference queries and information leakage\nfrom direct exposure to target audio during training.

Here, electron\nemission from tungsten nanotips driven by THz pulses generated by a long\nfilament air-plasma are reported. Electron energies up to 1.1 keV and bunch\ncharges up to 2x$10^5$ electrons per pulse were detected, well below values\nexpected for peak field calculated via the time averaged Poynting vector.\nInvestigations revealed a failure in the use of the time-averaged Poynting\nvector when applied to long filament THz pulses, due to spatio-temporal\nrestructuring of the THz pulse in the focus. Accounting for this restructuring\nsignificantly reduces the field strength to approximately 160 ~kV/cm,\nconsistent with the observed electron bunch charges, peak energies and their\ndependence on the tip position in the THz focus. Despite these findings, our\nresults surpass previous THz plasma-driven electron generation by an order of\nmagnitude in both electron energy and bunch charge and a path to increasing\nthese by an additional order of magnitude by modification of the THz optics is\nproposed.",

                    "value": "Terahertz pulses generated by two-color laser plasmas have reported peak\nfield strengths exceeding MV/cm, and when illuminating metal nanotips the\nnear-field enhancement at the tip apex should result in extremely high bunch\ncharges and electron energies via sub-cycle cold field emission. Here, electron\nemission from tungsten nanotips driven by THz pulses generated by a long\nfilament air-plasma are reported. Electron energies up to 1.1 keV and bunch\ncharges up to 2x$10^5$ electrons per pulse were detected, well below values\nexpected for peak field calculated via the time averaged Poynting vector.\nInvestigations revealed a failure in the use of the time-averaged Poynting\nvector when applied to long filament THz pulses, due to spatio-temporal\nrestructuring of the THz pulse in the focus. Accounting for this restructuring\nsignificantly reduces the field strength to approximately 160 ~kV/cm,\nconsistent with the observed electron bunch charges, peak energies and their\ndependence on the tip position in the THz focus. Despite these findings, our\nresults surpass previous THz plasma-driven electron generation by an order of\nmagnitude in both electron energy and bunch charge and a path to increasing\nthese by an additional order of magnitude by modification of the THz optics is\nproposed."

Recent works alleviate this issue\nthrough the use of radiance caches: data structures that store the\nsteady-state, infinite-bounce radiance arriving at any point from any\ndirection. However, these solutions rely on approximations that introduce bias\ninto the renderings and, more importantly, into the gradients used for\noptimization. We present a method that avoids these approximations while\nremaining computationally efficient. In particular, we leverage two techniques\nto reduce variance for unbiased estimators of the rendering equation: (1) an\nocclusion-aware importance sampler for incoming illumination and (2) a fast\ncache architecture that can be used as a control variate for the radiance from\na high-quality, but more expensive, volumetric cache.

                "summary": "A critical approach for efficiently deploying computationally demanding large\nlanguage models (LLMs) is Key-Value (KV) caching. The KV cache stores key-value\nstates of previously generated tokens, significantly reducing the need for\nrepetitive computations and thereby lowering latency in autoregressive\ngeneration. However, the size of the KV cache grows linearly with sequence\nlength, posing challenges for applications requiring long context input and\nextensive sequence generation. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective\napproach, called MiniCache, to compress the KV cache across layers from a novel\ndepth perspective, significantly reducing the memory footprint for LLM\ninference. Our approach is based on the observation that KV cache states\nexhibit high similarity between the adjacent layers in the middle-to-deep\nportion of LLMs. To facilitate merging, we propose disentangling the states\ninto the magnitude and direction components, interpolating the directions of\nthe state vectors while preserving their lengths unchanged. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a token retention strategy to keep highly distinct state pairs\nunmerged, thus preserving the information with minimal additional storage\noverhead. Our MiniCache is training-free and general, complementing existing KV\ncache compression strategies, such as quantization and sparsity. We conduct a\ncomprehensive evaluation of MiniCache utilizing various models including\nLLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, Phi-3, Mistral, and Mixtral across multiple benchmarks,\ndemonstrating its exceptional performance in achieving superior compression\nratios and high throughput. On the ShareGPT dataset, LLaMA-2-7B with 4-bit\nMiniCache achieves a remarkable compression ratio of up to 5.02x, enhances\ninference throughput by approximately 5x, and reduces the memory footprint by\n41% compared to the FP16 full cache baseline, all while maintaining\nnear-lossless performance.",

This paper introduces SELCC; a\nShared-Exclusive Latch Cache Coherence protocol that maintains cache coherence\nwithout imposing any computational burden on the remote memory side. SELCC\nbuilds on a one-sided shared-exclusive latch protocol by introducing lazy latch\nrelease and invalidation messages among the compute nodes so that it can\nguarantee both data access atomicity and cache coherence. SELCC minimizes\ncommunication round-trips by embedding the current cache copy holder IDs into\nRDMA latch words and prioritizes local concurrency control over global\nconcurrency control. We instantiate the SELCC protocol onto compute-sided\ncache, forming an abstraction layer over disaggregated memory.

To demonstrate the usability of SELCC, we\nimplement a B-tree and three transaction concurrency control algorithms over\nSELCC's APIs.

However, scaling the\ngeneration inference of LLMs to such long contexts incurs significant\nadditional computation load, and demands a substantial GPU memory footprint to\nmaintain the key-value (KV) cache of transformer-based LLMs. Existing KV cache\ncompression methods, such as quantization, face memory bottlenecks as context\nlength increases, while static-sized caches, such as eviction, suffer from\ninefficient policies. These limitations restrict deployment on consumer-grade\ndevices like a single Nvidia 4090 GPU. To overcome this, we propose Locret, a\nframework for long-context LLM inference that introduces retaining heads to\nevaluate the causal importance of KV cache units, allowing for more accurate\neviction within a fixed cache size. Locret is fine-tuned on top of the frozen\nbackbone LLM using a minimal amount of data from standard long-context SFT\ndatasets. During inference, we evict low-importance cache units along with a\nchunked prefill pattern, significantly reducing peak GPU memory usage. We\nconduct an extensive empirical study to evaluate Locret, where the experimental\nresults show that Locret outperforms the recent competitive approaches,\nincluding InfLLM, Quantization, SirLLM, and MInference, in terms of memory\nefficiency and the quality of generated contents -- Locret achieves over a 20x\nand 8x KV cache compression ratio compared to the full KV cache for\nPhi-3-mini-128K and Llama-3.1-8B-instruct. Additionally, Locret can be combined\nwith other methods, such as quantization and token merging. To our knowledge,\nLocret is the first framework capable of deploying Llama-3.1-8B or similar\nmodels on a single Nvidia 4090 GPU, enabling 128K long-context inference\nwithout compromising generation quality, and requiring little additional system\noptimizations.",

However, the\nintractability of sampling Bayesian posteriors over many parameters inhibits\nthe use of Bayesian methods where they are most needed. Thermodynamic computing\nhas emerged as a paradigm for accelerating operations used in machine learning,\nsuch as matrix inversion, and is based on the mapping of Langevin equations to\nthe dynamics of noisy physical systems. Hence, it is natural to consider the\nimplementation of Langevin sampling algorithms on thermodynamic devices. In\nthis work we propose electronic analog devices that sample from Bayesian\nposteriors by realizing Langevin dynamics physically.

                    "value": "A fully Bayesian treatment of complicated predictive models (such as deep\nneural networks) would enable rigorous uncertainty quantification and the\nautomation of higher-level tasks including model selection. However, the\nintractability of sampling Bayesian posteriors over many parameters inhibits\nthe use of Bayesian methods where they are most needed. Thermodynamic computing\nhas emerged as a paradigm for accelerating operations used in machine learning,\nsuch as matrix inversion, and is based on the mapping of Langevin equations to\nthe dynamics of noisy physical systems. Hence, it is natural to consider the\nimplementation of Langevin sampling algorithms on thermodynamic devices. In\nthis work we propose electronic analog devices that sample from Bayesian\nposteriors by realizing Langevin dynamics physically.

Adapting a model\non test samples can help mitigate this drop in performance. However, most\ntest-time adaptation methods have focused on synthetic corruption shifts,\nleaving a variety of distribution shifts underexplored. In this paper, we focus\non distribution shifts that evolve gradually over time, which are common in the\nwild but challenging for existing methods, as we show. To address this, we\npropose STAD, a probabilistic state-space model that adapts a deployed model to\ntemporal distribution shifts by learning the time-varying dynamics in the last\nset of hidden features. Without requiring labels, our model infers\ntime-evolving class prototypes that act as a dynamic classification head.\nThrough experiments on real-world temporal distribution shifts, we show that\nour method excels in handling small batch sizes and label shift.",

                    "value": "Distribution shifts between training and test data are inevitable over the\nlifecycle of a deployed model, leading to performance decay. Adapting a model\non test samples can help mitigate this drop in performance. However, most\ntest-time adaptation methods have focused on synthetic corruption shifts,\nleaving a variety of distribution shifts underexplored. In this paper, we focus\non distribution shifts that evolve gradually over time, which are common in the\nwild but challenging for existing methods, as we show. To address this, we\npropose STAD, a probabilistic state-space model that adapts a deployed model to\ntemporal distribution shifts by learning the time-varying dynamics in the last\nset of hidden features. Without requiring labels, our model infers\ntime-evolving class prototypes that act as a dynamic classification head.\nThrough experiments on real-world temporal distribution shifts, we show that\nour method excels in handling small batch sizes and label shift."

But sometimes, an even better explanation is a bug in the\nprogrammer's mental model of the language or API they are using. Instead of\nmerely debugging our current code (\"giving the programmer a fish\"), what if our\ntools could directly debug our mental models (\"teaching the programmer to\nfish\")? In this paper, we apply recent ideas from computational cognitive\nscience to offer a principled framework for doing exactly that. Given a \"why?\"\nquestion about a program, we automatically infer potential misconceptions about\nthe language/API that might cause the user to be surprised by the program's\nbehavior -- and then analyze those misconceptions to provide explanations of\nthe program's behavior. Our key idea is to formally represent misconceptions as\ncounterfactual (erroneous) semantics for the language/API, which can be\ninferred and debugged using program synthesis techniques. We demonstrate our\nframework, WatChat, by building systems for explanation in two domains:\nJavaScript type coercion, and the Git version control system. We evaluate\nWatChatJS and WatChatGit by comparing their outputs to experimentally-collected\nhuman-written explanations in these two domains: we show that WatChat's\nexplanations exhibit key features of human-written explanation, unlike those of\na state-of-the-art language model.",

                    "value": "Often, a good explanation for a program's unexpected behavior is a bug in the\nprogrammer's code. But sometimes, an even better explanation is a bug in the\nprogrammer's mental model of the language or API they are using. Instead of\nmerely debugging our current code (\"giving the programmer a fish\"), what if our\ntools could directly debug our mental models (\"teaching the programmer to\nfish\")? In this paper, we apply recent ideas from computational cognitive\nscience to offer a principled framework for doing exactly that. Given a \"why?\"\nquestion about a program, we automatically infer potential misconceptions about\nthe language/API that might cause the user to be surprised by the program's\nbehavior -- and then analyze those misconceptions to provide explanations of\nthe program's behavior. Our key idea is to formally represent misconceptions as\ncounterfactual (erroneous) semantics for the language/API, which can be\ninferred and debugged using program synthesis techniques. We demonstrate our\nframework, WatChat, by building systems for explanation in two domains:\nJavaScript type coercion, and the Git version control system. We evaluate\nWatChatJS and WatChatGit by comparing their outputs to experimentally-collected\nhuman-written explanations in these two domains: we show that WatChat's\nexplanations exhibit key features of human-written explanation, unlike those of\na state-of-the-art language model."

However, the precise\ndefinition of style and the relationship between style, data quality, and LLM\nperformance remains unclear. This research identifies two key stylistic\nelements in responses: linguistic form and semantic surprisal. We find that,\namong training data of comparable quality, higher consistency in these response\nelements leads to better LLM performance. Inspired by this, we introduce Style\nConsistency-Aware Response Ranking (SCAR), which automatically prioritizes\ninstruction-response pairs in the training set based on their response\nstylistic consistency. By selecting the most style-consistent examples,\nsometimes as few as 0.7% of the full dataset, the fine-tuned LLMs can match or\neven surpass the performance of models trained on the entire dataset in coding\nand open-ended question-answering benchmarks.

However, the precise\ndefinition of style and the relationship between style, data quality, and LLM\nperformance remains unclear. This research identifies two key stylistic\nelements in responses: linguistic form and semantic surprisal. We find that,\namong training data of comparable quality, higher consistency in these response\nelements leads to better LLM performance. Inspired by this, we introduce Style\nConsistency-Aware Response Ranking (SCAR), which automatically prioritizes\ninstruction-response pairs in the training set based on their response\nstylistic consistency. By selecting the most style-consistent examples,\nsometimes as few as 0.7% of the full dataset, the fine-tuned LLMs can match or\neven surpass the performance of models trained on the entire dataset in coding\nand open-ended question-answering benchmarks.

Based on a Facebook public post-comment\ndataset, this study evaluates the ability of Llama 3.0 (70B) to predict the\nsemantic tones across different combinations of a commenter's and poster's\ngender, age, and friendship closeness and to replicate these differences in\nLLM-generated comments.\n  The study consists of two parts: Part I assesses differences in semantic\ntones across social relationship categories, and Part II examines the\nsimilarity between comments generated by Llama 3.0 (70B) and human comments\nfrom Part I given public Facebook posts as input. Part I results show that\nincluding social relationship information improves the ability of a model to\npredict the semantic tone of human comments. However, Part II results show that\neven without including social context information in the prompt, LLM-generated\ncomments and human comments are equally sensitive to social context, suggesting\nthat LLMs can comprehend semantics from the original post alone. When we\ninclude all social relationship information in the prompt, the similarity\nbetween human comments and LLM-generated comments decreases. This inconsistency\nmay occur because LLMs did not include social context information as part of\ntheir training data. Together these results demonstrate the ability of LLMs to\ncomprehend semantics from the original post and respond similarly to human\ncomments, but also highlights their limitations in generalizing personalized\ncomments through prompting alone.",

Based on a Facebook public post-comment\ndataset, this study evaluates the ability of Llama 3.0 (70B) to predict the\nsemantic tones across different combinations of a commenter's and poster's\ngender, age, and friendship closeness and to replicate these differences in\nLLM-generated comments.\n  The study consists of two parts: Part I assesses differences in semantic\ntones across social relationship categories, and Part II examines the\nsimilarity between comments generated by Llama 3.0 (70B) and human comments\nfrom Part I given public Facebook posts as input. Part I results show that\nincluding social relationship information improves the ability of a model to\npredict the semantic tone of human comments. However, Part II results show that\neven without including social context information in the prompt, LLM-generated\ncomments and human comments are equally sensitive to social context, suggesting\nthat LLMs can comprehend semantics from the original post alone. When we\ninclude all social relationship information in the prompt, the similarity\nbetween human comments and LLM-generated comments decreases. This inconsistency\nmay occur because LLMs did not include social context information as part of\ntheir training data. Together these results demonstrate the ability of LLMs to\ncomprehend semantics from the original post and respond similarly to human\ncomments, but also highlights their limitations in generalizing personalized\ncomments through prompting alone."

However, their reliability is\nhindered by issues of hallucination and generating non-factual content. This is\nparticularly problematic in long-form responses, where assessing and ensuring\nfactual accuracy is complex. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing\nFactAlign, a novel alignment framework designed to enhance the factuality of\nLLMs' long-form responses while maintaining their helpfulness. We introduce\nfKTO, a fine-grained, sentence-level alignment algorithm that extends the\nKahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) alignment method. Leveraging recent\nadvances in automatic factuality evaluation, FactAlign utilizes fine-grained\nfactuality assessments to guide the alignment process. Our experiments on\nopen-domain prompts and information-seeking questions demonstrate that\nFactAlign significantly improves the factual accuracy of LLM responses while\nalso improving their helpfulness. Further analyses identify that FactAlign is\ncapable of training LLMs to provide more information without losing factual\nprecision, thus improving the factual F1 score. Our source code, datasets, and\ntrained models are publicly available at https://github.com/MiuLab/FactAlign",

Despite the\navailability of numerous DP tools, there remains a lack of general techniques\nfor conducting statistical inference under DP. We examine a DP bootstrap\nprocedure that releases multiple private bootstrap estimates to infer the\nsampling distribution and construct confidence intervals (CIs). Our privacy\nanalysis presents new results on the privacy cost of a single DP bootstrap\nestimate, applicable to any DP mechanism, and identifies some misapplications\nof the bootstrap in the existing literature. For the composition of the DP\nbootstrap, we present a numerical method to compute the exact privacy cost of\nreleasing multiple DP bootstrap estimates, and using the Gaussian-DP (GDP)\nframework (Dong et al., 2022), we show that the release of $B$ DP bootstrap\nestimates from mechanisms satisfying $(\\mu/\\sqrt{(2-2/\\mathrm{e})B})$-GDP\nasymptotically satisfies $\\mu$-GDP as $B$ goes to infinity. Then, we perform\nprivate statistical inference by post-processing the DP bootstrap estimates. We\nprove that our point estimates are consistent, our standard CIs are\nasymptotically valid, and both enjoy optimal convergence rates. To further\nimprove the finite performance, we use deconvolution with DP bootstrap\nestimates to accurately infer the sampling distribution. We derive CIs for\ntasks such as population mean estimation, logistic regression, and quantile\nregression, and we compare them to existing methods using simulations and\nreal-world experiments on 2016 Canada Census data. Our private CIs achieve the\nnominal coverage level and offer the first approach to private inference for\nquantile regression.",

Despite the\navailability of numerous DP tools, there remains a lack of general techniques\nfor conducting statistical inference under DP. We examine a DP bootstrap\nprocedure that releases multiple private bootstrap estimates to infer the\nsampling distribution and construct confidence intervals (CIs). Our privacy\nanalysis presents new results on the privacy cost of a single DP bootstrap\nestimate, applicable to any DP mechanism, and identifies some misapplications\nof the bootstrap in the existing literature. For the composition of the DP\nbootstrap, we present a numerical method to compute the exact privacy cost of\nreleasing multiple DP bootstrap estimates, and using the Gaussian-DP (GDP)\nframework (Dong et al., 2022), we show that the release of $B$ DP bootstrap\nestimates from mechanisms satisfying $(\\mu/\\sqrt{(2-2/\\mathrm{e})B})$-GDP\nasymptotically satisfies $\\mu$-GDP as $B$ goes to infinity. Then, we perform\nprivate statistical inference by post-processing the DP bootstrap estimates. We\nprove that our point estimates are consistent, our standard CIs are\nasymptotically valid, and both enjoy optimal convergence rates. To further\nimprove the finite performance, we use deconvolution with DP bootstrap\nestimates to accurately infer the sampling distribution. We derive CIs for\ntasks such as population mean estimation, logistic regression, and quantile\nregression, and we compare them to existing methods using simulations and\nreal-world experiments on 2016 Canada Census data. Our private CIs achieve the\nnominal coverage level and offer the first approach to private inference for\nquantile regression."

In this work, we find that a floating point multiplier can be\napproximated by one integer adder with high precision. We propose the\nlinear-complexity multiplication L-Mul algorithm that approximates floating\npoint number multiplication with integer addition operations. The new algorithm\ncosts significantly less computation resource than 8-bit floating point\nmultiplication but achieves higher precision. Compared to 8-bit floating point\nmultiplications, the proposed method achieves higher precision but consumes\nsignificantly less bit-level computation. Since multiplying floating point\nnumbers requires substantially higher energy compared to integer addition\noperations, applying the L-Mul operation in tensor processing hardware can\npotentially reduce 95% energy cost by element-wise floating point tensor\nmultiplications and 80% energy cost of dot products. We calculated the\ntheoretical error expectation of L-Mul, and evaluated the algorithm on a wide\nrange of textual, visual, and symbolic tasks, including natural language\nunderstanding, structural reasoning, mathematics, and commonsense question\nanswering. Our numerical analysis experiments agree with the theoretical error\nestimation, which indicates that L-Mul with 4-bit mantissa achieves comparable\nprecision as float8_e4m3 multiplications, and L-Mul with 3-bit mantissa\noutperforms float8_e5m2. Evaluation results on popular benchmarks show that\ndirectly applying L-Mul to the attention mechanism is almost lossless.

We notice that test samples\nproduced directly from knowledge bases by templates or LLMs may introduce\nfactual errors and also lack diversity. To address these issues, we introduce a\nnovel schema into our proposed evaluation framework that employs predicate\nequivalence transformations to produce a series of variants for any given\nmedical knowledge point. Finally, these produced predicate variants are\nconverted into textual language, resulting in a series of reliable and diverse\ntest samples to evaluate whether LLMs fully master the given medical factual\nknowledge point.

                "summary": "Low-rank training has emerged as a promising approach for reducing memory\nusage in training Large Language Models (LLMs). Previous methods either rely on\ndecomposing weight matrices (e.g., LoRA), or seek to decompose gradient\nmatrices (e.g., GaLore) to ensure reduced memory consumption. However, both of\nthem constrain the training in a low-rank subspace, thus inevitably leading to\nsub-optimal performance. This raises a question: whether it is possible to\nconsistently preserve the low-rank constraint for memory efficiency, while\nachieving full-rank training (i.e., training with full-rank gradients of\nfull-rank weights) to avoid inferior outcomes? In this paper, we propose a new\nplug-and-play training framework for LLMs called Fira, as the first attempt to\nachieve this goal. First, we observe an interesting phenomenon during LLM\ntraining: the scaling impact of adaptive optimizers (e.g., Adam) on the\ngradient norm remains similar from low-rank to full-rank training. Based on\nthis observation, we propose a norm-based scaling method, which utilizes the\nscaling impact of low-rank optimizers as substitutes for that of original\nfull-rank optimizers to enable full-rank training. In this way, we can preserve\nthe low-rank constraint in the optimizer while achieving full-rank training for\nbetter performance. Moreover, we find that there are sudden gradient rises\nduring the optimization process, potentially causing loss spikes. To address\nthis, we further put forward a norm-growth limiter to smooth the gradient via\nregulating the relative increase of gradient norms. Extensive experiments on\nthe pre-training and fine-tuning of LLMs show that Fira outperforms both LoRA\nand GaLore, achieving performance that is comparable to or even better than\nfull-rank training.",

In this paper, we propose a new\nplug-and-play training framework for LLMs called Fira, as the first attempt to\nachieve this goal. First, we observe an interesting phenomenon during LLM\ntraining: the scaling impact of adaptive optimizers (e.g., Adam) on the\ngradient norm remains similar from low-rank to full-rank training. Based on\nthis observation, we propose a norm-based scaling method, which utilizes the\nscaling impact of low-rank optimizers as substitutes for that of original\nfull-rank optimizers to enable full-rank training. In this way, we can preserve\nthe low-rank constraint in the optimizer while achieving full-rank training for\nbetter performance. Moreover, we find that there are sudden gradient rises\nduring the optimization process, potentially causing loss spikes. To address\nthis, we further put forward a norm-growth limiter to smooth the gradient via\nregulating the relative increase of gradient norms. Extensive experiments on\nthe pre-training and fine-tuning of LLMs show that Fira outperforms both LoRA\nand GaLore, achieving performance that is comparable to or even better than\nfull-rank training."

Each of those maps are built by first\nestimating an intermediate density of moderate complexity, and then by\ncomputing the exact KR map from a reference density to the precomputed\napproximate density. In our work, we explore the use of Sum-of-Squares (SoS)\ndensities and $\\alpha$-divergences for approximating the intermediate\ndensities. Combining SoS densities with $\\alpha$-divergence interestingly\nyields convex optimization problems which can be efficiently solved using\nsemidefinite programming. The main advantage of $\\alpha$-divergences is to\nenable working with unnormalized densities, which provides benefits both\nnumerically and theoretically. In particular, we provide a new convergence\nanalyses of the sequential transport maps based on information geometric\nproperties of $\\alpha$-divergences. The choice of intermediate densities is\nalso crucial for the efficiency of the method. While tempered (or annealed)\ndensities are the state-of-the-art, we introduce diffusion-based intermediate\ndensities which permits to approximate densities known from samples only. Such\nintermediate densities are well-established in machine learning for generative\nmodeling. Finally we propose low-dimensional maps (or lazy maps) for dealing\nwith high-dimensional problems and numerically demonstrate our methods on\nBayesian inference problems and unsupervised learning tasks.",

Each of those maps are built by first\nestimating an intermediate density of moderate complexity, and then by\ncomputing the exact KR map from a reference density to the precomputed\napproximate density. In our work, we explore the use of Sum-of-Squares (SoS)\ndensities and $\\alpha$-divergences for approximating the intermediate\ndensities. Combining SoS densities with $\\alpha$-divergence interestingly\nyields convex optimization problems which can be efficiently solved using\nsemidefinite programming. The main advantage of $\\alpha$-divergences is to\nenable working with unnormalized densities, which provides benefits both\nnumerically and theoretically. In particular, we provide a new convergence\nanalyses of the sequential transport maps based on information geometric\nproperties of $\\alpha$-divergences. The choice of intermediate densities is\nalso crucial for the efficiency of the method. While tempered (or annealed)\ndensities are the state-of-the-art, we introduce diffusion-based intermediate\ndensities which permits to approximate densities known from samples only. Such\nintermediate densities are well-established in machine learning for generative\nmodeling. Finally we propose low-dimensional maps (or lazy maps) for dealing\nwith high-dimensional problems and numerically demonstrate our methods on\nBayesian inference problems and unsupervised learning tasks."

ACE employs this scheme\nto identify mistakes and provide targeted feedback to users.

To address this, we propose Efficient\nQuantization-Aware Training (EfficientQAT), a more feasible QAT algorithm.\nEfficientQAT involves two consecutive phases: Block-wise training of all\nparameters (Block-AP) and end-to-end training of quantization parameters\n(E2E-QP). To the best of our knowledge, Block-AP is the first method to enable\ndirect training of all parameters in a block-wise manner, reducing accuracy\nloss in low-bit scenarios by enhancing the solution space during optimization.\nE2E-QP then trains only the quantization parameters (step sizes) end-to-end,\nfurther improving the performance of quantized models by considering\ninteractions among all sub-modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nEfficientQAT outperforms previous quantization methods across a range of\nmodels, including base LLMs, instruction-tuned LLMs, and multimodal LLMs, with\nscales from 7B to 70B parameters at various quantization bits. For instance,\nEfficientQAT obtains a 2-bit Llama-2-70B model on a single A100-80GB GPU in 41\nhours, with less than 3 points accuracy degradation compared to the full\nprecision (69.48 vs. 72.41).

This online model differs from traditional static\napproaches or those reliant on a single LLM without cost consideration. With\nmultiple LLMs deployed on a scheduling cloud and a local server dedicated to\nhandling user queries, \\textit{C2MAB-V} facilitates the selection of multiple\nLLMs over a combinatorial search space, specifically tailored for various\ncollaborative task types with different reward models. Based on our designed\nonline feedback mechanism and confidence bound technique, \\textit{C2MAB-V} can\neffectively address the multi-LLM selection challenge by managing the\nexploration-exploitation trade-off across different models, while also\nbalancing cost and reward for diverse tasks. The NP-hard integer linear\nprogramming problem for selecting multiple LLMs with trade-off dilemmas is\naddressed by: i) decomposing the integer problem into a relaxed form by the\nlocal server, ii) utilizing a discretization rounding scheme that provides\noptimal LLM combinations by the scheduling cloud, and iii) continual online\nupdates based on feedback. Theoretically, we prove that \\textit{C2MAB-V} offers\nstrict guarantees over versatile reward models, matching state-of-the-art\nresults for regret and violations in some degenerate cases.

                    "value": "With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), the diversity of\nmulti-LLM tasks and the variability in their pricing structures have become\nincreasingly important, as costs can vary greatly between different LLMs. To\ntackle these challenges, we introduce the \\textit{C2MAB-V}, a\n\\underline{C}ost-effective \\underline{C}ombinatorial \\underline{M}ulti-armed\n\\underline{B}andit with \\underline{V}ersatile reward models for optimal LLM\nselection and usage. This online model differs from traditional static\napproaches or those reliant on a single LLM without cost consideration. With\nmultiple LLMs deployed on a scheduling cloud and a local server dedicated to\nhandling user queries, \\textit{C2MAB-V} facilitates the selection of multiple\nLLMs over a combinatorial search space, specifically tailored for various\ncollaborative task types with different reward models. Based on our designed\nonline feedback mechanism and confidence bound technique, \\textit{C2MAB-V} can\neffectively address the multi-LLM selection challenge by managing the\nexploration-exploitation trade-off across different models, while also\nbalancing cost and reward for diverse tasks. The NP-hard integer linear\nprogramming problem for selecting multiple LLMs with trade-off dilemmas is\naddressed by: i) decomposing the integer problem into a relaxed form by the\nlocal server, ii) utilizing a discretization rounding scheme that provides\noptimal LLM combinations by the scheduling cloud, and iii) continual online\nupdates based on feedback. Theoretically, we prove that \\textit{C2MAB-V} offers\nstrict guarantees over versatile reward models, matching state-of-the-art\nresults for regret and violations in some degenerate cases. Empirically, we\nshow that \\textit{C2MAB-V} effectively balances performance and cost-efficiency\nwith nine LLMs for three application scenarios."

This paper presents Sparsely-Sharded(S2) Attention, a Triton library\nthat provides kernel optimization for sparse attention customizable at both\nper-head and per-context-range levels. S2-Attention enables the exploration of\nnovel and high-performance sparse attention techniques, which we demonstrate\nthrough extensive ablations across a wide range of sparse attention designs at\nvarious model scales. From these insights, we present several basic guidelines\nto design sparse attention that can achieve not only practical efficiency\nimprovements, but also strong downstream performance. To achieve high\nparallelization and optimized memory IO, sparse attention should shard the\ncontext heterogeneously across attention heads, where each head attends to a\ndifferent subset of tokens while collectively covering the full context.\nMeanwhile, we find hybrid architectures combining sparse and dense attention\nparticularly beneficial in practice.

                "summary": "Training and serving long-context large language models (LLMs) incurs\nsubstantial overhead. To address this, two critical steps are often required: a\npretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length\nextension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural\nmodifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper\nargues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction\narchitecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but\nalso achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed\nLongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during\nlength extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention\npatterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink\n(initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are\nwell-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their\nGPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just\ntheoretically but in practice as well.

                    "value": "Training and serving long-context large language models (LLMs) incurs\nsubstantial overhead. To address this, two critical steps are often required: a\npretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length\nextension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural\nmodifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper\nargues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction\narchitecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but\nalso achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed\nLongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during\nlength extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention\npatterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink\n(initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are\nwell-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their\nGPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just\ntheoretically but in practice as well.

These limitations restrict deployment on consumer-grade\ndevices like a single Nvidia 4090 GPU. To overcome this, we propose Locret, a\nframework for long-context LLM inference that introduces retaining heads to\nevaluate the causal importance of KV cache units, allowing for more accurate\neviction within a fixed cache size. Locret is fine-tuned on top of the frozen\nbackbone LLM using a minimal amount of data from standard long-context SFT\ndatasets.

We\nconduct an extensive empirical study to evaluate Locret, where the experimental\nresults show that Locret outperforms the recent competitive approaches,\nincluding InfLLM, Quantization, SirLLM, and MInference, in terms of memory\nefficiency and the quality of generated contents -- Locret achieves over a 20x\nand 8x KV cache compression ratio compared to the full KV cache for\nPhi-3-mini-128K and Llama-3.1-8B-instruct.

To address this challenge, we introduce\nScylla, a dynamic evaluation framework that quantitatively measures the\ngeneralization abilities of LLMs. Scylla disentangles generalization from\nmemorization via assessing model performance on both in-distribution (ID) and\nout-of-distribution (OOD) data through 20 tasks across 5 levels of complexity.\nThrough extensive experiments, we uncover a non-monotonic relationship between\ntask complexity and the performance gap between ID and OOD data, which we term\nthe generalization valley. Specifically, this phenomenon reveals a critical\nthreshold - referred to as critical complexity - where reliance on\nnon-generalizable behavior peaks, indicating the upper bound of LLMs'\ngeneralization capabilities. As model size increases, the critical complexity\nshifts toward higher levels of task complexity, suggesting that larger models\ncan handle more complex reasoning tasks before over-relying on memorization.\nLeveraging Scylla and the concept of critical complexity, we benchmark 28LLMs\nincluding both open-sourced models such as LLaMA and Qwen families, and\nclose-sourced models like Claude and GPT, providing a more robust evaluation\nand establishing a clearer understanding of LLMs' generalization capabilities.",

                    "value": "While large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities in\nunderstanding complex queries and performing sophisticated tasks, their\ngeneralization abilities are often deeply entangled with memorization,\nnecessitating more precise evaluation. To address this challenge, we introduce\nScylla, a dynamic evaluation framework that quantitatively measures the\ngeneralization abilities of LLMs. Scylla disentangles generalization from\nmemorization via assessing model performance on both in-distribution (ID) and\nout-of-distribution (OOD) data through 20 tasks across 5 levels of complexity.\nThrough extensive experiments, we uncover a non-monotonic relationship between\ntask complexity and the performance gap between ID and OOD data, which we term\nthe generalization valley. Specifically, this phenomenon reveals a critical\nthreshold - referred to as critical complexity - where reliance on\nnon-generalizable behavior peaks, indicating the upper bound of LLMs'\ngeneralization capabilities. As model size increases, the critical complexity\nshifts toward higher levels of task complexity, suggesting that larger models\ncan handle more complex reasoning tasks before over-relying on memorization.\nLeveraging Scylla and the concept of critical complexity, we benchmark 28LLMs\nincluding both open-sourced models such as LLaMA and Qwen families, and\nclose-sourced models like Claude and GPT, providing a more robust evaluation\nand establishing a clearer understanding of LLMs' generalization capabilities."

However, the degree to which an RM generalizes to new tasks\nis often not known a priori (e.g. some RMs may excel at scoring creative\nwriting vs. math reasoning). Therefore, using only one fixed RM while training\nLLMs can be suboptimal. Moreover, optimizing LLMs with multiple RMs\nsimultaneously can be prohibitively computationally-intensive and challenging\ndue to conflicting signals from different RMs, potentially degrading\nperformance. To address these challenges, we introduce LASeR (Learning to\nAdaptively Select Rewards), which iteratively trains LLMs using multiple RMs,\nselecting and utilizing the most well-suited RM for each instance to rank\noutputs and generate preference data, framed as a multi-armed bandit problem.\nOur results on commonsense and math reasoning tasks demonstrate that LASeR can\nboost iterative LLM optimization by optimizing for multiple RMs, improving the\nabsolute average accuracy of Llama-3-8B over three datasets by 2.67% over\ntraining with ensemble RM scores while also showing superior training\nefficiency (e.g., a 2x speedup). Moreover, on WildChat, a benchmark of\ninstruction-following prompts, we find that using Llama-3-8B LASeR leads to a\n71.45% AlpacaEval win rate over sequentially optimizing multiple RMs. Extending\nto long-context generation tasks, we find that on Llama-3-8B, LASeR achieves an\naverage improvement of 2.64 F1 and 2.42 F1 on single- and multi-document QA\nover random RM selection when used with best-of-n sampling. LASeR is robust to\nnoisy rewards and generalizes to multiple settings.

While\nprevious methods such as speculative decoding mitigate these inefficiencies by\nproducing multiple tokens per step, each token is still generated by its\nsingle-token distribution, thereby enhancing speed without improving\neffectiveness. In contrast, our work simultaneously enhances inference speed\nand improves the output effectiveness. We consider multi-token joint decoding\n(MTJD), which generates multiple tokens from their joint distribution at each\niteration, theoretically reducing perplexity and enhancing task performance.\nHowever, MTJD suffers from the high cost of sampling from the joint\ndistribution of multiple tokens. Inspired by speculative decoding, we introduce\nmulti-token assisted decoding (MTAD), a novel framework designed to accelerate\nMTJD. MTAD leverages a smaller auxiliary model to approximate the joint\ndistribution of a larger model, incorporating a verification mechanism that not\nonly ensures the accuracy of this approximation, but also improves the decoding\nefficiency over conventional speculative decoding. Theoretically, we\ndemonstrate that MTAD closely approximates exact MTJD with bounded error.\nEmpirical evaluations using Llama-2 and OPT models ranging from 13B to 70B\nparameters across various tasks reveal that MTAD reduces perplexity by 21.2%\nand improves downstream performance compared to standard single-token sampling.\nFurthermore, MTAD achieves a 1.42x speed-up and consumes 1.54x less energy than\nconventional speculative decoding methods. These results highlight MTAD's\nability to make multi-token joint decoding both effective and efficient,\npromoting more sustainable and high-performance deployment of LLMs.",

By integrating CRE and DES (CreDes), our model\nhas realized simultaneous multi-step reasoning, circumventing the\ninefficiencies from cascading multiple one-step reasoning like the\nChain-of-Thought (CoT). Experiments demonstrate that CreDes significantly\noutperforms existing State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) solutions in long-range reasoning\ntasks in terms of both accuracy and time efficiency."

First, redundant error\ncorrection leads to unstable planning and long execution time. Additionally,\ndesigning a correct plan among multiple tools is also a challenge in tool\nlearning. To address these issues, we propose Tool-Planner, a task-processing\nframework based on toolkits. Tool-Planner groups tools based on the API\nfunctions with the same function into a toolkit and allows LLMs to implement\nplanning across the various toolkits. When a tool error occurs, the language\nmodel can reselect and adjust tools based on the toolkit. Experiments show that\nour approach demonstrates a high pass and win rate across different datasets\nand optimizes the planning scheme for tool learning in models such as GPT-4 and\nClaude 3, showcasing the potential of our method.

We notice that test samples\nproduced directly from knowledge bases by templates or LLMs may introduce\nfactual errors and also lack diversity. To address these issues, we introduce a\nnovel schema into our proposed evaluation framework that employs predicate\nequivalence transformations to produce a series of variants for any given\nmedical knowledge point. Finally, these produced predicate variants are\nconverted into textual language, resulting in a series of reliable and diverse\ntest samples to evaluate whether LLMs fully master the given medical factual\nknowledge point.

In particular, in this work, we\ninvestigate the more general version of the problem, known as Authorship\nAttribution (AA), in a multi-class setting--i.e., not only determining if a\ngiven text is a deepfake text or not but also being able to pinpoint which LLM\nis the author. We propose TopFormer to improve existing AA solutions by\ncapturing more linguistic patterns in deepfake texts by including a Topological\nData Analysis (TDA) layer in the Transformer-based model.

We present the\ndesign and evaluation of GOAT, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying\nvulnerabilities in state-of-the-art LLMs, with an ASR@10 of 97% against Llama\n3.1 and 88% against GPT-4 on the JailbreakBench dataset."

These limitations stem from\ninadequate knowledge awareness of LLMs during vanilla fine-tuning. To address\nthese problems, we propose a knowledge-aware fine-tuning (KnowTuning) method to\nimprove fine-grained and coarse-grained knowledge awareness of LLMs. We devise\na fine-grained knowledge augmentation stage to train LLMs to identify difficult\nfine-grained knowledge in answers. We also propose a coarse-grained knowledge\ncomparison stage to train LLMs to distinguish between reliable and unreliable\nknowledge, in three aspects: completeness, factuality, and logicality.\nExtensive experiments on both generic and medical question answering (QA)\ndatasets confirm the effectiveness of KnowTuning, through automatic and human\nevaluations, across various sizes of LLMs. We further verify that KnowTuning\ngenerates more facts with less factual error rate under fine-grained facts\nevaluation.",

These limitations stem from\ninadequate knowledge awareness of LLMs during vanilla fine-tuning. To address\nthese problems, we propose a knowledge-aware fine-tuning (KnowTuning) method to\nimprove fine-grained and coarse-grained knowledge awareness of LLMs. We devise\na fine-grained knowledge augmentation stage to train LLMs to identify difficult\nfine-grained knowledge in answers. We also propose a coarse-grained knowledge\ncomparison stage to train LLMs to distinguish between reliable and unreliable\nknowledge, in three aspects: completeness, factuality, and logicality.\nExtensive experiments on both generic and medical question answering (QA)\ndatasets confirm the effectiveness of KnowTuning, through automatic and human\nevaluations, across various sizes of LLMs. We further verify that KnowTuning\ngenerates more facts with less factual error rate under fine-grained facts\nevaluation."

However, they face challenges in\nmanaging their significant memory requirements. Although quantization-aware\ntraining (QAT) offers a solution by reducing memory consumption through low-bit\nrepresentations with minimal accuracy loss, it is impractical due to\nsubstantial training resources. To address this, we propose Efficient\nQuantization-Aware Training (EfficientQAT), a more feasible QAT algorithm.\nEfficientQAT involves two consecutive phases: Block-wise training of all\nparameters (Block-AP) and end-to-end training of quantization parameters\n(E2E-QP). To the best of our knowledge, Block-AP is the first method to enable\ndirect training of all parameters in a block-wise manner, reducing accuracy\nloss in low-bit scenarios by enhancing the solution space during optimization.\nE2E-QP then trains only the quantization parameters (step sizes) end-to-end,\nfurther improving the performance of quantized models by considering\ninteractions among all sub-modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nEfficientQAT outperforms previous quantization methods across a range of\nmodels, including base LLMs, instruction-tuned LLMs, and multimodal LLMs, with\nscales from 7B to 70B parameters at various quantization bits. For instance,\nEfficientQAT obtains a 2-bit Llama-2-70B model on a single A100-80GB GPU in 41\nhours, with less than 3 points accuracy degradation compared to the full\nprecision (69.48 vs. 72.41).

To address this, we propose Efficient\nQuantization-Aware Training (EfficientQAT), a more feasible QAT algorithm.\nEfficientQAT involves two consecutive phases: Block-wise training of all\nparameters (Block-AP) and end-to-end training of quantization parameters\n(E2E-QP). To the best of our knowledge, Block-AP is the first method to enable\ndirect training of all parameters in a block-wise manner, reducing accuracy\nloss in low-bit scenarios by enhancing the solution space during optimization.\nE2E-QP then trains only the quantization parameters (step sizes) end-to-end,\nfurther improving the performance of quantized models by considering\ninteractions among all sub-modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nEfficientQAT outperforms previous quantization methods across a range of\nmodels, including base LLMs, instruction-tuned LLMs, and multimodal LLMs, with\nscales from 7B to 70B parameters at various quantization bits. For instance,\nEfficientQAT obtains a 2-bit Llama-2-70B model on a single A100-80GB GPU in 41\nhours, with less than 3 points accuracy degradation compared to the full\nprecision (69.48 vs. 72.41).

With\nmultiple LLMs deployed on a scheduling cloud and a local server dedicated to\nhandling user queries, \\textit{C2MAB-V} facilitates the selection of multiple\nLLMs over a combinatorial search space, specifically tailored for various\ncollaborative task types with different reward models. Based on our designed\nonline feedback mechanism and confidence bound technique, \\textit{C2MAB-V} can\neffectively address the multi-LLM selection challenge by managing the\nexploration-exploitation trade-off across different models, while also\nbalancing cost and reward for diverse tasks. The NP-hard integer linear\nprogramming problem for selecting multiple LLMs with trade-off dilemmas is\naddressed by: i) decomposing the integer problem into a relaxed form by the\nlocal server, ii) utilizing a discretization rounding scheme that provides\noptimal LLM combinations by the scheduling cloud, and iii) continual online\nupdates based on feedback. Theoretically, we prove that \\textit{C2MAB-V} offers\nstrict guarantees over versatile reward models, matching state-of-the-art\nresults for regret and violations in some degenerate cases.

With\nmultiple LLMs deployed on a scheduling cloud and a local server dedicated to\nhandling user queries, \\textit{C2MAB-V} facilitates the selection of multiple\nLLMs over a combinatorial search space, specifically tailored for various\ncollaborative task types with different reward models. Based on our designed\nonline feedback mechanism and confidence bound technique, \\textit{C2MAB-V} can\neffectively address the multi-LLM selection challenge by managing the\nexploration-exploitation trade-off across different models, while also\nbalancing cost and reward for diverse tasks. The NP-hard integer linear\nprogramming problem for selecting multiple LLMs with trade-off dilemmas is\naddressed by: i) decomposing the integer problem into a relaxed form by the\nlocal server, ii) utilizing a discretization rounding scheme that provides\noptimal LLM combinations by the scheduling cloud, and iii) continual online\nupdates based on feedback. Theoretically, we prove that \\textit{C2MAB-V} offers\nstrict guarantees over versatile reward models, matching state-of-the-art\nresults for regret and violations in some degenerate cases. Empirically, we\nshow that \\textit{C2MAB-V} effectively balances performance and cost-efficiency\nwith nine LLMs for three application scenarios."

To address this, two critical steps are often required: a\npretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length\nextension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural\nmodifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper\nargues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction\narchitecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but\nalso achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed\nLongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during\nlength extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention\npatterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink\n(initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are\nwell-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their\nGPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just\ntheoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to\nhave direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention\nlayers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency\nand long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data\nis sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.\n  We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its\neffectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts,\nLongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%,\ncompared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV\ncache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding\nspeedup.",

Within this framework, termed\nSinkSAM, we highlight four key improvements: (1) The integration of topographic\ncomputations with SAM enables pixel-level refinement of sinkhole boundaries\nsegmentation; (2) A coherent mathematical prompting strategy, based on closed\ndepressions, addresses the limitations of purely learning-based models (CNNs)\nin detecting and segmenting undefined sinkhole features, while improving\ngeneralization to new, unseen regions; (3) Using Depth Anything V2 monocular\ndepth for automatic prompts eliminates photogrammetric biases, enabling\nsinkhole mapping without the dependence on LiDAR data; and (4) An established\nsinkhole database facilitates fine-tuning of SAM, improving its zero-shot\nperformance in sinkhole segmentation. These advancements allow the deployment\nof SinkSAM, in an unseen test area, in the highly variable semiarid region,\nachieving an intersection-over-union (IoU) of 40.27\\% and surpassing previous\nresults.

Specifically, we propose a first\nmulti-turn approach that leverages benign preliminary questions to interact\nwith the LLM. Due to the autoregressive nature of LLMs, which use previous\nconversation rounds as context during generation, we guide the model's\nquestion-response pair to construct a context that is semantically aligned with\nthe attack query to execute the attack. We conduct experiments on seven\ndifferent LLMs and demonstrate the efficacy of this attack, which is black-box\nand can also transfer across LLMs. We believe this can lead to further\ndevelopments and understanding of security in LLMs.",

Recent advancements in Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have further enhanced the performance of embedding\nmodels, which are trained on massive amounts of text covering almost every\ndomain. These models are often benchmarked on general-purpose datasets like\nMassive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), where they demonstrate superior\nperformance. However, a critical question arises: Is the development of\ndomain-specific embedding models necessary when general-purpose models are\ntrained on vast corpora that already include specialized domain texts? In this\npaper, we empirically investigate this question, choosing the finance domain as\nan example. We introduce the Finance Massive Text Embedding Benchmark\n(FinMTEB), a counterpart to MTEB that consists of financial domain-specific\ntext datasets. We evaluate the performance of seven state-of-the-art embedding\nmodels on FinMTEB and observe a significant performance drop compared to their\nperformance on MTEB. To account for the possibility that this drop is driven by\nFinMTEB's higher complexity, we propose four measures to quantify dataset\ncomplexity and control for this factor in our analysis. Our analysis provides\ncompelling evidence that state-of-the-art embedding models struggle to capture\ndomain-specific linguistic and semantic patterns. Moreover, we find that the\nperformance of general-purpose embedding models on MTEB is not correlated with\ntheir performance on FinMTEB, indicating the need for domain-specific embedding\nbenchmarks for domain-specific embedding models.

Through extensive\nexperimental analysis, we identified three key challenges in designing\neffective data management strategies that enable the model to achieve\nlong-context capability without sacrificing performance in other tasks: (1) a\nshortage of long documents across multiple domains, (2) effective construction\nof context windows, and (3) efficient organization of large-scale datasets.
