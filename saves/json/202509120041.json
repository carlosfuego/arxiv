A calibration phase is introduced to analyze L1 relative\nerrors between timesteps, guiding the selection of cache schedules that\nminimize quality degradation. To address the problem of inter-layer dependency,\na unified caching schedule is adopted, applying the cache pattern derived from\nself-attention layers to both layer types. Experiments on LibriSpeech-PC and\nSeed-TTS datasets evaluate various cache thresholds and denoising step\nconfigurations. Results show that caching at higher denoising steps reduces\ninference time without compromising output quality, whereas caching at lower\nsteps can negatively impact synthesis quality similarly to reducing the total\nnumber of denoising steps. Objective and subjective metrics confirm the\neffectiveness of SmoothCache in maintaining performance while improving\ncomputational efficiency.

The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high\ntraining and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key\nchallenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and\nKey-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to\nleverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a\nBidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training,\nthe first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D\nfull attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference\nefficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query\nsparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via\nsemantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV\nsparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain\nonly the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long\nsequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention\ntraining, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full\nattention.",

                    "value": "Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit\nmajor computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration\nvideos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high\ntraining and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key\nchallenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and\nKey-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to\nleverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a\nBidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training,\nthe first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D\nfull attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference\nefficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query\nsparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via\nsemantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV\nsparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain\nonly the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long\nsequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention\ntraining, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full\nattention."

We introduce CXL-NDP, a\ntransparent near-data processing architecture that amplifies effective CXL\nbandwidth without requiring changes to the CXL.mem interface or AI models.\nCXL-NDP integrates a precision-scalable bit-plane layout for dynamic\nquantization with transparent lossless compression of weights and KV caches\ndirectly within the CXL device. In end-to-end serving, CXL-NDP improves\nthroughput by 43%, extends the maximum context length by 87%, and reduces the\nKV cache footprint by 46.9% without accuracy loss. Hardware synthesis confirms\nits practicality with a modest silicon footprint, lowering the barrier for\nadopting efficient, scalable CXL-based memory in generative AI infrastructure."

The first is a novel multi-turn off-policy RL framework for\ncontinually improving the performance of LLM step-prover at training time. This\nframework, inspired by the principles of AlphaZero, utilizes a multi-stage\nexpert iteration pipeline featuring adaptive tactic-level data filtering and\nperiodic retraining to surmount the performance plateaus that typically curtail\nlong-term RL in LLM-based agents. The second innovation is a planner-enhanced\nmulti-agent search architecture that scales reasoning capabilities at inference\ntime. This architecture employs a general reasoning model as a high-level\nplanner to iteratively decompose complex theorems into a sequence of simpler\nsubgoals. This hierarchical approach substantially reduces the search space,\nenabling a team of parallel prover agents to collaborate efficiently by\nleveraging a shared proof cache. We demonstrate that this dual approach to\nscaling yields state-of-the-art results on established formal mathematics\nbenchmarks. \\texttt{BFS-Prover-V2} achieves 95.08\\% and 41.4\\% on the MiniF2F\nand ProofNet test sets respectively.

Here, a hybrid integration approach\nis demonstrated in which crystalline BaTiO3 (BTO) membranes are first\ntransferred onto Pt coated Si substrates and subsequently used as vector\nsubstrates (VS) for the growth of epitaxial (001) Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT) thin\nfilms via chemical solution deposition (CSD). A KI and HCl based etchant\nenables rapid and complete dissolution of the SrVO3 sacrificial layer in about\n30 minutes, reducing the release time from days to minutes compared with\nconventional water based approaches to dissolve AVO3 and AMoO3 (A is Ca, Sr,\nBa). The BTO VS imposes dominant (00l) out of plane orientation and in plane\ncube on cube epitaxy in the overlying PZT. Devices exhibit remnant polarization\n10 to 12 micro coulomb/cm2 and coercive field of 100 kV/cm, with stable\nswitching to 10^8 cycles on the VS. From piezoelectric butterfly loops, we\nextract effective d33 of 70 pm/V for PZT on VS, and 54 pm/V for PZT grown on\nconventional Pt Si substrates. This approach demonstrates a scalable and cost\neffective route for integrating functional ferroelectric materials onto silicon\nand offers a promising platform for future CMOS compatible oxide electronics.",

                    "value": "The direct integration of high-performance ferroelectric oxides with silicon\nremains challenging due to lattice mismatch, thermal incompatibility, and the\nneed for high-temperature epitaxial growth. Here, a hybrid integration approach\nis demonstrated in which crystalline BaTiO3 (BTO) membranes are first\ntransferred onto Pt coated Si substrates and subsequently used as vector\nsubstrates (VS) for the growth of epitaxial (001) Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT) thin\nfilms via chemical solution deposition (CSD). A KI and HCl based etchant\nenables rapid and complete dissolution of the SrVO3 sacrificial layer in about\n30 minutes, reducing the release time from days to minutes compared with\nconventional water based approaches to dissolve AVO3 and AMoO3 (A is Ca, Sr,\nBa). The BTO VS imposes dominant (00l) out of plane orientation and in plane\ncube on cube epitaxy in the overlying PZT. Devices exhibit remnant polarization\n10 to 12 micro coulomb/cm2 and coercive field of 100 kV/cm, with stable\nswitching to 10^8 cycles on the VS. From piezoelectric butterfly loops, we\nextract effective d33 of 70 pm/V for PZT on VS, and 54 pm/V for PZT grown on\nconventional Pt Si substrates. This approach demonstrates a scalable and cost\neffective route for integrating functional ferroelectric materials onto silicon\nand offers a promising platform for future CMOS compatible oxide electronics."

The evaluation of Hopper's fourth-generation tensor cores reveals the\nbenefits of FP8 precision and asynchronous wgmma instructions for matrix\noperations. Additionally, we investigate the performance of DPX instructions\nfor dynamic programming, distributed shared memory (DSM) for inter-SM\ncommunication, and the Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA) for asynchronous data\nmovement. Through multi-level evaluation, we discover that the Hopper\narchitecture demonstrates significant acceleration potential in real-world\napplications. For instance, the asynchronous programming model supported by TMA\nachieves a 1.5x speedup in matrix multiplication, FP8 delivers nearly double\nthe performance of FP16, and DPX instructions accelerate a computational\nbiology algorithm by at least 4.75x.

In this paper, we introduce IC-Cache, a\ncaching system that enables live LLM capability augmentation to improve serving\nefficiency: by leveraging historical request-response pairs from larger models\nas in-context examples, IC-Cache empowers small LLMs to imitate and even exceed\nthe compositional abilities (e.g., reasoning) of their larger counterparts,\nenabling selective offloading of requests to reduce cost and latency. Achieving\nthis live augmentation at scale introduces intricate trade-offs between\nresponse quality, latency, and system throughput. For a new request, IC-Cache\nefficiently selects similar, high-utility examples to prepend them to the new\nrequest's input. At scale, it adaptively routes requests across LLMs of varying\ncapabilities, accounting for response quality and serving loads. IC-Cache\nemploys a cost-aware cache replay mechanism that refines example quality\noffline to maximize online cache utility and efficiency.

We introduce Halo, a system that brings batch\nquery processing and optimization into agentic LLM workflows.

Guided by a cost\nmodel that jointly considers prefill and decode costs, cache reuse, and GPU\nplacement, Halo performs plan-level optimization to minimize redundant\nexecution. Its runtime integrates adaptive batching, KV-cache sharing and\nmigration, along with compute-communication overlap to maximize hardware\nefficiency. Evaluation across six benchmarks shows that Halo achieves up to\n18.6x speedup for batch inference and 4.7x throughput improvement under online\nserving, scaling to workloads of tens of thousands of queries and complex\ngraphs.

Most critically, the SEC'25 paper's simulation of\nMIRAGE uses a constant seed to initialize the random number generator used for\nglobal evictions in MIRAGE, causing every AES encryption they trace to evict\nthe same deterministic sequence of cache lines. This artificially creates a\nhighly repeatable timing pattern that is not representative of a realistic\nimplementation of MIRAGE, where eviction sequences vary randomly between\nencryptions. When we instead randomize the eviction seed for each run,\nreflecting realistic operation, the correlation between AES T-table accesses\nand attacker runtimes disappears, and the attack fails. These findings show\nthat the reported leakage is an artifact of incorrect modeling, and not an\nactual vulnerability in MIRAGE."

These levels of\ndifferentiation introduce irregular memory usage patterns across different\nrequests and attention heads, posing significant scalability challenges for\nmemory management. To address these challenges, DiffKV proposes an on-GPU\nmemory manager that compacts fragmented free memory list into contiguous\nregions in parallel, effectively translating sparsity in the KV cache into\nperformance gains. We evaluate DiffKV on several mainstream LLMs, including the\nemerging thinking models that generate extended chains of thought.

                "summary": "X-ray scatter has been a serious concern in computed tomography (CT), leading\nto image artifacts and distortion of CT values. The linear Boltzmann transport\nequation (LBTE) is recognized as a fast and accurate approach for scatter\nestimation. However, for multi-spectral CT, it is cumbersome to compute\nmultiple scattering components for different spectra separately when applying\nLBTE-based scatter correction. In this work, we propose a Matrixed-Spectrum\nDecomposition accelerated LBTE solver (MSD-LBTE) that can be used to compute\nX-ray scatter distributions from CT acquisitions at two or more different\nspectra simultaneously, in a unified framework with no sacrifice in accuracy\nand nearly no increase in computation in theory. First, a matrixed-spectrum\nsolver of LBTE is obtained by introducing an additional label dimension to\nexpand the phase space. Then, we propose a ``spectrum basis'' for LBTE and a\nprinciple of selection of basis using the QR decomposition, along with the\nabove solver to construct the MSD-LBTE. Based on MSD-LBTE, a unified scatter\ncorrection method can be established for multi-spectral CT. We validate the\neffectiveness and accuracy of our method by comparing it with the Monte Carlo\nmethod, including the computational time. We also evaluate the scatter\ncorrection performance using two different phantoms for fast-kV switching based\ndual-energy CT, and using an elliptical phantom in a numerical simulation for\nkV-modulation enabled CT scans, validating that our proposed method can\nsignificantly reduce the computational cost at multiple spectra and effectively\nreduce scatter artifact in reconstructed CT images.",

To address these issues,\nwe propose a training-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value\nDecomposition (ASVD). Specifically, ASVD manages activation outliers by\ntransforming the weight matrix based on the activation distribution. This\ntransformation allows the outliers in the activation matrix to be absorbed into\nthe transformed weight matrix, thereby enhancing decomposition accuracy.\nAdditionally, we propose an efficient iterative calibration process to optimize\nlayer-specific decomposition by addressing the varying sensitivity of different\nLLM layers. In this way, ASVD can compress a network by 10%-30%. Based on the\nsuccess of the low-rank decomposition of projection matrices in the\nself-attention module, we further introduce ASVD to compress the KV cache. By\nreducing the channel dimension of KV activations, memory requirements for KV\ncache can be largely reduced.

                "summary": "Memory allocation, though constituting only a small portion of the executed\ncode, can have a \"butterfly effect\" on overall program performance, leading to\nsignificant and far-reaching impacts. Despite accounting for just approximately\n5% of total instructions, memory allocation can result in up to a 2.7x\nperformance variation depending on the allocator used. This effect arises from\nthe complexity of memory allocation in modern multi-threaded multi-core\nsystems, where allocator metadata becomes intertwined with user data, leading\nto cache pollution or increased cross-thread synchronization overhead.\nOffloading memory allocators to accelerators, e.g., Mallacc and Memento, is a\npotential direction to improve the allocator performance and mitigate cache\npollution. However, these accelerators currently have limited support for\nmulti-threaded applications, and synchronization between cores and accelerators\nremains a significant challenge.\n  We present SpeedMalloc, using a lightweight support-core to process memory\nallocation tasks in multi-threaded applications.

                    "value": "Memory allocation, though constituting only a small portion of the executed\ncode, can have a \"butterfly effect\" on overall program performance, leading to\nsignificant and far-reaching impacts. Despite accounting for just approximately\n5% of total instructions, memory allocation can result in up to a 2.7x\nperformance variation depending on the allocator used. This effect arises from\nthe complexity of memory allocation in modern multi-threaded multi-core\nsystems, where allocator metadata becomes intertwined with user data, leading\nto cache pollution or increased cross-thread synchronization overhead.\nOffloading memory allocators to accelerators, e.g., Mallacc and Memento, is a\npotential direction to improve the allocator performance and mitigate cache\npollution. However, these accelerators currently have limited support for\nmulti-threaded applications, and synchronization between cores and accelerators\nremains a significant challenge.\n  We present SpeedMalloc, using a lightweight support-core to process memory\nallocation tasks in multi-threaded applications. The support-core is a\nlightweight programmable processor with efficient cross-core data\nsynchronization and houses all allocator metadata in its own caches.

While feature caching offers a\npromising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across\ntimesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this\nwork, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and\ndecompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by\ninaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from\nerror propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we\npropose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both\nerror types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify\nreusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a\ntrajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates\ncache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.\nTogether, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under\naggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video\ngeneration benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup\nwhile consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the\nstate-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x\nacceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline\nfidelity while significantly improving efficiency.

To\naddress this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers\nwith highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a\nfixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer\npairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention\ndynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern\nsimilarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable\naccuracy degradation.\n  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and\nefficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies\nbased on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a\nrecomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key\ninnovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical\ncontext for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the\nconversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to\nmitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model\ngeneration; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles\nbrought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV\ncaches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul\nachieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x\nreduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without\ncompromising generation quality.",

Our approach not only reduces the\nprefilling complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L)$, but also achieves performance\ncomparable to or better than the full context in the long context scenarios.\nWithout additional post training or operator development, ILRe can process a\nsingle $1M$ tokens request in less than half a minute (speedup $\\approx\n180\\times$) and scores RULER-$1M$ benchmark of $\\approx 79.8$ with model\nLlama-3.1-UltraLong-8B-1M-Instruct on a Huawei Ascend 910B NPU."

                "summary": "Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), introduced in DeepSeek-V2, compresses\nkey-value states into a low-rank latent vector, caching only this vector to\nreduce memory. In tensor parallelism (TP), however, attention heads are\ncomputed across multiple devices, and each device must load the full cache,\neroding the advantage of MLA over Grouped Query Attention (GQA). We propose\nTensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): a scheme that partitions both the\nlatent representation and each head's input dimension across devices, performs\nattention independently per shard, and then combines results with an\nall-reduce. TPLA preserves the benefits of a compressed KV cache while\nunlocking TP efficiency. Unlike Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), every head in\nTPLA still leverages the full latent representation, maintaining stronger\nrepresentational capacity.

                    "value": "Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), introduced in DeepSeek-V2, compresses\nkey-value states into a low-rank latent vector, caching only this vector to\nreduce memory. In tensor parallelism (TP), however, attention heads are\ncomputed across multiple devices, and each device must load the full cache,\neroding the advantage of MLA over Grouped Query Attention (GQA). We propose\nTensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): a scheme that partitions both the\nlatent representation and each head's input dimension across devices, performs\nattention independently per shard, and then combines results with an\nall-reduce. TPLA preserves the benefits of a compressed KV cache while\nunlocking TP efficiency. Unlike Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), every head in\nTPLA still leverages the full latent representation, maintaining stronger\nrepresentational capacity.

Recent\nVision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit promising capabilities such as object\nrecognition, common-sense reasoning, and contextual understanding-capabilities\nthat align with the nuanced requirements of social robot navigation. However,\nit remains unclear whether VLMs can accurately understand complex social\nnavigation scenes (e.g., inferring the spatial-temporal relations among agents\nand human intentions), which is essential for safe and socially compliant robot\nnavigation. While some recent works have explored the use of VLMs in social\nrobot navigation, no existing work systematically evaluates their ability to\nmeet these necessary conditions. In this paper, we introduce the Social\nNavigation Scene Understanding Benchmark (SocialNav-SUB), a Visual Question\nAnswering (VQA) dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs for scene\nunderstanding in real-world social robot navigation scenarios. SocialNav-SUB\nprovides a unified framework for evaluating VLMs against human and rule-based\nbaselines across VQA tasks requiring spatial, spatiotemporal, and social\nreasoning in social robot navigation. Through experiments with state-of-the-art\nVLMs, we find that while the best-performing VLM achieves an encouraging\nprobability of agreeing with human answers, it still underperforms simpler\nrule-based approach and human consensus baselines, indicating critical gaps in\nsocial scene understanding of current VLMs. Our benchmark sets the stage for\nfurther research on foundation models for social robot navigation, offering a\nframework to explore how VLMs can be tailored to meet real-world social robot\nnavigation needs.

By moving the alignment to a pre-processing step,and introducing\nappropriate delays between streams, DSM provides streaming inference of\narbitrary output sequences, from any input combination, making it applicable to\nmany sequence-to-sequence problems.

Furthermore, by extending the\ndataset size to over 12,000 high-quality trajectories, we established a new\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) among Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct based LLMs on the\nOpenHands agent framework, which increases the resolve rate on\nSWE-Bench-Verified by +21.8% for the 7B model and +46.0% for the 32B model and\nvalidates the effectiveness of our approach."

We\nsidestep this issue by directly fusing hidden states from Large Language Models\n(LLMs) into detectors-an avenue surprisingly under-explored. This paper\npresents a systematic method to enhance visual grounding by utilizing decoder\nlayers of the LLM of an MLLM. We introduce a zero-initialized cross-attention\nadapter to enable efficient knowledge fusion from LLMs to object detectors, a\nnew approach called LED (LLM Enhanced Open-Vocabulary Object Detection). We\nfind that intermediate LLM layers already encode rich spatial semantics;\nadapting only the early layers yields most of the gain.

We\nsidestep this issue by directly fusing hidden states from Large Language Models\n(LLMs) into detectors-an avenue surprisingly under-explored. This paper\npresents a systematic method to enhance visual grounding by utilizing decoder\nlayers of the LLM of an MLLM. We introduce a zero-initialized cross-attention\nadapter to enable efficient knowledge fusion from LLMs to object detectors, a\nnew approach called LED (LLM Enhanced Open-Vocabulary Object Detection). We\nfind that intermediate LLM layers already encode rich spatial semantics;\nadapting only the early layers yields most of the gain. With Swin-T as the\nvision encoder, Qwen2-0.5B + LED lifts GroundingDINO by 3.82 % on OmniLabel at\njust 8.7 % extra GFLOPs, and a larger vision backbone pushes the improvement to\n6.22 %.

This approach paves the way for analysis of\nlarge datasets from large solar telescopes."

We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite\nexcelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to\ngrasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we\nconstruct a benchmark dataset of over 1,200+ meticulously curated and diverse\nexamples across English, Mandarin, Spanish, French, Japanese, and Korean. Each\nexample underwent careful expert review to verify its Drivelological\ncharacteristics, involving multiple rounds of discussion and adjudication to\naddress disagreements. Using this dataset, we evaluate a range of LLMs on\nclassification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear\nlimitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense,\nproduce incoherent justifications, or miss implied rhetorical functions\naltogether.

In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of\nmemorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it\noccurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is\nmemorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect\nmedical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios:\n(1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard\nmedical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including\nover 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The\nresults demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation\nscenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain.\nMemorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and\ncan be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of\nclinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated\ndisclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g.,\nregeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these\nfindings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial\nmemorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy,\nminimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond\nsurface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the\nleakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information.",

SQLGovernor introduces a fragment wise\nprocessing strategy to enable fine grained rewriting and localized error\ncorrection, significantly reducing the cognitive load on the LLM. It further\nincorporates a hybrid self learning mechanism guided by expert feedback,\nallowing the system to continuously improve through DBMS output analysis and\nrule validation. Experiments on benchmarks such as BIRD and BIRD CRITIC, as\nwell as industrial datasets, show that SQLGovernor consistently boosts the\nperformance of base models by up to 10%, while minimizing reliance on manual\nexpertise.

To address these\nchallenges, we propose SQLGovernor, an LLM powered SQL toolkit that unifies\nmultiple functionalities, including syntax correction, query rewriting, query\nmodification, and consistency verification within a structured framework\nenhanced by knowledge management. SQLGovernor introduces a fragment wise\nprocessing strategy to enable fine grained rewriting and localized error\ncorrection, significantly reducing the cognitive load on the LLM. It further\nincorporates a hybrid self learning mechanism guided by expert feedback,\nallowing the system to continuously improve through DBMS output analysis and\nrule validation. Experiments on benchmarks such as BIRD and BIRD CRITIC, as\nwell as industrial datasets, show that SQLGovernor consistently boosts the\nperformance of base models by up to 10%, while minimizing reliance on manual\nexpertise. Deployed in production environments, SQLGovernor demonstrates strong\npractical utility and effective performance."

In this work, we propose a novel approach to\nautomatically generate symbolic stubs for external functions during symbolic\nexecution that leverages Genetic Programming. When the symbolic executor\nencounters an external function, AutoStub generates training data by executing\nthe function on randomly generated inputs and collecting the outputs. Genetic\nProgramming then derives expressions that approximate the behavior of the\nfunction, serving as symbolic stubs. These automatically generated stubs allow\nthe symbolic executor to continue the analysis without manual intervention,\nenabling the exploration of program paths that were previously intractable. We\ndemonstrate that AutoStub can automatically approximate external functions with\nover 90% accuracy for 55% of the functions evaluated, and can infer\nlanguage-specific behaviors that reveal edge cases crucial for software\ntesting.",

Powering Spatial Module, we also introduce an Instruction-Object-Space\n(I-O-S) dataset and fine-tune the Qwen3-4B model into Qwen-Spatial (Qwen-Sp),\nwhich outperforms leading commercial LLMs in object list extraction, achieving\nhigher F1 and NDCG scores on the I-O-S test set. Extensive experiments on the\nRoom-to-Room (R2R) and REVERIE datasets demonstrate MSNav's state-of-the-art\nperformance with significant improvements in Success Rate (SR) and Success\nweighted by Path Length (SPL)."

However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps:\nthey neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics\ncompetitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance\ncomparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first\nbenchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned\nevaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1)\nComprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025,\nspanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed\nmodalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2)\nProfessional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform\nfine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with\nhuman examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3)\nComparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to\nmodels based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison\nbetween (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30\nstate-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly\nremain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress\nwith occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold\nmedals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks. These\nresults highlight a substantial performance gap between open-source models and\ntop students, the strong physical reasoning capabilities of closed-source\nreasoning models, and the fact that there is still significant room for\nimprovement.

However, their application to hardware description languages, such as\nVerilog, is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality training data.\nCurrent approaches to Verilog code generation using LLMs often focus on\nsyntactic correctness, resulting in code with functional errors. To address\nthese challenges, we present AutoVeriFix, a novel Python-assisted two-stage\nframework designed to enhance the functional correctness of LLM-generated\nVerilog code. In the first stage, LLMs are employed to generate high-level\nPython reference models that define the intended circuit behavior.

                    "value": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in\ngenerating software code for high-level programming languages such as Python\nand C++. However, their application to hardware description languages, such as\nVerilog, is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality training data.\nCurrent approaches to Verilog code generation using LLMs often focus on\nsyntactic correctness, resulting in code with functional errors. To address\nthese challenges, we present AutoVeriFix, a novel Python-assisted two-stage\nframework designed to enhance the functional correctness of LLM-generated\nVerilog code. In the first stage, LLMs are employed to generate high-level\nPython reference models that define the intended circuit behavior. In the\nsecond stage, these Python models facilitate the creation of automated tests\nthat guide the generation of Verilog RTL implementations.

As a result, RL has\nemerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the\nrapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces\nfoundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in\nalgorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely\nto revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore\nstrategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence\n(ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for\nreasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including\nfoundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream\napplications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly\nevolving area.

Such variation can introduce systematic\nbiases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type\nI, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors.

We find\nincorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three\nhypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small\nlanguage models. While our findings show that higher task performance and\nbetter general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate\nmodels do not completely eliminate it. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as\neffect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of\nfindings near significance thresholds. Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking\nmitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in\nreducing false positive findings and improving model selection.

                "summary": "The advent of fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) promises to tackle\nclassically intractable problems. A key milestone is solving the Navier-Stokes\nequations (NSE), which has remained formidable for quantum algorithms due to\ntheir high input-output overhead and nonlinearity. Here, we establish a\nfull-stack framework that charts a practical pathway to a quantum advantage for\nlarge-scale NSE simulation. Our approach integrates a spectral-based\ninput/output algorithm, an explicit and synthesized quantum circuit, and a\nrefined error-correction protocol.

The\nevaluation examines consistency, factuality, and biases related to gender,\nethnicity, academic popularity, and scholar similarity. Using ground-truth data\nfrom the American Physical Society and OpenAlex, we establish scholarly\nbenchmarks by comparing model outputs to real-world academic records.

                "summary": "Background: Arsenicosis is a serious public health concern in South and\nSoutheast Asia, primarily caused by long-term consumption of\narsenic-contaminated water. Its early cutaneous manifestations are clinically\nsignificant but often underdiagnosed, particularly in rural areas with limited\naccess to dermatologists. Automated, image-based diagnostic solutions can\nsupport early detection and timely interventions.\n  Methods: In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework for arsenicosis\ndiagnosis using mobile phone-captured skin images. A dataset comprising 20\nclasses and over 11000 images of arsenic-induced and other dermatological\nconditions was curated. Multiple deep learning architectures, including\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, were\nbenchmarked for arsenicosis detection. Model interpretability was integrated\nvia LIME and Grad-CAM, while deployment feasibility was demonstrated through a\nweb-based diagnostic tool.\n  Results: Transformer-based models significantly outperformed CNNs, with the\nSwin Transformer achieving the best results (86\\\\% accuracy). LIME and Grad-CAM\nvisualizations confirmed that the models attended to lesion-relevant regions,\nincreasing clinical transparency and aiding in error analysis. The framework\nalso demonstrated strong performance on external validation samples, confirming\nits ability to generalize beyond the curated dataset.\n  Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of deep\nlearning for non-invasive, accessible, and explainable diagnosis of arsenicosis\nfrom mobile-acquired images. By enabling reliable image-based screening, it can\nserve as a practical diagnostic aid in rural and resource-limited communities,\nwhere access to dermatologists is scarce, thereby supporting early detection\nand timely intervention.",

In this work, we present a\nnovel RGB-only, object-level topometric navigation pipeline that enables\nzero-shot, long-horizon robot navigation without requiring 3D maps or\npre-trained controllers. Our approach integrates global topological path\nplanning with local metric trajectory control, allowing the robot to navigate\ntowards object-level sub-goals while avoiding obstacles.

In this work, we present a\nnovel RGB-only, object-level topometric navigation pipeline that enables\nzero-shot, long-horizon robot navigation without requiring 3D maps or\npre-trained controllers. Our approach integrates global topological path\nplanning with local metric trajectory control, allowing the robot to navigate\ntowards object-level sub-goals while avoiding obstacles.

                "summary": "As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become increasingly capable of\nautomating complex, multi-step tasks, the need for robust, secure, and\npredictable architectural patterns is paramount. This paper provides a\ncomprehensive guide to the ``Plan-then-Execute'' (P-t-E) pattern, an agentic\ndesign that separates strategic planning from tactical execution. We explore\nthe foundational principles of P-t-E, detailing its core components - the\nPlanner and the Executor - and its architectural advantages in predictability,\ncost-efficiency, and reasoning quality over reactive patterns like ReAct\n(Reason + Act). A central focus is placed on the security implications of this\ndesign, particularly its inherent resilience to indirect prompt injection\nattacks by establishing control-flow integrity. We argue that while P-t-E\nprovides a strong foundation, a defense-in-depth strategy is necessary, and we\ndetail essential complementary controls such as the Principle of Least\nPrivilege, task-scoped tool access, and sandboxed code execution. To make these\nprinciples actionable, this guide provides detailed implementation blueprints\nand working code references for three leading agentic frameworks: LangChain\n(via LangGraph), CrewAI, and AutoGen.

This paper provides a\ncomprehensive guide to the ``Plan-then-Execute'' (P-t-E) pattern, an agentic\ndesign that separates strategic planning from tactical execution. We explore\nthe foundational principles of P-t-E, detailing its core components - the\nPlanner and the Executor - and its architectural advantages in predictability,\ncost-efficiency, and reasoning quality over reactive patterns like ReAct\n(Reason + Act). A central focus is placed on the security implications of this\ndesign, particularly its inherent resilience to indirect prompt injection\nattacks by establishing control-flow integrity. We argue that while P-t-E\nprovides a strong foundation, a defense-in-depth strategy is necessary, and we\ndetail essential complementary controls such as the Principle of Least\nPrivilege, task-scoped tool access, and sandboxed code execution. To make these\nprinciples actionable, this guide provides detailed implementation blueprints\nand working code references for three leading agentic frameworks: LangChain\n(via LangGraph), CrewAI, and AutoGen.

We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite\nexcelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to\ngrasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we\nconstruct a benchmark dataset of over 1,200+ meticulously curated and diverse\nexamples across English, Mandarin, Spanish, French, Japanese, and Korean. Each\nexample underwent careful expert review to verify its Drivelological\ncharacteristics, involving multiple rounds of discussion and adjudication to\naddress disagreements. Using this dataset, we evaluate a range of LLMs on\nclassification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear\nlimitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense,\nproduce incoherent justifications, or miss implied rhetorical functions\naltogether.

To date, LLMs have been widely applied to tasks such as diagnostic\nassistance, medical question answering, and clinical information synthesis.\nHowever, a key open question remains: to what extent do LLMs memorize medical\ntraining data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of\nmemorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it\noccurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is\nmemorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect\nmedical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios:\n(1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard\nmedical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including\nover 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The\nresults demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation\nscenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain.\nMemorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and\ncan be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of\nclinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated\ndisclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g.,\nregeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these\nfindings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial\nmemorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy,\nminimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond\nsurface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the\nleakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information.",

To address these\nchallenges, we propose SQLGovernor, an LLM powered SQL toolkit that unifies\nmultiple functionalities, including syntax correction, query rewriting, query\nmodification, and consistency verification within a structured framework\nenhanced by knowledge management. SQLGovernor introduces a fragment wise\nprocessing strategy to enable fine grained rewriting and localized error\ncorrection, significantly reducing the cognitive load on the LLM.

The EGA modules enhance both spatial and channel-wise\ninteraction, improving the network's capacity to capture relevant features,\nwhile the hybrid upsampling module mitigates the risk of overfitting to noise.\nWe validate the proposed approach using a publicly available LDCT/PET dataset.\nExperimental results demonstrate that HSANet achieves superior denoising\nperformance compared to existing methods, while maintaining a lightweight model\nsize suitable for deployment on GPUs with standard memory configurations. This\nmakes our approach highly practical for real-world clinical applications."

However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps:\nthey neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics\ncompetitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance\ncomparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first\nbenchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned\nevaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1)\nComprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025,\nspanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed\nmodalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2)\nProfessional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform\nfine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with\nhuman examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3)\nComparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to\nmodels based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison\nbetween (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30\nstate-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly\nremain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress\nwith occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold\nmedals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks. These\nresults highlight a substantial performance gap between open-source models and\ntop students, the strong physical reasoning capabilities of closed-source\nreasoning models, and the fact that there is still significant room for\nimprovement.

Existing\nmethods often optimize for individual alignment dimensions in isolation,\nleading to trade-offs and inconsistent behavior. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\narchitectures offer modularity, they suffer from poorly calibrated routing,\nlimiting their effectiveness in alignment tasks. We propose TrinityX, a modular\nalignment framework that incorporates a Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE)\nwithin the Transformer architecture. TrinityX leverages separately trained\nexperts for each HHH dimension, integrating their outputs through a calibrated,\ntask-adaptive routing mechanism that combines expert signals into a unified,\nalignment-aware representation. Extensive experiments on three standard\nalignment benchmarks-Alpaca (Helpfulness), BeaverTails (Harmlessness), and\nTruthfulQA (Honesty)-demonstrate that TrinityX outperforms strong baselines,\nachieving relative improvements of 32.5% in win rate, 33.9% in safety score,\nand 28.4% in truthfulness.

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong performance across a wide range\nof NLP tasks, yet aligning their outputs with the principles of Helpfulness,\nHarmlessness, and Honesty (HHH) remains a persistent challenge. Existing\nmethods often optimize for individual alignment dimensions in isolation,\nleading to trade-offs and inconsistent behavior. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\narchitectures offer modularity, they suffer from poorly calibrated routing,\nlimiting their effectiveness in alignment tasks. We propose TrinityX, a modular\nalignment framework that incorporates a Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE)\nwithin the Transformer architecture. TrinityX leverages separately trained\nexperts for each HHH dimension, integrating their outputs through a calibrated,\ntask-adaptive routing mechanism that combines expert signals into a unified,\nalignment-aware representation. Extensive experiments on three standard\nalignment benchmarks-Alpaca (Helpfulness), BeaverTails (Harmlessness), and\nTruthfulQA (Honesty)-demonstrate that TrinityX outperforms strong baselines,\nachieving relative improvements of 32.5% in win rate, 33.9% in safety score,\nand 28.4% in truthfulness. In addition, TrinityX reduces memory usage and\ninference latency by over 40% compared to prior MoE-based approaches.

This\nparadigm is often impractical for specialized robots where data is scarce and\ncreates an inefficient, theoretically suboptimal training pipeline. To overcome\nthis, we introduce PegasusFlow, a hierarchical rolling-denoising framework that\nenables direct and parallel sampling of trajectory score gradients from\nenvironmental interaction, completely bypassing the need for expert data. Our\ncore innovation is a novel sampling algorithm, Weighted Basis Function\nOptimization (WBFO), which leverages spline basis representations to achieve\nsuperior sample efficiency and faster convergence compared to traditional\nmethods like MPPI. The framework is embedded within a scalable, asynchronous\nparallel simulation architecture that supports massively parallel rollouts for\nefficient data collection. Extensive experiments on trajectory optimization and\nrobotic navigation tasks demonstrate that our approach, particularly\nAction-Value WBFO (AVWBFO) combined with a reinforcement learning warm-start,\nsignificantly outperforms baselines.

                    "value": "Diffusion models offer powerful generative capabilities for robot trajectory\nplanning, yet their practical deployment on robots is hindered by a critical\nbottleneck: a reliance on imitation learning from expert demonstrations. This\nparadigm is often impractical for specialized robots where data is scarce and\ncreates an inefficient, theoretically suboptimal training pipeline. To overcome\nthis, we introduce PegasusFlow, a hierarchical rolling-denoising framework that\nenables direct and parallel sampling of trajectory score gradients from\nenvironmental interaction, completely bypassing the need for expert data. Our\ncore innovation is a novel sampling algorithm, Weighted Basis Function\nOptimization (WBFO), which leverages spline basis representations to achieve\nsuperior sample efficiency and faster convergence compared to traditional\nmethods like MPPI. The framework is embedded within a scalable, asynchronous\nparallel simulation architecture that supports massively parallel rollouts for\nefficient data collection. Extensive experiments on trajectory optimization and\nrobotic navigation tasks demonstrate that our approach, particularly\nAction-Value WBFO (AVWBFO) combined with a reinforcement learning warm-start,\nsignificantly outperforms baselines.

With Metis, FP8\ntraining surpasses FP32 baselines, and FP4 training achieves accuracy\ncomparable to FP32, paving the way for robust and scalable LLM training under\nadvanced low-bit quantization.

This work introduces Metis, a training\nframework that combines (i) spectral decomposition with random embedding to\nefficiently disentangle dominant from long-tail components, compressing broad\ndistributions into quantization-friendly narrow ranges; (ii) adaptive learning\nrates in the spectral domain to amplify underrepresented directions and better\ncapture diverse features critical for performance; and (iii) a dual-range\nregularizer that jointly constrains numerical precision and parameter range\ndistribution, ensuring stable, unbiased low-bit training. With Metis, FP8\ntraining surpasses FP32 baselines, and FP4 training achieves accuracy\ncomparable to FP32, paving the way for robust and scalable LLM training under\nadvanced low-bit quantization. The code implementation for Metis is available\nat: https://github.com/sii-research/Metis."

Drawing inspiration from recent\nadvances in autonomous agent architectures, such as the AI Co-Scientist, our\napproach integrates specialized agents for planning, crime type detection,\nexternal intelligence gathering, and compliance validation.

Since the top\nsegments of cached experts are exempt from fetching, the loading time is\nreduced, which allows efficient transfer-computation overlap. Nevertheless, the\nperformance of MoEpic critically depends on the cache configuration (i.e., each\nlayer's VRAM budget and expert split ratio). To this end, we propose a\ndivide-and-conquer algorithm based on fixed-point iteration for adaptive cache\nconfiguration.

In this paper, we propose EvolKV, an adaptive framework for\nlayer-wise, task-driven KV cache compression that jointly optimizes the memory\nefficiency and task performance.
