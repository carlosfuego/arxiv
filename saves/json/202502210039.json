We propose mmMamba, a framework for developing\nlinear-complexity native multimodal state space models through progressive\ndistillation from existing MLLMs using moderate academic computational\nresources. Our approach enables the direct conversion of trained decoder-only\nMLLMs to linear-complexity architectures without requiring pre-trained\nRNN-based LLM or vision encoders. We propose an seeding strategy to carve Mamba\nfrom trained Transformer and a three-stage distillation recipe, which can\neffectively transfer the knowledge from Transformer to Mamba while preserving\nmultimodal capabilities. Our method also supports flexible hybrid architectures\nthat combine Transformer and Mamba layers for customizable\nefficiency-performance trade-offs. Distilled from the Transformer-based\ndecoder-only HoVLE, mmMamba-linear achieves competitive performance against\nexisting linear and quadratic-complexity VLMs, while mmMamba-hybrid further\nimproves performance significantly, approaching HoVLE's capabilities. At 103K\ntokens, mmMamba-linear demonstrates 20.6$\\times$ speedup and 75.8% GPU memory\nreduction compared to HoVLE, while mmMamba-hybrid achieves 13.5$\\times$ speedup\nand 60.2% memory savings.

Then,we illustrate how DRL algorithms are applied to\nspecific UAV network tasks by discussing from problem formulations to DRL\nimplementation. By framing UAV communication challenges as optimization\nproblems, this survey emphasizes the practical value of DRL in dynamic and\nuncertain environments.

Offload-based methods have\nbeen proposed to address this challenge, but they face difficulties with expert\nprediction. Inaccurate expert predictions can result in prolonged inference\ndelays. To promote the application of MoE models in edge scenarios, we propose\nFate, an offloading system designed for MoE models to enable efficient\ninference in resource-constrained environments. The key insight behind Fate is\nthat gate inputs from adjacent layers can be effectively used for expert\nprefetching, achieving high prediction accuracy without additional GPU\noverhead. Furthermore, Fate employs a shallow-favoring expert caching strategy\nthat increases the expert hit rate to 99\\%. Additionally, Fate integrates\ntailored quantization strategies for cache optimization and IO efficiency.\nExperimental results show that, compared to Load on Demand and Expert\nActivation Path-based method, Fate achieves up to 4.5x and 1.9x speedups in\nprefill speed and up to 4.1x and 2.2x speedups in decoding speed, respectively,\nwhile maintaining inference quality. Moreover, Fate's performance improvements\nare scalable across different memory budgets.",

Offload-based methods have\nbeen proposed to address this challenge, but they face difficulties with expert\nprediction. Inaccurate expert predictions can result in prolonged inference\ndelays. To promote the application of MoE models in edge scenarios, we propose\nFate, an offloading system designed for MoE models to enable efficient\ninference in resource-constrained environments. The key insight behind Fate is\nthat gate inputs from adjacent layers can be effectively used for expert\nprefetching, achieving high prediction accuracy without additional GPU\noverhead. Furthermore, Fate employs a shallow-favoring expert caching strategy\nthat increases the expert hit rate to 99\\%. Additionally, Fate integrates\ntailored quantization strategies for cache optimization and IO efficiency.\nExperimental results show that, compared to Load on Demand and Expert\nActivation Path-based method, Fate achieves up to 4.5x and 1.9x speedups in\nprefill speed and up to 4.1x and 2.2x speedups in decoding speed, respectively,\nwhile maintaining inference quality. Moreover, Fate's performance improvements\nare scalable across different memory budgets."

Additionally, most existing pre-trained LLMs fail to\ngeneralize beyond their original training sequence lengths. To enable efficient\nand practical long-context utilization, we introduce InfiniteHiP, a novel, and\npractical LLM inference framework that accelerates processing by dynamically\neliminating irrelevant context tokens through a modular hierarchical token\npruning algorithm. Our method also allows generalization to longer sequences by\nselectively applying various RoPE adjustment methods according to the internal\nattention patterns within LLMs. Furthermore, we offload the key-value cache to\nhost memory during inference, significantly reducing GPU memory pressure. As a\nresult, InfiniteHiP enables the processing of up to 3 million tokens on a\nsingle L40s 48GB GPU -- 3x larger -- without any permanent loss of context\ninformation. Our framework achieves an 18.95x speedup in attention decoding for\na 1 million token context without requiring additional training. We implement\nour method in the SGLang framework and demonstrate its effectiveness and\npracticality through extensive evaluations.",

                    "value": "In modern large language models (LLMs), handling very long context lengths\npresents significant challenges as it causes slower inference speeds and\nincreased memory costs. Additionally, most existing pre-trained LLMs fail to\ngeneralize beyond their original training sequence lengths. To enable efficient\nand practical long-context utilization, we introduce InfiniteHiP, a novel, and\npractical LLM inference framework that accelerates processing by dynamically\neliminating irrelevant context tokens through a modular hierarchical token\npruning algorithm. Our method also allows generalization to longer sequences by\nselectively applying various RoPE adjustment methods according to the internal\nattention patterns within LLMs. Furthermore, we offload the key-value cache to\nhost memory during inference, significantly reducing GPU memory pressure. As a\nresult, InfiniteHiP enables the processing of up to 3 million tokens on a\nsingle L40s 48GB GPU -- 3x larger -- without any permanent loss of context\ninformation. Our framework achieves an 18.95x speedup in attention decoding for\na 1 million token context without requiring additional training. We implement\nour method in the SGLang framework and demonstrate its effectiveness and\npracticality through extensive evaluations."

                "summary": "Efficient real-world deployments of large language models (LLMs) rely on\nKey-Value (KV) caching for processing and generating long outputs, reducing the\nneed for repetitive computation. For large contexts, Key-Value caches can take\nup tens of gigabytes of device memory, as they store vector representations for\neach token and layer. Recent work has shown that the cached vectors can be\ncompressed through quantization, pruning or merging, but these techniques often\ncompromise quality towards higher compression rates. In this work, we aim to\nimprove Key & Value compression by exploiting two observations: 1) the inherent\ndependencies between keys and values across different layers, and 2)\nhigh-compression mechanisms for internal network states. We propose AQUA-KV, an\nadaptive quantization for Key-Value caches that relies on compact adapters to\nexploit existing dependencies between Keys and Values, and aims to \"optimally\"\ncompress the information that cannot be predicted. AQUA-KV significantly\nimproves compression rates, while maintaining high accuracy on state-of-the-art\nLLM families. On Llama 3.2 LLMs, we achieve near-lossless inference at 2-2.5\nbits per value with under $1\\%$ relative error in perplexity and LongBench\nscores. AQUA-KV is one-shot, simple, and efficient: it can be calibrated on a\nsingle GPU within 1-6 hours, even for 70B models.",

                    "value": "Efficient real-world deployments of large language models (LLMs) rely on\nKey-Value (KV) caching for processing and generating long outputs, reducing the\nneed for repetitive computation. For large contexts, Key-Value caches can take\nup tens of gigabytes of device memory, as they store vector representations for\neach token and layer. Recent work has shown that the cached vectors can be\ncompressed through quantization, pruning or merging, but these techniques often\ncompromise quality towards higher compression rates. In this work, we aim to\nimprove Key & Value compression by exploiting two observations: 1) the inherent\ndependencies between keys and values across different layers, and 2)\nhigh-compression mechanisms for internal network states. We propose AQUA-KV, an\nadaptive quantization for Key-Value caches that relies on compact adapters to\nexploit existing dependencies between Keys and Values, and aims to \"optimally\"\ncompress the information that cannot be predicted. AQUA-KV significantly\nimproves compression rates, while maintaining high accuracy on state-of-the-art\nLLM families. On Llama 3.2 LLMs, we achieve near-lossless inference at 2-2.5\nbits per value with under $1\\%$ relative error in perplexity and LongBench\nscores. AQUA-KV is one-shot, simple, and efficient: it can be calibrated on a\nsingle GPU within 1-6 hours, even for 70B models."

To tackle\nthese concerns, we present SphereFusion, an end-to-end framework that combines\nthe strengths of various projection methods. Specifically, SphereFusion\ninitially employs 2D image convolution and mesh operations to extract two\ndistinct types of features from the panorama image in both equirectangular and\nspherical projection domains. These features are then projected onto the\nspherical domain, where a gate fusion module selects the most reliable features\nfor fusion. Finally, SphereFusion estimates panorama depth within the spherical\ndomain. Meanwhile, SphereFusion employs a cache strategy to improve the\nefficiency of mesh operation. Extensive experiments on three public panorama\ndatasets demonstrate that SphereFusion achieves competitive results with other\nstate-of-the-art methods, while presenting the fastest inference speed at only\n17 ms on a 512$\\times$1024 panorama image.",

While these important issues have been considered in the\npast, significant developments, such as the IPv6 finally getting traction, the\nadoption of the ECS extension to DNS by major DNS resolution services, and the\nembracing of anycast by some CDNs warrant a reassessment under these new\nrealities. Among the resolution services we consider, We find Google DNS and\nOpenDNS to lag behind the Cloudflare resolver and, for some CDNs, Quad9 in\nterms of DNS latency, and trace the cause to drastically lower cache hit rates.\nAt the same time, we find that Google and OpenDNS have largely closed the gap\nwith ISP resolvers in the quality of CDNs'client-to-edge-server mappings as\nmeasured by latency, while the Cloudflare resolver still shows some penalty\nwith Akamai, and Quad9 exhibits a noticeable penalty with three of the four\nCDNs in the study, keeping up only for Cloudflare CDN that does not use DNS to\nmap clients to servers. Finally, in several locations, we observe IPv6 penalty\nin the latency of client-to-CDN-edge-server mappings produced by the resolvers.\nMoreover, this penalty does not rise above typical thresholds employed by the\nHappy Eyeballs algorithm for falling back to IPv4 communication.

To reduce high training costs, Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE) architecture has become a popular backbone for modern LLMs. However,\ndespite the benefits, serving MoE-based LLMs experience severe memory\ninefficiency due to sparsely activated experts. Recent studies propose to\noffload inactive experts from GPU memory to CPU memory to improve the serving\nefficiency of MoE models. However, they either incur high inference latency or\nhigh model memory footprints due to coarse-grained designs. To tame the\nlatency-memory trade-off in MoE serving, we present fMoE, a fine-grained expert\noffloading system for MoE serving that achieves low inference latency with\nmemory efficiency. We design fMoE to extract fine-grained expert selection\npatterns from MoE models and semantic hints from input prompts to efficiently\nguide expert prefetching, caching, and offloading decisions. fMoE is prototyped\non top of HuggingFace Transformers and deployed on a six-GPU testbed.\nExperiments with open-source MoE models and real-world workloads show that fMoE\nreduces inference latency by 47% and improves expert hit rate by 36% over\nstate-of-the-art solutions.",

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained immense success in revolutionizing\nvarious applications, including content generation, search and recommendation,\nand AI-assisted operation. To reduce high training costs, Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE) architecture has become a popular backbone for modern LLMs. However,\ndespite the benefits, serving MoE-based LLMs experience severe memory\ninefficiency due to sparsely activated experts. Recent studies propose to\noffload inactive experts from GPU memory to CPU memory to improve the serving\nefficiency of MoE models. However, they either incur high inference latency or\nhigh model memory footprints due to coarse-grained designs. To tame the\nlatency-memory trade-off in MoE serving, we present fMoE, a fine-grained expert\noffloading system for MoE serving that achieves low inference latency with\nmemory efficiency. We design fMoE to extract fine-grained expert selection\npatterns from MoE models and semantic hints from input prompts to efficiently\nguide expert prefetching, caching, and offloading decisions. fMoE is prototyped\non top of HuggingFace Transformers and deployed on a six-GPU testbed.\nExperiments with open-source MoE models and real-world workloads show that fMoE\nreduces inference latency by 47% and improves expert hit rate by 36% over\nstate-of-the-art solutions."

Therefore, we thoroughly analyze the inherent\ncorrelation of layer-wise transformer attention patterns to KV cache\nquantization errors and study why key cache is more important than value cache\nfor quantization error reduction.

To reduce the computational cost of\noffline calibration, we utilize the intra-layer KV precision pair pruning and\ninter-layer clustering to reduce the search space. Experimental results show\nthat we can achieve nearly lossless 3.25-bit mixed precision KV cache\nquantization for LLMs like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and 4.0-bit for sensitive\nmodels like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning tasks.

Additionally, the computation\ntime overhead for prefill and decode is key for optimizing Job Completion Time\n(JCT), and KV data size can become prohibitive for long prompts and sequences.\nExisting KV quantization methods can alleviate the transmission bottleneck and\nreduce memory requirements, but they introduce significant dequantization\noverhead, exacerbating the computation time.\n  We propose Homomorphic Acceleration via Compression of the KV cache (HACK)\nfor disaggregated LLM inference. HACK eliminates the heavy KV dequantization\nstep, and directly performs computations on quantized KV data to approximate\nand reduce the cost of the expensive matrix-multiplication step. Extensive\ntrace-driven experiments show that HACK reduces JCT by up to 70.9% compared to\ndisaggregated LLM inference baseline and by up to 52.3% compared to\nstate-of-the-art KV quantization methods.",

Additionally, the computation\ntime overhead for prefill and decode is key for optimizing Job Completion Time\n(JCT), and KV data size can become prohibitive for long prompts and sequences.\nExisting KV quantization methods can alleviate the transmission bottleneck and\nreduce memory requirements, but they introduce significant dequantization\noverhead, exacerbating the computation time.\n  We propose Homomorphic Acceleration via Compression of the KV cache (HACK)\nfor disaggregated LLM inference. HACK eliminates the heavy KV dequantization\nstep, and directly performs computations on quantized KV data to approximate\nand reduce the cost of the expensive matrix-multiplication step. Extensive\ntrace-driven experiments show that HACK reduces JCT by up to 70.9% compared to\ndisaggregated LLM inference baseline and by up to 52.3% compared to\nstate-of-the-art KV quantization methods."

Our analysis reveals\nthat programs submitted to LLM serving engines experience long cumulative wait\ntimes, primarily due to head-of-line blocking at both the individual LLM\nrequest and the program. To address this, we introduce Autellix, an LLM serving\nsystem that treats programs as first-class citizens to minimize their\nend-to-end latencies. Autellix intercepts LLM calls submitted by programs,\nenriching schedulers with program-level context. We propose two scheduling\nalgorithms-for single-threaded and distributed programs-that preempt and\nprioritize LLM calls based on their programs' previously completed calls.

However, instrumental\nnoise, computational requirements, and varying levels of physical realism make\nit challenging to derive reliable solar magnetic field estimates. In this\nstudy, we present a novel approach for spectropolarimetric inversions based on\nPhysics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to infer the photospheric magnetic\nfield under the Milne-Eddington approximation (PINN ME). Our model acts as a\nrepresentation of the parameter space, mapping input coordinates (t, x, y) to\nthe respective spectropolarimetric parameters, which are used to synthesize the\ncorresponding stokes profiles. By iteratively sampling coordinate points,\nsynthesizing profiles, and minimizing the deviation from the observed stokes\nprofiles, our method can find the set of Milne-Eddington parameters that best\nfit the observations. In addition, we directly include the\npoint-spread-function to account for instrumental effects. We use a predefined\nparameter space as well as synthetic profiles from a radiative MHD simulation\nto evaluate the performance of our method and to estimate the impact of\ninstrumental noise. Our results demonstrate that PINN ME achieves an intrinsic\nspatio-temporal coupling, which can largely mitigate observational noise and\nprovides a memory-efficient inversion even for extended fields-of-view.\nFinally, we apply our method to observations and show that our method provides\na high spatial coherence and can resolve small-scale features both in strong-\nand weak-field regions.",

However, instrumental\nnoise, computational requirements, and varying levels of physical realism make\nit challenging to derive reliable solar magnetic field estimates. In this\nstudy, we present a novel approach for spectropolarimetric inversions based on\nPhysics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to infer the photospheric magnetic\nfield under the Milne-Eddington approximation (PINN ME). Our model acts as a\nrepresentation of the parameter space, mapping input coordinates (t, x, y) to\nthe respective spectropolarimetric parameters, which are used to synthesize the\ncorresponding stokes profiles. By iteratively sampling coordinate points,\nsynthesizing profiles, and minimizing the deviation from the observed stokes\nprofiles, our method can find the set of Milne-Eddington parameters that best\nfit the observations. In addition, we directly include the\npoint-spread-function to account for instrumental effects. We use a predefined\nparameter space as well as synthetic profiles from a radiative MHD simulation\nto evaluate the performance of our method and to estimate the impact of\ninstrumental noise. Our results demonstrate that PINN ME achieves an intrinsic\nspatio-temporal coupling, which can largely mitigate observational noise and\nprovides a memory-efficient inversion even for extended fields-of-view.\nFinally, we apply our method to observations and show that our method provides\na high spatial coherence and can resolve small-scale features both in strong-\nand weak-field regions."

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities\nthrough pretraining and alignment. However, superior short-context LLMs may\nunderperform in long-context scenarios due to insufficient long-context\nalignment. This alignment process remains challenging due to the impracticality\nof human annotation for extended contexts and the difficulty in balancing\nshort- and long-context performance. To address these challenges, we introduce\nLongPO, that enables short-context LLMs to self-evolve to excel on long-context\ntasks by internally transferring short-context capabilities. LongPO harnesses\nLLMs to learn from self-generated short-to-long preference data, comprising\npaired responses generated for identical instructions with long-context inputs\nand their compressed short-context counterparts, respectively. This preference\nreveals capabilities and potentials of LLMs cultivated during short-context\nalignment that may be diminished in under-aligned long-context scenarios.\nAdditionally, LongPO incorporates a short-to-long KL constraint to mitigate\nshort-context performance decline during long-context alignment. When applied\nto Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 from 128K to 512K context lengths, LongPO fully\nretains short-context performance and largely outperforms naive SFT and DPO in\nboth long- and short-context tasks.

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities\nthrough pretraining and alignment. However, superior short-context LLMs may\nunderperform in long-context scenarios due to insufficient long-context\nalignment. This alignment process remains challenging due to the impracticality\nof human annotation for extended contexts and the difficulty in balancing\nshort- and long-context performance. To address these challenges, we introduce\nLongPO, that enables short-context LLMs to self-evolve to excel on long-context\ntasks by internally transferring short-context capabilities. LongPO harnesses\nLLMs to learn from self-generated short-to-long preference data, comprising\npaired responses generated for identical instructions with long-context inputs\nand their compressed short-context counterparts, respectively. This preference\nreveals capabilities and potentials of LLMs cultivated during short-context\nalignment that may be diminished in under-aligned long-context scenarios.\nAdditionally, LongPO incorporates a short-to-long KL constraint to mitigate\nshort-context performance decline during long-context alignment. When applied\nto Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 from 128K to 512K context lengths, LongPO fully\nretains short-context performance and largely outperforms naive SFT and DPO in\nboth long- and short-context tasks.

In this paper, we first demonstrate through a series of experiments\nthat existing LLM4Rec models do not fully capture sequential information both\nduring training and inference. Then, we propose a simple yet effective\nLLM-based sequential recommender, called LLM-SRec, a method that enhances the\nintegration of sequential information into LLMs by distilling the user\nrepresentations extracted from a pre-trained CF-SRec model into LLMs. Our\nextensive experiments show that LLM-SRec enhances LLMs' ability to understand\nusers' item interaction sequences, ultimately leading to improved\nrecommendation performance. Furthermore, unlike existing LLM4Rec models that\nrequire fine-tuning of LLMs, LLM-SRec achieves state-of-the-art performance by\ntraining only a few lightweight MLPs, highlighting its practicality in\nreal-world applications.

For large inputs, SPEX outperforms marginal attribution methods by up\nto 20% in terms of faithfully reconstructing LLM outputs. Further, SPEX\nsuccessfully identifies key features and interactions that strongly influence\nmodel output. For one of our datasets, HotpotQA, SPEX provides interactions\nthat align with human annotations.

This framework\nsupports both routine and critical traffic scenarios, enhancing its\napplicability. We demonstrate that our approach not only diversifies agent\nplanning and road selection but also significantly reduces the average\ncollision rate from 8% to 3.5% in SafeBench.

                "summary": "The latent position network model (LPM) is a popular approach for the\nstatistical analysis of network data. A central aspect of this model is that it\nassigns nodes to random positions in a latent space, such that the probability\nof an interaction between each pair of individuals or nodes is determined by\ntheir distance in this latent space.

                "summary": "Geolocation, the task of identifying an image's location, requires complex\nreasoning and is crucial for navigation, monitoring, and cultural preservation.\nHowever, current methods often produce coarse, imprecise, and non-interpretable\nlocalization. A major challenge lies in the quality and scale of existing\ngeolocation datasets. These datasets are typically small-scale and\nautomatically constructed, leading to noisy data and inconsistent task\ndifficulty, with images that either reveal answers too easily or lack\nsufficient clues for reliable inference. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a comprehensive geolocation framework with three key components:\nGeoComp, a large-scale dataset; GeoCoT, a novel reasoning method; and GeoEval,\nan evaluation metric, collectively designed to address critical challenges and\ndrive advancements in geolocation research. At the core of this framework is\nGeoComp (Geolocation Competition Dataset), a large-scale dataset collected from\na geolocation game platform involving 740K users over two years. It comprises\n25 million entries of metadata and 3 million geo-tagged locations spanning much\nof the globe, with each location annotated thousands to tens of thousands of\ntimes by human users. The dataset offers diverse difficulty levels for detailed\nanalysis and highlights key gaps in current models.

                    "value": "Geolocation, the task of identifying an image's location, requires complex\nreasoning and is crucial for navigation, monitoring, and cultural preservation.\nHowever, current methods often produce coarse, imprecise, and non-interpretable\nlocalization. A major challenge lies in the quality and scale of existing\ngeolocation datasets. These datasets are typically small-scale and\nautomatically constructed, leading to noisy data and inconsistent task\ndifficulty, with images that either reveal answers too easily or lack\nsufficient clues for reliable inference. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a comprehensive geolocation framework with three key components:\nGeoComp, a large-scale dataset; GeoCoT, a novel reasoning method; and GeoEval,\nan evaluation metric, collectively designed to address critical challenges and\ndrive advancements in geolocation research. At the core of this framework is\nGeoComp (Geolocation Competition Dataset), a large-scale dataset collected from\na geolocation game platform involving 740K users over two years. It comprises\n25 million entries of metadata and 3 million geo-tagged locations spanning much\nof the globe, with each location annotated thousands to tens of thousands of\ntimes by human users. The dataset offers diverse difficulty levels for detailed\nanalysis and highlights key gaps in current models. Building on this dataset,\nwe propose Geographical Chain-of-Thought (GeoCoT), a novel multi-step reasoning\nframework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Vision Models\n(LVMs) in geolocation tasks. GeoCoT improves performance by integrating\ncontextual and spatial cues through a multi-step process that mimics human\ngeolocation reasoning.

Pre-stellar cores are the birthplaces of Sun-like stars and\nrepresent the initial conditions for the assembly of protoplanetary systems.\nDue to their short lifespans, they are rare. In recent efforts to increase the\nnumber of such sources identified in the Solar neighbourhood, we have selected\na sample of 40 starless cores from the publicly available core catalogs of the\nHerschel Gould Belt survey. In this work, we focus on one of the sources that\nstands out for its high central density: Corona Australis 151. Aims. We use\nmolecular lines that trace dense gas (n>=10^6 cm-3) to confirm the\nexceptionally high density of this object, to study its physical structure, and\nto understand its evolutionary stage. Methods. We detected the N2H+ 3-2 and 5-4\ntransitions, and the N2D+ 3-2, 4-3, and 6-5 lines with the APEX telescope. We\nuse the Herschel continuum data to infer a spherically symmetric model of the\ncore's density and temperature. This is used as input to perform\nnon-local-thermodynamic-equilibrium radiative transfer to fit the observed five\nlines. Results. Our analysis confirms that this core is characterised by very\nhigh densities (a few x 10^7 cm-3 at the centre) and cold temperatures. We\ninfer a high deuteration level of N2D+/N2H+=0.50, indicative of an advanced\nevolutionary stage. In the large bandwidth covered by the APEX data, we detect\nseveral other deuterated species, including CHD2OH, D2CO, and ND3. We also\ndetect multiple sulphurated species that present broader lines with signs of\nhigh-velocity wings. Conclusions. The observation of high-velocity wings and\nthe fact that the linewidths of N2H+ and N2D+ become larger with increasing\nfrequency can be interpreted either as an indication of supersonic infall\nmotions developing in the central parts of a very evolved pre-stellar core or\nas the signature of outflows from a very low luminosity object (VeLLO).\n*SHORTENED*",

While\nLLM-based program repair systems can propose bug fixes using only a user's bug\nreport, their effectiveness is fundamentally limited by their ability to\nperform fault localization (FL), a challenging problem for both humans and\nLLMs. Existing FL approaches rely on executable test cases, require training on\ncostly and often noisy line-level annotations, or demand resource-intensive\nLLMs. In this paper, we present Bug Attention Probe (BAP), a method which\nlearns state-of-the-art fault localization without any direct localization\nlabels, outperforming traditional FL baselines and prompting of large-scale\nLLMs. We evaluate our approach across a variety of code settings, including\nreal-world Java bugs from the standard Defects4J dataset as well as seven other\ndatasets which span a diverse set of bug types and languages. Averaged across\nall eight datasets, BAP improves by 34.6% top-1 accuracy compared to the\nstrongest baseline and 93.4% over zero-shot prompting GPT-4o. BAP is also\nsignificantly more efficient than prompting, outperforming large open-weight\nmodels at a small fraction of the computational cost.",

We complement a complete system description, including\nnumerous design decisions that are typically not widely disseminated, with a\ncollection of studies that clarify the importance of mitigating various sources\nof latency, accounting for training and deployment distribution shifts,\nrobustness of the perception system, sensitivity to policy hyper-parameters,\nand choice of action space. A video demonstrating the components of the system\nand details of experimental results can be found at\nhttps://youtu.be/uFcnWjB42I0."

Qwen2.5-VL achieves a major leap\nforward in understanding and interacting with the world through enhanced visual\nrecognition, precise object localization, robust document parsing, and\nlong-video comprehension. A standout feature of Qwen2.5-VL is its ability to\nlocalize objects using bounding boxes or points accurately. It provides robust\nstructured data extraction from invoices, forms, and tables, as well as\ndetailed analysis of charts, diagrams, and layouts. To handle complex inputs,\nQwen2.5-VL introduces dynamic resolution processing and absolute time encoding,\nenabling it to process images of varying sizes and videos of extended durations\n(up to hours) with second-level event localization. This allows the model to\nnatively perceive spatial scales and temporal dynamics without relying on\ntraditional normalization techniques. By training a native dynamic-resolution\nVision Transformer (ViT) from scratch and incorporating Window Attention, we\nreduce computational overhead while maintaining native resolution. As a result,\nQwen2.5-VL excels not only in static image and document understanding but also\nas an interactive visual agent capable of reasoning, tool usage, and task\nexecution in real-world scenarios such as operating computers and mobile\ndevices. Qwen2.5-VL is available in three sizes, addressing diverse use cases\nfrom edge AI to high-performance computing. The flagship Qwen2.5-VL-72B model\nmatches state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, particularly\nexcelling in document and diagram understanding. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL\nmaintains robust linguistic performance, preserving the core language\ncompetencies of the Qwen2.5 LLM.",

Our approach begins with a voxel-based semantic\nsegmentation (SS) pretraining task, aimed at exploring the semantics and\ngeometry of incomplete regions while acquiring transferable meta-knowledge.\nUsing simulated cooperative perception datasets, we supervise the perception\ntraining of a single vehicle using aggregated sensor data from multiple nearby\nconnected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), generating richer and more comprehensive\nlabels. This meta-knowledge is then adapted to the target domain through a\ndual-phase training strategy that does not add extra model parameters, enabling\nefficient deployment. To further enhance the model's capability in capturing\nlong-sequence relationships within 3D voxel grids, we integrate Mamba blocks\nwith deformable convolution and large-kernel attention into the backbone\nnetwork.

In this paper, we propose and validate a\nmeasurement-based approach to analyze the power consumption of a virtualized 5G\ncore network (5GC) deployment. We design an experimental testbed using\ncommercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and open-source software as a sample\narchitecture simulating an edge computing node and supporting three different\nvirtualization options. We make use of both hardware-based and software-based\npower meters to investigate the power consumption trends associated with\nincreasing levels of traffic and multiple 5GC deployment types. The results\nshow the feasibility of a real-time power monitoring system and highlight how\ndeployment choices, such as virtualization framework and 5GC software, can\nsignificantly impact on the power consumption of the network.",

                    "value": "In light of the ever growing energy needs of the ICT sector, a value that is\nbecoming increasingly important for a mobile network is its power consumption.\nHowever, the transition away from legacy network deployments tightly coupled\nwith the underlying hardware and the adoption of the Network Function\nVirtualization (NFV) paradigm has made more difficult to accurately evaluate\ntheir energy and carbon footprint. In this paper, we propose and validate a\nmeasurement-based approach to analyze the power consumption of a virtualized 5G\ncore network (5GC) deployment. We design an experimental testbed using\ncommercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and open-source software as a sample\narchitecture simulating an edge computing node and supporting three different\nvirtualization options. We make use of both hardware-based and software-based\npower meters to investigate the power consumption trends associated with\nincreasing levels of traffic and multiple 5GC deployment types. The results\nshow the feasibility of a real-time power monitoring system and highlight how\ndeployment choices, such as virtualization framework and 5GC software, can\nsignificantly impact on the power consumption of the network."

                "summary": "Deployment of robots into hazardous environments typically involves a\n``Human-Robot Teaming'' (HRT) paradigm, in which a human supervisor interacts\nwith a remotely operating robot inside the hazardous zone. Situational\nAwareness (SA) is vital for enabling HRT, to support navigation, planning, and\ndecision-making. This paper explores issues of higher-level ``semantic''\ninformation and understanding in SA. In semi-autonomous, or variable-autonomy\nparadigms, different types of semantic information may be important, in\ndifferent ways, for both the human operator and an autonomous agent controlling\nthe robot. We propose a generalizable framework for acquiring and combining\nmultiple modalities of semantic-level SA during remote deployments of mobile\nrobots. We demonstrate the framework with an example application of search and\nrescue (SAR) in disaster response robotics. We propose a set of ``environment\nsemantic indicators\" that can reflect a variety of different types of semantic\ninformation, e.g. indicators of risk, or signs of human activity, as the robot\nencounters different scenes. Based on these indicators, we propose a metric to\ndescribe the overall situation of the environment called ``Situational Semantic\nRichness (SSR)\". This metric combines multiple semantic indicators to summarise\nthe overall situation. The SSR indicates if an information-rich and complex\nsituation has been encountered, which may require advanced reasoning for robots\nand humans and hence the attention of the expert human operator. The framework\nis tested on a Jackal robot in a mock-up disaster response environment.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed semantic indicators are\nsensitive to changes in different modalities of semantic information in\ndifferent scenes, and the SSR metric reflects overall semantic changes in the\nsituations encountered.",

To alleviate such interference, we investigate\na user association and coordinated beamforming (CBF) problem in CATN, where the\naerial network serves as the primary network sharing its spectrum with the\nterrestrial network. Specifically, we maximize the sum rate of the secondary\nterrestrial users (TUs) under the interference temperature constraints of the\nAUs.

Although deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) based schemes can address these challenges, their\nperformance is sensitive to the weights of the weighted penalty terms for\nviolating constraints in the reward function. Motivated by these issues, we\npropose a safe DRL-based user association and CBF scheme for CATN, eliminating\nthe need for training multiple times to find the optimal penalty weight before\nactual deployment. Specifically, the CATN is modeled as a networked constrained\npartially observable Markov game.

This task focuses on the\nability of a model to cross-lingually rank the true parallel sentence higher\nthan hard negatives generated by a large language model. We create four\ninstances of our introduced CLSD task for the language pair German-French\nwithin the domain of news. Within this case study, we find that models that are\nalso fine-tuned for retrieval tasks (e.g., multilingual E5) benefit from using\nEnglish as the pivot language, while bitext mining models such as LaBSE perform\nbest directly cross-lingually. We also show a fine-grained similarity analysis\nenabled by our distractor generation strategy, indicating that different\nembedding models are sensitive to different types of perturbations."

To address these\nlimitations and provide a more comprehensive evaluation, we introduce the\nMassive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB) - a large-scale,\ncommunity-driven expansion of MTEB, covering over 500 quality-controlled\nevaluation tasks across 250+ languages. MMTEB includes a diverse set of\nchallenging, novel tasks such as instruction following, long-document\nretrieval, and code retrieval, representing the largest multilingual collection\nof evaluation tasks for embedding models to date. Using this collection, we\ndevelop several highly multilingual benchmarks, which we use to evaluate a\nrepresentative set of models. We find that while large language models (LLMs)\nwith billions of parameters can achieve state-of-the-art performance on certain\nlanguage subsets and task categories, the best-performing publicly available\nmodel is multilingual-e5-large-instruct with only 560 million parameters. To\nfacilitate accessibility and reduce computational cost, we introduce a novel\ndownsampling method based on inter-task correlation, ensuring a diverse\nselection while preserving relative model rankings. Furthermore, we optimize\ntasks such as retrieval by sampling hard negatives, creating smaller but\neffective splits. These optimizations allow us to introduce benchmarks that\ndrastically reduce computational demands. For instance, our newly introduced\nzero-shot English benchmark maintains a ranking order similar to the full-scale\nversion but at a fraction of the computational cost.",

Extensive experiments on various graph learning tasks\nvalidate the effectiveness of our method over existing graph data augmentation\nmethods. Notably, our approach excels in scenarios involving electronic health\nrecords (EHRs), which validates its maximal utilization of contextual\nknowledge, leading to enhanced predictive performance and interpretability."
