In addition, we apply orthogonal transformations to\nattention heads without changing the model to increase similarity between\nattention heads before pruning training, in order to further improve\nperformance of the model. Our method can be compatible with rotary position\nembedding (RoPE), which means the model after training can be fully adapted to\nthe mainstream standard GQA framework.

As an\neffective approach for DiT acceleration, feature caching methods are designed\nto cache the features of DiT in previous timesteps and reuse them in the next\ntimesteps, allowing us to skip the computation in the next timesteps. However,\non the one hand, aggressively reusing all the features cached in previous\ntimesteps leads to a severe drop in generation quality. On the other hand,\nconservatively caching only the features in the redundant layers or tokens but\nstill computing the important ones successfully preserves the generation\nquality but results in reductions in acceleration ratios. Observing such a\ntradeoff between generation quality and acceleration performance, this paper\nbegins by quantitatively studying the accumulated error from cached features.\nSurprisingly, we find that aggressive caching does not introduce significantly\nmore caching errors in the caching step, and the conservative feature caching\ncan fix the error introduced by aggressive caching. Thereby, we propose a dual\ncaching strategy that adopts aggressive and conservative caching iteratively,\nleading to significant acceleration and high generation quality at the same\ntime. Besides, we further introduce a V-caching strategy for token-wise\nconservative caching, which is compatible with flash attention and requires no\ntraining and calibration data.\n  Our codes have been released in Github: \\textbf{Code:\n\\href{https://github.com/Shenyi-Z/DuCa}{\\texttt{\\textcolor{cyan}{https://github.com/Shenyi-Z/DuCa}}}}",

In this paper, we\ndemonstrate that transforming a memory access pattern consisting of a single\nstride to one that concurrently accesses multiple strides, can boost the\nutilization of the hardware prefetcher, and in turn improves the performance of\nmemory-bound kernels significantly. Using a set of micro-benchmarks, we\nestablish that accessing memory in a multi-strided manner enables more cache\nlines to be concurrently brought into the cache, resulting in improved cache\nhit ratios and higher effective memory bandwidth without the introduction of\ncostly software prefetch instructions. Subsequently, we show that multi-strided\nvariants of a collection of six memory-bound dense compute kernels outperform\nstate-of-the-art counterparts on three different micro-architectures. More\nspecifically, for kernels among which Matrix Vector Multiplication, Convolution\nStencil and kernels from PolyBench, we achieve significant speedups of up to\n12.55x over Polly, 2.99x over MKL, 1.98x over OpenBLAS, 1.08x over Halide and\n1.87x over OpenCV. The code transformation to take advantage of multi-strided\nmemory access is a natural extension of the loop unroll and loop interchange\ntechniques, allowing this method to be incorporated into compiler pipelines in\nthe future.",

In this paper, we\ndemonstrate that transforming a memory access pattern consisting of a single\nstride to one that concurrently accesses multiple strides, can boost the\nutilization of the hardware prefetcher, and in turn improves the performance of\nmemory-bound kernels significantly. Using a set of micro-benchmarks, we\nestablish that accessing memory in a multi-strided manner enables more cache\nlines to be concurrently brought into the cache, resulting in improved cache\nhit ratios and higher effective memory bandwidth without the introduction of\ncostly software prefetch instructions. Subsequently, we show that multi-strided\nvariants of a collection of six memory-bound dense compute kernels outperform\nstate-of-the-art counterparts on three different micro-architectures. More\nspecifically, for kernels among which Matrix Vector Multiplication, Convolution\nStencil and kernels from PolyBench, we achieve significant speedups of up to\n12.55x over Polly, 2.99x over MKL, 1.98x over OpenBLAS, 1.08x over Halide and\n1.87x over OpenCV. The code transformation to take advantage of multi-strided\nmemory access is a natural extension of the loop unroll and loop interchange\ntechniques, allowing this method to be incorporated into compiler pipelines in\nthe future."

To\ntackle this problem, we propose ResQ, a PTQ method that pushes further the\nstate-of-the-art.

We empirically observe that,\nunlike single image inputs, VLLMs typically attend visual tokens from different\nframes at different decoding iterations, making a one-shot pruning strategy\nprone to removing important tokens by mistake. Motivated by this, we present\nDyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token\nrepresentation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play\ntemporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging\nredundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune\nspatially redundant tokens selectively. It ensures high-quality inference by\ndynamically retaining the critical tokens at each decoding step. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that DyCoke can outperform the prior SoTA\ncounterparts, achieving 1.5X inference speedup, 1.4X memory reduction against\nthe baseline VLLM, while still improving the performance, with no training.",

                    "value": "Video large language models (VLLMs) have significantly advanced recently in\nprocessing complex video content, yet their inference efficiency remains\nconstrained because of the high computational cost stemming from the thousands\nof visual tokens generated from the video inputs. We empirically observe that,\nunlike single image inputs, VLLMs typically attend visual tokens from different\nframes at different decoding iterations, making a one-shot pruning strategy\nprone to removing important tokens by mistake. Motivated by this, we present\nDyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token\nrepresentation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play\ntemporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging\nredundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune\nspatially redundant tokens selectively. It ensures high-quality inference by\ndynamically retaining the critical tokens at each decoding step. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that DyCoke can outperform the prior SoTA\ncounterparts, achieving 1.5X inference speedup, 1.4X memory reduction against\nthe baseline VLLM, while still improving the performance, with no training."

In addition,\nVivar leverages latent reuse and caching strategies to accelerate 2D and AR\ncontent generation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our system\nachieves 11$\\times$ latency reduction without compromising quality.

The dynamic arrival and departure of connection requests in\noptical networks result in particular central links experiencing more traffic\nand congestion than non-central links. The occurrence of congested links leads\nto service blocking despite the availability of resources within the network,\nrestricting the efficient utilization of network resources. The available\nalgorithms in the literature that aim to balance load among network links offer\na trade-off between blocking performance and algorithmic complexity, thus\nincreasing service provisioning time. This work proposes a dynamic\nrouting-based congestion-aware routing, modulation, core, and spectrum\nassignment (RMCSA) algorithm for space division multiplexing elastic optical\nnetworks (SDM-EONs). The algorithm finds alternative candidate paths based on\nreal-time link occupancy metrics to minimize blocking due to link congestion\nunder dynamic traffic scenarios. As a result, the algorithm reduces the\nformation of congestion hotspots in the network owing to link-betweenness\ncentrality. We have performed extensive simulations using two realistic network\ntopologies to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with relevant\nRMCSA algorithms available in the literature. The simulation results verify the\nsuperior performance of our proposed algorithm compared to the benchmark Yen's\nK-shortest paths and K-Disjoint shortest paths RMCSA algorithms in connection\nblocking ratio and spectrum utilization efficiency. To expedite the\nroute-finding process, we present a novel caching strategy that allows the\nproposed algorithm to demonstrate a much-reduced service delay time compared to\nthe recently developed adaptive link weight-based load-balancing RMCSA\nalgorithm.",

                "summary": "Deploying local AI models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), to edge\ndevices can substantially enhance devices' independent capabilities, alleviate\nthe server's burden, and lower the response time. Owing to these tremendous\npotentials, many big tech companies have released several lightweight Small\nLanguage Models (SLMs) to bridge this gap. However, we still have huge\nmotivations to deploy more powerful (LLMs) AI models on edge devices and\nenhance their smartness level. Unlike the conventional approaches for AI model\ncompression, we investigate activation sparsity. The activation sparsity method\nis orthogonal and combinable with existing techniques to maximize compression\nrate while maintaining great accuracy. LLMs' Feed-Forward Network (FFN)\ncomponents, which typically comprise a large proportion of parameters (around\n3/2), ensure that our FFN optimizations would have a better chance of achieving\neffective compression. Moreover, our findings are beneficial to general LLMs\nand are not restricted to ReLU-based models. This work systematically\ninvestigates the tradeoff between enforcing activation sparsity and perplexity\n(accuracy) on state-of-the-art LLMs. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that\nwe can obtain around 50% of main memory and computing reductions for critical\nFFN components with negligible accuracy degradation. This extra 50% sparsity\ndoes not naturally exist in the current LLMs, which require tuning LLMs'\nactivation outputs by injecting zero-enforcing thresholds.

                    "value": "Deploying local AI models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), to edge\ndevices can substantially enhance devices' independent capabilities, alleviate\nthe server's burden, and lower the response time. Owing to these tremendous\npotentials, many big tech companies have released several lightweight Small\nLanguage Models (SLMs) to bridge this gap. However, we still have huge\nmotivations to deploy more powerful (LLMs) AI models on edge devices and\nenhance their smartness level. Unlike the conventional approaches for AI model\ncompression, we investigate activation sparsity. The activation sparsity method\nis orthogonal and combinable with existing techniques to maximize compression\nrate while maintaining great accuracy. LLMs' Feed-Forward Network (FFN)\ncomponents, which typically comprise a large proportion of parameters (around\n3/2), ensure that our FFN optimizations would have a better chance of achieving\neffective compression. Moreover, our findings are beneficial to general LLMs\nand are not restricted to ReLU-based models. This work systematically\ninvestigates the tradeoff between enforcing activation sparsity and perplexity\n(accuracy) on state-of-the-art LLMs. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that\nwe can obtain around 50% of main memory and computing reductions for critical\nFFN components with negligible accuracy degradation. This extra 50% sparsity\ndoes not naturally exist in the current LLMs, which require tuning LLMs'\nactivation outputs by injecting zero-enforcing thresholds. To obtain the\nbenefits of activation sparsity, we provide a guideline for the system\narchitect for LLM prediction and prefetching. The success prediction allows the\nsystem to prefetch the necessary weights while omitting the inactive ones and\ntheir successors, therefore lowering cache and memory pollution and reducing\nLLM execution time on resource-constrained edge devices."

The\neffectiveness of a key-value cache relies on its ability of accommodating the\nneeded data. However, expanding the cache capacity is often more difficult than\ncommonly expected because of many practical constraints, such as server costs,\ncooling issues, rack space, and even human resource expenses. A potential\nsolution is compression, which virtually extends the cache capacity by\ncondensing data in cache. In practice, this seemingly simple idea has not\ngained much traction in key-value cache system design, due to several critical\nissues: the compression-unfriendly index structure, severe read/write\namplification, wasteful decompression operations, and heavy computing cost.\nThis paper presents a hybrid DRAM-SSD cache design to realize a systematic\nintegration of data compression in key-value cache. By treating compression as\nan essential component, we have redesigned the indexing structure, data\nmanagement, and leveraged the emerging computational SSD hardware for\ncollaborative optimizations.

Consequently, the tailored prompts often fail to discern\nclass-specific visual concepts, thereby hindering the transferred performance\nfor classes that share similar or complex visual attributes. Recent advances\nmitigate this challenge by leveraging external knowledge from Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to furnish class descriptions, yet incurring notable inference\ncosts. In this paper, we introduce TextRefiner, a plug-and-play method to\nrefine the text prompts of existing methods by leveraging the internal\nknowledge of VLMs. Particularly, TextRefiner builds a novel local cache module\nto encapsulate fine-grained visual concepts derivedfrom local tokens within the\nimage branch. By aggregating and aligning the cached visual descriptions with\nthe original output of the text branch, TextRefiner can efficiently refine and\nenrich the learned prompts from existing methods without relying on any\nexternal expertise. For example, it improves the performance of CoOp from 71.66\n% to 76.94 % on 11 benchmarks, surpassing CoCoOp which introduces instance-wise\nfeatures for text prompts.

Our method is based on the\nnotion of modulating per-class prototypes in the shared embedding space. By\npre-computing and caching prototypes generated with the pre-trained text\nencoder, TPS not only facilitates optimization-free prototype reuse for\nsubsequent predictions but also enables seamless integration with current\nadvancements in prompt engineering. At test-time, TPS dynamically learns shift\nvectors for each prototype based solely on the given test sample, effectively\nbridging the domain gap and enhancing classification accuracy. A notable aspect\nof our framework is its significantly reduced memory and computational demands\nwhen compared to conventional text-prompt tuning methods. Extensive evaluations\nacross 15 image classification datasets involving natural distribution shifts\nand cross-dataset generalization, as well as in context-dependent visual\nreasoning, demonstrate TPS's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art\nresults while reducing resource requirements.",

In this work, we propose Video-XL, a\nnovel approach that leverages MLLMs' inherent key-value (KV) sparsification\ncapacity to condense the visual input.

Composite data curation,\nwhich integrates single-image, multi-image, and synthetic data to overcome the\nscarcity of long-video instruction data. The compression quality is further\nimproved by dynamic compression, which customizes compression granularity based\non the information density of different video intervals. Video-XL's\neffectiveness is verified from three aspects. First, it achieves a superior\nlong-video understanding capability, outperforming state-of-the-art models of\ncomparable sizes across multiple popular benchmarks.

In this paper, we consider such an MoA architecture in a distributed\nsetting, where LLMs operate on individual edge devices, each uniquely\nassociated with a user and equipped with its own distributed computing power.\nThese devices exchange information using decentralized gossip algorithms,\nallowing different device nodes to talk without the supervision of a\ncentralized server.

Given the memory limitations of edge\ndevices, it is crucial to ensure that the average queue sizes in the system\nremain bounded.

These\nmodels employ extended chain-of-thought (CoT) processes, exploring multiple\nstrategies to enhance problem-solving capabilities.

To simulate LLMs' long thought ability in\nMT, we first mine sentences containing similes or metaphors from existing\nliterature books, and then develop a multi-agent framework to translate these\nsentences via long thought.

A key challenge in aligning TTA models\nlies in the difficulty of creating preference pairs, as TTA lacks structured\nmechanisms like verifiable rewards or gold-standard answers available for Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs). To address this, we propose CLAP-Ranked Preference\nOptimization (CRPO), a novel framework that iteratively generates and optimizes\npreference data to enhance TTA alignment. We demonstrate that the audio\npreference dataset generated using CRPO outperforms existing alternatives. With\nthis framework, TangoFlux achieves state-of-the-art performance across both\nobjective and subjective benchmarks.

On the other hand, the\nrecent biological studies revealed that there are nonlinearities in the TD\nerror and the degree of updates, biasing policies optimistic or pessimistic.\nSuch biases in learning due to nonlinearities are expected to be useful and\nintentionally leftover features in biological learning. Therefore, this\nresearch explores a theoretical framework that can leverage the nonlinearity\nbetween the degree of the update and TD errors. To this end, we focus on a\ncontrol as inference framework, since it is known as a generalized formulation\nencompassing various RL and optimal control methods.

To address these challenges, we propose Knowledge graph Assisted\nReasoning Path Aggregation (KARPA), a novel framework that harnesses the global\nplanning abilities of LLMs for efficient and accurate KG reasoning. KARPA\noperates in three steps: pre-planning relation paths using the LLM's global\nplanning capabilities, matching semantically relevant paths via an embedding\nmodel, and reasoning over these paths to generate answers. Unlike existing KGQA\nmethods, KARPA avoids stepwise traversal, requires no additional training, and\nis adaptable to various LLM architectures. Extensive experimental results show\nthat KARPA achieves state-of-the-art performance in KGQA tasks, delivering both\nhigh efficiency and accuracy. Our code will be available on Github.",

While\nsuch tools are routinely used to simulate whole-body hemodynamics from\nphysiological parameters, solving the corresponding inverse problem of mapping\nwaveforms back to plausible physiological parameters remains both promising and\nchallenging. Motivated by advances in simulation-based inference (SBI), we cast\nthis inverse problem as statistical inference. In contrast to alternative\napproaches, SBI provides \\textit{posterior distributions} for the parameters of\ninterest, providing a \\textit{multi-dimensional} representation of uncertainty\nfor \\textit{individual} measurements. We showcase this ability by performing an\nin-silico uncertainty analysis of five biomarkers of clinical interest\ncomparing several measurement modalities. Beyond the corroboration of known\nfacts, such as the feasibility of estimating heart rate, our study highlights\nthe potential of estimating new biomarkers from standard-of-care measurements.\nSBI reveals practically relevant findings that cannot be captured by standard\nsensitivity analyses, such as the existence of sub-populations for which\nparameter estimation exhibits distinct uncertainty regimes. Finally, we study\nthe gap between in-vivo and in-silico with the MIMIC-III waveform database and\ncritically discuss how cardiovascular simulations can inform real-world data\nanalysis.",

Motivated by advances in simulation-based inference (SBI), we cast\nthis inverse problem as statistical inference. In contrast to alternative\napproaches, SBI provides \\textit{posterior distributions} for the parameters of\ninterest, providing a \\textit{multi-dimensional} representation of uncertainty\nfor \\textit{individual} measurements. We showcase this ability by performing an\nin-silico uncertainty analysis of five biomarkers of clinical interest\ncomparing several measurement modalities. Beyond the corroboration of known\nfacts, such as the feasibility of estimating heart rate, our study highlights\nthe potential of estimating new biomarkers from standard-of-care measurements.\nSBI reveals practically relevant findings that cannot be captured by standard\nsensitivity analyses, such as the existence of sub-populations for which\nparameter estimation exhibits distinct uncertainty regimes. Finally, we study\nthe gap between in-vivo and in-silico with the MIMIC-III waveform database and\ncritically discuss how cardiovascular simulations can inform real-world data\nanalysis."

The goal of alignment is to finetune a reference\nmodel such that the win rate of a sample from the aligned model over a sample\nfrom the reference model is high, subject to a KL divergence constraint. Today,\nwe are increasingly using inference-time algorithms (e.g., Best-of-N,\ncontrolled decoding, tree search) to decode from language models rather than\nstandard sampling. However, the alignment objective does not capture such\ninference-time decoding procedures. We show that the existing alignment\nframework is sub-optimal in view of such inference-time methods. We then modify\nthe alignment objective and propose a framework for inference-aware alignment\n(IAPO). We prove that for any inference-time decoding algorithm, the optimal\nsolution that optimizes the inference-time win rate of the aligned policy\nagainst the reference policy is the solution to the typical RLHF problem with a\ntransformation of the reward. This motivates us to provide the KL-regularized\ncalibrate-and-transform RL (CTRL) algorithm to solve this problem, which\ninvolves a reward calibration step and a KL-regularized reward maximization\nstep with a transformation of the calibrated reward. We particularize our study\nto two important inference-time strategies: best-of-N sampling and best-of-N\njailbreaking, where N responses are sampled from the model and the one with the\nhighest or lowest reward is selected. We propose specific transformations for\nthese strategies and demonstrate that our framework offers significant\nimprovements over existing state-of-the-art methods for language model\nalignment.

In this work, we introduce a new task of Synchronized\nVideo Storytelling, which aims to generate synchronous and informative\nnarrations for videos. These narrations, associated with each video clip,\nshould relate to the visual content, integrate relevant knowledge, and have an\nappropriate word count corresponding to the clip's duration. Specifically, a\nstructured storyline is beneficial to guide the generation process, ensuring\ncoherence and integrity. To support the exploration of this task, we introduce\na new benchmark dataset E-SyncVidStory with rich annotations. Since existing\nMultimodal LLMs are not effective in addressing this task in one-shot or\nfew-shot settings, we propose a framework named VideoNarrator that can generate\na storyline for input videos and simultaneously generate narrations with the\nguidance of the generated or predefined storyline.

However, in many applications it is common\npractice to include other covariates to account for differences in persistence\nlevels between groups defined by the values of these covariates. In these\ninstances the resulting coefficients can be difficult to interpret. We propose\nthe conditional rank-rank regression, which uses conditional ranks instead of\nunconditional ranks, to measure average within-group income persistence.

An empirical\nstudy on intergenerational income mobility in Switzerland demonstrates the\nadvantages of this approach. The study reveals stronger intergenerational\npersistence between fathers and sons compared to fathers and daughters, with\nthe within-group persistence explaining 62% of the overall income persistence\nfor sons and 52% for daughters.

The strategy for constructing positive and negative\nsample pairs significantly affects the final representation quality. However,\ndue to the continuous nature of time series semantics, the modeling approach of\ncontrastive learning struggles to accommodate the characteristics of time\nseries data. This results in issues such as difficulties in constructing hard\nnegative samples and the potential introduction of inappropriate biases during\npositive sample construction. Although some recent works have developed several\nscientific strategies for constructing positive and negative sample pairs with\nimproved effectiveness, they remain constrained by the contrastive learning\nframework. To fundamentally overcome the limitations of contrastive learning,\nthis paper introduces Frequency-masked Embedding Inference (FEI), a novel\nnon-contrastive method that completely eliminates the need for positive and\nnegative samples. The proposed FEI constructs 2 inference branches based on a\nprompting strategy: 1) Using frequency masking as prompts to infer the\nembedding representation of the target series with missing frequency bands in\nthe embedding space, and 2) Using the target series as prompts to infer its\nfrequency masking embedding. In this way, FEI enables continuous semantic\nrelationship modeling for time series. Experiments on 8 widely used time series\ndatasets for classification and regression tasks, using linear evaluation and\nend-to-end fine-tuning, show that FEI significantly outperforms existing\ncontrastive-based methods in terms of generalization.

Generative linguistic\nsteganography leverages the probability distribution of language models (LMs)\nand applies steganographic algorithms to generate stego tokens, gaining\nattention with recent Large Language Model (LLM) advancements. To enhance\nsecurity, researchers develop distribution-preserving stego algorithms to\nminimize the gap between stego sampling and LM sampling. However, the reliance\non language model distributions, coupled with deviations from real-world cover\ntexts, results in insufficient imperceptibility when facing steganalysis\ndetectors in real-world scenarios. Moreover, LLM distributions tend to be more\ndeterministic, resulting in reduced entropy and, consequently, lower embedding\ncapacity. In this paper, we propose FreStega, a plug-and-play method to\nreconstruct the distribution of language models used for generative linguistic\nsteganography. FreStega dynamically adjusts token probabilities from the\nlanguage model at each step of stegotext auto-regressive generation, leveraging\nboth sequential and spatial dimensions.

In the spatial\ndimension, the distribution is aligned with guidance from the target domain\ncorpus, closely mimicking real cover text in the target domain. By reforming\nthe distribution, FreStega enhances the imperceptibility of stego text in\npractical scenarios and improves steganographic capacity by 15.41\\%, all\nwithout compromising the quality of the generated text.

This approach typically relies on an internal\nretrieval module that uses various indexing mechanisms to manage a static\npre-processed corpus. However, such a paradigm often falls short when it is\nnecessary to integrate the most up-to-date information that has not been\nupdated into the corpus during generative inference time. In this paper, we\nexplore an alternative approach that leverages standard search engine APIs to\ndynamically integrate the latest online information (without maintaining any\nindex for any fixed corpus), thereby improving the quality of generated\ncontent. We design a collaborative LLM-based paradigm, where we include: (i) a\nparser-LLM that determines if the Internet augmented generation is demanded and\nextracts the search keywords if so with a single inference; (ii) a mixed\nranking strategy that re-ranks the retrieved HTML files to eliminate bias\nintroduced from the search engine API; and (iii) an extractor-LLM that can\naccurately and efficiently extract relevant information from the fresh content\nin each HTML file. We conduct extensive empirical studies to evaluate the\nperformance of this Internet search augmented generation paradigm. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that our method generates content with\nsignificantly improved quality. Our system has been successfully deployed in a\nproduction environment to serve 01.AI's generative inference requests.",

However, such a paradigm often falls short when it is\nnecessary to integrate the most up-to-date information that has not been\nupdated into the corpus during generative inference time. In this paper, we\nexplore an alternative approach that leverages standard search engine APIs to\ndynamically integrate the latest online information (without maintaining any\nindex for any fixed corpus), thereby improving the quality of generated\ncontent. We design a collaborative LLM-based paradigm, where we include: (i) a\nparser-LLM that determines if the Internet augmented generation is demanded and\nextracts the search keywords if so with a single inference; (ii) a mixed\nranking strategy that re-ranks the retrieved HTML files to eliminate bias\nintroduced from the search engine API; and (iii) an extractor-LLM that can\naccurately and efficiently extract relevant information from the fresh content\nin each HTML file. We conduct extensive empirical studies to evaluate the\nperformance of this Internet search augmented generation paradigm. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that our method generates content with\nsignificantly improved quality. Our system has been successfully deployed in a\nproduction environment to serve 01.AI's generative inference requests."

The similarities in the properties of G351.77 and the recently\npublished work in G353.41 indicate that many of the physical conditions\ninferred via the ALMA-IMF N$_2$H$^+$ observations may be generic to\nprotoclusters."

However, the next token prediction training objective of\ndecoder-only LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) is misaligned with the masked span prediction\nobjective of current infilling-style methods, which impedes LLMs from fully\nleveraging pre-trained knowledge for program repair. In addition, while some\nLLMs can locate and repair bugs in certain functions using the related\nartifacts (e.g., test cases), existing methods still depend on statement-level\nfault localization methods to provide a list of buggy hunks for repair. This\nrestriction hinders LLMs from exploring potential patches beyond the given\nlocations.\n  In this paper, we investigate a new approach to adapt LLMs to program repair.\nOur core insight is that LLM's APR capability can be greatly improved by simply\naligning the output to their training objective and allowing them to refine the\nwhole program without first identifying faulty statements. Based on this\ninsight, we designed D4C, a straightforward prompting framework for APR. D4C\ncan repair 180 bugs correctly in Defects4J, with each patch being sampled only\n10 times. This surpasses the SOTA APR methods with perfect fault localization\nby 10% and reduces the patch sampling number by 90%. Our findings reveal that\n(1) objective alignment is crucial for fully exploiting LLM's pre-trained\ncapability, and (2) replacing the traditional localize-buggy-hunks-then-repair\nworkflow with direct debugging is more effective for LLM-based APR methods.\nThus, we believe this paper introduces a new mindset for harnessing LLMs in\nAPR.",

However, the extensive pre-training\ncorpora used by LLMs raise concerns that they may rely on memorizing popular\nfictional works rather than genuinely understanding and reasoning about them.\nIn this work, we argue that 'gist memory'-capturing essential meaning - should\nbe the primary mechanism for character understanding tasks, as opposed to\n'verbatim memory' - exact match of a string. We introduce a simple yet\neffective method to mitigate mechanized memorization in character understanding\nevaluations while preserving the essential implicit cues needed for\ncomprehension and reasoning. Our approach reduces memorization-driven\nperformance on popular fictional works from 96% accuracy to 72% and results in\nup to an 18% drop in accuracy across various character understanding tasks.\nThese findings underscore the issue of data contamination in existing\nbenchmarks, which often measure memorization rather than true character\nunderstanding.",

However, the extensive pre-training\ncorpora used by LLMs raise concerns that they may rely on memorizing popular\nfictional works rather than genuinely understanding and reasoning about them.\nIn this work, we argue that 'gist memory'-capturing essential meaning - should\nbe the primary mechanism for character understanding tasks, as opposed to\n'verbatim memory' - exact match of a string. We introduce a simple yet\neffective method to mitigate mechanized memorization in character understanding\nevaluations while preserving the essential implicit cues needed for\ncomprehension and reasoning. Our approach reduces memorization-driven\nperformance on popular fictional works from 96% accuracy to 72% and results in\nup to an 18% drop in accuracy across various character understanding tasks.\nThese findings underscore the issue of data contamination in existing\nbenchmarks, which often measure memorization rather than true character\nunderstanding."

However, as the model size and the input\nsequence's length increase, the rapid increase of KV Cache significantly slows\ndown inference speed. Therefore GQA model, as an alternative to MHA model, has\nbeen widely introduced into LLMs. In this work, we propose a low-cost method\nfor pruning MHA models into GQA models with any compression ratio of key-value\nheads. Our method is based on $\\mathit{L_0}$ masks to gradually remove\nredundant parameters. In addition, we apply orthogonal transformations to\nattention heads without changing the model to increase similarity between\nattention heads before pruning training, in order to further improve\nperformance of the model. Our method can be compatible with rotary position\nembedding (RoPE), which means the model after training can be fully adapted to\nthe mainstream standard GQA framework. Experiments demonstrate that our\nstrategy can compress up to 87.5% of key-value heads of the LLaMA2-7B model\nwithout too much performance degradation, just achieved through supervised\nfine-tuning.",

Drawing inspiration from these findings, we propose the\nNeighbor-Guided Toolchain Reasoner (NGTR) framework, which is characterized by\nintegrating multiple lightweight models for low-level visual processing\noperations aimed at mitigating issues with low-quality input images.\nSpecifically, we utilize a neighbor retrieval mechanism to guide the generation\nof multiple tool invocation plans, transferring tool selection experiences from\nsimilar neighbors to the given input, thereby facilitating suitable tool\nselection. Additionally, we introduce a reflection module to supervise the tool\ninvocation process. Extensive experiments on public table recognition datasets\ndemonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the recognition\ncapabilities of the vanilla VLLMs. We believe that the designed benchmark and\nthe proposed NGTR framework could provide an alternative solution in table\nrecognition.",

                "summary": "Diversity is a critical aspect of multi-agent communication. In this paper,\nwe focus on controlling and exploring diversity in the context of open-domain\nmulti-agent conversations, particularly for world simulation applications. We\npropose Adaptive Prompt Pruning (APP), a novel method that dynamically adjusts\nthe content of the utterance generation prompt to control diversity using a\nsingle parameter, lambda. Through extensive experiments, we show that APP\neffectively controls the output diversity across models and datasets, with\npruning more information leading to more diverse output. We comprehensively\nanalyze the relationship between prompt content and conversational diversity.\nOur findings reveal that information from all components of the prompt\ngenerally constrains the diversity of the output, with the Memory block\nexerting the most significant influence. APP is compatible with established\ntechniques like temperature sampling and top-p sampling, providing a versatile\ntool for diversity management. To address the trade-offs of increased\ndiversity, such as inconsistencies with omitted information, we incorporate a\npost-generation correction step, which effectively balances diversity\nenhancement with output consistency. Additionally, we examine how prompt\nstructure, including component order and length, impacts diversity. This study\naddresses key questions surrounding diversity in multi-agent world simulation,\noffering insights into its control, influencing factors, and associated\ntrade-offs. Our contributions lay the foundation for systematically engineering\ndiversity in LLM-based multi-agent collaborations, advancing their\neffectiveness in real-world applications.",

                    "value": "Diversity is a critical aspect of multi-agent communication. In this paper,\nwe focus on controlling and exploring diversity in the context of open-domain\nmulti-agent conversations, particularly for world simulation applications. We\npropose Adaptive Prompt Pruning (APP), a novel method that dynamically adjusts\nthe content of the utterance generation prompt to control diversity using a\nsingle parameter, lambda. Through extensive experiments, we show that APP\neffectively controls the output diversity across models and datasets, with\npruning more information leading to more diverse output. We comprehensively\nanalyze the relationship between prompt content and conversational diversity.\nOur findings reveal that information from all components of the prompt\ngenerally constrains the diversity of the output, with the Memory block\nexerting the most significant influence. APP is compatible with established\ntechniques like temperature sampling and top-p sampling, providing a versatile\ntool for diversity management. To address the trade-offs of increased\ndiversity, such as inconsistencies with omitted information, we incorporate a\npost-generation correction step, which effectively balances diversity\nenhancement with output consistency. Additionally, we examine how prompt\nstructure, including component order and length, impacts diversity. This study\naddresses key questions surrounding diversity in multi-agent world simulation,\noffering insights into its control, influencing factors, and associated\ntrade-offs. Our contributions lay the foundation for systematically engineering\ndiversity in LLM-based multi-agent collaborations, advancing their\neffectiveness in real-world applications."

To simulate LLMs' long thought ability in\nMT, we first mine sentences containing similes or metaphors from existing\nliterature books, and then develop a multi-agent framework to translate these\nsentences via long thought.

To address this, we propose CLAP-Ranked Preference\nOptimization (CRPO), a novel framework that iteratively generates and optimizes\npreference data to enhance TTA alignment. We demonstrate that the audio\npreference dataset generated using CRPO outperforms existing alternatives. With\nthis framework, TangoFlux achieves state-of-the-art performance across both\nobjective and subjective benchmarks.

                "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance across a\nvariety of tasks, yet they are often affected by hallucinations and the\ntimeliness of knowledge. Leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) as external\nknowledge sources has emerged as a viable solution, but existing methods for\nLLM-based knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) are often limited by\nstep-by-step decision-making on KGs, restricting the global planning and\nreasoning capabilities of LLMs, or they require fine-tuning or pre-training on\nspecific KGs. To address these challenges, we propose Knowledge graph Assisted\nReasoning Path Aggregation (KARPA), a novel framework that harnesses the global\nplanning abilities of LLMs for efficient and accurate KG reasoning. KARPA\noperates in three steps: pre-planning relation paths using the LLM's global\nplanning capabilities, matching semantically relevant paths via an embedding\nmodel, and reasoning over these paths to generate answers.

                    "value": "Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance across a\nvariety of tasks, yet they are often affected by hallucinations and the\ntimeliness of knowledge. Leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) as external\nknowledge sources has emerged as a viable solution, but existing methods for\nLLM-based knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) are often limited by\nstep-by-step decision-making on KGs, restricting the global planning and\nreasoning capabilities of LLMs, or they require fine-tuning or pre-training on\nspecific KGs. To address these challenges, we propose Knowledge graph Assisted\nReasoning Path Aggregation (KARPA), a novel framework that harnesses the global\nplanning abilities of LLMs for efficient and accurate KG reasoning. KARPA\noperates in three steps: pre-planning relation paths using the LLM's global\nplanning capabilities, matching semantically relevant paths via an embedding\nmodel, and reasoning over these paths to generate answers. Unlike existing KGQA\nmethods, KARPA avoids stepwise traversal, requires no additional training, and\nis adaptable to various LLM architectures. Extensive experimental results show\nthat KARPA achieves state-of-the-art performance in KGQA tasks, delivering both\nhigh efficiency and accuracy. Our code will be available on Github."

                "summary": "Customized processors are attractive solutions for vast domain-specific\napplications due to their high energy efficiency. However, designing a\nprocessor in traditional flows is time-consuming and expensive. To address\nthis, researchers have explored methods including the use of agile development\ntools like Chisel or SpinalHDL, high-level synthesis (HLS) from programming\nlanguages like C or SystemC, and more recently, leveraging large language\nmodels (LLMs) to generate hardware description language (HDL) code from natural\nlanguage descriptions. However, each method has limitations in terms of\nexpressiveness, correctness, and performance, leading to a persistent\ncontradiction between the level of automation and the effectiveness of the\ndesign. Overall, how to automatically design highly efficient and practical\nprocessors with minimal human effort remains a challenge.\n  In this paper, we propose AGON, a novel framework designed to leverage LLMs\nfor the efficient design of out-of-order (OoO) customized processors with\nminimal human effort.

                    "value": "Customized processors are attractive solutions for vast domain-specific\napplications due to their high energy efficiency. However, designing a\nprocessor in traditional flows is time-consuming and expensive. To address\nthis, researchers have explored methods including the use of agile development\ntools like Chisel or SpinalHDL, high-level synthesis (HLS) from programming\nlanguages like C or SystemC, and more recently, leveraging large language\nmodels (LLMs) to generate hardware description language (HDL) code from natural\nlanguage descriptions. However, each method has limitations in terms of\nexpressiveness, correctness, and performance, leading to a persistent\ncontradiction between the level of automation and the effectiveness of the\ndesign. Overall, how to automatically design highly efficient and practical\nprocessors with minimal human effort remains a challenge.\n  In this paper, we propose AGON, a novel framework designed to leverage LLMs\nfor the efficient design of out-of-order (OoO) customized processors with\nminimal human effort.

Our framework improves the MLLM's capacity to\nhandle tasks requiring precise visual descriptions, especially in scenarios\nwith challenging perspectives, such as aerial views or scenes with dense object\narrangements. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on the VG-150 dataset\nthat focuses on first-person visual understanding and the AUG dataset that\ninvolves aerial imagery.

These MoD models utilize a routing\nmechanism to determine which tokens should be processed by a layer, or skipped.\nHowever, conventional MoD models employ additional network layers specifically\nfor the routing which are difficult to train, and add complexity and deployment\noverhead to the model. In this paper, we introduce a novel attention-based\nrouting mechanism A-MoD that leverages the existing attention map of the\npreceding layer for routing decisions within the current layer. Compared to\nstandard routing, A-MoD allows for more efficient training as it introduces no\nadditional trainable parameters and can be easily adapted from pretrained\ntransformer models. Furthermore, it can increase the performance of the MoD\nmodel. For instance, we observe up to 2% higher accuracy on ImageNet compared\nto standard routing and isoFLOP ViT baselines. Furthermore, A-MoD improves the\nMoD training convergence, leading to up to 2x faster transfer learning.",

Previous studies on dense video\ncaptioning and video story generation have made some progress. However, in\npractical applications, we typically require synchronized narrations for\nongoing visual scenes. In this work, we introduce a new task of Synchronized\nVideo Storytelling, which aims to generate synchronous and informative\nnarrations for videos. These narrations, associated with each video clip,\nshould relate to the visual content, integrate relevant knowledge, and have an\nappropriate word count corresponding to the clip's duration. Specifically, a\nstructured storyline is beneficial to guide the generation process, ensuring\ncoherence and integrity. To support the exploration of this task, we introduce\na new benchmark dataset E-SyncVidStory with rich annotations. Since existing\nMultimodal LLMs are not effective in addressing this task in one-shot or\nfew-shot settings, we propose a framework named VideoNarrator that can generate\na storyline for input videos and simultaneously generate narrations with the\nguidance of the generated or predefined storyline. We further introduce a set\nof evaluation metrics to thoroughly assess the generation. Both automatic and\nhuman evaluations validate the effectiveness of our approach.

For the second challenge, we design a validation\nmechanism to ensure that human instructions result in safe and consistent\ndriving behavior. Experiments conducted on both simulators and a real-world\nautonomous vehicle demonstrate that Autoware$.$Flex effectively interprets\nhuman instructions and executes them safely."

This approach typically relies on an internal\nretrieval module that uses various indexing mechanisms to manage a static\npre-processed corpus. However, such a paradigm often falls short when it is\nnecessary to integrate the most up-to-date information that has not been\nupdated into the corpus during generative inference time. In this paper, we\nexplore an alternative approach that leverages standard search engine APIs to\ndynamically integrate the latest online information (without maintaining any\nindex for any fixed corpus), thereby improving the quality of generated\ncontent. We design a collaborative LLM-based paradigm, where we include: (i) a\nparser-LLM that determines if the Internet augmented generation is demanded and\nextracts the search keywords if so with a single inference; (ii) a mixed\nranking strategy that re-ranks the retrieved HTML files to eliminate bias\nintroduced from the search engine API; and (iii) an extractor-LLM that can\naccurately and efficiently extract relevant information from the fresh content\nin each HTML file. We conduct extensive empirical studies to evaluate the\nperformance of this Internet search augmented generation paradigm. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that our method generates content with\nsignificantly improved quality.

As these models increasingly\nintegrate into our daily life, it is necessary to conduct moral evaluation to\nensure that their outputs align with human values and remain within moral\nboundaries. Previous works primarily focus on LLMs, proposing moral datasets\nand benchmarks limited to text modality. However, given the rapid development\nof LVLMs, there is still a lack of multimodal moral evaluation methods. To\nbridge this gap, we introduce M$^3$oralBench, the first MultiModal Moral\nBenchmark for LVLMs. M$^3$oralBench expands the everyday moral scenarios in\nMoral Foundations Vignettes (MFVs) and employs the text-to-image diffusion\nmodel, SD3.0, to create corresponding scenario images. It conducts moral\nevaluation across six moral foundations of Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) and\nencompasses tasks in moral judgement, moral classification, and moral response,\nproviding a comprehensive assessment of model performance in multimodal moral\nunderstanding and reasoning. Extensive experiments on 10 popular open-source\nand closed-source LVLMs demonstrate that M$^3$oralBench is a challenging\nbenchmark, exposing notable moral limitations in current models. Our benchmark\nis publicly available.",

Selecting the most suitable examples as\ncontext remains an ongoing challenge and an open problem. Existing literature\nhas highlighted the importance of selecting examples that are diverse or\nsemantically similar to the test sample while ignoring the fact that the\noptimal selection dimension, i.e., diversity or similarity, is task-specific.\nBased on how the test sample is answered, we propose Iterative Demonstration\nSelection (IDS) to leverage the merits of both dimensions. Using zero-shot\nchain-of-thought reasoning (Zero-shot-CoT), IDS iteratively selects examples\nthat are diverse but still strongly correlated with the test sample as ICL\ndemonstrations. Specifically, IDS applies Zero-shot-CoT to the test sample\nbefore demonstration selection. The output reasoning path is then used to\nchoose demonstrations that are prepended to the test sample for inference. The\ngenerated answer is followed by its corresponding reasoning path for extracting\na new set of demonstrations in the next iteration. After several iterations,\nIDS adopts majority voting to obtain the final result.

                    "value": "Spurred by advancements in scale, large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated strong few-shot learning ability via in-context learning (ICL).\nHowever, the performance of ICL has been shown to be highly sensitive to the\nselection of few-shot demonstrations. Selecting the most suitable examples as\ncontext remains an ongoing challenge and an open problem. Existing literature\nhas highlighted the importance of selecting examples that are diverse or\nsemantically similar to the test sample while ignoring the fact that the\noptimal selection dimension, i.e., diversity or similarity, is task-specific.\nBased on how the test sample is answered, we propose Iterative Demonstration\nSelection (IDS) to leverage the merits of both dimensions. Using zero-shot\nchain-of-thought reasoning (Zero-shot-CoT), IDS iteratively selects examples\nthat are diverse but still strongly correlated with the test sample as ICL\ndemonstrations. Specifically, IDS applies Zero-shot-CoT to the test sample\nbefore demonstration selection. The output reasoning path is then used to\nchoose demonstrations that are prepended to the test sample for inference. The\ngenerated answer is followed by its corresponding reasoning path for extracting\na new set of demonstrations in the next iteration. After several iterations,\nIDS adopts majority voting to obtain the final result. Through extensive\nexperiments on tasks including reasoning, question answering, and topic\nclassification, we demonstrate that IDS can consistently outperform existing\nICL demonstration selection methods."

However, their usage presents security challenges, often\nresulting in insecure code merging into the code base. Thus, evaluating the\nquality of generated code, especially its security, is crucial. While prior\nresearch explored various aspects of code generation, the focus on security has\nbeen limited, mostly examining code produced in controlled environments rather\nthan open source development scenarios. To address this gap, we conducted an\nempirical study, analyzing code snippets generated by GitHub Copilot and two\nother AI code generation tools (i.e., CodeWhisperer and Codeium) from GitHub\nprojects. Our analysis identified 733 snippets, revealing a high likelihood of\nsecurity weaknesses, with 29.5% of Python and 24.2% of JavaScript snippets\naffected. These issues span 43 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories,\nincluding significant ones like CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values,\nCWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code, and CWE-79: Cross-site\nScripting. Notably, eight of those CWEs are among the 2023 CWE Top-25,\nhighlighting their severity. We further examined using Copilot Chat to fix\nsecurity issues in Copilot-generated code by providing Copilot Chat with\nwarning messages from the static analysis tools, and up to 55.5% of the\nsecurity issues can be fixed.

                    "value": "Modern code generation tools utilizing AI models like Large Language Models\n(LLMs) have gained increased popularity due to their ability to produce\nfunctional code. However, their usage presents security challenges, often\nresulting in insecure code merging into the code base. Thus, evaluating the\nquality of generated code, especially its security, is crucial. While prior\nresearch explored various aspects of code generation, the focus on security has\nbeen limited, mostly examining code produced in controlled environments rather\nthan open source development scenarios. To address this gap, we conducted an\nempirical study, analyzing code snippets generated by GitHub Copilot and two\nother AI code generation tools (i.e., CodeWhisperer and Codeium) from GitHub\nprojects. Our analysis identified 733 snippets, revealing a high likelihood of\nsecurity weaknesses, with 29.5% of Python and 24.2% of JavaScript snippets\naffected. These issues span 43 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories,\nincluding significant ones like CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values,\nCWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code, and CWE-79: Cross-site\nScripting. Notably, eight of those CWEs are among the 2023 CWE Top-25,\nhighlighting their severity. We further examined using Copilot Chat to fix\nsecurity issues in Copilot-generated code by providing Copilot Chat with\nwarning messages from the static analysis tools, and up to 55.5% of the\nsecurity issues can be fixed. We finally provide the suggestions for mitigating\nsecurity issues in generated code."

Conventional methods in TKGR typically\ndepend on deep learning algorithms or temporal logical rules. However, deep\nlearning-based TKGRs often lack interpretability, whereas rule-based TKGRs\nstruggle to effectively learn temporal rules that capture temporal patterns.\nRecently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated extensive knowledge\nand remarkable proficiency in temporal reasoning.

To address these challenges and make LLMs more\naccessible and cost-effective, in this paper, we propose algorithms to improve\nthe inference time and memory efficiency of 1.58-bit LLMs with ternary weight\nmatrices. Particularly focusing on matrix multiplication as the bottle-neck\noperation of inference, we observe that, once trained, the weight matrices of a\nmodel no longer change. This allows us to preprocess these matrices and create\nindices that help reduce the storage requirements by a logarithmic factor while\nenabling our efficient inference algorithms. Specifically, for a $n$ by $n$\nweight matrix, our efficient algorithm guarantees a time complexity of\n$O(\\frac{n^2}{\\log n})$, a logarithmic factor improvement over the standard\n$O(n^2)$ vector-matrix multiplication. Besides theoretical analysis, we conduct\nextensive experiments to evaluate the practical efficiency of our algorithms.\nOur results confirm the superiority of the approach both with respect to time\nand memory, as we observed a reduction in inference time up to 29x and memory\nusage up to 6x.",

To address these challenges and make LLMs more\naccessible and cost-effective, in this paper, we propose algorithms to improve\nthe inference time and memory efficiency of 1.58-bit LLMs with ternary weight\nmatrices. Particularly focusing on matrix multiplication as the bottle-neck\noperation of inference, we observe that, once trained, the weight matrices of a\nmodel no longer change. This allows us to preprocess these matrices and create\nindices that help reduce the storage requirements by a logarithmic factor while\nenabling our efficient inference algorithms. Specifically, for a $n$ by $n$\nweight matrix, our efficient algorithm guarantees a time complexity of\n$O(\\frac{n^2}{\\log n})$, a logarithmic factor improvement over the standard\n$O(n^2)$ vector-matrix multiplication. Besides theoretical analysis, we conduct\nextensive experiments to evaluate the practical efficiency of our algorithms.\nOur results confirm the superiority of the approach both with respect to time\nand memory, as we observed a reduction in inference time up to 29x and memory\nusage up to 6x."
