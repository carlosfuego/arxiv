We propose mmMamba, a framework for developing\nlinear-complexity native multimodal state space models through progressive\ndistillation from existing MLLMs using moderate academic computational\nresources. Our approach enables the direct conversion of trained decoder-only\nMLLMs to linear-complexity architectures without requiring pre-trained\nRNN-based LLM or vision encoders. We propose an seeding strategy to carve Mamba\nfrom trained Transformer and a three-stage distillation recipe, which can\neffectively transfer the knowledge from Transformer to Mamba while preserving\nmultimodal capabilities. Our method also supports flexible hybrid architectures\nthat combine Transformer and Mamba layers for customizable\nefficiency-performance trade-offs. Distilled from the Transformer-based\ndecoder-only HoVLE, mmMamba-linear achieves competitive performance against\nexisting linear and quadratic-complexity VLMs, while mmMamba-hybrid further\nimproves performance significantly, approaching HoVLE's capabilities. At 103K\ntokens, mmMamba-linear demonstrates 20.6$\\times$ speedup and 75.8% GPU memory\nreduction compared to HoVLE, while mmMamba-hybrid achieves 13.5$\\times$ speedup\nand 60.2% memory savings.

HEADINFER employs a fine-grained, head-wise\noffloading strategy, maintaining only selective attention heads KV cache on the\nGPU while computing attention output dynamically. Through roofline analysis, we\ndemonstrate that HEADINFER maintains computational efficiency while\nsignificantly reducing memory footprint. We evaluate HEADINFER on the\nLlama-3-8B model with a 1-million-token sequence, reducing the GPU memory\nfootprint of the KV cache from 128 GB to 1 GB and the total GPU memory usage\nfrom 207 GB to 17 GB, achieving a 92% reduction compared to BF16 baseline\ninference.

By\nsetting a target fraction of total attention scores, Tactic ensures that token\nselection naturally adapts to variations in attention sparsity. To efficiently\napproximate this selection, Tactic leverages clustering-based sorting and\ndistribution fitting, allowing it to accurately estimate token importance with\nminimal computational overhead. We show that Tactic outperforms existing sparse\nattention algorithms, achieving superior accuracy and up to 7.29x decode\nattention speedup.

To fully reserve the bandwidth for model weight transfers, we implement\na customized dataflow with an operator fusion pipeline and propose a data\narrangement format that can maximize the data transaction efficiency.

We successfully deploy a LLaMA2-7B model,\nachieving a decoding speed of around 5 token/s, utilizing 93.3% of the memory\ncapacity and reaching 85% decoding speed of the theoretical memory bandwidth\nlimit. To fully reserve the memory capacity for model weights and key-value\ncache, we develop the system in a bare-metal environment without an operating\nsystem. To fully reserve the bandwidth for model weight transfers, we implement\na customized dataflow with an operator fusion pipeline and propose a data\narrangement format that can maximize the data transaction efficiency. This\nresearch marks the first attempt to deploy a 7B level LLM on a standalone\nembedded field programmable gate array (FPGA) device. It provides key insights\ninto efficient LLM inference on embedded FPGA devices and provides guidelines\nfor future architecture design."

                "summary": "The growing memory and computational demands of large language models (LLMs)\nfor generative inference present significant challenges for practical\ndeployment. One promising solution to address these challenges is\noffloading-based batched inference, which leverages host memory and disk as an\nextended memory hierarchy for GPUs. While the approach cost-effectively enables\nLLM inference, its performance is limited by substantial I/O overhead,\nprimarily due to the large key-value (KV) cache sizes, which increase with\nbatch size and LLM context window length.\n  In this paper, we introduce INFerence-INFinity (INF^2), a framework that\nboosts generative inference throughput using computational storage devices\n(CSDs). The core of INF^2 is attention-near storage, which offloads\nmemory-intensive self-attention operations to near-storage accelerators,\nsignificantly reducing traffic through the system interconnect. We also propose\ndelayed KV cache writeback to hide storage write latency by delaying newly\ngenerated KV cache writes until the cache reaches sufficient size in system\nmemory.

                    "value": "The growing memory and computational demands of large language models (LLMs)\nfor generative inference present significant challenges for practical\ndeployment. One promising solution to address these challenges is\noffloading-based batched inference, which leverages host memory and disk as an\nextended memory hierarchy for GPUs. While the approach cost-effectively enables\nLLM inference, its performance is limited by substantial I/O overhead,\nprimarily due to the large key-value (KV) cache sizes, which increase with\nbatch size and LLM context window length.\n  In this paper, we introduce INFerence-INFinity (INF^2), a framework that\nboosts generative inference throughput using computational storage devices\n(CSDs). The core of INF^2 is attention-near storage, which offloads\nmemory-intensive self-attention operations to near-storage accelerators,\nsignificantly reducing traffic through the system interconnect. We also propose\ndelayed KV cache writeback to hide storage write latency by delaying newly\ngenerated KV cache writes until the cache reaches sufficient size in system\nmemory. Additionally, we introduce cooperative X-cache, a technique designed to\nfurther trade off the remaining memory capacity for storage bandwidth. Our\nmethods effectively minimize idle time for computation, improving the overall\nthroughput.\n  To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, \\thiswork has been\nimplemented on PyTorch and evaluated on a real system.

RDMA is an attractive solution to support\nhigh-throughput communication between different disaggregated resource pools.\nHowever, existing RDMA solutions face a dilemma: one-sided RDMA completely\nbypasses computation at memory nodes, but its communication takes multiple\nround trips; two-sided RDMA achieves one-round-trip communication but requires\nnon-trivial computation for index lookups at memory nodes, which violates the\nprinciple of disaggregated memory. This work presents Outback, a novel indexing\nsolution for key-value stores with a one-round-trip RDMA-based network that\ndoes not incur computation-heavy tasks at memory nodes. Outback is the first to\nutilize dynamic minimal perfect hashing and separates its index into two\ncomponents: one memory-efficient and compute-heavy component at compute nodes\nand the other memory-heavy and compute-efficient component at memory nodes. We\nimplement a prototype of Outback and evaluate its performance in a public\ncloud. The experimental results show that Outback achieves higher throughput\nthan both the state-of-the-art one-sided RDMA and two-sided RDMA-based\nin-memory KVS by 1.06-5.03x, due to the unique strength of applying a separated\nperfect hashing index.",

Besides its simplicity, RADD can\nreduce the number of function evaluations (NFEs) by caching the output of the\ntime-independent network when the noisy sample remains unchanged in a sampling\ninterval, which enables sampling acceleration. Built upon the new perspective\nof conditional distributions, we further unify absorbing discrete diffusion and\nany-order autoregressive models (AO-ARMs), showing that the upper bound on the\nnegative log-likelihood for the diffusion model can be interpreted as an\nexpected negative log-likelihood for AO-ARMs. Further, our RADD models achieve\nSOTA performance among diffusion models on 5 zero-shot language modeling\nbenchmarks (measured by perplexity) at the GPT-2 scale.

Besides its simplicity, RADD can\nreduce the number of function evaluations (NFEs) by caching the output of the\ntime-independent network when the noisy sample remains unchanged in a sampling\ninterval, which enables sampling acceleration. Built upon the new perspective\nof conditional distributions, we further unify absorbing discrete diffusion and\nany-order autoregressive models (AO-ARMs), showing that the upper bound on the\nnegative log-likelihood for the diffusion model can be interpreted as an\nexpected negative log-likelihood for AO-ARMs. Further, our RADD models achieve\nSOTA performance among diffusion models on 5 zero-shot language modeling\nbenchmarks (measured by perplexity) at the GPT-2 scale.

Our study shows that, due to the recombination\nluminescence, the LArTPC functions as a self-compensating light calorimeter:\nthe missing energy in the hadronic component is compensated for by the\nincreased luminescence relative to the electromagnetic component. Using 0.5--5\nGeV electron neutrino charged current interactions as a case study, we show\nthat good compensation of the electron-to-hadron response ratio (e/h) from\n1--1.05 can be achieved across a broad range of drift electric fields (0.2--1.8\nkV/cm), with better performance for neutrino energies above 2 GeV. This study\nhighlights the potential of light calorimetry in LArTPCs for GeV neutrino\nenergy reconstruction, complementing traditional charge calorimetry. Under\nideal conditions of uniform light collection, we show that LArTPC light\ncalorimetry can achieve an energy resolution comparable to the charge imaging\ncalorimetry. Challenges arising from nonuniform light collection in large\nLArTPCs can be mitigated with a position-dependent light yield correction\nderived from 3D charge signal imaging.",

                    "value": "The Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) is a powerful dual\ncalorimeter capable of estimating particle energy from both ionization charge\nand scintillation light. Our study shows that, due to the recombination\nluminescence, the LArTPC functions as a self-compensating light calorimeter:\nthe missing energy in the hadronic component is compensated for by the\nincreased luminescence relative to the electromagnetic component. Using 0.5--5\nGeV electron neutrino charged current interactions as a case study, we show\nthat good compensation of the electron-to-hadron response ratio (e/h) from\n1--1.05 can be achieved across a broad range of drift electric fields (0.2--1.8\nkV/cm), with better performance for neutrino energies above 2 GeV. This study\nhighlights the potential of light calorimetry in LArTPCs for GeV neutrino\nenergy reconstruction, complementing traditional charge calorimetry. Under\nideal conditions of uniform light collection, we show that LArTPC light\ncalorimetry can achieve an energy resolution comparable to the charge imaging\ncalorimetry. Challenges arising from nonuniform light collection in large\nLArTPCs can be mitigated with a position-dependent light yield correction\nderived from 3D charge signal imaging."

To tackle\nthese concerns, we present SphereFusion, an end-to-end framework that combines\nthe strengths of various projection methods. Specifically, SphereFusion\ninitially employs 2D image convolution and mesh operations to extract two\ndistinct types of features from the panorama image in both equirectangular and\nspherical projection domains. These features are then projected onto the\nspherical domain, where a gate fusion module selects the most reliable features\nfor fusion. Finally, SphereFusion estimates panorama depth within the spherical\ndomain. Meanwhile, SphereFusion employs a cache strategy to improve the\nefficiency of mesh operation. Extensive experiments on three public panorama\ndatasets demonstrate that SphereFusion achieves competitive results with other\nstate-of-the-art methods, while presenting the fastest inference speed at only\n17 ms on a 512$\\times$1024 panorama image.",

Selecting the best combination of\npragmas, even within a restricted set, remains particularly challenging and the\ntypical state-of-practice uses design-space exploration to navigate this space.\nBut due to the highly irregular performance distribution of pragma\nconfigurations, typical DSE approaches are either extremely time consuming, or\noperating on a severely restricted search space. This work proposes a framework\nto automatically insert HLS pragmas in regular loop-based programs, supporting\npipelining, unit replication, and data caching.

However,\ncurrent approaches face significant challenges when composing these LoRAs for\nmulti-concept image generation, resulting in diminished generated image\nquality. In this paper, we initially investigate the role of LoRAs in the\ndenoising process through the lens of the Fourier frequency domain. Based on\nthe hypothesis that applying multiple LoRAs could lead to \"semantic conflicts\",\nwe find that certain LoRAs amplify high-frequency features such as edges and\ntextures, whereas others mainly focus on low-frequency elements, including the\noverall structure and smooth color gradients. Building on these insights, we\ndevise a frequency domain based sequencing strategy to determine the optimal\norder in which LoRAs should be integrated during inference. This strategy\noffers a methodical and generalizable solution compared to the naive\nintegration commonly found in existing LoRA fusion techniques. To fully\nleverage our proposed LoRA order sequence determination method in multi-LoRA\ncomposition tasks, we introduce a novel, training-free framework, Cached\nMulti-LoRA (CMLoRA), designed to efficiently integrate multiple LoRAs while\nmaintaining cohesive image generation. With its flexible backbone for\nmulti-LoRA fusion and a non-uniform caching strategy tailored to individual\nLoRAs, CMLoRA has the potential to reduce semantic conflicts in LoRA\ncomposition and improve computational efficiency. Our experimental evaluations\ndemonstrate that CMLoRA outperforms state-of-the-art training-free LoRA fusion\nmethods by a significant margin -- it achieves an average improvement of\n$2.19\\%$ in CLIPScore, and $11.25\\%$ in MLLM win rate compared to LoraHub, LoRA\nComposite, and LoRA Switch.",

We apply PINT to the ERA5\nWeatherBench dataset, focusing on long-term forecasting of 2m-temperature data.\nPINT incorporates the Simple Harmonic Oscillator Equation as a physics-informed\nprior, embedding its periodic dynamics into RNN, LSTM, and GRU architectures.\nThis equation's analytical solutions (sine and cosine functions) facilitate\nrigorous evaluation of the benefits of incorporating physics-informed\nconstraints. By benchmarking against a linear regression baseline derived from\nits exact solutions, we quantify the impact of embedding physical principles in\ndata-driven models. Unlike traditional time series models that rely on future\nobservations, PINT is designed for practical forecasting.

                    "value": "This paper introduces PINT (Physics-Informed Neural Time Series Models), a\nframework that integrates physical constraints into neural time series models\nto improve their ability to capture complex dynamics. We apply PINT to the ERA5\nWeatherBench dataset, focusing on long-term forecasting of 2m-temperature data.\nPINT incorporates the Simple Harmonic Oscillator Equation as a physics-informed\nprior, embedding its periodic dynamics into RNN, LSTM, and GRU architectures.\nThis equation's analytical solutions (sine and cosine functions) facilitate\nrigorous evaluation of the benefits of incorporating physics-informed\nconstraints. By benchmarking against a linear regression baseline derived from\nits exact solutions, we quantify the impact of embedding physical principles in\ndata-driven models. Unlike traditional time series models that rely on future\nobservations, PINT is designed for practical forecasting.

In this paper,\nwe propose Cached Decentralized Federated Learning (Cached-DFL) to investigate\ndelay-tolerant model spreading and aggregation enabled by model caching on\nmobile agents. Each agent stores not only its own model, but also models of\nagents encountered in the recent past. When two agents meet, they exchange\ntheir own models as well as the cached models. Local model aggregation utilizes\nall models stored in the cache. We theoretically analyze the convergence of\nCached-DFL, explicitly taking into account the model staleness introduced by\ncaching. We design and compare different model caching algorithms for different\nDFL and mobility scenarios. We conduct detailed case studies in a vehicular\nnetwork to systematically investigate the interplay between agent mobility,\ncache staleness, and model convergence. In our experiments, Cached-DFL\nconverges quickly, and significantly outperforms DFL without caching.",

In this paper,\nwe propose Cached Decentralized Federated Learning (Cached-DFL) to investigate\ndelay-tolerant model spreading and aggregation enabled by model caching on\nmobile agents. Each agent stores not only its own model, but also models of\nagents encountered in the recent past. When two agents meet, they exchange\ntheir own models as well as the cached models. Local model aggregation utilizes\nall models stored in the cache. We theoretically analyze the convergence of\nCached-DFL, explicitly taking into account the model staleness introduced by\ncaching. We design and compare different model caching algorithms for different\nDFL and mobility scenarios. We conduct detailed case studies in a vehicular\nnetwork to systematically investigate the interplay between agent mobility,\ncache staleness, and model convergence. In our experiments, Cached-DFL\nconverges quickly, and significantly outperforms DFL without caching."

Our method also supports flexible hybrid architectures\nthat combine Transformer and Mamba layers for customizable\nefficiency-performance trade-offs. Distilled from the Transformer-based\ndecoder-only HoVLE, mmMamba-linear achieves competitive performance against\nexisting linear and quadratic-complexity VLMs, while mmMamba-hybrid further\nimproves performance significantly, approaching HoVLE's capabilities. At 103K\ntokens, mmMamba-linear demonstrates 20.6$\\times$ speedup and 75.8% GPU memory\nreduction compared to HoVLE, while mmMamba-hybrid achieves 13.5$\\times$ speedup\nand 60.2% memory savings.

                "summary": "How should one judge whether a given large language model (LLM) can reliably\nperform economic reasoning? Most existing LLM benchmarks focus on specific\napplications and fail to present the model with a rich variety of economic\ntasks. A notable exception is Raman et al. [2024], who offer an approach for\ncomprehensively benchmarking strategic decision-making; however, this approach\nfails to address the non-strategic settings prevalent in microeconomics, such\nas supply-and-demand analysis. We address this gap by taxonomizing\nmicroeconomic reasoning into $58$ distinct elements, focusing on the logic of\nsupply and demand, each grounded in up to $10$ distinct domains, $5$\nperspectives, and $3$ types. The generation of benchmark data across this\ncombinatorial space is powered by a novel LLM-assisted data generation protocol\nthat we dub auto-STEER, which generates a set of questions by adapting\nhandwritten templates to target new domains and perspectives. Because it offers\nan automated way of generating fresh questions, auto-STEER mitigates the risk\nthat LLMs will be trained to over-fit evaluation benchmarks; we thus hope that\nit will serve as a useful tool both for evaluating and fine-tuning models for\nyears to come.

                    "value": "How should one judge whether a given large language model (LLM) can reliably\nperform economic reasoning? Most existing LLM benchmarks focus on specific\napplications and fail to present the model with a rich variety of economic\ntasks. A notable exception is Raman et al. [2024], who offer an approach for\ncomprehensively benchmarking strategic decision-making; however, this approach\nfails to address the non-strategic settings prevalent in microeconomics, such\nas supply-and-demand analysis. We address this gap by taxonomizing\nmicroeconomic reasoning into $58$ distinct elements, focusing on the logic of\nsupply and demand, each grounded in up to $10$ distinct domains, $5$\nperspectives, and $3$ types. The generation of benchmark data across this\ncombinatorial space is powered by a novel LLM-assisted data generation protocol\nthat we dub auto-STEER, which generates a set of questions by adapting\nhandwritten templates to target new domains and perspectives. Because it offers\nan automated way of generating fresh questions, auto-STEER mitigates the risk\nthat LLMs will be trained to over-fit evaluation benchmarks; we thus hope that\nit will serve as a useful tool both for evaluating and fine-tuning models for\nyears to come. We demonstrate the usefulness of our benchmark via a case study\non $27$ LLMs, ranging from small open-source models to the current state of the\nart.

However, capacity to process Bayesian\nsurprise follows the logarithm of SNR, and errors occur when average capacity\nis exceeded. Our model allows the quantitative analysis of performance and\nerror in one framework with real-time estimation of mental load. We show\nthrough mathematical theorems how three basic laws of HCI, Hick's Law, Fitts'\nLaw and the Power Law fit our model. We then test the validity of the general\nmodel by empirically measuring how well it predicts human performance in a car\nfollowing task. Results suggest that driver processing capacity indeed is a\nlogarithmic function of the SNR of the distance to a lead car.

To gain concise insights from evidences, we then design a\nprompt-based module that utilizes a large language model to generate\njustifications by inferring reasons towards two possible veracities. Finally,\nwe propose a defense-based inference module to determine veracity via modeling\nthe defense among these justifications.

To detect fake news from\na sea of diverse, crowded and even competing narratives, in this paper, we\npropose a novel defense-based explainable fake news detection framework.\nSpecifically, we first propose an evidence extraction module to split the\nwisdom of crowds into two competing parties and respectively detect salient\nevidences. To gain concise insights from evidences, we then design a\nprompt-based module that utilizes a large language model to generate\njustifications by inferring reasons towards two possible veracities. Finally,\nwe propose a defense-based inference module to determine veracity via modeling\nthe defense among these justifications. Extensive experiments conducted on two\nreal-world benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines in terms of fake news detection and provides\nhigh-quality justifications."

In the 40-shot setting on the Rest16 restaurant domain\ndataset, LLMs achieved an F1 score of 52.46, compared to 60.39 by the\nbest-performing fine-tuned method MVP. Additionally, we report the performance\nof LLMs in target aspect sentiment detection (TASD), where the F1 scores were\nalso close to fine-tuned models, achieving 66.03 on Rest16 in the 40-shot\nsetting, compared to 72.76 with MVP.

In this work, we propose a novel\ntwo-stage pipeline for personalized story generation. Our approach first infers\nan author's implicit story-writing characteristics from their past work and\norganizes them into an Author Writing Sheet, inspired by narrative theory. The\nsecond stage uses this sheet to simulate the author's persona through tailored\npersona descriptions and personalized story writing rules. To enable and\nvalidate our approach, we construct Mythos, a dataset of 590 stories from 64\nauthors across five distinct sources that reflect diverse story-writing\nsettings. A head-to-head comparison with a non-personalized baseline\ndemonstrates our pipeline's effectiveness in generating high-quality\npersonalized stories.

In this work, we propose a novel\ntwo-stage pipeline for personalized story generation. Our approach first infers\nan author's implicit story-writing characteristics from their past work and\norganizes them into an Author Writing Sheet, inspired by narrative theory. The\nsecond stage uses this sheet to simulate the author's persona through tailored\npersona descriptions and personalized story writing rules. To enable and\nvalidate our approach, we construct Mythos, a dataset of 590 stories from 64\nauthors across five distinct sources that reflect diverse story-writing\nsettings. A head-to-head comparison with a non-personalized baseline\ndemonstrates our pipeline's effectiveness in generating high-quality\npersonalized stories.

Existing approaches assume, for example, that changes\noccur smoothly over time so that short-term prediction using only the recent\npast becomes feasible. To additionally exploit observations further in the\npast, we propose a novel invariance-based framework for linear conditionals,\ncalled Invariant Subspace Decomposition (ISD), that splits the conditional\ndistribution into a time-invariant and a residual time-dependent component. As\nwe show, this decomposition can be utilized both for zero-shot and\ntime-adaptation prediction tasks, that is, settings where either no or a small\namount of training data is available at the time points we want to predict Y\nat, respectively. We propose a practical estimation procedure, which\nautomatically infers the decomposition using tools from approximate joint\nmatrix diagonalization. Furthermore, we provide finite sample guarantees for\nthe proposed estimator and demonstrate empirically that it indeed improves on\napproaches that do not use the additional invariant structure.",

Existing approaches assume, for example, that changes\noccur smoothly over time so that short-term prediction using only the recent\npast becomes feasible. To additionally exploit observations further in the\npast, we propose a novel invariance-based framework for linear conditionals,\ncalled Invariant Subspace Decomposition (ISD), that splits the conditional\ndistribution into a time-invariant and a residual time-dependent component. As\nwe show, this decomposition can be utilized both for zero-shot and\ntime-adaptation prediction tasks, that is, settings where either no or a small\namount of training data is available at the time points we want to predict Y\nat, respectively. We propose a practical estimation procedure, which\nautomatically infers the decomposition using tools from approximate joint\nmatrix diagonalization. Furthermore, we provide finite sample guarantees for\nthe proposed estimator and demonstrate empirically that it indeed improves on\napproaches that do not use the additional invariant structure."

In this work, we introduce\nCharacterBot, a model designed to replicate both the linguistic patterns and\ndistinctive thought processes of a character. Using Lu Xun, a renowned Chinese\nwriter, as a case study, we propose four training tasks derived from his 17\nessay collections. These include a pre-training task focused on mastering\nexternal linguistic structures and knowledge, as well as three fine-tuning\ntasks: multiple-choice question answering, generative question answering, and\nstyle transfer, each aligning the LLM with Lu Xun's internal ideation and\nwriting style. To optimize learning across these tasks, we introduce a CharLoRA\nparameter updating mechanism, where a general linguistic style expert\ncollaborates with other task-specific experts to better study both the language\nstyle and the understanding of deeper thoughts. We evaluate CharacterBot on\nthree tasks for linguistic accuracy and opinion comprehension, demonstrating\nthat it significantly outperforms the baselines on our adapted metrics.

We argue that complex\nreasoning tasks are difficult for Small Language Models (SLMs, e.g., $\\leq$\n7B), as these tasks demand not only general cognitive abilities but also\nspecialized knowledge, which is often sparse and difficult for these\nneural-based SLMs to effectively capture. Therefore, NesyCD distills the\ngeneral capabilities and specialized knowledge in LLMs using different manners.\nOn the one hand, we distill only general abilities from teacher LLMs into the\nstudent SLMs of parameterized neural networks. On the other hand, for the\nspecialized abilities and uncommon knowledge of a complex reasoning task, we\nemploy a symbolic knowledge distillation approach to obtain and store the\nspecialized knowledge within a symbolic knowledge base (KB). By decoupling\ngeneral and specialized capabilities, the proposed NesyCD can achieve superior\nperformance cost-effectively, utilizing smaller models and blending\nparameterized neural networks with symbolic KB. Moreover, the specialized KB\ngeneralizes well and is comprehended and manipulated by humans.

Specifically, we utilize knowledge distillation to enhance the\nconsistency between TAGI developed through Learning with Instruction and\ntask-specific models developed through Training with Instance, by aligning the\nlabels, output logits, and adapter parameters between them. TAGI is endowed\nwith cross-task generalization capabilities through a two-stage training\nprocess that includes hypernetwork pretraining and finetuning. We evaluate TAGI\non the Super-Natural Instructions and P3 datasets. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that TAGI can match or even outperform traditional meta-trained\nmodels and other hypernetwork models, while significantly reducing\ncomputational requirements."

The rise of high-quality AI-generated content has\nspurred interest in AI-driven micro-video creation. However, despite the\nadvanced capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and DeepSeek\nin text generation and reasoning, their potential to assist the creation of\npopular micro-videos remains largely unexplored.\n  In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on LLM-assisted popular\nmicro-video generation (LLMPopcorn). Specifically, we investigate the following\nresearch questions: (i) How can LLMs be effectively utilized to assist popular\nmicro-video generation? (ii) To what extent can prompt-based enhancements\noptimize the LLM-generated content for higher popularity? (iii) How well do\nvarious LLMs and video generators perform in the popular micro-video generation\ntask? By exploring these questions, we show that advanced LLMs like DeepSeek-V3\nenable micro-video generation to achieve popularity comparable to human-created\ncontent. Prompt enhancements further boost popularity, and benchmarking\nhighlights DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 among LLMs, while LTX-Video and\nHunyuanVideo lead in video generation. This pioneering work advances\nAI-assisted micro-video creation, uncovering new research opportunities. We\nwill release the code and datasets to support future studies.",

                    "value": "Popular Micro-videos, dominant on platforms like TikTok and YouTube, hold\nsignificant commercial value. The rise of high-quality AI-generated content has\nspurred interest in AI-driven micro-video creation. However, despite the\nadvanced capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and DeepSeek\nin text generation and reasoning, their potential to assist the creation of\npopular micro-videos remains largely unexplored.\n  In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on LLM-assisted popular\nmicro-video generation (LLMPopcorn). Specifically, we investigate the following\nresearch questions: (i) How can LLMs be effectively utilized to assist popular\nmicro-video generation? (ii) To what extent can prompt-based enhancements\noptimize the LLM-generated content for higher popularity? (iii) How well do\nvarious LLMs and video generators perform in the popular micro-video generation\ntask? By exploring these questions, we show that advanced LLMs like DeepSeek-V3\nenable micro-video generation to achieve popularity comparable to human-created\ncontent. Prompt enhancements further boost popularity, and benchmarking\nhighlights DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 among LLMs, while LTX-Video and\nHunyuanVideo lead in video generation. This pioneering work advances\nAI-assisted micro-video creation, uncovering new research opportunities. We\nwill release the code and datasets to support future studies."

We introduce\nSynthetic Educational Feedback Loops (SEFL), a novel framework designed to\ndeliver immediate, on-demand feedback at scale without relying on extensive,\nreal-world student data.

We propose mmMamba, a framework for developing\nlinear-complexity native multimodal state space models through progressive\ndistillation from existing MLLMs using moderate academic computational\nresources. Our approach enables the direct conversion of trained decoder-only\nMLLMs to linear-complexity architectures without requiring pre-trained\nRNN-based LLM or vision encoders. We propose an seeding strategy to carve Mamba\nfrom trained Transformer and a three-stage distillation recipe, which can\neffectively transfer the knowledge from Transformer to Mamba while preserving\nmultimodal capabilities. Our method also supports flexible hybrid architectures\nthat combine Transformer and Mamba layers for customizable\nefficiency-performance trade-offs. Distilled from the Transformer-based\ndecoder-only HoVLE, mmMamba-linear achieves competitive performance against\nexisting linear and quadratic-complexity VLMs, while mmMamba-hybrid further\nimproves performance significantly, approaching HoVLE's capabilities. At 103K\ntokens, mmMamba-linear demonstrates 20.6$\\times$ speedup and 75.8% GPU memory\nreduction compared to HoVLE, while mmMamba-hybrid achieves 13.5$\\times$ speedup\nand 60.2% memory savings.

We propose an seeding strategy to carve Mamba\nfrom trained Transformer and a three-stage distillation recipe, which can\neffectively transfer the knowledge from Transformer to Mamba while preserving\nmultimodal capabilities. Our method also supports flexible hybrid architectures\nthat combine Transformer and Mamba layers for customizable\nefficiency-performance trade-offs. Distilled from the Transformer-based\ndecoder-only HoVLE, mmMamba-linear achieves competitive performance against\nexisting linear and quadratic-complexity VLMs, while mmMamba-hybrid further\nimproves performance significantly, approaching HoVLE's capabilities. At 103K\ntokens, mmMamba-linear demonstrates 20.6$\\times$ speedup and 75.8% GPU memory\nreduction compared to HoVLE, while mmMamba-hybrid achieves 13.5$\\times$ speedup\nand 60.2% memory savings.

                "summary": "The emergence of symmetric multi-processing (SMP) systems with non-uniform\nmemory access (NUMA) has prompted extensive research on process and data\nplacement to mitigate the performance impact of NUMA on applications. However,\nexisting solutions often overlook the coordination between the CPU scheduler\nand memory manager, leading to inefficient thread and page table placement.\nMoreover, replication techniques employed to improve locality suffer from\nredundant replicas, scalability barriers, and performance degradation due to\nmemory bandwidth and inter-socket interference. In this paper, we present\nPhoenix, a novel integrated CPU scheduler and memory manager with on-demand\npage table replication mechanism. Phoenix integrates the CPU scheduler and\nmemory management subsystems, allowing for coordinated thread and page table\nplacement. By differentiating between data and page table pages, Phoenix\nenables direct migration or replication of page tables based on application\nbehavior.

                    "value": "The emergence of symmetric multi-processing (SMP) systems with non-uniform\nmemory access (NUMA) has prompted extensive research on process and data\nplacement to mitigate the performance impact of NUMA on applications. However,\nexisting solutions often overlook the coordination between the CPU scheduler\nand memory manager, leading to inefficient thread and page table placement.\nMoreover, replication techniques employed to improve locality suffer from\nredundant replicas, scalability barriers, and performance degradation due to\nmemory bandwidth and inter-socket interference. In this paper, we present\nPhoenix, a novel integrated CPU scheduler and memory manager with on-demand\npage table replication mechanism. Phoenix integrates the CPU scheduler and\nmemory management subsystems, allowing for coordinated thread and page table\nplacement. By differentiating between data and page table pages, Phoenix\nenables direct migration or replication of page tables based on application\nbehavior. Additionally, Phoenix employs memory bandwidth management mechanism\nto maintain Quality of Service (QoS) while mitigating coherency maintenance\noverhead.

To uncover the root cause of this phenomenon, we conduct an in-depth\nanalysis and identify a key issue: multimodal inputs introduce an\nmodality-induced activation shift toward a \"safer\" direction compared to their\ntext-only counterparts, leading VLMs to systematically overestimate the safety\nof harmful inputs. We refer to this issue as safety perception distortion. To\nmitigate such distortion, we propose Activation Shift Disentanglement and\nCalibration (ShiftDC), a training-free method that decomposes and calibrates\nthe modality-induced activation shift to reduce the impact of modality on\nsafety. By isolating and removing the safety-relevant component, ShiftDC\nrestores the inherent safety alignment of the LLM backbone while preserving the\nvision-language capabilities of VLMs. Empirical results demonstrate that\nShiftDC significantly enhances alignment performance on safety benchmarks\nwithout impairing model utility.",

To uncover the root cause of this phenomenon, we conduct an in-depth\nanalysis and identify a key issue: multimodal inputs introduce an\nmodality-induced activation shift toward a \"safer\" direction compared to their\ntext-only counterparts, leading VLMs to systematically overestimate the safety\nof harmful inputs. We refer to this issue as safety perception distortion. To\nmitigate such distortion, we propose Activation Shift Disentanglement and\nCalibration (ShiftDC), a training-free method that decomposes and calibrates\nthe modality-induced activation shift to reduce the impact of modality on\nsafety. By isolating and removing the safety-relevant component, ShiftDC\nrestores the inherent safety alignment of the LLM backbone while preserving the\nvision-language capabilities of VLMs. Empirical results demonstrate that\nShiftDC significantly enhances alignment performance on safety benchmarks\nwithout impairing model utility."

Even\ncapable models like GPT-4 and Gemini-1.5 exhibit sensitivity to encoding, with\ndeviations of about $60\\%$. We further demonstrate this sensitivity for\ndownstream causal intervention tasks.

Extensive experiments across four\nevaluation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of HPSS, consistently\noutperforming both human-designed evaluation prompts and existing automatic\nprompt optimization methods."

To optimize learning across these tasks, we introduce a CharLoRA\nparameter updating mechanism, where a general linguistic style expert\ncollaborates with other task-specific experts to better study both the language\nstyle and the understanding of deeper thoughts.

We challenge this notion by introducing LLaDA, a\ndiffusion model trained from scratch under the pre-training and supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) paradigm. LLaDA models distributions through a forward data\nmasking process and a reverse process, parameterized by a vanilla Transformer\nto predict masked tokens. By optimizing a likelihood bound, it provides a\nprincipled generative approach for probabilistic inference. Across extensive\nbenchmarks, LLaDA demonstrates strong scalability, outperforming our\nself-constructed ARM baselines. Remarkably, LLaDA 8B is competitive with strong\nLLMs like LLaMA3 8B in in-context learning and, after SFT, exhibits impressive\ninstruction-following abilities in case studies such as multi-turn dialogue.\nMoreover, LLaDA addresses the reversal curse, surpassing GPT-4o in a reversal\npoem completion task. Our findings establish diffusion models as a viable and\npromising alternative to ARMs, challenging the assumption that key LLM\ncapabilities discussed above are inherently tied to ARMs. Project page and\ncodes: https://ml-gsai.github.io/LLaDA-demo/.",

These LLM-based dense retrievers have shown\npromising performance across various retrieval scenarios. However, relying on a\nsingle embedding to represent documents proves less effective in capturing\ndifferent perspectives of documents for matching. In this paper, we propose\nDeliberate Thinking based Dense Retriever (DEBATER), which enhances these\nLLM-based retrievers by enabling them to learn more effective document\nrepresentations through a step-by-step thinking process. DEBATER introduces the\nChain-of-Deliberation mechanism to iteratively optimize document\nrepresentations using a continuous chain of thought. To consolidate information\nfrom various thinking steps, DEBATER also incorporates the Self Distillation\nmechanism, which identifies the most informative thinking steps and integrates\nthem into a unified text embedding. Experimental results show that DEBATER\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods across several retrieval benchmarks,\ndemonstrating superior accuracy and robustness.

                    "value": "Recent dense retrievers usually thrive on the emergency capabilities of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), using them to encode queries and documents into an\nembedding space for retrieval. These LLM-based dense retrievers have shown\npromising performance across various retrieval scenarios. However, relying on a\nsingle embedding to represent documents proves less effective in capturing\ndifferent perspectives of documents for matching. In this paper, we propose\nDeliberate Thinking based Dense Retriever (DEBATER), which enhances these\nLLM-based retrievers by enabling them to learn more effective document\nrepresentations through a step-by-step thinking process. DEBATER introduces the\nChain-of-Deliberation mechanism to iteratively optimize document\nrepresentations using a continuous chain of thought. To consolidate information\nfrom various thinking steps, DEBATER also incorporates the Self Distillation\nmechanism, which identifies the most informative thinking steps and integrates\nthem into a unified text embedding. Experimental results show that DEBATER\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods across several retrieval benchmarks,\ndemonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. All codes are available at\nhttps://github.com/OpenBMB/DEBATER."

                "summary": "With significant efforts in recent studies, LLM-as-a-Judge has become a\ncost-effective alternative to human evaluation for assessing text generation\nquality in a wide range of tasks. However, there still remains a reliability\ngap between LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluation. One important reason is the\nlack of guided oracles in the evaluation process. Motivated by the role of\nreference pervasively used in classic text evaluation, we introduce RevisEval,\na novel text generation evaluation paradigm via the response-adapted\nreferences.

When combined with LoRA-like adapters,\nthis enables fully integer-based fine-tuning that is both memory and compute\nefficient. We demonstrate that our approach achieves accuracy comparable to\nFP16-based fine-tuning while significantly reducing memory usage (50%).\nMoreover, compared to FP8, our method can reduce 5x power consumption and 11x\nchip area with same performance, making large-scale model adaptation feasible\non edge devices."

Recent works\nhave turned to zeroth-order optimizers for fine-tuning, which save substantial\nmemory by using two forward passes. However, these optimizers are plagued by\nthe heterogeneity of parameter curvatures across different dimensions. In this\nwork, we propose HiZOO, a diagonal Hessian informed zeroth-order optimizer\nwhich is the first work to leverage the diagonal Hessian to enhance\nzeroth-order optimizer for fine-tuning LLMs. What's more, HiZOO avoids the\nexpensive memory cost and only increases one forward pass per step. Extensive\nexperiments on various models (350M~66B parameters) indicate that HiZOO\nimproves model convergence, significantly reducing training steps and\neffectively enhancing model accuracy. Moreover, we visualize the optimization\ntrajectories of HiZOO on test functions, illustrating its effectiveness in\nhandling heterogeneous curvatures. Lastly, we provide theoretical proofs of\nconvergence for HiZOO. Code is publicly available at\nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/HiZOO27F8.",

                    "value": "Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with classic first-order optimizers\nentails prohibitive GPU memory due to the backpropagation process. Recent works\nhave turned to zeroth-order optimizers for fine-tuning, which save substantial\nmemory by using two forward passes. However, these optimizers are plagued by\nthe heterogeneity of parameter curvatures across different dimensions. In this\nwork, we propose HiZOO, a diagonal Hessian informed zeroth-order optimizer\nwhich is the first work to leverage the diagonal Hessian to enhance\nzeroth-order optimizer for fine-tuning LLMs. What's more, HiZOO avoids the\nexpensive memory cost and only increases one forward pass per step. Extensive\nexperiments on various models (350M~66B parameters) indicate that HiZOO\nimproves model convergence, significantly reducing training steps and\neffectively enhancing model accuracy. Moreover, we visualize the optimization\ntrajectories of HiZOO on test functions, illustrating its effectiveness in\nhandling heterogeneous curvatures. Lastly, we provide theoretical proofs of\nconvergence for HiZOO. Code is publicly available at\nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/HiZOO27F8."

Results demonstrate\nthat our agent significantly outperforms benchmark models by achieving lower\nerror rates and more reliable HR estimations. The agent implementation is\npublicly available on GitHub."
