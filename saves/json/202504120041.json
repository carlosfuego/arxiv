Yet, the unique properties of these models complicate the usage of\ncomplementary efficiency optimizations such as prefix caching that skip\nredundant computations across requests. Most notably, their use of in-place\nstate updates for recurrent layers precludes rolling back cache entries for\npartial sequence overlaps, and instead mandates only exact-match cache hits;\nthe effect is a deluge of (large) cache entries per sequence, most of which\nyield minimal reuse opportunities. We present Marconi, the first system that\nsupports efficient prefix caching with Hybrid LLMs. Key to Marconi are its\nnovel admission and eviction policies that more judiciously assess potential\ncache entries based not only on recency, but also on (1) forecasts of their\nreuse likelihood across a taxonomy of different hit scenarios, and (2) the\ncompute savings that hits deliver relative to memory footprints. Across diverse\nworkloads and Hybrid models, Marconi achieves up to 34.4$\\times$ higher token\nhit rates (71.1% or 617 ms lower TTFT) compared to state-of-the-art prefix\ncaching systems.",

                    "value": "Hybrid models that combine the language modeling capabilities of Attention\nlayers with the efficiency of Recurrent layers (e.g., State Space Models) have\ngained traction in practically supporting long contexts in Large Language Model\nserving. Yet, the unique properties of these models complicate the usage of\ncomplementary efficiency optimizations such as prefix caching that skip\nredundant computations across requests. Most notably, their use of in-place\nstate updates for recurrent layers precludes rolling back cache entries for\npartial sequence overlaps, and instead mandates only exact-match cache hits;\nthe effect is a deluge of (large) cache entries per sequence, most of which\nyield minimal reuse opportunities. We present Marconi, the first system that\nsupports efficient prefix caching with Hybrid LLMs. Key to Marconi are its\nnovel admission and eviction policies that more judiciously assess potential\ncache entries based not only on recency, but also on (1) forecasts of their\nreuse likelihood across a taxonomy of different hit scenarios, and (2) the\ncompute savings that hits deliver relative to memory footprints. Across diverse\nworkloads and Hybrid models, Marconi achieves up to 34.4$\\times$ higher token\nhit rates (71.1% or 617 ms lower TTFT) compared to state-of-the-art prefix\ncaching systems."

Therefore, data\nthroughput specifications play a key role in modeling application performance\nand determining possible bottlenecks. However, while peak instruction\nthroughputs and bandwidths for local caches are often documented, the\nachievable throughput can also depend on the relation between memory access and\ncompute instructions. In this paper, we present an Arm version of the well\nestablished x86-membench throughput benchmark, which we have adapted to support\nall current SIMD extensions of the Armv8 instruction set architecture. We\ndescribe aspects of the Armv8 ISA that need to be considered in the portable\ndesign of this benchmark. We use the benchmark to analyze the memory subsystem\nat a fine spatial granularity and to unveil microarchitectural details of three\nprocessors: Fujitsu A64FX, Ampere Altra and Cavium ThunderX2. Based on the\nresulting performance information, we show that instruction fetch and decoder\nwidths become a potential bottleneck for cache-bandwidth-sensitive workloads\ndue to the load-store concept of the Arm ISA.",

                    "value": "Application performance of modern day processors is often limited by the\nmemory subsystem rather than actual compute capabilities. Therefore, data\nthroughput specifications play a key role in modeling application performance\nand determining possible bottlenecks. However, while peak instruction\nthroughputs and bandwidths for local caches are often documented, the\nachievable throughput can also depend on the relation between memory access and\ncompute instructions. In this paper, we present an Arm version of the well\nestablished x86-membench throughput benchmark, which we have adapted to support\nall current SIMD extensions of the Armv8 instruction set architecture. We\ndescribe aspects of the Armv8 ISA that need to be considered in the portable\ndesign of this benchmark. We use the benchmark to analyze the memory subsystem\nat a fine spatial granularity and to unveil microarchitectural details of three\nprocessors: Fujitsu A64FX, Ampere Altra and Cavium ThunderX2. Based on the\nresulting performance information, we show that instruction fetch and decoder\nwidths become a potential bottleneck for cache-bandwidth-sensitive workloads\ndue to the load-store concept of the Arm ISA."

By reformulating the selection process with tensorized data\nstructures and an optimized caching strategy, our approach effectively\neliminates computational bottlenecks inherent in traditional CPU-based and\nna\\\"ive GPU implementations. Experimental results on widely used numerical\nbenchmarks show that TensorNSGA-III achieves speedups of up to $3629\\times$\nover the CPU version of NSGA-III. Additionally, we validate its effectiveness\nin multiobjective robotic control tasks, where it discovers diverse and\nhigh-quality behavioral solutions. Furthermore, we investigate the critical\nrole of large population sizes in many-objective optimization and demonstrate\nthe scalability of TensorNSGA-III in such scenarios.

However, the large MoE model size still introduces\nsubstantial memory demands, which usually requires expert offloading on\nresource-constrained platforms and incurs significant overhead. Hybrid CPU-GPU\ninference has been proposed to leverage CPU computation to reduce expert\nloading overhead but faces major challenges: on one hand, the expert activation\npatterns of MoE models are highly unstable, rendering the fixed mapping\nstrategies in existing works inefficient; on the other hand, the hybrid CPU-GPU\nschedule for MoE is inherently complex due to the diverse expert sizes,\nstructures, uneven workload distribution, etc. To address these challenges, in\nthis paper, we propose HybriMoE, a hybrid CPU-GPU inference framework that\nimproves resource utilization through a novel CPU-GPU scheduling and cache\nmanagement system. HybriMoE introduces (i) a dynamic intra-layer scheduling\nstrategy to balance workloads across CPU and GPU, (ii) an impact-driven\ninter-layer prefetching algorithm, and (iii) a score-based caching algorithm to\nmitigate expert activation instability.

                "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized for complex tasks\nrequiring longer context lengths, with some models supporting up to 128K or 1M\ntokens. This trend, however, presents significant challenges in inference speed\nand memory management. Quantization emerges as a promising approach to address\nthe widening gap between LLM size and memory capacity. However, traditional\nquantization schemes often yield suboptimal compression results for KV caches\ndue to two key factors: i) On-the-fly quantization and de-quantization, causing\nsignificant performance overhead; ii) Prevalence of outliers in KV values,\nchallenging low-bitwidth uniform quantization. To this end, we propose MILLION,\na novel quantization framework achieving low-bitwidth KV cache through product\nquantization. First, we conduct a thorough analysis of KV cache distribution,\nrevealing the limitations of existing quantization schemes. Second, we\nintroduce a non-uniform quantization algorithm based on product quantization,\nwhich efficiently compresses data while preserving accuracy. Third, we develop\na high-performance GPU inference framework with efficient attention kernel and\npipeline design for MILLION that leverages sparse computation and asynchronous\nquantization, significantly enhancing inference speed. Comprehensive evaluation\nresults demonstrate that MILLION can achieve 4 bits quantization with trivial\nperplexity and accuracy loss, and achieve 2.09x end-to-end performance gains at\n32K context length.

To address this challenge, we\npropose FastVAR, a post-training acceleration method for efficient resolution\nscaling with VARs. Our key finding is that the majority of latency arises from\nthe large-scale step where most tokens have already converged. Leveraging this\nobservation, we develop the cached token pruning strategy that only forwards\npivotal tokens for scale-specific modeling while using cached tokens from\nprevious scale steps to restore the pruned slots. This significantly reduces\nthe number of forwarded tokens and improves the efficiency at larger\nresolutions. Experiments show the proposed FastVAR can further speedup\nFlashAttention-accelerated VAR by 2.7$\\times$ with negligible performance drop\nof <1%. We further extend FastVAR to zero-shot generation of higher resolution\nimages. In particular, FastVAR can generate one 2K image with 15GB memory\nfootprints in 1.5s on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU.

To speed up the prefill of the long\nLLM inputs, one can pre-compute the KV cache of a text and re-use the KV cache\nwhen the context is reused as the prefix of another LLM input. However, the\nreused text chunks are not always the input prefix, which makes precomputed KV\ncaches not directly usable since they ignore the text's cross-attention with\nthe preceding texts. Thus, the benefits of reusing KV caches remain largely\nunrealized.\n  This paper tackles just one challenge: when an LLM input contains multiple\ntext chunks, how to quickly combine their precomputed KV caches in order to\nachieve the same generation quality as the expensive full prefill (i.e.,\nwithout reusing KV cache)? This challenge naturally arises in\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where the input is supplemented with\nmultiple retrieved texts as the context. We present CacheBlend, a scheme that\nreuses the precomputed KV caches, regardless prefix or not, and selectively\nrecomputes the KV values of a small subset of tokens to partially update each\nreused KV cache. In the meantime, the small extra delay for recomputing some\ntokens can be pipelined with the retrieval of KV caches within the same job,\nallowing CacheBlend to store KV caches in slower devices with more storage\ncapacity while retrieving them without increasing the inference delay. By\ncomparing CacheBlend with the state-of-the-art KV cache reusing schemes on\nthree open-source LLMs of various sizes and four popular benchmark datasets of\ndifferent tasks, we show that CacheBlend reduces time-to-first-token (TTFT) by\n2.2-3.3x and increases the inference throughput by 2.8-5x from full KV\nrecompute without compromising generation quality.

                "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for\nenhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) by integrating\nexternal knowledge into the generation process. A key component of RAG\npipelines is the reranker, which selects the most relevant documents from a\npool of retrieved candidates and significantly improves the quality of the\ngenerated responses. While rerankers refine the selection of retrieved\ndocuments in RAG pipelines, they introduce computational challenges that hinder\nhigh throughput and low latency. To address this problem, we propose HyperRAG,\na system that optimizes the trade-off between quality and efficiency in RAG\npipelines by leveraging KV-cache reuse for efficient reranker inference. By\nreusing document-side KV-cache, HyperRAG achieves both high-quality generation\nand system-level efficiency.

                    "value": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for\nenhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) by integrating\nexternal knowledge into the generation process. A key component of RAG\npipelines is the reranker, which selects the most relevant documents from a\npool of retrieved candidates and significantly improves the quality of the\ngenerated responses. While rerankers refine the selection of retrieved\ndocuments in RAG pipelines, they introduce computational challenges that hinder\nhigh throughput and low latency. To address this problem, we propose HyperRAG,\na system that optimizes the trade-off between quality and efficiency in RAG\npipelines by leveraging KV-cache reuse for efficient reranker inference. By\nreusing document-side KV-cache, HyperRAG achieves both high-quality generation\nand system-level efficiency.

Additionally, existing frameworks often fix the roles of P and D nodes,\nleading to computational imbalances. In this paper, we propose FlowKV, a novel\ndisaggregated inference framework, which reduces the average transmission\nlatency of KV cache by 96%, from 0.944s to 0.053s, almost eliminating the\ntransfer time relative to the total request latency by optimizing the KV cache\ntransfer. FlowKV introduces the Load-Aware Scheduler for balanced request\nscheduling and flexible PD node allocation. This design maximizes hardware\nresource utilization, achieving peak system throughput across various\nscenarios, including normal, computational imbalance, and extreme overload\nconditions. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowKV significantly\naccelerates inference by 15.2%-48.9% on LongBench dataset compared to the\nbaseline and supports applications with heterogeneous GPUs.",

By pre-executing the application code during occurrences of\nlong-latency operations and prefetching anticipated cache-missed data into the\ncache hierarchy, runahead effectively masks memory latency for subsequent cache\nmisses and achieves high prefetching accuracy; however, this technique has been\nlimited to superscalar out-of-order and superscalar in-order cores. For\nimplementation in scalar in-order cores, the challenges of\narea-/energy-constraint and severe cache contention remain.\n  Here, we build the first full-stack system featuring runahead, MERE, from SoC\nand a dedicated ISA to the OS and programming model. Through this deployment,\nwe show that enabling runahead in scalar in-order cores is possible, with\nminimal area and power overheads, while still achieving high performance. By\nre-constructing the sequential runahead employing a hardware/software co-design\napproach, the system can be implemented on a mature processor and SoC. Building\non this, an adaptive runahead mechanism is proposed to mitigate the severe\ncache contention in scalar in-order cores. Combining this, we provide a\ncomprehensive solution for embedded processors managing irregular workloads.\nOur evaluation demonstrates that the proposed MERE attains 93.5% of a 2-wide\nout-of-order core's performance while constraining area and power overheads\nbelow 5%, with the adaptive runahead mechanism delivering an additional 20.1%\nperformance gain through mitigating the severe cache contention issues.",

By pre-executing the application code during occurrences of\nlong-latency operations and prefetching anticipated cache-missed data into the\ncache hierarchy, runahead effectively masks memory latency for subsequent cache\nmisses and achieves high prefetching accuracy; however, this technique has been\nlimited to superscalar out-of-order and superscalar in-order cores. For\nimplementation in scalar in-order cores, the challenges of\narea-/energy-constraint and severe cache contention remain.\n  Here, we build the first full-stack system featuring runahead, MERE, from SoC\nand a dedicated ISA to the OS and programming model. Through this deployment,\nwe show that enabling runahead in scalar in-order cores is possible, with\nminimal area and power overheads, while still achieving high performance. By\nre-constructing the sequential runahead employing a hardware/software co-design\napproach, the system can be implemented on a mature processor and SoC. Building\non this, an adaptive runahead mechanism is proposed to mitigate the severe\ncache contention in scalar in-order cores. Combining this, we provide a\ncomprehensive solution for embedded processors managing irregular workloads.\nOur evaluation demonstrates that the proposed MERE attains 93.5% of a 2-wide\nout-of-order core's performance while constraining area and power overheads\nbelow 5%, with the adaptive runahead mechanism delivering an additional 20.1%\nperformance gain through mitigating the severe cache contention issues."

This\npaper focuses on cache management for applications where data objects can be\nstored in layered representations. In such representations, each additional\ndata layer enhances the \"quality\" of the object's version but comes with an\nincremental cost of memory space. This layered approach proves beneficial in\nvarious scenarios, including the delivery of zoomable maps, video coding,\nfuture Virtual Reality gaming, and layered neural network models where\nadditional data layers improve inference accuracy. In systems where users or\ndevices demand different versions of a data object, layered representations\noffer flexibility for caching policies to achieve improved hit rates.\n  In this paper, we explore the performance of various traditionally studied\ncaching policies, such as Belady, LRU, and LFU, both with and without layering.\nTo this end, we develop an asymptotically accurate analytical model for Layered\nLRU (LLRU). We study how the performance of LLRU is impacted by factors such as\nthe number of layers, the popularity of different objects and layers, and\noverheads associated with storing layered representations. For instance, we\nshow that, for LLRU, more layers are not always beneficial and indeed\nperformance depends in subtle ways on the popularity and size profiles of\nlayers.",

                    "value": "The effective management of large amounts of data processed or required by\ntoday's cloud or edge computing systems remains a fundamental challenge. This\npaper focuses on cache management for applications where data objects can be\nstored in layered representations. In such representations, each additional\ndata layer enhances the \"quality\" of the object's version but comes with an\nincremental cost of memory space. This layered approach proves beneficial in\nvarious scenarios, including the delivery of zoomable maps, video coding,\nfuture Virtual Reality gaming, and layered neural network models where\nadditional data layers improve inference accuracy. In systems where users or\ndevices demand different versions of a data object, layered representations\noffer flexibility for caching policies to achieve improved hit rates.\n  In this paper, we explore the performance of various traditionally studied\ncaching policies, such as Belady, LRU, and LFU, both with and without layering.\nTo this end, we develop an asymptotically accurate analytical model for Layered\nLRU (LLRU). We study how the performance of LLRU is impacted by factors such as\nthe number of layers, the popularity of different objects and layers, and\noverheads associated with storing layered representations. For instance, we\nshow that, for LLRU, more layers are not always beneficial and indeed\nperformance depends in subtle ways on the popularity and size profiles of\nlayers."

Evaluations on a real-world prototype show that EMO improves\naccuracy by up to 17.77% compared to FL, and reduces communication costs by up\nto 7.17x and decreases training time by up to 6.9x compared to SFL."

To address\nthis critical bottleneck, we propose AirCache, a novel KV cache compression\nmethod aimed at accelerating LVLMs inference. This work systematically\ninvestigates the correlations between visual and textual tokens within the\nattention mechanisms of LVLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals considerable\nredundancy in cached visual tokens, wherein strategically eliminating these\ntokens preserves model performance while significantly accelerating context\ngeneration. Inspired by these findings, we introduce an elite observation\nwindow for assessing the importance of visual components in the KV cache,\nfocusing on stable inter-modal relevancy modeling with enhanced\nmulti-perspective consistency. Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise\nbudget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of\ntoken importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to\nuniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the\nfull cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing\ndecoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of\ninputs.

To address these challenges, we introduce a comprehensive\nand reliable caching mechanism and propose a novel zero-shot TTA method called\n\"Cache, Residual, Gaussian\" (CRG).

While binary search is typically utilized\nfor branch operations, it may lead to inefficient cache utilization in\nmain-memory scenarios. In contrast, trie-based index structures drive branch\noperations through prefix matching. While these structures generally produce\nfewer cache misses and are thus increasingly popular, they may underperform in\nrange scans because of frequent pointer chasing. This paper proposes a new\nhigh-performance B$^+$-tree variant called \\textbf{Feature B$^+$-tree\n(FB$^+$-tree)}. Similar to employing bit or byte for branch operation in tries,\nFB$^+$-tree progressively considers several bytes following the common prefix\non each level of its inner nodes\\textemdash referred to as features, which\nallows FB$^+$-tree to benefit from prefix skewness. FB$^+$-tree blurs the lines\nbetween B$^+$-trees and tries, while still retaining balance. In the best case,\nFB$^+$-tree almost becomes a trie, whereas in the worst case, it continues to\nfunction as a B$^+$-tree. Meanwhile, a crafted synchronization protocol that\ncombines the link technique and optimistic lock is designed to support\nefficient concurrent index access. Distinctively, FB$^+$-tree leverages subtle\natomic operations seamlessly coordinated with optimistic lock to facilitate\nlatch-free updates, which can be easily extended to other structures. Intensive\nexperiments on multiple workload-dataset combinations demonstrate that\nFB$^+$-tree shows comparable lookup performance to state-of-the-art trie-based\nindexes and outperforms popular B$^+$-trees by 2.3x$\\ \\sim\\ $3.7x under 96\nthreads. FB$^+$-tree also exhibits significant potential on other workloads,\nespecially update workloads under contention and scan workloads.",

While these structures generally produce\nfewer cache misses and are thus increasingly popular, they may underperform in\nrange scans because of frequent pointer chasing. This paper proposes a new\nhigh-performance B$^+$-tree variant called \\textbf{Feature B$^+$-tree\n(FB$^+$-tree)}. Similar to employing bit or byte for branch operation in tries,\nFB$^+$-tree progressively considers several bytes following the common prefix\non each level of its inner nodes\\textemdash referred to as features, which\nallows FB$^+$-tree to benefit from prefix skewness. FB$^+$-tree blurs the lines\nbetween B$^+$-trees and tries, while still retaining balance. In the best case,\nFB$^+$-tree almost becomes a trie, whereas in the worst case, it continues to\nfunction as a B$^+$-tree. Meanwhile, a crafted synchronization protocol that\ncombines the link technique and optimistic lock is designed to support\nefficient concurrent index access. Distinctively, FB$^+$-tree leverages subtle\natomic operations seamlessly coordinated with optimistic lock to facilitate\nlatch-free updates, which can be easily extended to other structures. Intensive\nexperiments on multiple workload-dataset combinations demonstrate that\nFB$^+$-tree shows comparable lookup performance to state-of-the-art trie-based\nindexes and outperforms popular B$^+$-trees by 2.3x$\\ \\sim\\ $3.7x under 96\nthreads. FB$^+$-tree also exhibits significant potential on other workloads,\nespecially update workloads under contention and scan workloads."

However, current FSDMC research often\nlacks generalizability due to its focus on specific datasets. Additionally,\ndefect classification heavily relies on contextual information within images,\nand existing methods fall short of effectively extracting this information. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a general FSDMC framework called MVREC,\nwhich offers two primary advantages: (1) MVREC extracts general features for\ndefect instances by incorporating the pre-trained AlphaCLIP model. (2) It\nutilizes a region-context framework to enhance defect features by leveraging\nmask region input and multi-view context augmentation. Furthermore, Few-shot\nZip-Adapter(-F) classifiers within the model are introduced to cache the visual\nfeatures of the support set and perform few-shot classification. We also\nintroduce MVTec-FS, a new FSDMC benchmark based on MVTec AD, which includes\n1228 defect images with instance-level mask annotations and 46 defect types.\nExtensive experiments conducted on MVTec-FS and four additional datasets\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in general defect classification and its ability\nto incorporate contextual information to improve classification performance.\nCode: https://github.com/ShuaiLYU/MVREC",

Furthermore, chunk-level KV cache\ncomputation reorders the KV cache chunks before quantization, avoiding the\nhardware inefficiency caused by mixed-precision quantization in inference\ncomputation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Cocktail outperforms\nstate-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods on various models and datasets."

Rather than caching keys and\nvalues separately, MLA stores their compressed latent representations, reducing\nmemory overhead while maintaining the performance. While MLA improves memory\nefficiency without compromising language model accuracy, its major limitation\nlies in its integration during the pre-training phase, requiring models to be\ntrained from scratch. This raises a key question: can we use MLA's benefits\nfully or partially in models that have already been pre-trained with different\nattention mechanisms? In this paper, we propose X-EcoMLA to deploy post\ntraining distillation to enable the upcycling of Transformer-based attention\ninto an efficient hybrid MLA variant through lightweight post-training\nadaptation, bypassing the need for extensive pre-training. We demonstrate that\nleveraging the dark knowledge of a well-trained model can enhance training\naccuracy and enable extreme KV cache compression in MLA without compromising\nmodel performance. The experimental results show that our proposed method can\neffectively compress the KV cache while preserving the performance on the\nbenchmarks; specifically, for Llama3.2-1B-Instruct baseline, a 6.4x compression\nachieves the same average score by using only 3.6B training tokens and 70 GPU\nhours on AMD MI300, whereas a 10.6x compression have less than 0.1\\% average\nscore drop with 7B training tokens and 140 GPU hours.",

Motivated by this, we present\nDyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token\nrepresentation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play\ntemporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging\nredundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune\nspatially redundant tokens selectively. It ensures high-quality inference by\ndynamically retaining the critical tokens at each decoding step.

Using atomic magnetometers to monitor the magnetic field\ninside the shield, we measure noise below 40 fT/$\\sqrt{{\\rm Hz}}$ at 1 Hz and\nabove, rising to 500 fT/$\\sqrt{{\\rm Hz}}$ at 0.1 Hz.

Extensive\nexperiments across multiple benchmarks show that Geo4D significantly surpasses\nstate-of-the-art video depth estimation methods, including recent methods such\nas MonST3R, which are also designed to handle dynamic scenes."

By\nincorporating HoloPart with existing segmentation techniques, we achieve\npromising results on 3D part amodal segmentation, opening new avenues for\napplications in geometry editing, animation, and material assignment."

However, the internal mechanisms by which\noff-the-shelf LLMs understand and operationalize relevance remain largely\nunexplored.

This form of reasoning is significantly more sophisticated than\nisolated planning or reasoning tasks in static settings (e.g., math problem\nsolving). In this paper, we present Strategic Planning, Interaction, and\nNegotiation (SPIN-Bench), a new multi-domain evaluation designed to measure the\nintelligence of strategic planning and social reasoning. While many existing\nbenchmarks focus on narrow planning or single-agent reasoning, SPIN-Bench\ncombines classical PDDL tasks, competitive board games, cooperative card games,\nand multi-agent negotiation scenarios in one unified framework. The framework\nincludes both a benchmark as well as an arena to simulate and evaluate the\nvariety of social settings to test reasoning and strategic behavior of AI\nagents. We formulate the benchmark SPIN-Bench by systematically varying action\nspaces, state complexity, and the number of interacting agents to simulate a\nvariety of social settings where success depends on not only methodical and\nstep-wise decision making, but also conceptual inference of other (adversarial\nor cooperative) participants. Our experiments reveal that while contemporary\nLLMs handle basic fact retrieval and short-range planning reasonably well, they\nencounter significant performance bottlenecks in tasks requiring deep multi-hop\nreasoning over large state spaces and socially adept coordination under\nuncertainty. We envision SPIN-Bench as a catalyst for future research on robust\nmulti-agent planning, social reasoning, and human--AI teaming. Project Website:\nhttps://spinbench.github.io/",

Pychop also introduces interfaces for both\nPyTorch and JAX, enabling efficient low-precision emulation on GPUs for neural\nnetwork training and inference with unparalleled flexibility.\n  In this paper, we offer a comprehensive exposition of the design,\nimplementation, validation, and practical application of Pychop, establishing\nit as a foundational tool for advancing efficient mixed-precision algorithms.\nFurthermore, we present empirical results on low-precision emulation for image\nclassification and object detection using published datasets, illustrating the\nsensitivity of the use of low precision and offering valuable insights into its\nimpact. Pychop enables in-depth investigations into the effects of numerical\nprecision, facilitates the development of novel hardware accelerators, and\nintegrates seamlessly into existing deep learning workflows. Software and\nexperimental code are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/inEXASCALE/pychop."

To\ntackle these shortcomings, we find that fine-tuning Video-LLMs on\nself-supervised fragment tasks, greatly improve their fine-grained video\nunderstanding abilities.

Through a comprehensive analysis of the token reduction\nprocess, we analyze the information loss introduced by different reduction\nstrategies and develop FOLDER to preserve key information while removing visual\nredundancy. We showcase the effectiveness of FOLDER by integrating it into the\nvisual backbone of several MLLMs, significantly accelerating the inference\nphase. Furthermore, we evaluate its utility as a training accelerator or even\nperformance booster for MLLMs. In both contexts, FOLDER achieves comparable or\neven better performance than the original models, while dramatically reducing\ncomplexity by removing up to 70% of visual tokens.",

Through a comprehensive analysis of the token reduction\nprocess, we analyze the information loss introduced by different reduction\nstrategies and develop FOLDER to preserve key information while removing visual\nredundancy. We showcase the effectiveness of FOLDER by integrating it into the\nvisual backbone of several MLLMs, significantly accelerating the inference\nphase. Furthermore, we evaluate its utility as a training accelerator or even\nperformance booster for MLLMs. In both contexts, FOLDER achieves comparable or\neven better performance than the original models, while dramatically reducing\ncomplexity by removing up to 70% of visual tokens."

However, LLMs face limitations in CSC, particularly\nover-correction, making them suboptimal for this task. While existing studies\nhave investigated the use of phonetic and graphemic information in multimodal\nCSC models, effectively leveraging these features to enhance correction\nperformance remains a challenge. To address this, we propose the Multimodal\nAnalysis for Character Usage (\\textbf{MACU}) experiment, identifying potential\nimprovements for multimodal correctison. Based on empirical findings, we\nintroduce \\textbf{NamBert}, a novel multimodal model for Chinese spelling\ncorrection. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate NamBert's superiority\nover SOTA methods. We also conduct a comprehensive comparison between NamBert\nand LLMs, systematically evaluating their strengths and limitations in CSC. Our\ncode and model are available at https://github.com/iioSnail/NamBert."

However, the\nalignment objective used to train CLIP often results in subpar visual features\nfor fine-grained tasks. In contrast, SSL-pretrained models like DINO excel at\nextracting rich visual features due to their specialized training paradigm.\nYet, these SSL models require an additional supervised linear probing step,\nwhich relies on fully labeled data which is often expensive and difficult to\nobtain at scale. In this paper, we propose a label-free prompt-tuning method\nthat leverages the rich visual features of self-supervised learning models\n(DINO) and the broad textual knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to\nlargely enhance CLIP-based image classification performance using unlabeled\nimages. Our approach unfolds in three key steps: (1) We generate robust textual\nfeature embeddings that more accurately represent object classes by leveraging\nclass-specific descriptions from LLMs, enabling more effective zero-shot\nclassification compared to CLIP's default name-specific prompts. (2) These\ntextual embeddings are then used to produce pseudo-labels to train an alignment\nmodule that integrates the complementary strengths of LLM description-based\ntextual embeddings & DINO's visual features. (3) Finally, we prompt-tune CLIP's\nvision encoder through DINO-assisted supervision using the trained alignment\nmodule. This three-step process allows us to harness the best of visual &\ntextual foundation models, resulting in a powerful and efficient approach that\nsurpasses state-of-the-art label-free classification methods.

These\napproximations are applied to the problem of electron capture by a closing\ntunnel barrier where the competition between the closing speed and the escape\nrate defines a scaling relation for the capture fidelity. Effective\none-dimensional cubic potential approximation leads to a universal form of this\nscaling relation in terms of device-independent dimensionless depth and speed\nparameters. Using predictions for temperature and magnetic-field dependence we\nshow how to infer the energy scales of cubic longitudinal and quadratic\ntransverse confinement.

                "summary": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has enjoyed increased attention in the\nrecent past and recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have\nhighlighted the importance of integrating world knowledge into these systems.\nCurrent RAG methodologies often modify the internal architecture of pre-trained\nlanguage models (PLMs) or rely on textifying knowledge graphs (KGs), which is\ninefficient in terms of token usage. This paper introduces ConceptFormer, a new\napproach to augment LLMs with structured knowledge from KGs, such as Wikidata,\nwithout altering their internal structure or relying on textual input of KGs.\nConceptFormer operates in the LLM embedding vector space, creating and\ninjecting \\emph{concept vectors} that encapsulate the information of the KG\nnodes directly. Trained in conjunction with a frozen LLM, ConceptFormer\ngenerates a comprehensive lookup table that maps KG nodes to their respective\nconcept vectors.

This paper introduces ConceptFormer, a new\napproach to augment LLMs with structured knowledge from KGs, such as Wikidata,\nwithout altering their internal structure or relying on textual input of KGs.\nConceptFormer operates in the LLM embedding vector space, creating and\ninjecting \\emph{concept vectors} that encapsulate the information of the KG\nnodes directly. Trained in conjunction with a frozen LLM, ConceptFormer\ngenerates a comprehensive lookup table that maps KG nodes to their respective\nconcept vectors.

Among these, Mo\nhandled 298 complete patient interactions, for which we report\nphysician-assessed measures of safety and medical accuracy.\n  Patients reported higher clarity of information (3.73 vs 3.62 out of 4, p <\n0.05) and overall satisfaction (4.58 vs 4.42 out of 5, p < 0.05) with\nAI-assisted conversations compared to standard care, while showing equivalent\nlevels of trust and perceived empathy. The high opt-in rate (81% among\nrespondents) exceeded previous benchmarks for AI acceptance in healthcare.\nPhysician oversight ensured safety, with 95% of conversations rated as \"good\"\nor \"excellent\" by general practitioners experienced in operating a medical\nadvice chat service.\n  Our findings demonstrate that carefully implemented AI medical assistants can\nenhance patient experience while maintaining safety standards through physician\nsupervision. This work provides empirical evidence for the feasibility of AI\ndeployment in healthcare communication and insights into the requirements for\nsuccessful integration into existing healthcare services."

To further show WQRM's\npractical benefits during inference, we leverage additional test-time compute\nto generate and rank multiple candidate revisions, allowing us to select\nhigher-quality outputs from an initial draft. Human evaluation with 9\nexperienced writers confirm that WQRM-based selection produces writing samples\npreferred by experts 66% overall, and 72.2% when the reward gap is larger than\n1 point.

The commonly used Pass@k\nmetric necessitates extensive unit tests and configured environments, demands a\nhigh labor cost, and is not suitable for evaluating LLM-generated text.\nConventional metrics like BLEU, which measure only lexical rather than semantic\nsimilarity, have also come under scrutiny.

In\nthis paper, we empirically explore LLM-as-a-judge methods for evaluating SE\ntasks, focusing on their alignment with human judgments.

As demand for LLM services continues to grow, scaling\nthese systems to handle high request rates while meeting latency Service-Level\nObjectives (SLOs), referred to as effective throughput, becomes critical.\nHowever, existing systems often struggle to improve effective throughput,\nprimarily due to a significant decline in Time To First Token (TTFT) SLO\nattainment. We identify two major causes of this bottleneck: (1)\nmemory-intensive KV cache that limits batch size expansion under GPU memory\nconstraints, and (2) rigid batch composition enforced by the default\nFirst-Come-First-Serve scheduling policy. In this paper, we introduce\nApt-Serve, a scalable framework designed to enhance effective throughput in LLM\ninference serving. Apt-Serve features a new hybrid cache scheme that combines\nKV cache with a memory-efficient hidden cache for reusable input hidden state\nvectors, allowing large batch sizes and improving request concurrency. Based on\nthe hybrid cache, Apt-Serve employs an adaptive runtime scheduling mechanism\nthat dynamically optimizes batch composition. We formally define the adaptive\nscheduling optimization problem and propose an efficient algorithm with\ntheoretical guarantees. Extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets and\nLLMs ranging from 13B to 66B parameters demonstrate that Apt-Serve achieves up\nto 8.8x improvement in effective throughput compared to the state-of-the-art\ninference serving systems.",

Kimi-VL\ndemonstrates strong performance across challenging domains: as a\ngeneral-purpose VLM, Kimi-VL excels in multi-turn agent tasks (e.g., OSWorld),\nmatching flagship models. Furthermore, it exhibits remarkable capabilities\nacross diverse challenging vision language tasks, including college-level image\nand video comprehension, OCR, mathematical reasoning, and multi-image\nunderstanding. In comparative evaluations, it effectively competes with\ncutting-edge efficient VLMs such as GPT-4o-mini, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, and\nGemma-3-12B-IT, while surpassing GPT-4o in several key domains. Kimi-VL also\nadvances in processing long contexts and perceiving clearly. With a 128K\nextended context window, Kimi-VL can process diverse long inputs, achieving\nimpressive scores of 64.5 on LongVideoBench and 35.1 on MMLongBench-Doc. Its\nnative-resolution vision encoder, MoonViT, further allows it to see and\nunderstand ultra-high-resolution visual inputs, achieving 83.2 on InfoVQA and\n34.5 on ScreenSpot-Pro, while maintaining lower computational cost for common\ntasks. Building upon Kimi-VL, we introduce an advanced long-thinking variant:\nKimi-VL-Thinking. Developed through long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), this model exhibits strong\nlong-horizon reasoning capabilities. It achieves scores of 61.7 on MMMU, 36.8\non MathVision, and 71.3 on MathVista while maintaining the compact 2.8B\nactivated LLM parameters, setting a new standard for efficient multimodal\nthinking models.

In this paper, we investigate\ntokenization from a theoretical point of view by studying the behavior of\ntransformers on simple data generating processes. When trained on data drawn\nfrom certain simple $k^{\\text{th}}$-order Markov processes for $k > 1$,\ntransformers exhibit a surprising phenomenon - in the absence of tokenization,\nthey empirically fail to learn the right distribution and predict characters\naccording to a unigram model (Makkuva et al., 2024). With the addition of\ntokenization, however, we empirically observe that transformers break through\nthis barrier and are able to model the probabilities of sequences drawn from\nthe source near-optimally, achieving small cross-entropy loss. With this\nobservation as starting point, we study the end-to-end cross-entropy loss\nachieved by transformers with and without tokenization. With the appropriate\ntokenization, we show that even the simplest unigram models (over tokens)\nlearnt by transformers are able to model the probability of sequences drawn\nfrom $k^{\\text{th}}$-order Markov sources near optimally.

Traditional FL experiences from an\naccuracy drop during aggregation due to its averaging function, while SL and\nSFL face increased loss due to the independent gradient updates on each split\nnetwork. TL adopts a unique strategy where the model traverses the nodes during\nforward propagation (FP) and performs backward propagation (BP) on the\norchestrator, effectively implementing centralized learning (CL) principles\nwithin a distributed environment. The orchestrator is tasked with generating\nvirtual batches and planning the sequential node visits of the model during FP,\naligning them with the ordered index of the data within these batches. We\nconducted experiments on six datasets representing diverse characteristics\nacross various domains. Our evaluation demonstrates that TL is on par with\nclassic CL approaches in terms of accurate inference, thereby offering a viable\nand robust solution for DL tasks.

These biases stem from various sources, including\nhistorical inequalities in training data, linguistic imbalances, and\nadversarial manipulation. Despite mitigation efforts, recent studies indicate\nthat LLMs remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks designed to elicit biased\nresponses. This work proposes a scalable benchmarking framework to evaluate LLM\nrobustness against adversarial bias elicitation. Our methodology involves (i)\nsystematically probing models with a multi-task approach targeting biases\nacross various sociocultural dimensions, (ii) quantifying robustness through\nsafety scores using an LLM-as-a-Judge approach for automated assessment of\nmodel responses, and (iii) employing jailbreak techniques to investigate\nvulnerabilities in safety mechanisms. Our analysis examines prevalent biases in\nboth small and large state-of-the-art models and their impact on model safety.\nAdditionally, we assess the safety of domain-specific models fine-tuned for\ncritical fields, such as medicine. Finally, we release a curated dataset of\nbias-related prompts, CLEAR-Bias, to facilitate systematic vulnerability\nbenchmarking. Our findings reveal critical trade-offs between model size and\nsafety, aiding the development of fairer and more robust future language\nmodels.",

Despite mitigation efforts, recent studies indicate\nthat LLMs remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks designed to elicit biased\nresponses. This work proposes a scalable benchmarking framework to evaluate LLM\nrobustness against adversarial bias elicitation. Our methodology involves (i)\nsystematically probing models with a multi-task approach targeting biases\nacross various sociocultural dimensions, (ii) quantifying robustness through\nsafety scores using an LLM-as-a-Judge approach for automated assessment of\nmodel responses, and (iii) employing jailbreak techniques to investigate\nvulnerabilities in safety mechanisms. Our analysis examines prevalent biases in\nboth small and large state-of-the-art models and their impact on model safety.\nAdditionally, we assess the safety of domain-specific models fine-tuned for\ncritical fields, such as medicine. Finally, we release a curated dataset of\nbias-related prompts, CLEAR-Bias, to facilitate systematic vulnerability\nbenchmarking. Our findings reveal critical trade-offs between model size and\nsafety, aiding the development of fairer and more robust future language\nmodels."

We show that in a multi-tenant cloud-based quantum system,\nan adversary with the basic capability to deploy custom pulses, similar to any\nstandard user today, can utilize the QubitHammer attacks to significantly\ndegrade the fidelity of victim circuits located on the same quantum computer.\nUpon extensive evaluation, the QubitHammer attacks achieve a very high\nvariational distance of up to 0.938 from the expected outcome, thus\ndemonstrating their potential to degrade victim computation. Our findings\nexhibit the effectiveness of these attacks across various superconducting\nquantum computers from a leading vendor, suggesting that QubitHammer represents\na new class of security attacks.

This form of reasoning is significantly more sophisticated than\nisolated planning or reasoning tasks in static settings (e.g., math problem\nsolving). In this paper, we present Strategic Planning, Interaction, and\nNegotiation (SPIN-Bench), a new multi-domain evaluation designed to measure the\nintelligence of strategic planning and social reasoning. While many existing\nbenchmarks focus on narrow planning or single-agent reasoning, SPIN-Bench\ncombines classical PDDL tasks, competitive board games, cooperative card games,\nand multi-agent negotiation scenarios in one unified framework. The framework\nincludes both a benchmark as well as an arena to simulate and evaluate the\nvariety of social settings to test reasoning and strategic behavior of AI\nagents. We formulate the benchmark SPIN-Bench by systematically varying action\nspaces, state complexity, and the number of interacting agents to simulate a\nvariety of social settings where success depends on not only methodical and\nstep-wise decision making, but also conceptual inference of other (adversarial\nor cooperative) participants. Our experiments reveal that while contemporary\nLLMs handle basic fact retrieval and short-range planning reasonably well, they\nencounter significant performance bottlenecks in tasks requiring deep multi-hop\nreasoning over large state spaces and socially adept coordination under\nuncertainty.

                "summary": "Soybean leaf disease detection is critical for agricultural productivity but\nfaces challenges due to visually similar symptoms and limited interpretability\nin conventional methods. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in\nspatial feature extraction, they often neglect inter-image relational\ndependencies, leading to misclassifications. This paper proposes an\ninterpretable hybrid Sequential CNN-Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that\nsynergizes MobileNetV2 for localized feature extraction and GraphSAGE for\nrelational modeling. The framework constructs a graph where nodes represent\nleaf images, with edges defined by cosine similarity-based adjacency matrices\nand adaptive neighborhood sampling.

                    "value": "Soybean leaf disease detection is critical for agricultural productivity but\nfaces challenges due to visually similar symptoms and limited interpretability\nin conventional methods. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in\nspatial feature extraction, they often neglect inter-image relational\ndependencies, leading to misclassifications. This paper proposes an\ninterpretable hybrid Sequential CNN-Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that\nsynergizes MobileNetV2 for localized feature extraction and GraphSAGE for\nrelational modeling. The framework constructs a graph where nodes represent\nleaf images, with edges defined by cosine similarity-based adjacency matrices\nand adaptive neighborhood sampling.

This\npaper addresses the crucial question: What is the best practice to reduce\ncommunication costs in human-in-the-loop learning with minimal annotator\neffort? Existing FAL methods typically rely on iterative annotation processes\nthat separate active sampling from federated updates, leading to multiple\nrounds of expensive communication and annotation. In response, we introduce\nFAST, a two-pass FAL framework that harnesses foundation models for weak\nlabeling in a preliminary pass, followed by a refinement pass focused\nexclusively on the most uncertain samples. By leveraging representation\nknowledge from foundation models and integrating refinement steps into a\nstreamlined workflow, FAST substantially reduces the overhead incurred by\niterative active sampling. Extensive experiments on diverse medical and natural\nimage benchmarks demonstrate that FAST outperforms existing FAL methods by an\naverage of 4.36% while reducing communication rounds eightfold under a limited\n5% labeling budget.",

The\nGI-ITM employs an adaptive gating mechanism to aggregate MMAE's features,\nsubsequently applying image-text matching constraints to steer the alignment\nbetween the text and the image. Extensive experiments are conducted on three\nsocial media news benchmarks including N24News, VisualNews, and GoodNews, the\nresults shows that our method surpasses the competition methods with a clear\nmargin."

Utilizing dual-layer\nLLM analysis, DeepGreen preliminarily identifies potential green keywords in\nfinancial statements and then assesses their implementation degree via\niterative semantic analysis of LLM. A core variable GreenImplement is derived\nfrom the ratio from the two layers' output. We extract 204 financial statements\nof 68 companies from A-share market over three years, comprising 89,893 words,\nand analyse them through DeepGreen.

However, they also exhibit inherent limitations,\nsuch as outdated knowledge and susceptibility to hallucinations.\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to\naddress these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent\nefforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack\nmethods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines\nsharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the\nknowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often\ndetectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness,\nand (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking\nformal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their\neffectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose\ncoordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack\nthat introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database\nwhile embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt. When activated, the\ntrigger causes the LLM to generate pre-designed responses to targeted queries,\nwhile maintaining normal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high\neffectiveness and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a\nbilevel optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization framework to\ndevelop optimal poisoned texts and triggers. Extensive experiments across\ndiverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PR-Attack, achieving\na high attack success rate even with a limited number of poisoned texts and\nsignificantly improved stealth compared to existing methods.",

The core of R1 lies in its\nrule-based reward formulation, which leverages tasks with deterministic\nground-truth answers to enable precise and stable reward computation. In the\nvisual domain, we similarly observe that a wide range of visual understanding\ntasks are inherently equipped with well-defined ground-truth annotations. This\nproperty makes them naturally compatible with rule-based reward mechanisms.\nMotivated by this observation, we investigate the extension of R1-style\nreinforcement learning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), aiming to enhance\ntheir visual reasoning capabilities. To this end, we develop VLM-R1, a\ndedicated framework designed to harness RL for improving VLMs' performance on\ngeneral vision-language tasks. Using this framework, we further explore the\nfeasibility of applying RL to visual domain. Experimental results indicate that\nthe RL-based model not only delivers competitive performance on visual\nunderstanding tasks but also surpasses Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in\ngeneralization ability. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies\nthat uncover a series of noteworthy insights, including the presence of reward\nhacking in object detection, the emergence of the \"OD aha moment\", the impact\nof training data quality, and the scaling behavior of RL across different model\nsizes. Through these analyses, we aim to deepen the understanding of how\nreinforcement learning enhances the capabilities of vision-language models, and\nwe hope our findings and open-source contributions will support continued\nprogress in the vision-language RL community.

The goal is to compute the joint\nclusters while preserving the privacy of each entity's dataset. Existing\nsolutions using secret sharing or garbled circuits implement privacy-preserving\nvariants of Lloyd's algorithm but incur high communication costs, scaling as\nO(nkt), where n is the number of data points, k the number of clusters, and t\nthe number of rounds.

To further show WQRM's\npractical benefits during inference, we leverage additional test-time compute\nto generate and rank multiple candidate revisions, allowing us to select\nhigher-quality outputs from an initial draft. Human evaluation with 9\nexperienced writers confirm that WQRM-based selection produces writing samples\npreferred by experts 66% overall, and 72.2% when the reward gap is larger than\n1 point.

As demand for LLM services continues to grow, scaling\nthese systems to handle high request rates while meeting latency Service-Level\nObjectives (SLOs), referred to as effective throughput, becomes critical.\nHowever, existing systems often struggle to improve effective throughput,\nprimarily due to a significant decline in Time To First Token (TTFT) SLO\nattainment. We identify two major causes of this bottleneck: (1)\nmemory-intensive KV cache that limits batch size expansion under GPU memory\nconstraints, and (2) rigid batch composition enforced by the default\nFirst-Come-First-Serve scheduling policy. In this paper, we introduce\nApt-Serve, a scalable framework designed to enhance effective throughput in LLM\ninference serving. Apt-Serve features a new hybrid cache scheme that combines\nKV cache with a memory-efficient hidden cache for reusable input hidden state\nvectors, allowing large batch sizes and improving request concurrency. Based on\nthe hybrid cache, Apt-Serve employs an adaptive runtime scheduling mechanism\nthat dynamically optimizes batch composition. We formally define the adaptive\nscheduling optimization problem and propose an efficient algorithm with\ntheoretical guarantees. Extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets and\nLLMs ranging from 13B to 66B parameters demonstrate that Apt-Serve achieves up\nto 8.8x improvement in effective throughput compared to the state-of-the-art\ninference serving systems.",

Kimi-VL\ndemonstrates strong performance across challenging domains: as a\ngeneral-purpose VLM, Kimi-VL excels in multi-turn agent tasks (e.g., OSWorld),\nmatching flagship models. Furthermore, it exhibits remarkable capabilities\nacross diverse challenging vision language tasks, including college-level image\nand video comprehension, OCR, mathematical reasoning, and multi-image\nunderstanding. In comparative evaluations, it effectively competes with\ncutting-edge efficient VLMs such as GPT-4o-mini, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, and\nGemma-3-12B-IT, while surpassing GPT-4o in several key domains. Kimi-VL also\nadvances in processing long contexts and perceiving clearly. With a 128K\nextended context window, Kimi-VL can process diverse long inputs, achieving\nimpressive scores of 64.5 on LongVideoBench and 35.1 on MMLongBench-Doc. Its\nnative-resolution vision encoder, MoonViT, further allows it to see and\nunderstand ultra-high-resolution visual inputs, achieving 83.2 on InfoVQA and\n34.5 on ScreenSpot-Pro, while maintaining lower computational cost for common\ntasks. Building upon Kimi-VL, we introduce an advanced long-thinking variant:\nKimi-VL-Thinking. Developed through long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), this model exhibits strong\nlong-horizon reasoning capabilities. It achieves scores of 61.7 on MMMU, 36.8\non MathVision, and 71.3 on MathVista while maintaining the compact 2.8B\nactivated LLM parameters, setting a new standard for efficient multimodal\nthinking models.

We propose LoRA with Reduced Interference (LoRI), a simple yet\neffective approach that freezes the projection matrices $A$ as random\nprojections and sparsifies the matrices $B$ using task-specific masks. This\ndesign substantially reduces the number of trainable parameters while\nmaintaining strong task performance. Moreover, LoRI minimizes cross-task\ninterference in adapter merging by leveraging the orthogonality between adapter\nsubspaces, and supports continual learning by using sparsity to mitigate\ncatastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments across natural language\nunderstanding, mathematical reasoning, code generation, and safety alignment\ntasks demonstrate that LoRI outperforms full fine-tuning and existing PEFT\nmethods, while using up to 95% fewer trainable parameters than LoRA.

The core\nidea is that to assess an LLM's overall ability, we must evaluate not only its\ntask performance but also the effort expended to achieve the outcome. Our\nextensive experiments reveal an inverse relationship between MUI and\nperformance, from which we deduce a common trend observed in popular LLMs,\nwhich we term the Utility Law. Based on this, we derive four corollaries that\naddress key challenges, including training judgement, the issue of data\ncontamination, fairness in model comparison, and data diversity.

To refine this map, we design a novel channel and spatial\nattention module.
