Multi-head\nLatent Attention (MLA) tackles this challenge by using low-rank matrices in the\nkey-value (KV) layers, thereby allowing compressed latent KV states to be\ncached. This approach significantly reduces the KV cache size relative to\ntraditional multi-head attention, leading to faster inference. Moreover, MLA\nemploys an up-projection matrix to increase expressiveness, trading additional\ncomputation for reduced communication overhead. Although MLA has demonstrated\nefficiency and effectiveness in Deepseek V2/V3/R1, many major model providers\nstill rely on Group Query Attention (GQA) and have not announced any plans to\nadopt MLA. In this paper, we show that GQA can always be represented by MLA\nwhile maintaining the same KV cache overhead, but the converse does not hold.\nTo encourage broader use of MLA, we introduce TransMLA, a post-training method\nthat converts widely used GQA-based pre-trained models (e.g., LLaMA, Qwen,\nMixtral) into MLA-based models. After conversion, the model can undergo\nadditional training to boost expressiveness without increasing the KV cache\nsize. Furthermore, we plan to develop MLA-specific inference acceleration\ntechniques to preserve low latency in transformed models, thus enabling more\nefficient distillation of Deepseek R1.",

The key quantities to be estimated are the ratios between\nthe marginal probabilities of two transitive states at all timesteps, called\nthe concrete score. In this paper, we reveal that the concrete score in\nabsorbing diffusion can be expressed as conditional probabilities of clean\ndata, multiplied by a time-dependent scalar in an analytic form.

Our study shows that, due to the recombination\nluminescence, the LArTPC functions as a self-compensating light calorimeter:\nthe missing energy in the hadronic component is compensated for by the\nincreased luminescence relative to the electromagnetic component. Using 0.5--5\nGeV electron neutrino charged current interactions as a case study, we show\nthat good compensation of the electron-to-hadron response ratio (e/h) from\n1--1.05 can be achieved across a broad range of drift electric fields (0.2--1.8\nkV/cm), with better performance for neutrino energies above 2 GeV. This study\nhighlights the potential of light calorimetry in LArTPCs for GeV neutrino\nenergy reconstruction, complementing traditional charge calorimetry. Under\nideal conditions of uniform light collection, we show that LArTPC light\ncalorimetry can achieve an energy resolution comparable to the charge imaging\ncalorimetry. Challenges arising from nonuniform light collection in large\nLArTPCs can be mitigated with a position-dependent light yield correction\nderived from 3D charge signal imaging.",

To tackle\nthese concerns, we present SphereFusion, an end-to-end framework that combines\nthe strengths of various projection methods. Specifically, SphereFusion\ninitially employs 2D image convolution and mesh operations to extract two\ndistinct types of features from the panorama image in both equirectangular and\nspherical projection domains. These features are then projected onto the\nspherical domain, where a gate fusion module selects the most reliable features\nfor fusion. Finally, SphereFusion estimates panorama depth within the spherical\ndomain. Meanwhile, SphereFusion employs a cache strategy to improve the\nefficiency of mesh operation. Extensive experiments on three public panorama\ndatasets demonstrate that SphereFusion achieves competitive results with other\nstate-of-the-art methods, while presenting the fastest inference speed at only\n17 ms on a 512$\\times$1024 panorama image.",

We\ndemonstrate the utility of MC3 on NVIDIA Orin AGX, Orin NX, and Orin Nano up to\na transmit rate of 6.4 kbps with less than 1% error rate."

However,\ncurrent approaches face significant challenges when composing these LoRAs for\nmulti-concept image generation, resulting in diminished generated image\nquality. In this paper, we initially investigate the role of LoRAs in the\ndenoising process through the lens of the Fourier frequency domain. Based on\nthe hypothesis that applying multiple LoRAs could lead to \"semantic conflicts\",\nwe find that certain LoRAs amplify high-frequency features such as edges and\ntextures, whereas others mainly focus on low-frequency elements, including the\noverall structure and smooth color gradients. Building on these insights, we\ndevise a frequency domain based sequencing strategy to determine the optimal\norder in which LoRAs should be integrated during inference. This strategy\noffers a methodical and generalizable solution compared to the naive\nintegration commonly found in existing LoRA fusion techniques. To fully\nleverage our proposed LoRA order sequence determination method in multi-LoRA\ncomposition tasks, we introduce a novel, training-free framework, Cached\nMulti-LoRA (CMLoRA), designed to efficiently integrate multiple LoRAs while\nmaintaining cohesive image generation. With its flexible backbone for\nmulti-LoRA fusion and a non-uniform caching strategy tailored to individual\nLoRAs, CMLoRA has the potential to reduce semantic conflicts in LoRA\ncomposition and improve computational efficiency.

The results demonstrate that EasySpec\ncan achieve a peak speedup of 4.17x compared to vanilla decoding, while\npreserving the original distribution of the base LLMs. Specifically, the\ndrafting stage can be accelerated by up to 1.62x with a maximum accuracy drop\nof only 7%, requiring no training or fine-tuning on the draft models."

The computational results for\nthese unchanged tokens are then reused in subsequent steps via KV-cache,\nthereby significantly improving the efficiency of the VLA-Cache model.\nExperimental results on both simulation (e.g., LIBERO benchmark and SIMPLER)\nand real-world robot valid VLA-Cache can achieve practical acceleration with\nminimal sacrifice in success rate."

In this paper, we propose LoRA-TTT, a\nnovel TTT method that leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), applied exclusively\nto the image encoder of VLMs. By introducing LoRA and updating only its\nparameters during test time, our method offers a simple yet effective TTT\napproach, retaining the model's initial generalization capability while\nachieving substantial performance gains with minimal memory and runtime\noverhead. Additionally, we introduce a highly efficient reconstruction loss\ntailored for TTT. Our method can adapt to diverse domains by combining these\ntwo losses, without increasing memory consumption or runtime. Extensive\nexperiments on two benchmarks, covering 15 datasets, demonstrate that our\nmethod improves the zero-shot top-1 accuracy of CLIP-ViT-B/16 by an average of\n5.79% on the OOD benchmark and 1.36% on the fine-grained benchmark, efficiently\nsurpassing test-time prompt tuning, without relying on any external models or\ncache.",

Quantizing the cache to lower bit widths\nis an effective way to reduce computational costs; however, previous methods\nstruggle with quantizing key vectors due to outliers, resulting in excessive\noverhead. We propose a novel quantization approach called PolarQuant, which\nefficiently addresses the outlier challenge. We observe that outliers typically\nappear in only one of two dimensions, which are rotated together by a specific\nangle when rotary position embeddings are applied. When represented as\ntwo-dimensional vectors, these dimensions exhibit well-structured patterns,\nwith radii and angles smoothly distributed in polar coordinates. This\nalleviates the challenge of outliers on per-channel quantization, making them\nwell-suited for quantization. Thus, PolarQuant divides key vectors into groups\nof two-dimensional sub-vectors, encoding them as the corresponding quantized\nradius and the polar angle, rather than quantizing original key vectors\ndirectly. PolarQuant achieves the superior efficiency in KV cache quantization\nand accelerates the decoding process by turning the query-key inner product\ninto a table lookup, all while maintaining the downstream performance of\nfull-precision models.",

                    "value": "The KV cache in large language models is a dominant factor in memory usage,\nlimiting their broader applicability. Quantizing the cache to lower bit widths\nis an effective way to reduce computational costs; however, previous methods\nstruggle with quantizing key vectors due to outliers, resulting in excessive\noverhead. We propose a novel quantization approach called PolarQuant, which\nefficiently addresses the outlier challenge. We observe that outliers typically\nappear in only one of two dimensions, which are rotated together by a specific\nangle when rotary position embeddings are applied. When represented as\ntwo-dimensional vectors, these dimensions exhibit well-structured patterns,\nwith radii and angles smoothly distributed in polar coordinates. This\nalleviates the challenge of outliers on per-channel quantization, making them\nwell-suited for quantization. Thus, PolarQuant divides key vectors into groups\nof two-dimensional sub-vectors, encoding them as the corresponding quantized\nradius and the polar angle, rather than quantizing original key vectors\ndirectly. PolarQuant achieves the superior efficiency in KV cache quantization\nand accelerates the decoding process by turning the query-key inner product\ninto a table lookup, all while maintaining the downstream performance of\nfull-precision models."

                "summary": "We introduce the State Stream Transformer (SST), a novel LLM architecture\nthat reveals emergent reasoning behaviours and capabilities latent in\npretrained weights through addressing a fundamental limitation in traditional\ntransformer models: the lack of latent computational continuity across\nautoregressive generations in the state space. SST introduces a sliding window\nlatent state (FFN) cache with weighted decay that maintains and evolves\npersistent latent processes throughout autoregressive generations. Through\ncontrolled experiments comparing base and SST architectures using the same\nfrozen weights, we demonstrate that this architectural modification alone\nenables enhanced reasoning capabilities which appear best explained by some\nform of potential higher-order processing, as evidenced by emergent\nmetacognitive behaviours.

SST introduces a sliding window\nlatent state (FFN) cache with weighted decay that maintains and evolves\npersistent latent processes throughout autoregressive generations. Through\ncontrolled experiments comparing base and SST architectures using the same\nfrozen weights, we demonstrate that this architectural modification alone\nenables enhanced reasoning capabilities which appear best explained by some\nform of potential higher-order processing, as evidenced by emergent\nmetacognitive behaviours.

In this paper, we introduce MME-CoT, a specialized benchmark\nevaluating the CoT reasoning performance of LMMs, spanning six domains: math,\nscience, OCR, logic, space-time, and general scenes. As the first comprehensive\nstudy in this area, we propose a thorough evaluation suite incorporating three\nnovel metrics that assess the reasoning quality, robustness, and efficiency at\na fine-grained level. Leveraging curated high-quality data and a unique\nevaluation strategy, we conduct an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art LMMs,\nuncovering several key insights: 1) Models with reflection mechanism\ndemonstrate a superior CoT quality, with Kimi k1.5 outperforming GPT-4o and\ndemonstrating the highest quality results; 2) CoT prompting often degrades LMM\nperformance on perception-heavy tasks, suggesting a potentially harmful\noverthinking behavior; and 3) Although the CoT quality is high, LMMs with\nreflection exhibit significant inefficiency in both normal response and\nself-correction phases. We hope MME-CoT serves as a foundation for advancing\nmultimodal reasoning in LMMs. Project Page: https://mmecot.github.io/",

To address both challenges we augment the recently proposed dual\nshape representation, which combines the benefits of a mesh and Gaussian\npoints, in two ways.

We introduce a new tuning and inference strategy named\nCoT-Valve, designed to allow models to generate reasoning chains of varying\nlengths. To achieve this, we propose to identify a direction in the parameter\nspace that, when manipulated, can effectively control the length of generated\nCoT.

We construct datasets with chains from long to short for the\nsame questions and explore two enhanced strategies for CoT-Valve: (1) a precise\nlength-compressible CoT tuning method, and (2) a progressive chain length\ncompression approach. Our experiments show that CoT-Valve successfully enables\ncontrollability and compressibility of the chain and shows better performance\nthan the prompt-based control.

PrefEval contains user personalization or preference\ninformation in both explicit and implicit forms, and evaluates LLM performance\nusing a generation and a classification task. With PrefEval, we evaluated the\naforementioned preference following capabilities of 10 open-source and\nproprietary LLMs in multi-session conversations with varying context lengths up\nto 100k tokens. We benchmark with various prompting, iterative feedback, and\nretrieval-augmented generation methods. Our benchmarking effort reveals that\nstate-of-the-art LLMs face significant challenges in proactively following\nusers' preferences during conversations. In particular, in zero-shot settings,\npreference following accuracy falls below 10% at merely 10 turns (~3k tokens)\nacross most evaluated models. Even with advanced prompting and retrieval\nmethods, preference following still deteriorates in long-context conversations.\nFurthermore, we show that fine-tuning on PrefEval significantly improves\nperformance.

Multi-head\nLatent Attention (MLA) tackles this challenge by using low-rank matrices in the\nkey-value (KV) layers, thereby allowing compressed latent KV states to be\ncached. This approach significantly reduces the KV cache size relative to\ntraditional multi-head attention, leading to faster inference. Moreover, MLA\nemploys an up-projection matrix to increase expressiveness, trading additional\ncomputation for reduced communication overhead. Although MLA has demonstrated\nefficiency and effectiveness in Deepseek V2/V3/R1, many major model providers\nstill rely on Group Query Attention (GQA) and have not announced any plans to\nadopt MLA. In this paper, we show that GQA can always be represented by MLA\nwhile maintaining the same KV cache overhead, but the converse does not hold.\nTo encourage broader use of MLA, we introduce TransMLA, a post-training method\nthat converts widely used GQA-based pre-trained models (e.g., LLaMA, Qwen,\nMixtral) into MLA-based models. After conversion, the model can undergo\nadditional training to boost expressiveness without increasing the KV cache\nsize.

Our study offers a new perspective on\nsocietal bias trends by bridging AI, literary studies, and social science\nresearch."

By using\nmulti-source simulators as the backend simulator, it can provide immediate\nenvironment feedback to LLMs, which enables LLMs to interact dynamically with\nthe environment and re-plan as necessary. We evaluated the state-of-the-art\nopen source and closed source foundation models, including GPT-4, LLAMA and\nMistral on our proposed benchmark. While they perform adequately well on simple\nnavigation tasks, their performance can significantly deteriorate when faced\nwith tasks that require a deeper understanding of spatial, temporal, and causal\nrelationships. Thus, our benchmark distinguishes itself as a large-scale,\nquantifiable, highly automated, and fine-grained diagnostic framework that\npresents a significant challenge to the latest foundation models. We hope it\ncan spark and drive further research in embodied task planning using foundation\nmodels."

We propose an approach to summary faithfulness evaluation in which\nmultiple LLM-based agents are assigned initial stances (regardless of what\ntheir belief might be) and forced to come up with a reason to justify the\nimposed belief, thus engaging in a multi-round debate to reach an agreement.\nThe uniformly distributed initial assignments result in a greater diversity of\nstances leading to more meaningful debates and ultimately more errors\nidentified.

The lack of systematic and automatic generation\nof solutions inevitably restricts their potential wider applications to\nwireless communication systems, due to the limited generalizability of coding\nschemes to wider network configurations. To address such an issue, this work\nmakes the first attempt to advocate revisiting topological interference\nalignment (IA) from a novel learning-to-code perspective. Specifically, we\nrecast the one-to-one and subspace IA conditions as vector assignment policies\nand propose a unifying learning-to-code on graphs (LCG) framework by leveraging\ngraph neural networks (GNNs) for capturing topological structures and\nreinforcement learning (RL) for decision-making of IA beamforming vector\nassignment. Interestingly, the proposed LCG framework is capable of recovering\nknown one-to-one scalar/vector IA solutions for a significantly wider range of\nnetwork topologies, and more remarkably of discovering new subspace IA coding\nschemes for multiple-antenna cases that are challenging to be handcrafted. The\nextensive experiments demonstrate that the LCG framework is an effective way to\nautomatically produce systematic coding solutions to the TIM instances with\narbitrary network topologies, and at the same time, the underlying learning\nalgorithm is efficient with respect to online inference time and possesses\nexcellent generalizability and transferability for practical deployment.",

We evaluate pre-translation strategies across 35 languages covering\nboth low and high-resource languages, on various tasks including Question\nAnswering (QA), Natural Language Inference (NLI), Named Entity Recognition\n(NER), and Abstractive Summarization. Our experiments show the impact of\nfactors as similarity to English, translation quality and the size of\npre-trained data, on the model performance with pre-translation. We suggest\npractical guidelines for choosing optimal strategies in various multilingual\nsettings."

While\nsupervised approaches have achieved superior performance, they are constrained\nby the scarcity and high cost of 3D vision-language datasets. On the other\nhand, LLM/VLM based agents are proposed for 3DVG, eliminating the need for\ntraining data. However, these methods incur prohibitive time and token costs\nduring inference. To address the challenges, we introduce a novel training-free\nsymbolic framework for 3D visual grounding, namely Evolvable Symbolic Visual\nGrounder, that offers significantly reduced inference costs compared to\nprevious agent-based methods while maintaining comparable performance. EaSe\nuses LLM generated codes to compute on spatial relationships. EaSe also\nimplements an automatic pipeline to evaluate and optimize the quality of these\ncodes and integrate VLMs to assist in the grounding process. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that EaSe achieves 52.9% accuracy on Nr3D dataset and 49.2%\nAcc@0.25 on ScanRefer, which is top-tier among training-free methods. Moreover,\nit substantially reduces the inference time and cost, offering a balanced\ntrade-off between performance and efficiency. Codes are available at\nhttps://github.com/OpenRobotLab/EaSe.",

To address these challenges, we\nintroduce ACEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing tool usage in LLMs.\nACEBench categorizes data into three primary types based on evaluation\nmethodology: Normal, Special, and Agent. \"Normal\" evaluates tool usage in basic\nscenarios; \"Special\" evaluates tool usage in situations with ambiguous or\nincomplete instructions; \"Agent\" evaluates tool usage through multi-agent\ninteractions to simulate real-world, multi-turn dialogues. We conducted\nextensive experiments using ACEBench, analyzing various LLMs in-depth and\nproviding a more granular examination of error causes across different data\ntypes."

Recently, deep neural networks have shown great\npotential for reconstructing high-fidelity images from highly undersampled\nmeasurements in the frequency space. However, one needs to train multiple\nmodels for different undersampling patterns and desired output image\nresolutions, since most networks operate on a fixed discretization. Such\napproaches are highly impractical in clinical settings, where undersampling\npatterns and image resolutions are frequently changed to accommodate different\nreal-time imaging and diagnostic requirements.\n  We propose a unified model robust to different measurement undersampling\npatterns and image resolutions in compressed sensing MRI. Our model is based on\nneural operators, a discretization-agnostic architecture. Neural operators are\nemployed in both image and measurement space, which capture local and global\nimage features for MRI reconstruction. Empirically, we achieve consistent\nperformance across different undersampling rates and patterns, with an average\n11 percent SSIM and 4dB PSNR improvement over a state-of-the-art CNN,\nEnd-to-End VarNet. For efficiency, our inference speed is also 1,400x faster\nthan diffusion methods. The resolution-agnostic design also enhances zero-shot\nsuper-resolution and extended field of view in reconstructed images. Our\nunified model offers a versatile solution for MRI, adapting seamlessly to\nvarious measurement undersampling and imaging resolutions, making it highly\neffective for flexible and reliable clinical imaging.

To address\nthis challenge, we propose AnomalyGFM, a GAD-oriented graph foundation model\nthat supports zero-shot inference and few-shot prompt tuning for GAD in diverse\ngraph datasets. One key insight is that graph-agnostic representations for\nnormal and abnormal classes are required to support effective zero/few-shot GAD\nacross different graphs. Motivated by this, AnomalyGFM is pre-trained to align\ndata-independent, learnable normal and abnormal class prototypes with node\nrepresentation residuals (i.e., representation deviation of a node from its\nneighbors). The residual features essentially project the node information into\na unified feature space where we can effectively measure the abnormality of\nnodes from different graphs in a consistent way. This provides a driving force\nfor the learning of graph-agnostic, discriminative prototypes for the normal\nand abnormal classes, which can be used to enable zero-shot GAD on new graphs,\nincluding very large-scale graphs. If there are few-shot labeled normal nodes\navailable in the new graphs, AnomalyGFM can further support prompt tuning to\nleverage these nodes for better adaptation. Comprehensive experiments on 11\nwidely-used GAD datasets with real anomalies, demonstrate that AnomalyGFM\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods under both zero-\nand few-shot GAD settings.",

Our\napproach uses an LLM and ASP (Answer Set Programming) solver to translate a\nuser query to a representation in Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL)\nvia an intermediate representation in ASP.

In this paper, we introduce AtomR, a framework for LLMs to conduct\naccurate heterogeneous knowledge reasoning at the atomic level. Inspired by how\nknowledge graph query languages model compositional reasoning through combining\npredefined operations, we propose three atomic knowledge operators, a unified\nset of operators for LLMs to retrieve and manipulate knowledge from\nheterogeneous sources.

Computer science researchers, on the\nother hand, commonly study privacy issues through privacy attacks and defenses\non segmented fields. Privacy research is conducted on various sub-fields,\nincluding Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Computer\nNetworks. Within each field, privacy has its own formulation. Though pioneering\nworks on attacks and defenses reveal sensitive privacy issues, they are\nnarrowly trapped and cannot fully cover people's actual privacy concerns.\nConsequently, the research on general and human-centric privacy research\nremains rather unexplored. In this paper, we formulate the privacy issue as a\nreasoning problem rather than simple pattern matching. We ground on the\nContextual Integrity (CI) theory which posits that people's perceptions of\nprivacy are highly correlated with the corresponding social context. Based on\nsuch an assumption, we develop the first comprehensive checklist that covers\nsocial identities, private attributes, and existing privacy regulations. Unlike\nprior works on CI that either cover limited expert annotated norms or model\nincomplete social context, our proposed privacy checklist uses the whole Health\nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) as an example, to\nshow that we can resort to large language models (LLMs) to completely cover the\nHIPAA's regulations. Additionally, our checklist also gathers expert\nannotations across multiple ontologies to determine private information\nincluding but not limited to personally identifiable information (PII).

In addition, traditional training approaches rely\ntoo much on expert-labeled data, setting a ceiling on the performance of LLMs.\nTo address this issue, we propose a novel paradigm named LANCE (LANguage models\nas Continuous self-Evolving data engineers) that enables LLMs to train\nthemselves by autonomously generating, cleaning, reviewing, and annotating data\nwith preference information. Our approach demonstrates that LLMs can serve as\ncontinuous self-evolving data engineers, significantly reducing the time and\ncost of the post-training data construction. Through iterative fine-tuning on\nQwen2 series models, we validate the effectiveness of LANCE across various\ntasks, showing that it can maintain high-quality data generation and\ncontinuously improve model performance. Across multiple benchmark dimensions,\nLANCE results in an average score enhancement of 3.64 for Qwen2-7B and 1.75 for\nQwen2-7B-Instruct. This training paradigm with autonomous data construction not\nonly reduces the reliance on human experts or external models but also ensures\nthat the data aligns with human preferences, paving the way for the development\nof future superintelligent systems that can exceed human capabilities.

Leveraging curated high-quality data and a unique\nevaluation strategy, we conduct an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art LMMs,\nuncovering several key insights: 1) Models with reflection mechanism\ndemonstrate a superior CoT quality, with Kimi k1.5 outperforming GPT-4o and\ndemonstrating the highest quality results; 2) CoT prompting often degrades LMM\nperformance on perception-heavy tasks, suggesting a potentially harmful\noverthinking behavior; and 3) Although the CoT quality is high, LMMs with\nreflection exhibit significant inefficiency in both normal response and\nself-correction phases.

In this paper, we present the first\ncomprehensive investigation into the potential of encoder-free architectures to\novercome the challenges of encoder-based 3D Large Multimodal Models (LMMs).\nThese challenges include the failure to adapt to varying point cloud\nresolutions and the point features from the encoder not meeting the semantic\nneeds of Large Language Models (LLMs). We identify key aspects for 3D LMMs to\nremove the encoder and enable the LLM to assume the role of the 3D encoder: 1)\nWe propose the LLM-embedded Semantic Encoding strategy in the pre-training\nstage, exploring the effects of various point cloud self-supervised losses. And\nwe present the Hybrid Semantic Loss to extract high-level semantics. 2) We\nintroduce the Hierarchical Geometry Aggregation strategy in the instruction\ntuning stage. This incorporates inductive bias into the LLM early layers to\nfocus on the local details of the point clouds. To the end, we present the\nfirst Encoder-free 3D LMM, ENEL. Our 7B model rivals the current\nstate-of-the-art model, ShapeLLM-13B, achieving 55.0%, 50.92%, and 42.7% on the\nclassification, captioning, and VQA tasks, respectively.

This reward\ncan guide the inference-time best-of-N sampling strategy to improve citation\nquality significantly, as well as be used in preference optimization to\ndirectly fine-tune the models for generating better citations.

This technical report\npresents a configurable knowledge integrated multi-agent system, KIMAs, to\naddress these challenges. KIMAs features a flexible and configurable system for\nintegrating diverse knowledge sources with 1) context management and query\nrewrite mechanisms to improve retrieval accuracy and multi-turn conversational\ncoherency, 2) efficient knowledge routing and retrieval, 3) simple but\neffective filter and reference generation mechanisms, and 4) optimized\nparallelizable multi-agent pipeline execution. Our work provides a scalable\nframework for advancing the deployment of LLMs in real-world settings. To show\nhow KIMAs can help developers build knowledge-intensive applications with\ndifferent scales and emphases, we demonstrate how we configure the system to\nthree applications already running in practice with reliable performance.",

Multi-head\nLatent Attention (MLA) tackles this challenge by using low-rank matrices in the\nkey-value (KV) layers, thereby allowing compressed latent KV states to be\ncached. This approach significantly reduces the KV cache size relative to\ntraditional multi-head attention, leading to faster inference. Moreover, MLA\nemploys an up-projection matrix to increase expressiveness, trading additional\ncomputation for reduced communication overhead. Although MLA has demonstrated\nefficiency and effectiveness in Deepseek V2/V3/R1, many major model providers\nstill rely on Group Query Attention (GQA) and have not announced any plans to\nadopt MLA. In this paper, we show that GQA can always be represented by MLA\nwhile maintaining the same KV cache overhead, but the converse does not hold.\nTo encourage broader use of MLA, we introduce TransMLA, a post-training method\nthat converts widely used GQA-based pre-trained models (e.g., LLaMA, Qwen,\nMixtral) into MLA-based models. After conversion, the model can undergo\nadditional training to boost expressiveness without increasing the KV cache\nsize. Furthermore, we plan to develop MLA-specific inference acceleration\ntechniques to preserve low latency in transformed models, thus enabling more\nefficient distillation of Deepseek R1.",

In these\ncases, trust as a generalisation of correctness fares better. One way to\nunderstand it is to say that a probabilistic computational process is\ntrustworthy if the frequency of its outputs is compliant with a probability\ndistribution which models its expected behaviour. We present a formal\ncomputational framework that formalises this idea. In order to do so, we define\na typed lambda-calculus that features operators for conducting experiments at\nruntime on probabilistic programs and for evaluating whether they compute\noutputs as determined by a target probability distribution. After proving some\nfundamental computational properties of the calculus, such as progress and\ntermination, we define a static notion of confidence that allows to prove that\nour notion of trust behaves correctly with respect to the basic tenets of\nprobability theory.",

In these\ncases, trust as a generalisation of correctness fares better. One way to\nunderstand it is to say that a probabilistic computational process is\ntrustworthy if the frequency of its outputs is compliant with a probability\ndistribution which models its expected behaviour. We present a formal\ncomputational framework that formalises this idea. In order to do so, we define\na typed lambda-calculus that features operators for conducting experiments at\nruntime on probabilistic programs and for evaluating whether they compute\noutputs as determined by a target probability distribution. After proving some\nfundamental computational properties of the calculus, such as progress and\ntermination, we define a static notion of confidence that allows to prove that\nour notion of trust behaves correctly with respect to the basic tenets of\nprobability theory."

We here ask whether similar specialization for language\nemerges in LLMs. We identify language-selective units within 18 popular LLMs,\nusing the same localization approach that is used in neuroscience. We then\nestablish the causal role of these units by demonstrating that ablating LLM\nlanguage-selective units -- but not random units -- leads to drastic deficits\nin language tasks. Correspondingly, language-selective LLM units are more\naligned to brain recordings from the human language system than random units.\nFinally, we investigate whether our localization method extends to other\ncognitive domains: while we find specialized networks in some LLMs for\nreasoning and social capabilities, there are substantial differences among\nmodels. These findings provide functional and causal evidence for\nspecialization in large language models, and highlight parallels with the\nfunctional organization in the brain.",

Traditional navigation methods, which depend on\nhigh-precision maps, are resource-intensive, while learning-based approaches\noften struggle with generalization in real-world scenarios. To address these\nchallenges, this work proposes the Openstreetmap-enhanced oPen-air sEmantic\nNavigation (OPEN) system that combines foundation models with classic\nalgorithms for scalable outdoor navigation.

Exposing this knowledge as logic programs enables sound\nreasoning methods that can verify alignment of LLM outputs to their intended\nuses and extend their inference capabilities. We study new execution methods\nfor the generated programs, including soft-unification of abducible facts\nagainst LLM-generated content stored in a vector database as well as GPU-based\nacceleration of minimal model computation that supports inference with large\nLLM-generated programs."

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on\nvarious tasks, while the further evolvement is limited to the lack of\nhigh-quality training data. In addition, traditional training approaches rely\ntoo much on expert-labeled data, setting a ceiling on the performance of LLMs.\nTo address this issue, we propose a novel paradigm named LANCE (LANguage models\nas Continuous self-Evolving data engineers) that enables LLMs to train\nthemselves by autonomously generating, cleaning, reviewing, and annotating data\nwith preference information. Our approach demonstrates that LLMs can serve as\ncontinuous self-evolving data engineers, significantly reducing the time and\ncost of the post-training data construction. Through iterative fine-tuning on\nQwen2 series models, we validate the effectiveness of LANCE across various\ntasks, showing that it can maintain high-quality data generation and\ncontinuously improve model performance. Across multiple benchmark dimensions,\nLANCE results in an average score enhancement of 3.64 for Qwen2-7B and 1.75 for\nQwen2-7B-Instruct.

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on\nvarious tasks, while the further evolvement is limited to the lack of\nhigh-quality training data. In addition, traditional training approaches rely\ntoo much on expert-labeled data, setting a ceiling on the performance of LLMs.\nTo address this issue, we propose a novel paradigm named LANCE (LANguage models\nas Continuous self-Evolving data engineers) that enables LLMs to train\nthemselves by autonomously generating, cleaning, reviewing, and annotating data\nwith preference information. Our approach demonstrates that LLMs can serve as\ncontinuous self-evolving data engineers, significantly reducing the time and\ncost of the post-training data construction. Through iterative fine-tuning on\nQwen2 series models, we validate the effectiveness of LANCE across various\ntasks, showing that it can maintain high-quality data generation and\ncontinuously improve model performance. Across multiple benchmark dimensions,\nLANCE results in an average score enhancement of 3.64 for Qwen2-7B and 1.75 for\nQwen2-7B-Instruct. This training paradigm with autonomous data construction not\nonly reduces the reliance on human experts or external models but also ensures\nthat the data aligns with human preferences, paving the way for the development\nof future superintelligent systems that can exceed human capabilities.

Current content moderation systems, which primarily rely on input\nprompt filtering, have proven insufficient, with techniques like Best-of-N\n(BoN) jailbreaking achieving success rates of 80% or more against popular LLMs.\nIn this paper, we introduce Flexible LLM-Assisted Moderation Engine (FLAME): a\nnew approach that shifts the focus from input filtering to output moderation.\nUnlike traditional circuit-breaking methods that analyze user queries, FLAME\nevaluates model responses, offering several key advantages: (1) computational\nefficiency in both training and inference, (2) enhanced resistance to BoN\njailbreaking attacks, and (3) flexibility in defining and updating safety\ncriteria through customizable topic filtering. Our experiments demonstrate that\nFLAME significantly outperforms current moderation systems. For example, FLAME\nreduces attack success rate in GPT-4o-mini and DeepSeek-v3 by a factor of ~9,\nwhile maintaining low computational overhead. We provide comprehensive\nevaluation on various LLMs and analyze the engine's efficiency against the\nstate-of-the-art jailbreaking. This work contributes to the development of more\nrobust and adaptable content moderation systems for LLMs.",

Overall, results indicated an accuracy of around 80%, with some\nvariability between domains (82% for human clinical, 80% for animal, and 72%\nfor studies of human social sciences). Causal inference methods and study\ndesign were the data extraction items with the most errors. In the PICO study,\nparticipants and intervention/control showed high accuracy (>80%), outcomes\nwere more challenging.

                "summary": "Recommender systems are crucial for personalizing user experiences but often\ndepend on implicit feedback data, which can be noisy and misleading. Existing\ndenoising studies involve incorporating auxiliary information or learning\nstrategies from interaction data. However, they struggle with the inherent\nlimitations of external knowledge and interaction data, as well as the\nnon-universality of certain predefined assumptions, hindering accurate noise\nidentification. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have gained attention\nfor their extensive world knowledge and reasoning abilities, yet their\npotential in enhancing denoising in recommendations remains underexplored. In\nthis paper, we introduce LLaRD, a framework leveraging LLMs to improve\ndenoising in recommender systems, thereby boosting overall recommendation\nperformance. Specifically, LLaRD generates denoising-related knowledge by first\nenriching semantic insights from observational data via LLMs and inferring\nuser-item preference knowledge. It then employs a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\ntechnique over user-item interaction graphs to reveal relation knowledge for\ndenoising. Finally, it applies the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle to\nalign LLM-generated denoising knowledge with recommendation targets, filtering\nout noise and irrelevant LLM knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate LLaRD's\neffectiveness in enhancing denoising and recommendation accuracy.",

                    "value": "Recommender systems are crucial for personalizing user experiences but often\ndepend on implicit feedback data, which can be noisy and misleading. Existing\ndenoising studies involve incorporating auxiliary information or learning\nstrategies from interaction data. However, they struggle with the inherent\nlimitations of external knowledge and interaction data, as well as the\nnon-universality of certain predefined assumptions, hindering accurate noise\nidentification. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have gained attention\nfor their extensive world knowledge and reasoning abilities, yet their\npotential in enhancing denoising in recommendations remains underexplored. In\nthis paper, we introduce LLaRD, a framework leveraging LLMs to improve\ndenoising in recommender systems, thereby boosting overall recommendation\nperformance. Specifically, LLaRD generates denoising-related knowledge by first\nenriching semantic insights from observational data via LLMs and inferring\nuser-item preference knowledge. It then employs a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\ntechnique over user-item interaction graphs to reveal relation knowledge for\ndenoising. Finally, it applies the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle to\nalign LLM-generated denoising knowledge with recommendation targets, filtering\nout noise and irrelevant LLM knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate LLaRD's\neffectiveness in enhancing denoising and recommendation accuracy."
