Yet, the size of\nthe KV cache grows proportionally with the input length, burdening both memory\nbandwidth and capacity as decoding progresses. To address this challenge, we\npresent RocketKV, a training-free KV cache compression strategy containing two\nconsecutive stages. In the first stage, it performs coarse-grain permanent KV\ncache eviction on the input sequence tokens. In the second stage, it adopts a\nhybrid sparse attention method to conduct fine-grain top-k sparse attention,\napproximating the attention scores by leveraging both head and sequence\ndimensionality reductions. We show that RocketKV provides a compression ratio\nof up to 400$\\times$, end-to-end speedup of up to 3.7$\\times$ as well as peak\nmemory reduction of up to 32.6% in the decode phase on an NVIDIA A100 GPU\ncompared to the full KV cache baseline, while achieving negligible accuracy\nloss on a variety of long-context tasks. We also propose a variant of RocketKV\nfor multi-turn scenarios, which consistently outperforms other existing methods\nand achieves accuracy nearly on par with an oracle top-k attention scheme.

Among\nvarious TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving\nhistorical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering\nefficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability\nchallenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts,\ncausing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation\nperformance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible\ndecision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA)\nmethod that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from\ntwo perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample\nselection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware\nEntropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight\nentropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low\nentropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method\nleverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and\nfacilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven\nDistribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as\nmultivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for\nmore accurate predictions across visually diverse content.

In this work, we propose a novel\ninput-adaptive navigation method to enhance VLN model efficiency. We first show\nthat existing input-adaptive mechanisms fail to reduce computations without\nsubstantial performance degradation. To address this, we introduce three\nadaptive algorithms, each deployed at a different level: (1) To improve spatial\nefficiency, we selectively process panoramic views at each observation of an\nagent. (2) To improve intra-model efficiency, we propose importance-based\nadaptive thresholding for the early-exit methods. (3) To improve temporal\nefficiency, we implement a caching mechanism that prevents reprocessing of\nviews previously seen by the agent. In evaluations on seven VLN benchmarks, we\ndemonstrate over a 2$\\times$ reduction in computation across three\noff-the-shelf agents in both standard and continuous environments.

However, serving a wide range of adapters introduces several and\nsubstantial overheads, leading to performance degradation and challenges in\noptimal placement.

Extensive experiments on real mobile edge testbeds\ndemonstrate that CoMoE achieves approximately 70% reduction in memory usage\ncompared to baseline methods, 10.5% lower inference latency than existing\nexpert offloading techniques, while maintaining model performance stability.\nFor large-scale MoE models (e.g,7.4B-parameter Switch-Base-128), the CoMoE\nreduces memory requirements from 15.6GB to 4.7GB, enabling deployment on\nresource-constrained mobile edge devices that previously could only support\nmuch smaller models."

Rather than caching keys and\nvalues separately, MLA stores their compressed latent representations, reducing\nmemory overhead while maintaining the performance. While MLA improves memory\nefficiency without compromising language model accuracy, its major limitation\nlies in its integration during the pre-training phase, requiring models to be\ntrained from scratch. This raises a key question: can we use MLA's benefits\nfully or partially in models that have already been pre-trained with different\nattention mechanisms? In this paper, we propose X-EcoMLA to deploy post\ntraining distillation to enable the upcycling of Transformer-based attention\ninto an efficient hybrid MLA variant through lightweight post-training\nadaptation, bypassing the need for extensive pre-training. We demonstrate that\nleveraging the dark knowledge of a well-trained model can enhance training\naccuracy and enable extreme KV cache compression in MLA without compromising\nmodel performance. The experimental results show that our proposed method can\neffectively compress the KV cache while preserving the performance on the\nbenchmarks; specifically, for Llama3.2-1B-Instruct baseline, a 6.4x compression\nachieves the same average score by using only 3.6B training tokens and 70 GPU\nhours on AMD MI300, whereas a 10.6x compression have less than 0.1% average\nscore drop with 7B training tokens and 140 GPU hours.

While exact algorithms based on MILP, CP, SAT, or dynamic\nprogramming guarantee optimality, they often suffer from poor anytime behavior\n-- meaning they struggle to find high-quality decision trees quickly when the\nsearch is stopped before completion -- due to unbalanced search space\nexploration. To address this, several anytime extensions of exact methods have\nbeen proposed, such as LDS-DL8.5, Top-k-DL8.5, and Blossom, but they have not\nbeen systematically compared, making it difficult to assess their relative\neffectiveness. In this paper, we propose CA-DL8.5, a generic, complete, and\nanytime beam search algorithm that extends the DL8.5 framework and unifies some\nexisting anytime strategies. In particular, CA-DL8.5 generalizes previous\napproaches LDS-DL8.5 and Top-k-DL8.5, by allowing the integration of various\nheuristics and relaxation mechanisms through a modular design. The algorithm\nreuses DL8.5's efficient branch-and-bound pruning and trie-based caching,\ncombined with a restart-based beam search that gradually relaxes pruning\ncriteria to improve solution quality over time. Our contributions are twofold:\n(1) We introduce this new generic framework for exact and anytime decision tree\nlearning, enabling the incorporation of diverse heuristics and search\nstrategies; (2) We conduct a rigorous empirical comparison of several\ninstantiations of CA-DL8.5 -- based on Purity, Gain, Discrepancy, and Top-k\nheuristics -- using an anytime evaluation metric called the primal gap\nintegral. Experimental results on standard classification benchmarks show that\nCA-DL8.5 using LDS (limited discrepancy) consistently provides the best anytime\nperformance, outperforming both other CA-DL8.5 variants and the Blossom\nalgorithm while maintaining completeness and optimality guarantees.",

Empirically, D2F\ndLLMs achieve more than $\\mathbf{2.5\\times}$ inference speed than LLaMA3 and\nQwen2.5 on GSM8K. Compared to vanilla dLLMs like LLaDA and Dream, the\nacceleration can be more than $\\mathbf{50\\times}$ while maintaining comparable\noutput quality.

The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy\nare further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method.

We then decide which\ntokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to\navoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information\nflow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most\nrepresentative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the\ndiscrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning,\nthereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs.\nExperiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while\nmaintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache\nmemory and 3.8 times faster inference.",

In this paper, we propose p-MoD, an efficient MLLM\narchitecture that significantly reduces training and inference costs while\nmaintaining model performance. The majority of computation in MLLMs stems from\nthe overwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer-based\nLLM. Accordingly, we leverage the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each\nLLM layer selects essential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant\nones. However, integrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the\nchallenges of training and inference stability as well as limited training\ndata, we adapt the MoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight\nnormalization (TanhNorm) and symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we\nobserve that vision tokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layers and thus\ndesign a progressive ratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the\ntoken retention ratio layer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This\ncrucial design fully unleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the\nefficiency and performance of our models. Extensive experiments on two baseline\nmodels across 15 benchmarks show that our model matches or even surpasses the\nperformance of corresponding baselines, while requiring only 55.6% TFLOPs and\n53.7% KV cache storage during inference, and 77.7% GPU hours during training.",

                "summary": "Modern large-scale services such as search engines, messaging platforms, and\nserverless functions, rely on key-value (KV) stores to maintain high\nperformance at scale. When such services are deployed in constrained memory\nenvironments, they present challenging requirements: point operations requiring\nhigh throughput, working sets much larger than main memory, and natural skew in\nkey access patterns. Traditional KV stores, based on LSM- and B-Trees, have\nbeen widely used to handle such use cases, but they often suffer from\nsuboptimal use of modern hardware resources. The FASTER project, developed as a\nhigh-performance open-source KV storage library, has demonstrated remarkable\nsuccess in both in-memory and hybrid storage environments. However, when tasked\nwith serving large skewed workloads, it faced challenges, including high\nindexing and compactions overheads, and inefficient management of\nnon-overlapping read-hot and write-hot working sets.\n  In this paper, we introduce F2 (for FASTER v2), an evolution of FASTER\ndesigned to meet the requirements of large skewed workloads common in industry\napplications. F2 adopts a two-tier record-oriented design to handle\nlarger-than-memory skewed workloads, along with new concurrent latch-free\nmechanisms and components to maximize performance on modern hardware. To\nrealize this design, F2 tackles key challenges and introduces several\ninnovations, including new latch-free algorithms for multi-threaded log\ncompaction, a two-level hash index to reduce indexing overhead for cold\nrecords, and a read-cache for serving read-hot records. Our evaluation shows\nthat F2 achieves 2-11.9x better throughput compared to existing KV stores,\neffectively serving the target workload. F2 is open-source and available as\npart of the FASTER project.",

Rhea is a unified framework that streamlines the\ndesign and system-level validation of RTL cache-coherent memory subsystems. On\nthe design side, Rhea generates synthesizable, highly configurable RTL\nsupporting various architectural parameters. On the validation side, Rhea\nintegrates Verilator's cycle-accurate RTL simulation with gem5's full-system\nsimulation, allowing realistic workloads and operating systems to run alongside\nthe actual RTL under test.

Rhea is a unified framework that streamlines the\ndesign and system-level validation of RTL cache-coherent memory subsystems. On\nthe design side, Rhea generates synthesizable, highly configurable RTL\nsupporting various architectural parameters. On the validation side, Rhea\nintegrates Verilator's cycle-accurate RTL simulation with gem5's full-system\nsimulation, allowing realistic workloads and operating systems to run alongside\nthe actual RTL under test.

Despite the\nadvancements, their practical deployment faces challenges, including high\nfinancial costs, long response time, and varying performance, especially when\nhandling a large number of queries (jobs). Existing optimization strategies for\ndeploying LLMs for diverse tasks focus on static scheduling, which requires\nextensive training data for performance prediction, increasing the\ncomputational costs and limiting the applicability and flexibility. In this\npaper, we propose the SmartLLMs Scheduler (SLS), a dynamic and cost-effective\nscheduling solution. The key idea is to learn LLMs' performance on diverse\ntasks and incorporate their real-time feedback to update strategies\nperiodically. Specifically, SLS incorporates three key components, including an\nAdaptive Cache Manager, a Performance-Cost Optimized Scheduler, and a Dynamic\nUpdate Manager. The Cache Manager stores the outputs of previously processed\nqueries and employs an adaptive strategy to reduce redundant computations and\nminimize response times. For queries not found in the cache, the Scheduler\ndynamically allocates them to the most suitable LLM based on the predicted\nperformance and cost from models that take both query-specific and LLM-specific\nfeatures as input. The Update Manager continuously refines the cache and\nscheduling strategies based on real-time feedback from the assigned queries to\nenhance decision-making and adapt to evolving task characteristics. To evaluate\nthe effectiveness of SLS, we conduct extensive experiments on two LLM-based\nsoftware engineering tasks, including log parsing and code generation. The\nresults show that SLS significantly outperforms the baseline methods, achieving\nan average performance improvement of 198.82% and an average processing time\nreduction of 63.28%.",

Minimizing last-level cache misses is key to\nmaximizing in-memory index performance, making high cache locality essential.\nIn this paper, we present a practical concurrent B-skiplist that enhances cache\nlocality and performance while preserving the simplicity of traditional\nskiplist structures and concurrency control schemes.

However, this progress comes at the cost of a substantial increase\nin memory usage during inference, primarily due to the linear growth of the\nkey-value~(KV) cache. Existing KV cache compression methods often discard less\nrelevant tokens, which can lead to significant performance degradation when\ncritical information is lost. In this paper, we propose \\textsc{PoD}~(Proximal\ntokens over Distant tokens), a novel KV cache compression framework that\nallocates memory according to token importance, retaining less important tokens\nin a more compact, shared form rather than discarding them entirely. Our\napproach is motivated by two key observations: (1) proximal tokens -- those at\nthe beginning and end of the context -- are significantly more important for\nnext-token prediction, and (2) attention scores for distant tokens are highly\nredundant across consecutive layers. Leveraging these insights, \\textsc{PoD}\npreserves the full KV cache for proximal tokens, while for distant tokens, it\nshares key states across layers. Since attention scores are determined by both\nqueries and keys, sharing key states enables multiple layers to reuse a single\nset of keys for distant tokens, substantially reducing KV cache memory without\ndiscarding essential context. We further introduce a lightweight post-training\nadaptation to enable the model to adjust to this new attention-sharing\nstructure. Extensive experiments on both synthetic~(Needle in a Haystack) and\nreal-world long-context benchmarks demonstrate that \\textsc{PoD} reduces KV\ncache memory usage by up to 35\\% without compromising performance. Our method\nis orthogonal to existing token-selection-based techniques and can be combined\nwith them for further KV cache compression.",

These combined methodologies\ndemonstrably enhance network throughput, elevate cache hit ratios, and\nconsequently, reduce content delivery latency compared to conventional CCN\nimplementations."

This\nefficient codec and fast chunk-autoregressive architecture also make the model\nhighly effective for generating long-form content, such as podcasts.\nExperiments on podcast datasets demonstrate its capability to efficiently\ngenerate high-quality zero-shot podcasts."

In our experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves\nstrong performance on video benchmarks, reaching 65.1% and 71.1% accuracy on\nVideoMME without and with subtitles, respectively, and consistently\noutperforming LongVILA-7B across multiple benchmarks.

We release SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B and\nSmallThinker-21B-A3B, which achieve state-of-the-art performance scores and\neven outperform larger LLMs. Remarkably, our co-designed system mostly\neliminates the need for expensive GPU hardware: with Q4_0 quantization, both\nmodels exceed 20 tokens/s on ordinary consumer CPUs, while consuming only 1GB\nand 8GB of memory respectively. SmallThinker is publicly available at\nhf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-4BA0.6B-Instruct and\nhf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-21BA3B-Instruct."

Our work differs from existing video\nbenchmarks through the following key features: 1) Knowledge required: demanding\nintegration of external knowledge beyond the video's explicit narrative; 2)\nMulti-hop fact-seeking question: Each question involves multiple explicit facts\nand requires strict factual grounding without hypothetical or subjective\ninferences. We also include per-hop single-fact-based sub-QAs alongside final\nQAs to enable fine-grained, stepby-step evaluation; 3) Short-form definitive\nanswer: Answers are crafted as unambiguous and definitively correct in a short\nformat with minimal scoring variance; 4) Temporal grounded required: Requiring\nanswers to rely on one or more temporal segments in videos, rather than single\nframes. We extensively evaluate 33 state-of-the-art LVLMs and summarize key\nfindings as follows: 1) Current LVLMs exhibit notable deficiencies in factual\nadherence, with the best-performing model o3 merely achieving an F-score of\n66.3%; 2) Most LVLMs are overconfident in what they generate, with self-stated\nconfidence exceeding actual accuracy; 3) Retrieval-augmented generation\ndemonstrates consistent improvements at the cost of additional inference time\noverhead; 4) Multi-hop QA demonstrates substantially degraded performance\ncompared to single-hop sub-QAs, with first-hop object or event recognition\nemerging as the primary bottleneck.

To support\ntraining and evaluation, we introduce the Multimodal Coding Dataset (MCD), a\nlarge-scale and diverse collection of 598k samples, including high-quality HTML\ncode, chart image-code pairs, image-augmented StackOverflow QA, and algorithmic\nproblems. Furthermore, we propose InfiBench-V, a novel and challenging\nbenchmark specifically designed to assess models on visually-rich, real-world\nprogramming questions that demand a nuanced understanding of both textual and\nvisual contexts. Extensive experiments show that VisCodex achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs and approaches proprietary\nmodels like GPT-4o, highlighting the effectiveness of our model merging\nstrategy and new datasets."

AAA-level Simulation: We design\na highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based\nshift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS\ninteractive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical\nautoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into\nopen-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the\nVDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive\nvideo generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from\ndifferent domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to\nblend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to\nuser prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that\nexplicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering,\nenabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through\ntext. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing\ninteractive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a\ncomprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the\nnext generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment.

                    "value": "We present Yan, a foundational framework for interactive video generation,\ncovering the entire pipeline from simulation and generation to editing.\nSpecifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design\na highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based\nshift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS\ninteractive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical\nautoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into\nopen-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the\nVDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive\nvideo generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from\ndifferent domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to\nblend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to\nuser prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that\nexplicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering,\nenabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through\ntext. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing\ninteractive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a\ncomprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the\nnext generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment.

Experiments\nshow that, while maintaining the original recommendation accuracy, our methods\ncut latency to less than 30% of the baseline and more than double system\nthroughput, offering a practical solution for deploying large-scale online\nrecommendation services."

This framework combines\nwhole-body bilateral teleoperation with an online multi-stage object inertial\nparameter estimation module, which is the core technical contribution of this\nwork. The multi-stage process sequentially integrates a vision-based object\nsize estimator, an initial parameter guess generated by a large vision-language\nmodel (VLM), and a decoupled hierarchical sampling strategy. The visual size\nestimate and VLM prior offer a strong initial guess of the object's inertial\nparameters, significantly reducing the search space for sampling-based\nrefinement and improving the overall estimation speed. A hierarchical strategy\nfirst estimates mass and center of mass, then infers inertia from object size\nto ensure physically feasible parameters, while a decoupled multi-hypothesis\nscheme enhances robustness to VLM prior errors. Our estimator operates in\nparallel with high-fidelity simulation and hardware, enabling real-time online\nupdates. The estimated parameters are then used to update the wheeled\nhumanoid's equilibrium point, allowing the operator to focus more on locomotion\nand manipulation. This integration improves the haptic force feedback for\ndynamic synchronization, enabling more dynamic whole-body teleoperation. By\ncompensating for object dynamics using the estimated parameters, the framework\nalso improves manipulation tracking while preserving compliant behavior. We\nvalidate the system on a customized wheeled humanoid with a robotic gripper and\nhuman-machine interface, demonstrating real-time execution of lifting,\ndelivering, and releasing tasks with a payload weighing approximately one-third\nof the robot's body weight.",

ViMoNet employs a joint training strategy that leverages the advantages\nof two data types: detailed motion-text data, which is more exact, and generic\nvideo-text data, which is more comprehensive but less detailed. This aids in\nthe model's acquisition of rich data regarding time and space in human\nbehavior. Additionally, we provide a brand new dataset named VIMOS that\ncontains a variety of films, motion sequences, instructions, and subtitles. We\ndeveloped ViMoNet-Bench, a standardized benchmark with carefully labeled\nsamples, to evaluate how well models understand human behavior.

                "summary": "Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials are typically characterized by\nmultiple 2D texture maps such as basecolor, normal, metallic, and roughness\nwhich encode spatially-varying bi-directional reflectance distribution function\n(SVBRDF) parameters to model surface reflectance properties and microfacet\ninteractions. Upscaling SVBRDF material is valuable for modern 3D graphics\napplications. However, existing Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) methods\nstruggle with cross-map inconsistency, inadequate modeling of modality-specific\nfeatures, and limited generalization due to data distribution shifts. In this\nwork, we propose Multi-modal Upscaling Joint Inference via Cross-map Attention\n(MUJICA), a flexible adapter that reforms pre-trained Swin-transformer-based\nSISR models for PBR material super-resolution. MUJICA is seamlessly attached\nafter the pre-trained and frozen SISR backbone. It leverages cross-map\nattention to fuse features while preserving remarkable reconstruction ability\nof the pre-trained SISR model. Applied to SISR models such as SwinIR, DRCT, and\nHMANet, MUJICA improves PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS scores while preserving cross-map\nconsistency. Experiments demonstrate that MUJICA enables efficient training\neven with limited resources and delivers state-of-the-art performance on PBR\nmaterial datasets.",

                    "value": "Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials are typically characterized by\nmultiple 2D texture maps such as basecolor, normal, metallic, and roughness\nwhich encode spatially-varying bi-directional reflectance distribution function\n(SVBRDF) parameters to model surface reflectance properties and microfacet\ninteractions. Upscaling SVBRDF material is valuable for modern 3D graphics\napplications. However, existing Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) methods\nstruggle with cross-map inconsistency, inadequate modeling of modality-specific\nfeatures, and limited generalization due to data distribution shifts. In this\nwork, we propose Multi-modal Upscaling Joint Inference via Cross-map Attention\n(MUJICA), a flexible adapter that reforms pre-trained Swin-transformer-based\nSISR models for PBR material super-resolution. MUJICA is seamlessly attached\nafter the pre-trained and frozen SISR backbone. It leverages cross-map\nattention to fuse features while preserving remarkable reconstruction ability\nof the pre-trained SISR model. Applied to SISR models such as SwinIR, DRCT, and\nHMANet, MUJICA improves PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS scores while preserving cross-map\nconsistency. Experiments demonstrate that MUJICA enables efficient training\neven with limited resources and delivers state-of-the-art performance on PBR\nmaterial datasets."

During inference, the retrieved chunks are then fed along\nwith the original question into the RAG pipeline.

Semantic\nOccupancy Prediction (SOP) addresses this challenge by inferring both occupancy\nand semantics of unobserved regions. Existing transformer-based SOP methods\nlack explicit modeling of spatial structure in attention computation, resulting\nin limited geometric awareness and poor performance in sparse or occluded\nareas. To this end, we propose Spatially-aware Window Attention (SWA), a novel\nmechanism that incorporates local spatial context into attention. SWA\nsignificantly improves scene completion and achieves state-of-the-art results\non LiDAR-based SOP benchmarks. We further validate its generality by\nintegrating SWA into a camera-based SOP pipeline, where it also yields\nconsistent gains across modalities.",

Semantic\nOccupancy Prediction (SOP) addresses this challenge by inferring both occupancy\nand semantics of unobserved regions. Existing transformer-based SOP methods\nlack explicit modeling of spatial structure in attention computation, resulting\nin limited geometric awareness and poor performance in sparse or occluded\nareas. To this end, we propose Spatially-aware Window Attention (SWA), a novel\nmechanism that incorporates local spatial context into attention. SWA\nsignificantly improves scene completion and achieves state-of-the-art results\non LiDAR-based SOP benchmarks. We further validate its generality by\nintegrating SWA into a camera-based SOP pipeline, where it also yields\nconsistent gains across modalities."

                "summary": "Modern recommendation systems can achieve high performance by fusing user\nbehavior graphs (via GNNs) and review texts (via LLMs). However, this fusion\nfaces three significant issues: (1) False Negatives in contrastive learning can\ndegrade the training signal by penalizing similar items; (2) Popularity Bias,\noften encoded as embedding magnitude, can distort similarity scores; and (3)\nSignal Ambiguity, which arises from the conflation of objective facts with\nsubjective sentiment in reviews. These interconnected issues can prevent models\nfrom learning users' true preferences. In this paper, we propose SymCERE\n(Symmetric SINCERE), a contrastive learning method that addresses these three\nissues simultaneously through its structural design. First, we introduce a\nsymmetric application of the SINCERE loss for cross-modal alignment, which is\ndesigned to eliminate false negatives in recommendation. Second, by integrating\nthis with L2 normalisation under a \"magnitude-as-noise\" hypothesis, we aim to\nmitigate popularity bias by forcing the model to encode preferences primarily\nin the vector's direction. Experiments on 15 datasets from three distinct\nplatforms (e-commerce, local reviews, and travel) demonstrate that SymCERE\noutperforms several strong baselines, achieving a relative improvement of up to\n43.6% on NDCG@10. Furthermore, a detailed LIME analysis shows that the model\nlearns to anchor alignment on objective, informative vocabulary (e.g., \"OEM,\"\n\"compatible,\" \"gasket\"), while placing less emphasis on generic sentiment\n(e.g., \"good,\" \"great\"). This suggests that effective semantic alignment stems\nfrom understanding factual product attributes, offering a path toward more\naccurate recommendation systems.

                "summary": "Event-based semantic segmentation has great potential in autonomous driving\nand robotics due to the advantages of event cameras, such as high dynamic\nrange, low latency, and low power cost. Unfortunately, current artificial\nneural network (ANN)-based segmentation methods suffer from high computational\ndemands, the requirements for image frames, and massive energy consumption,\nlimiting their efficiency and application on resource-constrained edge/mobile\nplatforms. To address these problems, we introduce SLTNet, a spike-driven\nlightweight transformer-based network designed for event-based semantic\nsegmentation. Specifically, SLTNet is built on efficient spike-driven\nconvolution blocks (SCBs) to extract rich semantic features while reducing the\nmodel's parameters. Then, to enhance the long-range contextural feature\ninteraction, we propose novel spike-driven transformer blocks (STBs) with\nbinary mask operations. Based on these basic blocks, SLTNet employs a\nhigh-efficiency single-branch architecture while maintaining the low energy\nconsumption of the Spiking Neural Network (SNN). Finally, extensive experiments\non DDD17 and DSEC-Semantic datasets demonstrate that SLTNet outperforms\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) SNN-based methods by at most 9.06% and 9.39% mIoU,\nrespectively, with extremely 4.58x lower energy consumption and 114 FPS\ninference speed.

Many\ncreators have understandably expressed concern over how their intellectual\nproperty has been ingested without their permission or a mechanism to opt out\nof training. As a result, questions of fair use and copyright infringement have\nquickly emerged. We describe a method that allows us to determine if a model\nwas trained on a specific image or set of images. This method is\ncomputationally efficient and assumes no explicit knowledge of the model\narchitecture or weights (so-called black-box membership inference). We\nanticipate that this method will be crucial for auditing existing models and,\nlooking ahead, ensuring the fairer development and deployment of generative AI\nmodels.",

                    "value": "From a simple text prompt, generative-AI image models can create stunningly\nrealistic and creative images bounded, it seems, by only our imagination. These\nmodels have achieved this remarkable feat thanks, in part, to the ingestion of\nbillions of images collected from nearly every corner of the internet. Many\ncreators have understandably expressed concern over how their intellectual\nproperty has been ingested without their permission or a mechanism to opt out\nof training. As a result, questions of fair use and copyright infringement have\nquickly emerged. We describe a method that allows us to determine if a model\nwas trained on a specific image or set of images. This method is\ncomputationally efficient and assumes no explicit knowledge of the model\narchitecture or weights (so-called black-box membership inference). We\nanticipate that this method will be crucial for auditing existing models and,\nlooking ahead, ensuring the fairer development and deployment of generative AI\nmodels."

However, their ability to\ngenerate code from multimodal inputs remains limited. In this work, we\nintroduce VisCodex, a unified framework that seamlessly merges vision and\ncoding language models to empower MLLMs with strong multimodal code generation\nabilities. Leveraging a task vector-based model merging technique, we integrate\na state-of-the-art coding LLM into a strong vision-language backbone, while\npreserving both visual comprehension and advanced coding skills.

In this work, we present a novel multi-agent framework\nthat integrates a Knowledge Graph (KG) of Regulatory triplets with\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to address these demands. First, agents\nbuild and maintain an ontology-free KG by extracting subject--predicate--object\n(SPO) triplets from regulatory documents and systematically cleaning,\nnormalizing, deduplicating, and updating them. Second, these triplets are\nembedded and stored along with their corresponding textual sections and\nmetadata in a single enriched vector database, allowing for both graph-based\nreasoning and efficient information retrieval. Third, an orchestrated agent\npipeline leverages triplet-level retrieval for question answering, ensuring\nhigh semantic alignment between user queries and the factual\n\"who-did-what-to-whom\" core captured by the graph. Our hybrid system\noutperforms conventional methods in complex regulatory queries, ensuring\nfactual correctness with embedded triplets, enabling traceability through a\nunified vector database, and enhancing understanding through subgraph\nvisualization, providing a robust foundation for compliance-driven and broader\naudit-focused applications.",

In this work, we present a novel multi-agent framework\nthat integrates a Knowledge Graph (KG) of Regulatory triplets with\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to address these demands. First, agents\nbuild and maintain an ontology-free KG by extracting subject--predicate--object\n(SPO) triplets from regulatory documents and systematically cleaning,\nnormalizing, deduplicating, and updating them. Second, these triplets are\nembedded and stored along with their corresponding textual sections and\nmetadata in a single enriched vector database, allowing for both graph-based\nreasoning and efficient information retrieval. Third, an orchestrated agent\npipeline leverages triplet-level retrieval for question answering, ensuring\nhigh semantic alignment between user queries and the factual\n\"who-did-what-to-whom\" core captured by the graph. Our hybrid system\noutperforms conventional methods in complex regulatory queries, ensuring\nfactual correctness with embedded triplets, enabling traceability through a\nunified vector database, and enhancing understanding through subgraph\nvisualization, providing a robust foundation for compliance-driven and broader\naudit-focused applications."

Given the easier training and superior\nperformance of continuous VAEs, an intuitive idea is to enhance discrete video\nVAEs by leveraging continuous VAEs. After rethinking the intrinsic link between\ndiscrete and continuous representations, we found that FSQ could effectively\npreserve pre-trained continuous VAE priors compared to other quantization\nmethods. By leveraging continuous VAE priors, it converges several times faster\nthan training from scratch and achieves superior performance at convergence.\nMeanwhile, two structural improvements are proposed. First, inspired by how\ncontinuous VAEs enhance reconstruction via enlarged latent dimensions, we\nintroduce a multi-token quantization mechanism, which achieves nearly a 1 dB\nimprovement in PSNR without compromising the token compression ratio. Second,\nto tackle reconstruction challenges in high-compression video VAEs, we\nstrengthen first-frame reconstruction, enabling the causal VAE to leverage this\ninformation in subsequent frames and markedly improving the performance of 4 x\n16 x 16 discrete VAEs. Furthermore, we propose a joint discrete-continuous\noptimization scheme that unifies the two paradigms and, for the first time,\nachieves competitive performance on both continuous and discrete\nrepresentations within a single network.

To address this, we provide ViMoNet, a straightforward\nyet effective framework for comprehending, characterizing, and deducing human\naction. ViMoNet employs a joint training strategy that leverages the advantages\nof two data types: detailed motion-text data, which is more exact, and generic\nvideo-text data, which is more comprehensive but less detailed. This aids in\nthe model's acquisition of rich data regarding time and space in human\nbehavior. Additionally, we provide a brand new dataset named VIMOS that\ncontains a variety of films, motion sequences, instructions, and subtitles. We\ndeveloped ViMoNet-Bench, a standardized benchmark with carefully labeled\nsamples, to evaluate how well models understand human behavior. Our tests show\nthat ViMoNet outperforms existing methods in caption generation, motion\nunderstanding, and behavior interpretation.",

These shift vectors allow us to recover\nfine-tuned concepts by applying simple, computationally inexpensive additive\nconcept shifts in the original model. Finally, our findings also have direct\napplications for MLLM steering, which can be used for model debiasing as well\nas enforcing safety in MLLM output.

Furthermore, we investigate the downstream\nimpact of these explanations on the performance of pre-trained language models\n(PLMs) and LLMs across natural language inference tasks on two diverse\nbenchmark datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that automated explanations\nexhibit highly competitive effectiveness compared to human-annotated\nexplanations in improving model performance. Our findings underscore a\npromising avenue for scalable, automated LLM-based textual explanation\ngeneration for extending NLP datasets and enhancing model performance."

We then\npropose UDA (Unsupervised Debiasing Alignment), a framework that reduces\ninter-judge disagreement by dynamically adjusting the Elo rating system. For\neach pairwise comparison, a compact neural network learns to adaptively set the\nK-factor and refine win probabilities. Crucially, UDA operates in a fully\nunsupervised manner, guided solely by the objective of minimizing the\ndispersion among the Elo trajectories of all judges. This forces an alignment\ntowards a collective consensus, which serves as an unsupervised proxy for a\nmore stable and reproducible evaluation. In addition, we provide theoretical\nmotivation demonstrating how alignment towards a consensus can reduce aggregate\nsystem bias. Experiments show that UDA significantly reduces the inter-judge\nrating standard deviation by up to 63.4% and improves the average correlation\nwith human judgments by 24.7%. Notably, UDA elevates the performance of poorly\nperforming judges to achieve parity with high-quality ones, fostering a more\nrobust and reliable evaluation ecosystem.

                "summary": "Modern recommendation systems can achieve high performance by fusing user\nbehavior graphs (via GNNs) and review texts (via LLMs). However, this fusion\nfaces three significant issues: (1) False Negatives in contrastive learning can\ndegrade the training signal by penalizing similar items; (2) Popularity Bias,\noften encoded as embedding magnitude, can distort similarity scores; and (3)\nSignal Ambiguity, which arises from the conflation of objective facts with\nsubjective sentiment in reviews. These interconnected issues can prevent models\nfrom learning users' true preferences. In this paper, we propose SymCERE\n(Symmetric SINCERE), a contrastive learning method that addresses these three\nissues simultaneously through its structural design. First, we introduce a\nsymmetric application of the SINCERE loss for cross-modal alignment, which is\ndesigned to eliminate false negatives in recommendation. Second, by integrating\nthis with L2 normalisation under a \"magnitude-as-noise\" hypothesis, we aim to\nmitigate popularity bias by forcing the model to encode preferences primarily\nin the vector's direction. Experiments on 15 datasets from three distinct\nplatforms (e-commerce, local reviews, and travel) demonstrate that SymCERE\noutperforms several strong baselines, achieving a relative improvement of up to\n43.6% on NDCG@10. Furthermore, a detailed LIME analysis shows that the model\nlearns to anchor alignment on objective, informative vocabulary (e.g., \"OEM,\"\n\"compatible,\" \"gasket\"), while placing less emphasis on generic sentiment\n(e.g., \"good,\" \"great\"). This suggests that effective semantic alignment stems\nfrom understanding factual product attributes, offering a path toward more\naccurate recommendation systems.

To address this,\nwe propose Multi-Expert Mutual Learning GRPO (MEML-GRPO), an innovative\nframework that utilizes diverse expert prompts as system prompts to generate a\nbroader range of responses, substantially increasing the likelihood of\nidentifying correct solutions. Additionally, we introduce an inter-expert\nmutual learning mechanism that facilitates knowledge sharing and transfer among\nexperts, further boosting the model's performance through RLVR. Extensive\nexperiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that MEML-GRPO delivers\nsignificant improvements, achieving an average performance gain of 4.89% with\nQwen and 11.33% with Llama, effectively overcoming the core limitations of\ntraditional RLVR methods.",

After pretraining\non 3 million publicly accessible images and captions, ViCToR achieves\nstate-of-the-art results, improving over LLaVA-NeXT-8B by 10.4%, 3.2%, and 7.2%\non the MMStar, SEED$^I$, and RealWorldQA benchmarks, respectively.

While ChatGPT demonstrates proficiency in constructing\ncoherent argumentative texts, its persuasive efficacy appears constrained,\nparticularly on topics involving ethical issues.The study finds that while\nparticipants often acknowledge the benefits highlighted by ChatGPT, ethical\nconcerns tend to persist or even intensify post-interaction. The results also\ndemonstrate a variation depending on the topic. These findings highlight new\ninsights on AI-generated persuasion in ethically sensitive domains and are a\nbasis for future research."

With this approach, LLMs appear to\nproduce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT\nreasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate\ninferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT\nreasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore\nfurther. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and\ninvestigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from\nin-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning\npaths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is\nfundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the\ntraining data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning\nvia three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension,\nwe design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs\nfrom scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution\nconditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that\nvanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a\ndeeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the\nongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning.",

However, building a unified\nspeech understanding and generation model still faces the following challenges:\n(1) Due to the huge modality gap between speech tokens and text tokens,\nextending text LLMs to unified speech LLMs relies on large-scale paired data\nfor fine-tuning, and (2) Generation and understanding tasks prefer information\nat different levels, e.g., generation benefits from detailed acoustic features,\nwhile understanding favors high-level semantics. This divergence leads to\ndifficult performance optimization in one unified model. To solve these\nchallenges, in this paper, we present two key insights in speech tokenization\nand speech language modeling. Specifically, we first propose an\nUnderstanding-driven Speech Tokenizer (USTokenizer), which extracts high-level\nsemantic information essential for accomplishing understanding tasks using text\nLLMs. In this way, USToken enjoys better modality commonality with text, which\nreduces the difficulty of modality alignment in adapting text LLMs to speech\nLLMs. Secondly, we present DualSpeechLM, a dual-token modeling framework that\nconcurrently models USToken as input and acoustic token as output within a\nunified, end-to-end framework, seamlessly integrating speech understanding and\ngeneration capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel semantic supervision\nloss and a Chain-of-Condition (CoC) strategy to stabilize model training and\nenhance speech generation performance.

Given a user written script,\nMapStory automatically produces a scene breakdown, which decomposes the text\ninto key map animation primitives such as camera movements, visual highlights,\nand animated elements. Our system includes a researcher agent that accurately\nqueries geospatial information by leveraging an LLM with web search, enabling\nautomatic extraction of relevant regions, paths, and coordinates while allowing\nusers to edit and query for changes or additional information to refine the\nresults. Additionally, users can fine-tune parameters of these primitive blocks\nthrough an interactive timeline editor. We detail the system's design and\narchitecture, informed by formative interviews with professional animators and\nby an analysis of 200 existing map animation videos. Our evaluation, which\nincludes expert interviews (N=5) and a usability study (N=12), demonstrates\nthat MapStory enables users to create map animations with ease, facilitates\nfaster iteration, encourages creative exploration, and lowers barriers to\ncreating map-centric stories.",
