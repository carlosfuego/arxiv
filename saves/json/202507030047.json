We first introduce a software\nabstraction called codebook cache to optimize codebook access efficiency and\nsupport the integration of VQ with various computations. The codebook cache\nadaptively stores different entries across the GPU's memory hierarchy,\nincluding off-chip global memory, on-chip shared memory, and registers.\nCentered around the codebook cache, we design an efficient computation engine\nthat optimizes memory traffic during computations involving codebooks. This\ncompute engine adopts the codebook-centric dataflow and fusion optimizations.\nAdditionally, we provide adaptive heuristics to tailor parameter selection in\nour optimizations to diverse VQ configurations. Our optimizations achieve an\naverage latency reduction of 46.13% compared to unoptimized versions. Compared\nto existing open-source implementations, our methods decrease latency by 64.36%\nto 99.1%. A final comparison with state-of-the-art element-wise quantization\nmethods like AWQ and KVQuant shows that our VQ-LLM is practically viable,\nachieving latencies close or even better latencies to those at equivalent\nbit-widths, potentially offering greater accuracy.",

                    "value": "In this work, we design and implement VQ-LLM, an efficient fused Vector\nQuantization (VQ) kernel generation framework. We first introduce a software\nabstraction called codebook cache to optimize codebook access efficiency and\nsupport the integration of VQ with various computations. The codebook cache\nadaptively stores different entries across the GPU's memory hierarchy,\nincluding off-chip global memory, on-chip shared memory, and registers.\nCentered around the codebook cache, we design an efficient computation engine\nthat optimizes memory traffic during computations involving codebooks. This\ncompute engine adopts the codebook-centric dataflow and fusion optimizations.\nAdditionally, we provide adaptive heuristics to tailor parameter selection in\nour optimizations to diverse VQ configurations. Our optimizations achieve an\naverage latency reduction of 46.13% compared to unoptimized versions. Compared\nto existing open-source implementations, our methods decrease latency by 64.36%\nto 99.1%. A final comparison with state-of-the-art element-wise quantization\nmethods like AWQ and KVQuant shows that our VQ-LLM is practically viable,\nachieving latencies close or even better latencies to those at equivalent\nbit-widths, potentially offering greater accuracy."

Due to the inherent non-convexity\nand NP-hardness of USBJOP, we decompose it into three sub-optimization\nproblems, \\textit{i.e.}, association between UAV-SIMs and users optimization\nproblem (AUUOP), UAV location optimization problem (ULOP), and UAV-SIM phase\nshifts optimization problem (USPSOP), and solve them using an alternating\noptimization strategy. Specifically, we transform AUUOP and ULOP into convex\nforms solvable by the CVX tool, while addressing USPSOP through a generative\nartificial intelligence (GAI)-based hybrid optimization algorithm.

This step negatively affects key Service Level Objectives (SLOs),\nsuch as time to first token (TTFT) and time per output token (TPOT). We\nintroduce Encode-Prefill-Decode (EPD) Disaggregation, a novel framework that\nseparates the encoding, prefill, and decode stages onto dedicated resources.\nUnlike current systems, which bundle encoding and prefill together, our\napproach decouples these steps, unlocking new opportunities and optimizations.\nThese include a mechanism to cache multimedia tokens for efficient transfer, a\nnovel way to parallelize the encoding load within a request, a module for\noptimal resource allocation for disaggregated serving, and a novel\nrole-switching method to handle changing workload characteristics. Experimental\nevaluations with popular LMMs show substantial gains in memory efficiency (up\nto 15x lower peak memory utilization), batch sizes (up to 22x larger), 10x more\nimages per request, and 2.2x larger KV caches. Furthermore, it leads to\nsignificant improvements in SLO attainment (up to 90-100% improvement) and TTFT\n(up to 71% reduction), compared to systems that do not disaggregate.

This step negatively affects key Service Level Objectives (SLOs),\nsuch as time to first token (TTFT) and time per output token (TPOT). We\nintroduce Encode-Prefill-Decode (EPD) Disaggregation, a novel framework that\nseparates the encoding, prefill, and decode stages onto dedicated resources.\nUnlike current systems, which bundle encoding and prefill together, our\napproach decouples these steps, unlocking new opportunities and optimizations.\nThese include a mechanism to cache multimedia tokens for efficient transfer, a\nnovel way to parallelize the encoding load within a request, a module for\noptimal resource allocation for disaggregated serving, and a novel\nrole-switching method to handle changing workload characteristics. Experimental\nevaluations with popular LMMs show substantial gains in memory efficiency (up\nto 15x lower peak memory utilization), batch sizes (up to 22x larger), 10x more\nimages per request, and 2.2x larger KV caches. Furthermore, it leads to\nsignificant improvements in SLO attainment (up to 90-100% improvement) and TTFT\n(up to 71% reduction), compared to systems that do not disaggregate.

This paper analyzes dialogue data\nfrom real users on the granularity of round and discovers that the LLM\ninference manifests a watershed layer, after which the distribution of\nround-level attention shows notable similarity. Based on this, we propose Round\nAttention - a novel round-level attention mechanism that selectively processes\nthe KV cache of top-k relevant rounds, where k is dynamically determined\nthrough the attention matrix in the watershed layer. Theoretical analysis\ndemonstrates that our method reduces memory usage by 54\\% to 82\\%, while\nexperimental results confirm that loading sparse critical-round KV cache\nmaintains answer accuracy without performance degradation.",

This paper analyzes dialogue data\nfrom real users on the granularity of round and discovers that the LLM\ninference manifests a watershed layer, after which the distribution of\nround-level attention shows notable similarity. Based on this, we propose Round\nAttention - a novel round-level attention mechanism that selectively processes\nthe KV cache of top-k relevant rounds, where k is dynamically determined\nthrough the attention matrix in the watershed layer. Theoretical analysis\ndemonstrates that our method reduces memory usage by 54\\% to 82\\%, while\nexperimental results confirm that loading sparse critical-round KV cache\nmaintains answer accuracy without performance degradation."

                "summary": "Recent advancements in Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained\nsignificant attention due to their remarkable reasoning capabilities and\nproficiency in generalization. However, processing a large number of visual\ntokens and generating long-context outputs impose substantial computational\noverhead, leading to excessive demands for key-value (KV) cache. To address\nthis critical bottleneck, we propose AirCache, a novel KV cache compression\nmethod aimed at accelerating LVLMs inference. This work systematically\ninvestigates the correlations between visual and textual tokens within the\nattention mechanisms of LVLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals considerable\nredundancy in cached visual tokens, wherein strategically eliminating these\ntokens preserves model performance while significantly accelerating context\ngeneration. Inspired by these findings, we introduce an elite observation\nwindow for assessing the importance of visual components in the KV cache,\nfocusing on stable inter-modal relevancy modeling with enhanced\nmulti-perspective consistency. Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise\nbudget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of\ntoken importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to\nuniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the\nfull cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing\ndecoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of\ninputs. Notably, as cache retention rates decrease, our method exhibits\nincreasing performance advantages over existing approaches.",

                "summary": "When irradiation is performed with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), a different\nshape of cells in suspension or adherent to walls may result in different\nprobability of cell survival. In a recent study, differences of up to a factor\nof 2 were found between the predicted survival of floating and adherent cells.\nThe present work aims to quantify the biases introduced by the simulation setup\nand the use of voxelized geometry in conjunction with the local effect model\nfor cell survival. The results show that simulated irradiation of a cell near\nthe surface with an incident beam matched to the cell dimensions results in\ndose values that are by a factor of about 50 lower than the dose to cells\ndeeper in the medium when irradiated with a Co-60 spectrum and lateral beam\ndimensions in the centimeter range. Furthermore, the number of ionizing photon\ninteractions in gold nanoparticles in a cell near the surface is lower by a\nfactor of about 2 than for cells at 5 mm and 1 cm depth. Using the average dose\nin voxels of size in the order of 200 nm for assessing cell survival with the\nlocal effect model (LEM) leads to an underestimation of the number of lesions\nfrom a single ionized AuNP by roughly two orders of magnitude and thus to an\noverestimation of cell survival. The effect of cell geometry on the survival\nrate was examined for approximate cell geometries and 100 kV x-ray irradiation,\nfor which the probability of photon interaction in gold nanoparticles is by\nmore than two orders of magnitude higher than for Co-60 irradiation.

In a recent study, differences of up to a factor\nof 2 were found between the predicted survival of floating and adherent cells.\nThe present work aims to quantify the biases introduced by the simulation setup\nand the use of voxelized geometry in conjunction with the local effect model\nfor cell survival. The results show that simulated irradiation of a cell near\nthe surface with an incident beam matched to the cell dimensions results in\ndose values that are by a factor of about 50 lower than the dose to cells\ndeeper in the medium when irradiated with a Co-60 spectrum and lateral beam\ndimensions in the centimeter range.

We observe that quantizing\nthe KV cache of different tokens has varying impacts on the quality of\nattention outputs. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we perform\nforward error propagation analysis on attention and propose the Anchor Score\n(AnS) that quantifies the sensitivity of each token's KV cache to\nquantization-induced error. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in AnS\nacross tokens, suggesting that preserving a small subset with full precision\n(FP16) of high-AnS tokens can greatly mitigate accuracy loss in aggressive\nquantization scenarios. Based on this insight, we introduce AnTKV, a novel\nframework that leverages Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization to compress the\nKV cache. Furthermore, to support efficient deployment, we design and develop a\ntriton kernel that is fully compatible with FlashAttention, enabling fast\nonline Anchor Token selection. AnTKV enables LLaMA-3-8B to handle context\nlengths up to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100 GPU, while achieving up to 3.5x\nhigher decoding throughput compared to the FP16 baseline. Our experiment\nresults demonstrate that AnTKV matches or outperforms prior works such as KIVI,\nSKVQ, KVQuant, and CQ under 4-bit settings.

The protocol leverages gRPC for efficient\ninter-agent communication and Pinecone for scalable vector embedding storage\nand similarity search, with SQLite managing metadata.

However, processing\nlong video inputs remains a major challenge due to high memory and\ncomputational costs. This makes it difficult for current models to achieve both\nstrong performance and high efficiency in long video understanding. To address\nthis challenge, we propose Video-XL-2, a novel MLLM that delivers superior\ncost-effectiveness for long-video understanding based on task-aware KV\nsparsification. The proposed framework operates with two key steps: chunk-based\npre-filling and bi-level key-value decoding. Chunk-based pre-filling divides\nthe visual token sequence into chunks, applying full attention within each\nchunk and sparse attention across chunks. This significantly reduces\ncomputational and memory overhead. During decoding, bi-level key-value decoding\nselectively reloads either dense or sparse key-values for each chunk based on\nits relevance to the task. This approach further improves memory efficiency and\nenhances the model's ability to capture fine-grained information. Video-XL-2\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on various long video understanding\nbenchmarks, outperforming existing open-source lightweight models. It also\ndemonstrates exceptional efficiency, capable of processing over 10,000 frames\non a single NVIDIA A100 (80GB) GPU and thousands of frames in just a few\nseconds.",

The widespread usage of sparse data has inspired many in-memory and\non-disk storage formats, but the only widely adopted storage specifications are\nthe Matrix Market and FROSTT file formats, which both use ASCII text. Due to\nthe inefficiency of text storage, these files typically have larger file sizes\nand longer parsing times than binary storage formats, which directly store an\nin-memory representation to disk. This can be a major bottleneck; since sparse\ncomputation is often bandwidth-bound, the cost of loading or storing a matrix\nto disk often exceeds the cost of performing a sparse computation. While it is\ncommon practice for practitioners to develop their own, custom, non-portable\nbinary formats for high-performance sparse matrix storage, there is currently\nno cross-platform binary sparse matrix storage format.

We provide several reference implementations of Binsparse\nspanning 5 languages, 5 frameworks, and 4 binary containers. We evaluate our\nBinsparse format on every matrix in the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection and a\nselection of tensors from the FROSTT collection.

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications requiring\nlong context lengths, but the key-value (KV) cache often becomes a memory\nbottleneck on GPUs as context grows. To address this, we propose Commutative\nVector Quantization (CommVQ) to significantly reduce memory usage for\nlong-context LLM inference. We first introduce additive quantization with a\nlightweight encoder and codebook to compress the KV cache, which can be decoded\nvia simple matrix multiplication. To further reduce computational costs during\ndecoding, we design the codebook to be commutative with Rotary Position\nEmbedding (RoPE) and train it using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.\nThis enables efficient integration of decoding into the self-attention\nmechanism. Our approach achieves high accuracy with additive quantization and\nlow overhead via the RoPE-commutative codebook. Experiments on long-context\nbenchmarks and GSM8K show that our method reduces FP16 KV cache size by 87.5%\nwith 2-bit quantization, while outperforming state-of-the-art KV cache\nquantization methods. Notably, it enables 1-bit KV cache quantization with\nminimal accuracy loss, allowing a LLaMA-3.1 8B model to run with a 128K context\nlength on a single RTX 4090 GPU.

These approaches are focused on\nreduction of the amount of compute in existing language models rather than\nminimization of number of bits needed to store text. Despite relying on\npowerful models as encoders, the maximum attainable lossless compression ratio\nis typically not higher than x10. This fact is highly intriguing because, in\ntheory, the maximum information capacity of large real-valued vectors is far\nbeyond the presented rates even for 16-bit precision and a modest vector size.\nIn this work, we explore the limits of compression by replacing the encoder\nwith a per-sample optimization procedure. We show that vectors with compression\nratios up to x1500 exist, which highlights two orders of magnitude gap between\nexisting and practically attainable solutions. Furthermore, we empirically show\nthat the compression limits are determined not by the length of the input but\nby the amount of uncertainty to be reduced, namely, the cross-entropy loss on\nthis sequence without any conditioning. The obtained limits highlight the\nsubstantial gap between the theoretical capacity of input embeddings and their\npractical utilization, suggesting significant room for optimization in model\ndesign.",

                    "value": "A range of recent works addresses the problem of compression of sequence of\ntokens into a shorter sequence of real-valued vectors to be used as inputs\ninstead of token embeddings or key-value cache. These approaches are focused on\nreduction of the amount of compute in existing language models rather than\nminimization of number of bits needed to store text. Despite relying on\npowerful models as encoders, the maximum attainable lossless compression ratio\nis typically not higher than x10. This fact is highly intriguing because, in\ntheory, the maximum information capacity of large real-valued vectors is far\nbeyond the presented rates even for 16-bit precision and a modest vector size.\nIn this work, we explore the limits of compression by replacing the encoder\nwith a per-sample optimization procedure. We show that vectors with compression\nratios up to x1500 exist, which highlights two orders of magnitude gap between\nexisting and practically attainable solutions. Furthermore, we empirically show\nthat the compression limits are determined not by the length of the input but\nby the amount of uncertainty to be reduced, namely, the cross-entropy loss on\nthis sequence without any conditioning. The obtained limits highlight the\nsubstantial gap between the theoretical capacity of input embeddings and their\npractical utilization, suggesting significant room for optimization in model\ndesign."

Addressing these issues requires\nfundamentally redesigned hardware-software integration. This paper introduces\nHuawei CloudMatrix, a next-generation AI datacenter architecture, realized in\nthe production-grade CloudMatrix384 supernode. It integrates 384 Ascend 910\nNPUs and 192 Kunpeng CPUs interconnected via an ultra-high-bandwidth Unified\nBus (UB) network, enabling direct all-to-all communication and dynamic pooling\nof resources. These features optimize performance for communication-intensive\noperations, such as large-scale MoE expert parallelism and distributed\nkey-value cache access. To fully leverage CloudMatrix384, we propose\nCloudMatrix-Infer, an advanced LLM serving solution incorporating three core\ninnovations: a peer-to-peer serving architecture that independently scales\nprefill, decode, and caching; a large-scale expert parallelism strategy\nsupporting EP320 via efficient UB-based token dispatch; and hardware-aware\noptimizations including specialized operators, microbatch-based pipelining, and\nINT8 quantization. Evaluation with the DeepSeek-R1 model shows\nCloudMatrix-Infer achieves state-of-the-art efficiency: prefill throughput of\n6,688 tokens/s per NPU and decode throughput of 1,943 tokens/s per NPU (<50 ms\nTPOT). It effectively balances throughput and latency, sustaining 538 tokens/s\nper NPU even under stringent 15 ms latency constraints, while INT8 quantization\nmaintains model accuracy across benchmarks.",

To validate our approach, we prototype a\nCXL-SSD on a custom FPGA platform and propose annotation mechanisms,\nDeterminism and Bufferability, to enhance performance while preserving data\npersistency. Our simulation-based evaluation demonstrates that CXL-SSD achieves\n10.9x better performance than PCIe-based memory expanders and further reduces\nlatency by 5.4x with annotation enhancements. In workloads with high locality,\nCXL-SSD approaches DRAM-like performance due to efficient on-chip caching.

The advantages of MoDiff are supported by solid theoretical insight and\nanalysis. In addition, extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and LSUN demonstrate\nthat MoDiff significant reduces activation quantization from 8 bits to 3 bits\nwithout performance degradation in post-training quantization (PTQ).

The\nfollowing is the list of what we believe to be novelties:\n  * Cached path to exploit sequential locality, and fast truncation thereof on\nerase operation;\n  * A hash table (or, rather, a cache table) with hard O(1) time guarantees on\nany operation to speed up key lookup (up to a pre-leaf node);\n  * Hardware-accelerated \"find next/previous set bit\" operations with BMI2\ninstruction set extension on x86-64;\n  * Order book-specific features: the preemption principle and the tree\nrestructure operation that prevent the tree from consuming too much memory.\n  We achieve the following speedups over C++'s standard std::map container:\n6x-20x on modifying operations, 30x on lookup operations, 9x-15x on real market\ndata, and a more modest 2x-3x speedup on iteration. In this paper, we discuss\nour implementation."

In this paper, we propose\nBlock-wise Adaptive Caching(BAC), a method to accelerate Diffusion Policy by\ncaching intermediate action features. BAC achieves lossless action generation\nacceleration by adaptively updating and reusing cached features at the block\nlevel, based on a key observation that feature similarities vary non-uniformly\nacross timesteps and locks. To operationalize this insight, we first propose\nthe Adaptive Caching Scheduler, designed to identify optimal update timesteps\nby maximizing the global feature similarities between cached and skipped\nfeatures. However, applying this scheduler for each block leads to signiffcant\nerror surges due to the inter-block propagation of caching errors, particularly\nwithin Feed-Forward Network (FFN) blocks. To mitigate this issue, we develop\nthe Bubbling Union Algorithm, which truncates these errors by updating the\nupstream blocks with signiffcant caching errors before downstream FFNs. As a\ntraining-free plugin, BAC is readily integrable with existing transformer-based\nDiffusion Policy and vision-language-action models. Extensive experiments on\nmultiple robotic benchmarks demonstrate that BAC achieves up to 3x inference\nspeedup for free.",

While these models have attained high accuracy\nby leveraging additional computation at test time, they need to generate long\nchain-of-thought reasoning in order to think before answering, which requires\ngenerating thousands of tokens. While sparse attention methods can help reduce\nthe KV cache pressure induced by this long autoregressive reasoning, these\nmethods can introduce errors which disrupt the reasoning process. Additionally,\nprior methods often pre-process the input to make it easier to identify the\nimportant prompt tokens when computing attention during generation, and this\npre-processing is challenging to perform online for newly generated reasoning\ntokens. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing Multipole Attention,\nwhich accelerates autoregressive reasoning by only computing exact attention\nfor the most important tokens, while maintaining approximate representations\nfor the remaining tokens. Our method first performs clustering to group\ntogether semantically similar key vectors, and then uses the cluster centroids\nboth to identify important key vectors and to approximate the remaining key\nvectors in order to retain high accuracy. We design a fast cluster update\nprocess to quickly re-cluster the input and previously generated tokens,\nthereby allowing for accelerating attention to the previous output tokens. We\nevaluate our method using emerging LRMs such as Qwen-8B, demonstrating that our\napproach can maintain accuracy on complex reasoning tasks even with aggressive\nattention sparsity settings. We also provide kernel implementations to\ndemonstrate the practical efficiency gains from our method, achieving up to\n4.5$\\times$ speedup for attention in long-context reasoning applications.

Our key finding is that MLA+RoPE\nwith half-rank latent dimensions (r = d/2) achieves a 45% KV-cache memory\nreduction while incurring only a 0.3% increase in validation loss (essentially\nmatching MHA quality)- a Pareto improvement for memory constrained deployment.\nWe further show that RoPE is crucial for MLA in small models: without it, MLA\nunderperforms vanilla attention by 3-5%, but with RoPE, it surpasses vanilla by\n2%. Inference benchmarks on NVIDIA A100 GPUs reveal that MLA with r=d/2\nachieves a 1.4 times speedup over full-rank MLA while maintaining the memory\nsavings.

The key problem is that data plane\nperformance is slow, and scaled instances remain stopped while parameters are\nloading. In this paper, we first show that the data plane can be made fast with\nno or O(1) caching by loading parameters through the compute network between\nGPUs because: (1) its speed is comparable to host cache and is underutilized,\nand (2) scaling multiple instances requires no or O(1) caching with\nnetwork-optimized multicast. Second, autoscaling can be made live by breaking\nthe scaling abstraction for inference from a coarse-grained instance-level to a\nfine-grained layer-level. This allows us to offload the layer computation from\nthe overloaded serving instances to the scaled ones without waiting for the\nparameters to be fully loaded. Under real-world workloads, our system\nBLITZSCALE achieves up to 94 % lower tail latency reductions compared to\nstate-of-the-art autoscaling system (ServerlessLLM), and it reduces the GPU\ntime used for serving by 49 % when compared with serving systems that do not\nsupport autoscaling like DistServe and vLLM with the same\nservice-level-agreement.",

IGTCache\nleverages a hierarchical access abstraction, AccessStreamTree, to organize the\nrecent data accesses in a tree structure, facilitating access pattern detection\nat various granularities. Using this abstraction, IGTCache applies hypothesis\ntesting to categorize data access patterns as sequential, random, or skewed.\nBased on these detected access patterns and granularities, IGTCache tailors\noptimal cache management strategies including prefetching, eviction, and space\nallocation accordingly. Experimental results show that IGTCache increases the\ncache hit ratio by 55.6% over state-of-the-art caching frameworks, reducing the\noverall job completion time by 52.2%.",

In this paper, we propose\nIGTCache, a unified, high-efficacy cache for modern AI clusters. IGTCache\nleverages a hierarchical access abstraction, AccessStreamTree, to organize the\nrecent data accesses in a tree structure, facilitating access pattern detection\nat various granularities. Using this abstraction, IGTCache applies hypothesis\ntesting to categorize data access patterns as sequential, random, or skewed.\nBased on these detected access patterns and granularities, IGTCache tailors\noptimal cache management strategies including prefetching, eviction, and space\nallocation accordingly. Experimental results show that IGTCache increases the\ncache hit ratio by 55.6% over state-of-the-art caching frameworks, reducing the\noverall job completion time by 52.2%."

While recent PRAC implementations enable holistic\nmitigation of Rowhammer attacks, they impose slowdowns of up to 10% due to the\nincreased DRAM timings for performing a read-modify-write of the counter.\nAlternatively, recent work, Chronus, addresses these slowdowns, but incurs\nenergy overheads due to the additional DRAM activations for counters. In this\npaper, we propose CnC-PRAC, a PRAC implementation that addresses both\nperformance and energy overheads. Unlike prior works focusing on caching\nactivation counts to reduce their overheads, our key idea is to reorder and\ncoalesce accesses to activation counts located in the same physical row. Our\ndesign achieves this by decoupling counter access from the critical path of\ndata accesses. This enables optimizations such as buffering counter\nread-modify-write requests and coalescing requests to the same row. Together,\nthese enable a reduction in row activations for counter accesses by almost\n75%-83% compared to state-of-the-art solutions like Chronus and enable a PRAC\nimplementation with negligible slowdown and a minimal dynamic energy overhead\nof 0.84%-1% compared to insecure DDR5 DRAM.",

In contrast, recent\ndiffusion-based control policies have shown promise in generating physically\nrealizable motion sequences, but the lack of kinematics prediction limits their\nsteerability.

This approach allows us to leverage established conditioning techniques\nfrom kinematic motion generation while producing physically realistic motions.\nAs a result, we achieve planning capabilities without the need for a high-level\nplanner. Our method handles a diverse set of unseen long-horizon downstream\ntasks through a single pre-trained model, including static and dynamic obstacle\navoidance, motion in-betweening, and task-space control.

Standard analysis conventions discard\ninformation and severely limit the scope of the causal questions that can be\nprobed. To address this gap, we 1) draw connections to the causal inference\nliterature on sequentially randomized experiments, 2) propose a non-parametric\nframework for analyzing \"open-loop\" (static regime) optogenetics behavioral\nexperiments, 3) derive extensions of history-restricted marginal structural\nmodels for dynamic treatment regimes with positivity violations for\n\"closed-loop\" designs, and 4) propose a taxonomy of identifiable causal effects\nthat encompass a far richer collection of scientific questions compared to\nstandard methods. From another view, our work extends \"excursion effect\"\nmethods, popularized recently in the mobile health literature, to enable\nestimation of causal contrasts for treatment sequences in the presence of\npositivity violations. We describe sufficient conditions for identifiability of\nthe proposed causal estimands, and provide asymptotic statistical guarantees\nfor a proposed inverse probability-weighted estimator, a multiply-robust\nestimator (for two intervention timepoints), a framework for hypothesis\ntesting, and a computationally scalable implementation. Finally, we apply our\nframework to data from a recent neuroscience study and show how it provides\ninsight into causal effects of optogenetics on behavior that are obscured by\nstandard analyses.",

                    "value": "Optogenetics is a powerful neuroscience technique for studying how neural\ncircuit manipulation affects behavior. Standard analysis conventions discard\ninformation and severely limit the scope of the causal questions that can be\nprobed. To address this gap, we 1) draw connections to the causal inference\nliterature on sequentially randomized experiments, 2) propose a non-parametric\nframework for analyzing \"open-loop\" (static regime) optogenetics behavioral\nexperiments, 3) derive extensions of history-restricted marginal structural\nmodels for dynamic treatment regimes with positivity violations for\n\"closed-loop\" designs, and 4) propose a taxonomy of identifiable causal effects\nthat encompass a far richer collection of scientific questions compared to\nstandard methods. From another view, our work extends \"excursion effect\"\nmethods, popularized recently in the mobile health literature, to enable\nestimation of causal contrasts for treatment sequences in the presence of\npositivity violations. We describe sufficient conditions for identifiability of\nthe proposed causal estimands, and provide asymptotic statistical guarantees\nfor a proposed inverse probability-weighted estimator, a multiply-robust\nestimator (for two intervention timepoints), a framework for hypothesis\ntesting, and a computationally scalable implementation. Finally, we apply our\nframework to data from a recent neuroscience study and show how it provides\ninsight into causal effects of optogenetics on behavior that are obscured by\nstandard analyses."

To address these challenges, we propose StreamFlow, a\nnovel neural architecture that facilitates streaming flow matching with\ndiffusion transformers (DiT). To mitigate the long-sequence extrapolation\nissues arising from lengthy historical dependencies, we design a local\nblock-wise receptive field strategy. Specifically, the sequence is first\nsegmented into blocks, and we introduce block-wise attention masks that enable\nthe current block to receive information from the previous or subsequent block.\nThese attention masks are combined hierarchically across different DiT-blocks\nto regulate the receptive field of DiTs. Both subjective and objective\nexperimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance\ncomparable to non-streaming methods while surpassing other streaming methods in\nterms of speech quality, all the while effectively managing inference time\nduring long-sequence generation. Furthermore, our method achieves a notable\nfirst-packet latency of only 180 ms.\\footnote{Speech samples:\nhttps://dukguo.github.io/StreamFlow/}",

To mitigate the long-sequence extrapolation\nissues arising from lengthy historical dependencies, we design a local\nblock-wise receptive field strategy. Specifically, the sequence is first\nsegmented into blocks, and we introduce block-wise attention masks that enable\nthe current block to receive information from the previous or subsequent block.\nThese attention masks are combined hierarchically across different DiT-blocks\nto regulate the receptive field of DiTs. Both subjective and objective\nexperimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance\ncomparable to non-streaming methods while surpassing other streaming methods in\nterms of speech quality, all the while effectively managing inference time\nduring long-sequence generation. Furthermore, our method achieves a notable\nfirst-packet latency of only 180 ms.\\footnote{Speech samples:\nhttps://dukguo.github.io/StreamFlow/}"

However, only one has been confirmed by the analysis of a\nmicrolensing event, and no confirmed emission detection from an IBH has been\nreported so far.\n  Aims: We analysed the detectability of electromagnetic signatures from IBHs\nmoving in the Galaxy. Methods: We considered accretion from the interstellar\nmedium onto an IBH and assumed the formation of an outflow. We modelled the\naccretion process and the interaction of the outflow with the surrounding\nmedium on large scales, including mechanical feedback on the accretion process.\nFurthermore, we also calculated the emission from three different regions: the\naccretion region, the radiation from the outflow medium interaction structure,\nand the emission of relativistic particles that diffuse in the surrounding\nmedium.\n  Results: Multiwavelength emission associated with Galactic IBHs can be\ndetected in systems moving through a very dense medium. Thermal emission from\naccretion could be observed in the mid infrared and in hard X rays with current\nand forthcoming observatories. Thermal and non thermal emission from the\noutflow medium shock could also be detected in the radio and millimetre ranges.\nMoreover, detection of the emission from particles diffusing in a dense medium\ncould be feasible in gamma rays. Applying our model to the IBH associated with\nthe gravitational microlensing event MOA2011BLG191 OGLE2011BLG0462, we inferred\nthat radio and infrared detection of the IBH is plausible.

                    "value": "Context: A large number of isolated black holes (IBHs) are expected to\npopulate the Galaxy. However, only one has been confirmed by the analysis of a\nmicrolensing event, and no confirmed emission detection from an IBH has been\nreported so far.\n  Aims: We analysed the detectability of electromagnetic signatures from IBHs\nmoving in the Galaxy. Methods: We considered accretion from the interstellar\nmedium onto an IBH and assumed the formation of an outflow. We modelled the\naccretion process and the interaction of the outflow with the surrounding\nmedium on large scales, including mechanical feedback on the accretion process.\nFurthermore, we also calculated the emission from three different regions: the\naccretion region, the radiation from the outflow medium interaction structure,\nand the emission of relativistic particles that diffuse in the surrounding\nmedium.\n  Results: Multiwavelength emission associated with Galactic IBHs can be\ndetected in systems moving through a very dense medium. Thermal emission from\naccretion could be observed in the mid infrared and in hard X rays with current\nand forthcoming observatories. Thermal and non thermal emission from the\noutflow medium shock could also be detected in the radio and millimetre ranges.\nMoreover, detection of the emission from particles diffusing in a dense medium\ncould be feasible in gamma rays. Applying our model to the IBH associated with\nthe gravitational microlensing event MOA2011BLG191 OGLE2011BLG0462, we inferred\nthat radio and infrared detection of the IBH is plausible. Also, we derived\nthat IBHs could be modest Galactic cosmic ray contributors, potentially\nreaching a 1% contribution at 1 PeV. Finally, by extending our model to\nprimordial black holes, we conclude that efficient leptonic acceleration in\ntheir outflow medium interactions would rule them out as a major dark matter\ncomponent."

                "summary": "The association of the Vela Pulsar with the Vela Supernova Remnant has long\nsupported the hypothesis that core-collapse supernovae yield neutron stars, but\nits surrounding stellar population now offers new insights into progenitor\nevolution. By age-dating stars within 150 pc of the Vela Pulsar, we infer\nproperties of its progenitor. These stars belong to the Vela-Puppis complex,\nrevealing the region's star formation history. While stellar population models\nwith standard assumptions suggest a likely progenitor age and mass, these\npredictions are internally inconsistent with the observed population,\nindicating that something is missing in the standard modeling approach. With\nthose assumptions, there is very weak support for a $\\lesssim$10 Myr old\npopulation, moderate support for a 40 Myr old population, and strong support\nfor an intermediate age population around 65-100 Myrs old. The $\\lesssim$10 Myr\nsignal hinges on two peculiar O stars, which are unlike any others in the\nVela-Puppis complex and imply nearly three times more main sequence stars than\nare observed. The 40 Myr-old population is supported by 6 red supergiants\n(RSGs) and several Be stars; but this population is again marginally\ninconsistent with the observed distribution of main sequence stars.

By age-dating stars within 150 pc of the Vela Pulsar, we infer\nproperties of its progenitor. These stars belong to the Vela-Puppis complex,\nrevealing the region's star formation history. While stellar population models\nwith standard assumptions suggest a likely progenitor age and mass, these\npredictions are internally inconsistent with the observed population,\nindicating that something is missing in the standard modeling approach. With\nthose assumptions, there is very weak support for a $\\lesssim$10 Myr old\npopulation, moderate support for a 40 Myr old population, and strong support\nfor an intermediate age population around 65-100 Myrs old. The $\\lesssim$10 Myr\nsignal hinges on two peculiar O stars, which are unlike any others in the\nVela-Puppis complex and imply nearly three times more main sequence stars than\nare observed. The 40 Myr-old population is supported by 6 red supergiants\n(RSGs) and several Be stars; but this population is again marginally\ninconsistent with the observed distribution of main sequence stars. The red\ngiant (RG) and MS distributions are consistent with a 65-100 Myr old\npopulation.

Yet,\nachieving scalable, low-power end-to-end on-chip learning, especially from\nreal-world sequential data with a limited number of examples, is an open\nchallenge. Indeed, accelerators supporting error backpropagation optimize for\nlearning performance at the expense of inference efficiency, while simplified\nlearning algorithms often fail to reach acceptable accuracy targets. In this\nwork, we present Chameleon, leveraging three key contributions to solve these\nchallenges. (i) A unified learning and inference architecture supports few-shot\nlearning (FSL), continual learning (CL) and inference at only 0.5% area\noverhead to the inference logic. (ii) Long temporal dependencies are\nefficiently captured with temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), enabling the\nfirst demonstration of end-to-end on-chip FSL and CL on sequential data and\ninference on 16-kHz raw audio. (iii) A dual-mode, matrix-multiplication-free\ncompute array allows either matching the power consumption of state-of-the-art\ninference-only keyword spotting (KWS) accelerators or enabling $4.3\\times$\nhigher peak GOPS. Fabricated in 40-nm CMOS, Chameleon sets new accuracy records\non Omniglot for end-to-end on-chip FSL (96.8%, 5-way 1-shot, 98.8%, 5-way\n5-shot) and CL (82.2% final accuracy for learning 250 classes with 10 shots),\nwhile maintaining an inference accuracy of 93.3% on the 12-class Google Speech\nCommands dataset at an extreme-edge power budget of 3.1 $\\mu$W.",

Yet,\nachieving scalable, low-power end-to-end on-chip learning, especially from\nreal-world sequential data with a limited number of examples, is an open\nchallenge. Indeed, accelerators supporting error backpropagation optimize for\nlearning performance at the expense of inference efficiency, while simplified\nlearning algorithms often fail to reach acceptable accuracy targets. In this\nwork, we present Chameleon, leveraging three key contributions to solve these\nchallenges. (i) A unified learning and inference architecture supports few-shot\nlearning (FSL), continual learning (CL) and inference at only 0.5% area\noverhead to the inference logic. (ii) Long temporal dependencies are\nefficiently captured with temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), enabling the\nfirst demonstration of end-to-end on-chip FSL and CL on sequential data and\ninference on 16-kHz raw audio. (iii) A dual-mode, matrix-multiplication-free\ncompute array allows either matching the power consumption of state-of-the-art\ninference-only keyword spotting (KWS) accelerators or enabling $4.3\\times$\nhigher peak GOPS. Fabricated in 40-nm CMOS, Chameleon sets new accuracy records\non Omniglot for end-to-end on-chip FSL (96.8%, 5-way 1-shot, 98.8%, 5-way\n5-shot) and CL (82.2% final accuracy for learning 250 classes with 10 shots),\nwhile maintaining an inference accuracy of 93.3% on the 12-class Google Speech\nCommands dataset at an extreme-edge power budget of 3.1 $\\mu$W."

Given the distinct semantic\nproperties of code, we introduce modifications, including a semantic\nequivalence check based on symbolic execution. Our findings indicate a strong\ncorrelation between the uncertainty computed through these techniques and\ncorrectness, highlighting the potential of uncertainty estimation for quality\nassessment. Additionally, we propose a simplified version of the entropy-based\nmethod that assumes a uniform distribution over the LLM's responses,\ndemonstrating comparable effectiveness. Using these techniques, we develop an\nabstention policy that prevents the model from making predictions when\nuncertainty is high, reducing incorrect outputs to near zero.

In this work, we show that the reason behind this\ndegradation is due to exponentially imbalanced errors between layers during\nweight updates, and predictions from the previous layer not being effective in\nguiding updates in deeper layers.

This allows to infer qualitatively\nand even quantitatively the imposed deformation and, eventually from that, an\nestimation of the stiffness and average stress on the sample even in complex\nloading scenarios involving combinations of uniform or nonuniform\ncompression/tension with superposed shearing in different directions. The work\nprovides a complete experimental, theoretical and numerical framework on finite\nstrain, compressible magneto-elasticity, thereby allowing to measure and\npredict coupled magneto-mechanical properties of such materials with different\nparticle volume fractions and then use it to estimate and design potential\nhaptic sensing devices."

We aim to characterize the properties of the inner companion of the\nS-type AGB star pi1 Gru and to identify plausible future evolutionary scenarios\nfor this triple system. Methods. We observed pi1 Gru with ALMA and VLT/SPHERE.\nIn addition, we collected archival photometry data and used the Hipparcos-Gaia\nproper motion anomaly. We derive the best orbital parameters from Bayesian\ninference. Results. In June-July 2019, the inner companion, pi1 Gru C, was\nlocated at 37.4 +/- 2.0 mas from the primary (a projected separation of 6.05\n+/- 0.55 au at 161.7 +/- 11.7 pc).

The preferred solution is an elliptical orbit with\neccentricity e = 0.35(+0.18/-0.17), although a circular orbit cannot be fully\nexcluded. The close companion could be either a K1V (F9.5V to K7V) star or a\nwhite dwarf (WD). Ultraviolet and millimeter continuum photometry are\nconsistent with the presence of an accretion disk around the close companion.\nThe ultraviolet emission may originate from hot spots in an overall cooler\ndisk, or from a hot disk if the companion is a WD.

We\nfirst confirm the wide existence of this phenomenon across the most popular\nfamilies of LLMs such as Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek, and Qwen. Our analysis,\ntheoretically and empirically, identifies that the underlying reason for the\nineffectiveness of deep layers in LLMs is the widespread usage of Pre-Layer\nNormalization (Pre-LN). While Pre-LN stabilizes the training of Transformer\nLLMs, its output variance exponentially grows with the model depth, which\nundesirably causes the derivative of the deep Transformer blocks to be an\nidentity matrix, and therefore barely contributes to the training. To resolve\nthis training pitfall, we propose LayerNorm Scaling (LNS), which scales the\nvariance of output of the layer normalization inversely by the square root of\nits depth. This simple modification mitigates the output variance explosion of\ndeeper Transformer layers, improving their contribution. Across a wide range of\nmodel sizes (130M to 7B), our experiments show that LNS consistently\noutperforms previous normalization and scaling techniques in enhancing LLM\npre-training performance.

We argue that AI influences learning objectives of different Bloom\nlevels in a different way, and assessment has to be adopted accordingly.\nFurthermore, in line with Bloom's vision, formative and summative assessment\nshould be aligned on whether the use of AI is permitted or not.\n  Although lecturers tend to agree that education and assessment need to be\nadapted to the presence of AI, a strong bias exists on the extent to which\nlecturers want to allow for AI in assessment. This bias is caused by a\nlecturer's familiarity with AI and specifically whether they use it themselves.\nTo avoid this bias, we propose structured guidelines on a university or faculty\nlevel, to foster alignment among the staff.

We argue that AI influences learning objectives of different Bloom\nlevels in a different way, and assessment has to be adopted accordingly.\nFurthermore, in line with Bloom's vision, formative and summative assessment\nshould be aligned on whether the use of AI is permitted or not.\n  Although lecturers tend to agree that education and assessment need to be\nadapted to the presence of AI, a strong bias exists on the extent to which\nlecturers want to allow for AI in assessment. This bias is caused by a\nlecturer's familiarity with AI and specifically whether they use it themselves.\nTo avoid this bias, we propose structured guidelines on a university or faculty\nlevel, to foster alignment among the staff. Besides that, we argue that\nteaching staff should be trained on the capabilities and limitations of AI\ntools. In this way, they are better able to adapt their assessment methods."

We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework\nwhere models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously\nimproving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision.\nThrough self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively\nchallenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To\nenable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online,\nmulti-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose\nrole-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training.\nUsing SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that\ntransfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6%\nimprovement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000\nexpert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through\nthree cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation,\nand case-by-case analysis.

It then applies this\nestimation to calibrate the predicted confidence scores during inference.\nExperimental results on three medical imaging datasets: PAPILA for fundus image\nclassification, HAM10000 for skin cancer classification, and MIMIC-CXR for\nchest X-ray classification demonstrate CALIN's effectiveness at ensuring fair\nconfidence calibration in its prediction, while improving its overall\nprediction accuracies and exhibiting minimum fairness-utility trade-off."

To\ndevelop socially intelligent AI technologies, it is crucial to develop models\nthat can both comprehend and generate dyadic behavioral dynamics. To this end,\nwe introduce the Seamless Interaction Dataset, a large-scale collection of over\n4,000 hours of face-to-face interaction footage from over 4,000 participants in\ndiverse contexts. This dataset enables the development of AI technologies that\nunderstand dyadic embodied dynamics, unlocking breakthroughs in virtual agents,\ntelepresence experiences, and multimodal content analysis tools. We also\ndevelop a suite of models that utilize the dataset to generate dyadic motion\ngestures and facial expressions aligned with human speech. These models can\ntake as input both the speech and visual behavior of their interlocutors. We\npresent a variant with speech from an LLM model and integrations with 2D and 3D\nrendering methods, bringing us closer to interactive virtual agents.\nAdditionally, we describe controllable variants of our motion models that can\nadapt emotional responses and expressivity levels, as well as generating more\nsemantically-relevant gestures. Finally, we discuss methods for assessing the\nquality of these dyadic motion models, which are demonstrating the potential\nfor more intuitive and responsive human-AI interactions.",

Despite this progress, the effects of\ndata, model architecture, training objective functions, and sampling strategies\non target benchmarks are not well understood. With the purpose of providing a\nholistic understanding of the design space of TTA models, we set up a\nlarge-scale empirical experiment focused on diffusion and flow matching models.\nOur contributions include: 1) AF-Synthetic, a large dataset of high quality\nsynthetic captions obtained from an audio understanding model; 2) a systematic\ncomparison of different architectural, training, and inference design choices\nfor TTA models; 3) an analysis of sampling methods and their Pareto curves with\nrespect to generation quality and inference speed. We leverage the knowledge\nobtained from this extensive analysis to propose our best model dubbed\nElucidated Text-To-Audio (ETTA). When evaluated on AudioCaps and MusicCaps,\nETTA provides improvements over the baselines trained on publicly available\ndata, while being competitive with models trained on proprietary data. Finally,\nwe show ETTA's improved ability to generate creative audio following complex\nand imaginative captions -- a task that is more challenging than current\nbenchmarks.",

In response to this challenge,\nefforts have been directed toward the application of traditional network\npruning techniques to LLMs, uncovering a massive number of parameters that can\nbe pruned in one-shot without hurting performance. Prevailing LLM pruning\nstrategies have consistently adhered to the practice of uniformly pruning all\nlayers at equivalent sparsity, resulting in robust performance. However, this\nobservation stands in contrast to the prevailing trends observed in the field\nof vision models, where non-uniform layerwise sparsity typically yields\nstronger results. To understand the underlying reasons for this disparity, we\nconduct a comprehensive study and discover a strong correlation with the\nemergence of activation outliers in LLMs. Inspired by this finding, we\nintroduce a novel LLM pruning methodology that incorporates a tailored set of\nnon-uniform layerwise sparsity ratios, termed as Outlier Weighed Layerwise\nsparsity (OWL). The sparsity ratio of OWL is proportional to the outlier ratio\nobserved within each layer, facilitating a more effective alignment between\nlayerwise weight sparsity and outlier ratios. Our empirical evaluation,\nconducted across the LLaMA-V1 family and OPT, spanning various benchmarks,\ndemonstrates the distinct advantages offered by OWL over previous methods. For\ninstance, OWL exhibits a remarkable performance gain, surpassing the\nstate-of-the-art Wanda and SparseGPT by 61.22 and 6.80 perplexity at a high\nsparsity level of 70%, respectively, while delivering 2.6x end-to-end inference\nspeed-up in the DeepSparse inference engine.

These concepts reflect a trade-off between expressive fidelity and\nrepresentational simplicity. Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate\nremarkable linguistic abilities, yet whether their internal representations\nstrike a human-like trade-off between compression and semantic fidelity is\nunclear. We introduce a novel information-theoretic framework, drawing from\nRate-Distortion Theory and the Information Bottleneck principle, to\nquantitatively compare these strategies. Analyzing token embeddings from a\ndiverse suite of LLMs against seminal human categorization benchmarks, we\nuncover key divergences. While LLMs form broad conceptual categories that align\nwith human judgment, they struggle to capture the fine-grained semantic\ndistinctions crucial for human understanding. More fundamentally, LLMs\ndemonstrate a strong bias towards aggressive statistical compression, whereas\nhuman conceptual systems appear to prioritize adaptive nuance and contextual\nrichness, even if this results in lower compressional efficiency by our\nmeasures. These findings illuminate critical differences between current AI and\nhuman cognitive architectures, guiding pathways toward LLMs with more\nhuman-aligned conceptual representations.",

Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate\nremarkable linguistic abilities, yet whether their internal representations\nstrike a human-like trade-off between compression and semantic fidelity is\nunclear. We introduce a novel information-theoretic framework, drawing from\nRate-Distortion Theory and the Information Bottleneck principle, to\nquantitatively compare these strategies. Analyzing token embeddings from a\ndiverse suite of LLMs against seminal human categorization benchmarks, we\nuncover key divergences. While LLMs form broad conceptual categories that align\nwith human judgment, they struggle to capture the fine-grained semantic\ndistinctions crucial for human understanding. More fundamentally, LLMs\ndemonstrate a strong bias towards aggressive statistical compression, whereas\nhuman conceptual systems appear to prioritize adaptive nuance and contextual\nrichness, even if this results in lower compressional efficiency by our\nmeasures. These findings illuminate critical differences between current AI and\nhuman cognitive architectures, guiding pathways toward LLMs with more\nhuman-aligned conceptual representations."

The family comes\nin three sizes -- Nano (8B), Super (49B), and Ultra (253B) -- and performs\ncompetitively with state-of-the-art reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 while\noffering superior inference throughput and memory efficiency. In this report,\nwe discuss the training procedure for these models, which entails using neural\narchitecture search from Llama 3 models for accelerated inference, knowledge\ndistillation, and continued pretraining, followed by a reasoning-focused\npost-training stage consisting of two main parts: supervised fine-tuning and\nlarge scale reinforcement learning. Llama-Nemotron models are the first\nopen-source models to support a dynamic reasoning toggle, allowing users to\nswitch between standard chat and reasoning modes during inference. To further\nsupport open research and facilitate model development, we provide the\nfollowing resources: 1. We release the Llama-Nemotron reasoning models --\nLN-Nano, LN-Super, and LN-Ultra -- under the commercially permissive NVIDIA\nOpen Model License Agreement. 2. We release the complete post-training dataset:\nLlama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset. 3. We also release our training\ncodebases: NeMo, NeMo-Aligner, and Megatron-LM.",

Specifically,\nVisVM not only evaluates the generated sentence quality in the current search\nstep, but also anticipates the quality of subsequent sentences that may result\nfrom the current step, thus providing a long-term value. In this way, VisVM\nsteers VLMs away from generating sentences prone to hallucinations or\ninsufficient detail, thereby producing higher quality responses. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that VisVM-guided search significantly enhances VLMs'\nability to generate descriptive captions with richer visual details and fewer\nhallucinations, compared with greedy decoding and search methods with other\nvisual reward signals.

Next, we embed these\nsub-queries and perform encrypted sub-second semantic search using our\nHomomorphically Encrypted Vector Database across one million entries of a\nsingle user's private data. This represents a realistic scale of personal\ndocuments, emails, and records accumulated over years of digital activity.\nFinally, we feed the CoT prompt and the decrypted records to a local language\nmodel and generate the final response. On the LoCoMo long-context QA benchmark,\nour hybrid framework, combining GPT-4o with a local Llama-3.2-1B model,\noutperforms using GPT-4o alone by up to 7.1 percentage points. This\ndemonstrates a first step toward systems where tasks are decomposed and split\nbetween untrusted strong LLMs and weak local ones, preserving user privacy."

Their ability to leverage prior knowledge from massive\ndatasets has streamlined the development of intelligent pathology models.\nHowever, we identify several critical and interrelated ethical risks that\nremain underexplored, yet must be addressed to enable the safe translation of\nPFMs from lab to clinic. These include the potential leakage of\npatient-sensitive attributes, disparities in model performance across\ndemographic and institutional subgroups, and the reliance on\ndiagnosis-irrelevant features that undermine clinical reliability. In this\nstudy, we pioneer the quantitative analysis for ethical risks in PFMs,\nincluding privacy leakage, clinical reliability, and group fairness.\nSpecifically, we propose an evaluation framework that systematically measures\nkey dimensions of ethical concern: the degree to which patient-sensitive\nattributes can be inferred from model representations, the extent of\nperformance disparities across demographic and institutional subgroups, and the\ninfluence of diagnostically irrelevant features on model decisions. We further\ninvestigate the underlying causes of these ethical risks in PFMs and\nempirically validate our findings.

Their ability to leverage prior knowledge from massive\ndatasets has streamlined the development of intelligent pathology models.\nHowever, we identify several critical and interrelated ethical risks that\nremain underexplored, yet must be addressed to enable the safe translation of\nPFMs from lab to clinic. These include the potential leakage of\npatient-sensitive attributes, disparities in model performance across\ndemographic and institutional subgroups, and the reliance on\ndiagnosis-irrelevant features that undermine clinical reliability. In this\nstudy, we pioneer the quantitative analysis for ethical risks in PFMs,\nincluding privacy leakage, clinical reliability, and group fairness.\nSpecifically, we propose an evaluation framework that systematically measures\nkey dimensions of ethical concern: the degree to which patient-sensitive\nattributes can be inferred from model representations, the extent of\nperformance disparities across demographic and institutional subgroups, and the\ninfluence of diagnostically irrelevant features on model decisions. We further\ninvestigate the underlying causes of these ethical risks in PFMs and\nempirically validate our findings. Then we offer insights into potential\ndirections for mitigating such risks, aiming to inform the development of more\nethically robust PFMs. This work provides the first quantitative and systematic\nevaluation of ethical risks in PFMs. Our findings highlight the urgent need for\nethical safeguards in PFMs and offer actionable insights for building more\ntrustworthy and clinically robust PFMs. To facilitate future research and\ndeployment, we will release the assessment framework as an online toolkit to\nsupport the development, auditing, and deployment of ethically robust PFMs."

This study\ntherefore compares the problem-solving performance of a general-purpose LLM\n(GPT-4o, using varying prompting techniques) and a reasoning-optimized model\n(o1-preview) with that of participants of the German Physics Olympiad, based on\na set of well-defined Olympiad problems. In addition to evaluating the\ncorrectness of the generated solutions, the study analyzes characteristic\nstrengths and limitations of LLM-generated solutions. The findings of this\nstudy indicate that both tested LLMs (GPT-4o and o1-preview) demonstrate\nadvanced problem-solving capabilities on Olympiad-type physics problems, on\naverage outperforming the human participants. Prompting techniques had little\neffect on GPT-4o's performance, while o1-preview almost consistently\noutperformed both GPT-4o and the human benchmark.

By shifting from a cognitivist to a semiotic framework, we avoid\nanthropomorphism and gain a more precise understanding of how LLMs participate\nin cultural processes, not by thinking, but by generating texts that invite\ninterpretation. Through theoretical analysis and practical examples, the paper\ndemonstrates how LLMs function as semiotic agents whose outputs can be treated\nas interpretive acts, open to contextual negotiation and critical reflection.\nWe explore applications in literature, philosophy, education, and cultural\nproduction, emphasizing how LLMs can serve as tools for creativity, dialogue,\nand critical inquiry. The semiotic paradigm foregrounds the situated,\ncontingent, and socially embedded nature of meaning, offering a more rigorous\nand ethically aware framework for studying and using LLMs. Ultimately, this\napproach reframes LLMs as technological participants in an ongoing ecology of\nsigns.

We\nfirst confirm the wide existence of this phenomenon across the most popular\nfamilies of LLMs such as Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek, and Qwen. Our analysis,\ntheoretically and empirically, identifies that the underlying reason for the\nineffectiveness of deep layers in LLMs is the widespread usage of Pre-Layer\nNormalization (Pre-LN). While Pre-LN stabilizes the training of Transformer\nLLMs, its output variance exponentially grows with the model depth, which\nundesirably causes the derivative of the deep Transformer blocks to be an\nidentity matrix, and therefore barely contributes to the training. To resolve\nthis training pitfall, we propose LayerNorm Scaling (LNS), which scales the\nvariance of output of the layer normalization inversely by the square root of\nits depth. This simple modification mitigates the output variance explosion of\ndeeper Transformer layers, improving their contribution. Across a wide range of\nmodel sizes (130M to 7B), our experiments show that LNS consistently\noutperforms previous normalization and scaling techniques in enhancing LLM\npre-training performance. Moreover, this improvement seamlessly carries over to\nsupervised fine-tuning. All these gains can be attributed to the fact that\nLayerNorm Scaling enables deeper layers to contribute more effectively during\ntraining.

This simple modification mitigates the output variance explosion of\ndeeper Transformer layers, improving their contribution. Across a wide range of\nmodel sizes (130M to 7B), our experiments show that LNS consistently\noutperforms previous normalization and scaling techniques in enhancing LLM\npre-training performance. Moreover, this improvement seamlessly carries over to\nsupervised fine-tuning. All these gains can be attributed to the fact that\nLayerNorm Scaling enables deeper layers to contribute more effectively during\ntraining.

                "summary": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as state-of-the-art methods to\nlearn from graph-structured data for recommendation. However, most existing\nGNN-based recommendation methods focus on the optimization of model structures\nand learning strategies based on pre-defined graphs, neglecting the importance\nof the graph construction stage. Earlier works for graph construction usually\nrely on speciffic rules or crowdsourcing, which are either too simplistic or\ntoo labor-intensive. Recent works start to utilize large language models (LLMs)\nto automate the graph construction, in view of their abundant open-world\nknowledge and remarkable reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, they generally\nsuffer from two limitations: (1) invisibility of global view (e.g., overlooking\ncontextual information) and (2) construction inefficiency. To this end, we\nintroduce AutoGraph, an automatic graph construction framework based on LLMs\nfor recommendation. Specifically, we first use LLMs to infer the user\npreference and item knowledge, which is encoded as semantic vectors. Next, we\nemploy vector quantization to extract the latent factors from the semantic\nvectors. The latent factors are then incorporated as extra nodes to link the\nuser/item nodes, resulting in a graph with in-depth global-view semantics. We\nfurther design metapath-based message aggregation to effectively aggregate the\nsemantic and collaborative information. The framework is model-agnostic and\ncompatible with different backbone models. Extensive experiments on three\nreal-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy and efffciency of AutoGraph\ncompared to existing baseline methods. We have deployed AutoGraph in Huawei\nadvertising platform, and gain a 2.69% improvement on RPM and a 7.31%\nimprovement on eCPM in the online A/B test. Currently AutoGraph has been used\nas the main trafffc model, serving hundreds of millions of people.",

However, most existing\nGNN-based recommendation methods focus on the optimization of model structures\nand learning strategies based on pre-defined graphs, neglecting the importance\nof the graph construction stage. Earlier works for graph construction usually\nrely on speciffic rules or crowdsourcing, which are either too simplistic or\ntoo labor-intensive. Recent works start to utilize large language models (LLMs)\nto automate the graph construction, in view of their abundant open-world\nknowledge and remarkable reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, they generally\nsuffer from two limitations: (1) invisibility of global view (e.g., overlooking\ncontextual information) and (2) construction inefficiency. To this end, we\nintroduce AutoGraph, an automatic graph construction framework based on LLMs\nfor recommendation. Specifically, we first use LLMs to infer the user\npreference and item knowledge, which is encoded as semantic vectors. Next, we\nemploy vector quantization to extract the latent factors from the semantic\nvectors. The latent factors are then incorporated as extra nodes to link the\nuser/item nodes, resulting in a graph with in-depth global-view semantics. We\nfurther design metapath-based message aggregation to effectively aggregate the\nsemantic and collaborative information. The framework is model-agnostic and\ncompatible with different backbone models. Extensive experiments on three\nreal-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy and efffciency of AutoGraph\ncompared to existing baseline methods. We have deployed AutoGraph in Huawei\nadvertising platform, and gain a 2.69% improvement on RPM and a 7.31%\nimprovement on eCPM in the online A/B test. Currently AutoGraph has been used\nas the main trafffc model, serving hundreds of millions of people."

Given (i) the\nexceptionally broad adoption of the tool in our organization, (ii) our research\nmission, and (iii) the shared responsibility model required by Microsoft OpenAI\nproducts, we deemed rigorous copyright compliance testing necessary.\n  Case Description: We conducted a structured red teaming exercise in Nov.\n2024, with 42 participants from academic, industry, and government\ninstitutions. Four teams attempted to extract copyrighted content from GPT4DFCI\nacross four domains: literary works, news articles, scientific publications,\nand access-restricted clinical notes. Teams successfully extracted verbatim\nbook dedications and near-exact passages through indirect prompting strategies.\nNews article extraction failed despite jailbreak attempts. Scientific article\nreproduction yielded only high-level summaries. Clinical note testing revealed\nappropriate privacy safeguards with data reformatting rather than reproduction.\n  Discussion: The successful extraction of literary content indicates potential\ncopyright material presence in training data, necessitating enhanced\ninference-time filtering. Differential success rates across content types\nsuggest varying protective mechanisms. The event led to implementation of a\ncopyright-specific meta-prompt in GPT4DFCI; this mitigation is in production\nsince Jan. 2025.\n  Conclusion: Systematic red teaming revealed specific vulnerabilities in\ngenerative AI copyright compliance, leading to concrete mitigation strategies.\nAcademic medical institutions deploying generative AI must implement continuous\ntesting protocols to ensure legal and ethical compliance.",

Given (i) the\nexceptionally broad adoption of the tool in our organization, (ii) our research\nmission, and (iii) the shared responsibility model required by Microsoft OpenAI\nproducts, we deemed rigorous copyright compliance testing necessary.\n  Case Description: We conducted a structured red teaming exercise in Nov.\n2024, with 42 participants from academic, industry, and government\ninstitutions. Four teams attempted to extract copyrighted content from GPT4DFCI\nacross four domains: literary works, news articles, scientific publications,\nand access-restricted clinical notes. Teams successfully extracted verbatim\nbook dedications and near-exact passages through indirect prompting strategies.\nNews article extraction failed despite jailbreak attempts. Scientific article\nreproduction yielded only high-level summaries. Clinical note testing revealed\nappropriate privacy safeguards with data reformatting rather than reproduction.\n  Discussion: The successful extraction of literary content indicates potential\ncopyright material presence in training data, necessitating enhanced\ninference-time filtering. Differential success rates across content types\nsuggest varying protective mechanisms. The event led to implementation of a\ncopyright-specific meta-prompt in GPT4DFCI; this mitigation is in production\nsince Jan. 2025.\n  Conclusion: Systematic red teaming revealed specific vulnerabilities in\ngenerative AI copyright compliance, leading to concrete mitigation strategies.\nAcademic medical institutions deploying generative AI must implement continuous\ntesting protocols to ensure legal and ethical compliance."

Contrary to this belief, this paper presents a\ncounter-argument: small-magnitude weights of pre-trained model weights encode\nvital knowledge essential for tackling difficult downstream tasks - manifested\nas the monotonic relationship between the performance drop of downstream tasks\nacross the difficulty spectrum, as we prune more pre-trained weights by\nmagnitude.

In response to this challenge,\nefforts have been directed toward the application of traditional network\npruning techniques to LLMs, uncovering a massive number of parameters that can\nbe pruned in one-shot without hurting performance. Prevailing LLM pruning\nstrategies have consistently adhered to the practice of uniformly pruning all\nlayers at equivalent sparsity, resulting in robust performance. However, this\nobservation stands in contrast to the prevailing trends observed in the field\nof vision models, where non-uniform layerwise sparsity typically yields\nstronger results. To understand the underlying reasons for this disparity, we\nconduct a comprehensive study and discover a strong correlation with the\nemergence of activation outliers in LLMs. Inspired by this finding, we\nintroduce a novel LLM pruning methodology that incorporates a tailored set of\nnon-uniform layerwise sparsity ratios, termed as Outlier Weighed Layerwise\nsparsity (OWL). The sparsity ratio of OWL is proportional to the outlier ratio\nobserved within each layer, facilitating a more effective alignment between\nlayerwise weight sparsity and outlier ratios. Our empirical evaluation,\nconducted across the LLaMA-V1 family and OPT, spanning various benchmarks,\ndemonstrates the distinct advantages offered by OWL over previous methods. For\ninstance, OWL exhibits a remarkable performance gain, surpassing the\nstate-of-the-art Wanda and SparseGPT by 61.22 and 6.80 perplexity at a high\nsparsity level of 70%, respectively, while delivering 2.6x end-to-end inference\nspeed-up in the DeepSparse inference engine.

                "summary": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown strong capability in enhancing\nlanguage models' knowledge and reducing AI generative hallucinations, driving\nits widespread use. However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval\nremain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a\ngood sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue\nsearching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may\nprovide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge.\nExisting solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled\nprocess supervision data or lead to subpar performance. This paper aims to\naddress these limitations by introducing a new framework, SIM-RAG, to\nexplicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and multi-round retrieval\ncapabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system self-practice\nmulti-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs with\nintermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic training\ndata.

                    "value": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown strong capability in enhancing\nlanguage models' knowledge and reducing AI generative hallucinations, driving\nits widespread use. However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval\nremain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a\ngood sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue\nsearching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may\nprovide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge.\nExisting solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled\nprocess supervision data or lead to subpar performance. This paper aims to\naddress these limitations by introducing a new framework, SIM-RAG, to\nexplicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and multi-round retrieval\ncapabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system self-practice\nmulti-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs with\nintermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic training\ndata. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths, which are\nlabeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and unsuccessful\notherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information sufficiency\nCritic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG system has\nretrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval decisions and\nimproving system-level self-awareness through in-context reinforcement\nlearning.

                "summary": "The proliferation of agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) on personal devices\nintroduces a new class of workloads characterized by a dichotomy of objectives.\nReactive tasks, initiated by users, demand immediate, low-latency responses,\nwhile proactive tasks operate invisibly and prioritize throughput. Existing\non-device LLM engines, designed for isolated inferences, fail to efficiently\nmanage these concurrent and conflicting requests on consumer-grade\nheterogeneous SoCs with CPU, integrated GPU, and NPU. This paper introduces\nAgent.xpu, an efficient serving system for agentic LLM workloads on\nmemory-unified heterogeneous SoCs. With dedicated offline profiling, Agent.xpu\nfirst constructs a heterogeneous execution graph, which fuses and chunks model\nkernels for affinity-guided, elastic accelerator mapping with predictive kernel\nannotation.

                    "value": "The proliferation of agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) on personal devices\nintroduces a new class of workloads characterized by a dichotomy of objectives.\nReactive tasks, initiated by users, demand immediate, low-latency responses,\nwhile proactive tasks operate invisibly and prioritize throughput. Existing\non-device LLM engines, designed for isolated inferences, fail to efficiently\nmanage these concurrent and conflicting requests on consumer-grade\nheterogeneous SoCs with CPU, integrated GPU, and NPU. This paper introduces\nAgent.xpu, an efficient serving system for agentic LLM workloads on\nmemory-unified heterogeneous SoCs. With dedicated offline profiling, Agent.xpu\nfirst constructs a heterogeneous execution graph, which fuses and chunks model\nkernels for affinity-guided, elastic accelerator mapping with predictive kernel\nannotation. At runtime, its online scheduler enables fine-grained, kernel-level\npreemption to guarantee the responsiveness of reactive tasks. To maximize SoC\nutilization, it adopts slack-aware kernel backfill to opportunistically append\nproactive tasks, and mitigates NPU-iGPU contention via bandwidth-aware\ndispatch.

One hope is that they can support\nmathematics learning, including word-problem solving. Since LLMs can handle\ntextual input with ease, they appear well-suited for solving mathematical word\nproblems. Yet their real competence, whether they can make sense of the\nreal-world context, and the implications for classrooms remain unclear. We\nconducted a scoping review from a mathematics-education perspective, including\nthree parts: a technical overview, a systematic review of word problems used in\nresearch, and a state-of-the-art empirical evaluation of LLMs on mathematical\nword problems. First, in the technical overview, we contrast the\nconceptualization of word problems and their solution processes between LLMs\nand students. In computer-science research this is typically labeled\nmathematical reasoning, a term that does not align with usage in mathematics\neducation. Second, our literature review of 213 studies shows that the most\npopular word-problem corpora are dominated by s-problems, which do not require\na consideration of realities of their real-world context. Finally, our\nevaluation of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, and o3 on 287 word problems\nshows that most recent LLMs solve these s-problems with near-perfect accuracy,\nincluding a perfect score on 20 problems from PISA. LLMs still showed\nweaknesses in tackling problems where the real-world context is problematic or\nnon-sensical.

However, existing\ntechniques primarily focus on evaluating ADS functionalities in single-AV\nsettings. As ADSs are increasingly deployed in multi-AV traffic, it becomes\ncrucial to assess their cooperative performance, particularly regarding\ndeadlocks, a fundamental coordination failure in which multiple AVs enter a\ncircular waiting state indefinitely, resulting in motion planning failures.\nDespite its importance, the cooperative capability of ADSs to prevent deadlocks\nremains insufficiently underexplored. To address this gap, we propose the first\ndedicated Spatio-Temporal Conflict-Guided Deadlock Avoidance Testing technique,\nSTCLocker, for generating DeadLock Scenarios (DLSs), where a group of AVs\ncontrolled by the ADS under test are in a circular wait state. STCLocker\nconsists of three key components: Deadlock Oracle, Conflict Feedback, and\nConflict-aware Scenario Generation. Deadlock Oracle provides a reliable\nblack-box mechanism for detecting deadlock cycles among multiple AVs within a\ngiven scenario. Conflict Feedback and Conflict-aware Scenario Generation\ncollaborate to actively guide AVs into simultaneous competition over spatial\nconflict resources (i.e., shared passing regions) and temporal competitive\nbehaviors (i.e., reaching the conflict region at the same time), thereby\nincreasing the effectiveness of generating conflict-prone deadlocks. We\nevaluate STCLocker on two types of ADSs: Roach, an end-to-end ADS, and OpenCDA,\na module-based ADS supporting cooperative communication. Experimental results\nshow that, on average, STCLocker generates more DLS than the best-performing\nbaseline.",

However, while they may produce fluent outputs, it\nremains unclear to what extent these models truly grasp the underlying\nlinguistic complexity of those languages, particularly in morphology. To\ninvestigate this, we introduce IMPACT, a synthetically generated evaluation\nframework focused on inflectional morphology, which we publicly release,\ndesigned to evaluate LLM performance across five morphologically rich\nlanguages: Arabic, Russian, Finnish, Turkish, and Hebrew. IMPACT includes\nunit-test-style cases covering both shared and language-specific phenomena,\nfrom basic verb inflections (e.g., tense, number, gender) to unique features\nlike Arabic's reverse gender agreement and vowel harmony in Finnish and\nTurkish. We assess eight multilingual LLMs that, despite strong English\nperformance, struggle with other languages and uncommon morphological patterns,\nespecially when judging ungrammatical examples. We also show that Chain of\nThought and Thinking Models can degrade performance. Our work exposes gaps in\nLLMs' handling of linguistic complexity, pointing to clear room for\nimprovement.

However, while they may produce fluent outputs, it\nremains unclear to what extent these models truly grasp the underlying\nlinguistic complexity of those languages, particularly in morphology. To\ninvestigate this, we introduce IMPACT, a synthetically generated evaluation\nframework focused on inflectional morphology, which we publicly release,\ndesigned to evaluate LLM performance across five morphologically rich\nlanguages: Arabic, Russian, Finnish, Turkish, and Hebrew. IMPACT includes\nunit-test-style cases covering both shared and language-specific phenomena,\nfrom basic verb inflections (e.g., tense, number, gender) to unique features\nlike Arabic's reverse gender agreement and vowel harmony in Finnish and\nTurkish. We assess eight multilingual LLMs that, despite strong English\nperformance, struggle with other languages and uncommon morphological patterns,\nespecially when judging ungrammatical examples. We also show that Chain of\nThought and Thinking Models can degrade performance. Our work exposes gaps in\nLLMs' handling of linguistic complexity, pointing to clear room for\nimprovement. To support further research, we publicly release the IMPACT\nframework."

For example, in the two-sample test, we compare\nthe log-probability of strings under contexts from its own versus the other\ngroup. We show on synthetic data that the method's t-statistics exhibit the\nexpected null behaviour while maintaining power and, through a replication,\nthat the method is powerful and interpretable. We next introduce text-on-text\nregression. Contexts generated around the predictor string are treated as\nmediating variables between the predictor and outcome strings. Using negative\ncontrols, we then distinguish between semantic and syntactic dimensions of\nprediction. Analysis of real-world dialogic data illustrates behaviour\npredicted from a psycholinguistic framework. Theoretically, we provide\nidentification conditions, derive an influence-function decomposition, and show\nthat repeated cross-fitting of a pivotal statistic yields higher-order\nefficiency. We derive bounds linking estimation error, context count, and\nnumber of cross-fits. Taken together, context augmentation offers the ability\nto connect LLMs with longstanding statistical practice.",
