However, this\nshift introduces new challenges in managing CPU resources efficiently under\nstrict real-time constraints. In particular, the interplay between\nlatency-sensitive RAN workloads and general-purpose Operating System (OS)\nschedulers often leads to sub-optimal performance and unnecessary energy\nconsumption. This work proposes a lightweight, programmable distributed\napplication (dApp) deployed at the Distributed Unit (DU) level to dynamically\norchestrate CPU usage. The dApp operates in closed loop with the OS, leveraging\nthread-level telemetry like context switches, Instructions Per Cycle (IPC), and\ncache metrics, to adapt CPU thread affinity, core isolation, and frequency\nscaling in real time. Unlike existing solutions, it requires no access to\nproprietary RAN software, hardware-specific features, or kernel modifications.\nFully compliant with the O-RAN architecture and agnostic to the underlying RAN\nstack, the proposed solution introduces negligible overhead while improving\nenergy efficiency and CPU utilization. Experimental results using a\ncommercial-grade srsRAN deployment demonstrate consistent power savings without\ncompromising real-time processing performance, highlighting the potential of\nlow-latency dApps for fine-grained resource control in next-generation networks",

This work proposes a lightweight, programmable distributed\napplication (dApp) deployed at the Distributed Unit (DU) level to dynamically\norchestrate CPU usage. The dApp operates in closed loop with the OS, leveraging\nthread-level telemetry like context switches, Instructions Per Cycle (IPC), and\ncache metrics, to adapt CPU thread affinity, core isolation, and frequency\nscaling in real time. Unlike existing solutions, it requires no access to\nproprietary RAN software, hardware-specific features, or kernel modifications.\nFully compliant with the O-RAN architecture and agnostic to the underlying RAN\nstack, the proposed solution introduces negligible overhead while improving\nenergy efficiency and CPU utilization. Experimental results using a\ncommercial-grade srsRAN deployment demonstrate consistent power savings without\ncompromising real-time processing performance, highlighting the potential of\nlow-latency dApps for fine-grained resource control in next-generation networks"

                "summary": "While diffusion and autoregressive (AR) models have significantly advanced\ngenerative modeling, they each present distinct limitations. AR models, which\nrely on causal attention, cannot exploit future context and suffer from slow\ngeneration speeds. Conversely, diffusion models struggle with key-value (KV)\ncaching. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dragon-FM, a novel\ntext-to-speech (TTS) design that unifies AR and flow-matching. This model\nprocesses 48 kHz audio codec tokens in chunks at a compact rate of 12.5 tokens\nper second. This design enables AR modeling across chunks, ensuring global\ncoherence, while parallel flow-matching within chunks facilitates fast\niterative denoising.

                    "value": "While diffusion and autoregressive (AR) models have significantly advanced\ngenerative modeling, they each present distinct limitations. AR models, which\nrely on causal attention, cannot exploit future context and suffer from slow\ngeneration speeds. Conversely, diffusion models struggle with key-value (KV)\ncaching. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dragon-FM, a novel\ntext-to-speech (TTS) design that unifies AR and flow-matching. This model\nprocesses 48 kHz audio codec tokens in chunks at a compact rate of 12.5 tokens\nper second. This design enables AR modeling across chunks, ensuring global\ncoherence, while parallel flow-matching within chunks facilitates fast\niterative denoising. Thus, the model leverages KV-cache across chunks and\nutilizes bidirectional context within each chunk. Furthermore, it bridges\ncontinuous and discrete feature modeling, demonstrating that continuous AR\nflow-matching can predict discrete tokens with finite scalar quantizers.

                "summary": "While frontier large language models (LLMs) continue to push capability\nboundaries, their deployment remains confined to GPU-powered cloud\ninfrastructure. We challenge this paradigm with SmallThinker, a family of LLMs\nnatively designed - not adapted - for the unique constraints of local devices:\nweak computational power, limited memory, and slow storage. Unlike traditional\napproaches that mainly compress existing models built for clouds, we architect\nSmallThinker from the ground up to thrive within these limitations. Our\ninnovation lies in a deployment-aware architecture that transforms constraints\ninto design principles. First, We introduce a two-level sparse structure\ncombining fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse feed-forward\nnetworks, drastically reducing computational demands without sacrificing model\ncapacity. Second, to conquer the I/O bottleneck of slow storage, we design a\npre-attention router that enables our co-designed inference engine to prefetch\nexpert parameters from storage while computing attention, effectively hiding\nstorage latency that would otherwise cripple on-device inference. Third, for\nmemory efficiency, we utilize NoPE-RoPE hybrid sparse attention mechanism to\nslash KV cache requirements. We release SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B and\nSmallThinker-21B-A3B, which achieve state-of-the-art performance scores and\neven outperform larger LLMs. Remarkably, our co-designed system mostly\neliminates the need for expensive GPU hardware: with Q4_0 quantization, both\nmodels exceed 20 tokens/s on ordinary consumer CPUs, while consuming only 1GB\nand 8GB of memory respectively. SmallThinker is publicly available at\nhf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-4BA0.6B-Instruct and\nhf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-21BA3B-Instruct.",

We challenge this paradigm with SmallThinker, a family of LLMs\nnatively designed - not adapted - for the unique constraints of local devices:\nweak computational power, limited memory, and slow storage. Unlike traditional\napproaches that mainly compress existing models built for clouds, we architect\nSmallThinker from the ground up to thrive within these limitations. Our\ninnovation lies in a deployment-aware architecture that transforms constraints\ninto design principles. First, We introduce a two-level sparse structure\ncombining fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse feed-forward\nnetworks, drastically reducing computational demands without sacrificing model\ncapacity. Second, to conquer the I/O bottleneck of slow storage, we design a\npre-attention router that enables our co-designed inference engine to prefetch\nexpert parameters from storage while computing attention, effectively hiding\nstorage latency that would otherwise cripple on-device inference. Third, for\nmemory efficiency, we utilize NoPE-RoPE hybrid sparse attention mechanism to\nslash KV cache requirements. We release SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B and\nSmallThinker-21B-A3B, which achieve state-of-the-art performance scores and\neven outperform larger LLMs. Remarkably, our co-designed system mostly\neliminates the need for expensive GPU hardware: with Q4_0 quantization, both\nmodels exceed 20 tokens/s on ordinary consumer CPUs, while consuming only 1GB\nand 8GB of memory respectively. SmallThinker is publicly available at\nhf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-4BA0.6B-Instruct and\nhf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-21BA3B-Instruct."

This\npaper focuses on enhancing token eviction strategies. Token eviction leverages\nthe observation that the attention patterns are often sparse, allowing for the\nremoval of less critical KV entries to save memory. However, this reduction\nusually comes at the cost of notable accuracy degradation, particularly under\nhigh compression ratios. To address this issue, we propose \\textbf{CaliDrop}, a\nnovel strategy that enhances token eviction through calibration. Our\npreliminary experiments show that queries at nearby positions exhibit high\nsimilarity. Building on this observation, CaliDrop performs speculative\ncalibration on the discarded tokens to mitigate the accuracy loss caused by\ntoken eviction.

Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel\nMulti-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces\nboth KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention\nexpressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed\ninference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers\ninto specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost\nefficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared\nwith models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at\nlonger context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per\ntoken (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that\nhardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are\ncritical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with\nDeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios. Our implementation on Hopper GPUs\nachieves a decoding throughput of up to 4,039 tokens per second per GPU under\n50ms TPOT SLA (4K context, FP8, no MTP). It is higher than DeepSeek-V3's 2,324\nin the same setup and sets a new Pareto frontier for LLM decoding.",

Unlike conventional speaker-tracing buffers, AOSC orders embeddings\nby speaker index corresponding to their arrival time order, and is dynamically\nupdated by selecting frames with the highest scores based on the model's past\npredictions. Notably, the number of stored embeddings per speaker is determined\ndynamically by the update mechanism, ensuring efficient cache utilization and\nprecise speaker tracking. Experiments on benchmark datasets confirm the\neffectiveness and flexibility of our approach, even in low-latency setups.\nThese results establish Streaming Sortformer as a robust solution for real-time\nmulti-speaker tracking and a foundation for streaming multi-talker speech\nprocessing.",

This concerning issue has\nrenewed the efforts in developing protection mechanisms based on adversarial\nattacks, which generate effective perturbations to poison diffusion models.

GATEBLEED poses a risk for local and remote timing inference, even\nunder previous protective measures. GATEBLEED can be used as a high\nperformance, stealthy remote covert channel and a generic magnifier for timing\ntransmission channels, capable of bypassing traditional cache defenses to leak\narbitrary memory addresses and evading state of the art microarchitectural\nattack detectors under realistic network conditions and system configurations\nin which previous attacks fail.

                "summary": "Long-context large language models (LLMs) are able to process inputs\ncontaining up to several million tokens. In the scope of in-context learning\n(ICL), this translates into using hundreds/thousands of demonstrations in the\ninput prompt, enabling many-shot ICL. In practice, a fixed set of\ndemonstrations is often selected at random in many-shot settings due to (1)\nhigh inference costs, (2) the benefits of caching and reusing computations, and\n(3) the similar performance offered by this strategy compared to others when\nscaled. In this work, we propose two straightforward strategies for\ndemonstration selection in many-shot ICL that improve performance with minimal\ncomputational overhead. Our first method combines a small number of\ndemonstrations, selected based on their similarity to each test sample, with a\ndisproportionately larger set of random demonstrations that are cached. The\nsecond strategy improves the first by replacing random demonstrations with\nthose selected using centroids derived from test sample representations via\nk-means clustering.

In the scope of in-context learning\n(ICL), this translates into using hundreds/thousands of demonstrations in the\ninput prompt, enabling many-shot ICL. In practice, a fixed set of\ndemonstrations is often selected at random in many-shot settings due to (1)\nhigh inference costs, (2) the benefits of caching and reusing computations, and\n(3) the similar performance offered by this strategy compared to others when\nscaled. In this work, we propose two straightforward strategies for\ndemonstration selection in many-shot ICL that improve performance with minimal\ncomputational overhead. Our first method combines a small number of\ndemonstrations, selected based on their similarity to each test sample, with a\ndisproportionately larger set of random demonstrations that are cached. The\nsecond strategy improves the first by replacing random demonstrations with\nthose selected using centroids derived from test sample representations via\nk-means clustering.

Transformer-based LLMs face\nsignificant memory and computational bottlenecks as context lengths increase,\ndue to the quadratic complexity of softmax attention and the growing key-value\n(KV) cache. Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic\nattention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while\npreserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are\noften limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating\nmechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent\nstate-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports\nconstant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more\nflexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global\ncontext compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory,\nforming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and\nfine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware\nalgorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive\nexperiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher\nmodel's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while\nsignificantly outperforming previous linearization methods.

                    "value": "We propose Lizard, a linearization framework that transforms pretrained\nTransformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) into flexible, subquadratic\narchitectures for infinite-context generation. Transformer-based LLMs face\nsignificant memory and computational bottlenecks as context lengths increase,\ndue to the quadratic complexity of softmax attention and the growing key-value\n(KV) cache. Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic\nattention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while\npreserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are\noften limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating\nmechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent\nstate-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports\nconstant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more\nflexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global\ncontext compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory,\nforming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and\nfine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware\nalgorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive\nexperiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher\nmodel's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while\nsignificantly outperforming previous linearization methods. On the 5-shot MMLU\nbenchmark, Lizard improves over prior models by 18 points and shows significant\nimprovements on associative recall tasks."

Our results show up to a 9x speedup of image\npre-processing and YOLOv3 fallback layer execution by up to 3x compared to CPU.\nWe demonstrate RVV-1.0 in exposing a flexible programming model that can enable\na balanced computation and memory footprint on accelerator-rich embedded SoCs\nsupporting modern deep-learning dataflows while consuming less power than\ntraditional parallel execution platforms."

                "summary": "Feature caching has emerged as an effective strategy to accelerate diffusion\ntransformer (DiT) sampling through temporal feature reuse. It is a challenging\nproblem since (1) Progressive error accumulation from cached blocks\nsignificantly degrades generation quality, particularly when over 50\\% of\nblocks are cached; (2) Current error compensation approaches neglect dynamic\nperturbation patterns during the caching process, leading to suboptimal error\ncorrection. To solve these problems, we propose the Gradient-Optimized Cache\n(GOC) with two key innovations: (1) Cached Gradient Propagation: A gradient\nqueue dynamically computes the gradient differences between cached and\nrecomputed features. These gradients are weighted and propagated to subsequent\nsteps, directly compensating for the approximation errors introduced by\ncaching. (2) Inflection-Aware Optimization: Through statistical analysis of\nfeature variation patterns, we identify critical inflection points where the\ndenoising trajectory changes direction. By aligning gradient updates with these\ndetected phases, we prevent conflicting gradient directions during error\ncorrection. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet demonstrate GOC's superior\ntrade-off between efficiency and quality. With 50\\% cached blocks, GOC achieves\nIS 216.28 (26.3\\% higher) and FID 3.907 (43\\% lower) compared to baseline DiT,\nwhile maintaining identical computational costs. These improvements persist\nacross various cache ratios, demonstrating robust adaptability to different\nacceleration requirements.

                    "value": "Feature caching has emerged as an effective strategy to accelerate diffusion\ntransformer (DiT) sampling through temporal feature reuse. It is a challenging\nproblem since (1) Progressive error accumulation from cached blocks\nsignificantly degrades generation quality, particularly when over 50\\% of\nblocks are cached; (2) Current error compensation approaches neglect dynamic\nperturbation patterns during the caching process, leading to suboptimal error\ncorrection. To solve these problems, we propose the Gradient-Optimized Cache\n(GOC) with two key innovations: (1) Cached Gradient Propagation: A gradient\nqueue dynamically computes the gradient differences between cached and\nrecomputed features. These gradients are weighted and propagated to subsequent\nsteps, directly compensating for the approximation errors introduced by\ncaching. (2) Inflection-Aware Optimization: Through statistical analysis of\nfeature variation patterns, we identify critical inflection points where the\ndenoising trajectory changes direction. By aligning gradient updates with these\ndetected phases, we prevent conflicting gradient directions during error\ncorrection. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet demonstrate GOC's superior\ntrade-off between efficiency and quality. With 50\\% cached blocks, GOC achieves\nIS 216.28 (26.3\\% higher) and FID 3.907 (43\\% lower) compared to baseline DiT,\nwhile maintaining identical computational costs. These improvements persist\nacross various cache ratios, demonstrating robust adaptability to different\nacceleration requirements.

Recent graph-based ANNS algorithms have\nachieved high search accuracy with practical efficiency.

This paper introduces VSAG, an\nopen-source framework that aims to enhance the in production performance of\ngraph-based ANNS algorithms. VSAG has been deployed at scale in the services of\nAnt Group, and it incorporates three key optimizations: (i) efficient memory\naccess: it reduces L3 cache misses with pre-fetching and cache-friendly vector\norganization; (ii) automated parameter tuning: it automatically selects\nperformance-optimal parameters without requiring index rebuilding; (iii)\nefficient distance computation: it leverages modern hardware, scalar\nquantization, and smartly switches to low-precision representation to\ndramatically reduce the distance computation costs.

However, these models incur significant computational and memory\noverhead during inference, which greatly hinders the efficient deployment in\npractical scenarios. The extensive key-value (KV) cache, necessitated by the\nlengthy input and output sequences, notably contributes to the high inference\ncost.

Caching techniques, which leverage data reuse to reduce\ncomputation, offer opportunities to optimize the performance of LLM inference\nengines. On the one hand, the low-level key-value (KV) cache working at the\ntoken level is widely adopted, albeit it incurs significant overhead as request\nvolume grows. On the other hand, instruction-level caching, which stores full\ninstruction-response pairs, is expected to play an increasingly crucial role.\nHowever, the high variability in the content and length of instructions make it\nrare for identical instructions to recur within a short time window, presenting\nchallenges for effective caching instruction-response pairs. To address this\nchallenge, we propose InstCache, a predictive caching mechanism for LLM serving\nsystems. Leveraging the capability of LLMs, we can effectively reorder the\nrepresentation space of instruction texts and develop a sufficient level of\nspatial locality. Such spatial locality enables us to predict potential\ninstructions located in a compact region in the space, resulting in an\neffective caching system at runtime. Experimental results demonstrate that\nInstCache achieves a 2.3x higher hit rate compared to the upper bound of\ntraditional caching mechanisms on WildChat dataset and reduces the time per\noutput token of vLLM by up to 42.0% and 50.0% on LMSys and Moss datasets,\nrespectively.",

This static\nlength allocation leads to a problematic trade-off: insufficient lengths\ncripple performance on complex tasks, while excessive lengths incur significant\ncomputational overhead and sometimes result in performance degradation. While\nthe inference framework is rigid, we observe that the model itself possesses\ninternal signals that correlate with the optimal response length for a given\ntask. To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce\nDAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive\nLength Expansion for Diffusion Large Language Models.

Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves\nperformance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned\nfixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency\nby achieving a higher effective token ratio.

Robust transfer from simulation to\nreal flight poses a major challenge, as standard simulators often lack\nsufficient visual fidelity. To address this, we construct a photorealistic\nsimulation environment of quadrotor racing tracks, called FalconGym, which\nprovides effectively unlimited synthetic images for training. Within FalconGym,\nwe develop a pipelined approach for crossing gates that combines (i) a Neural\nPose Estimator (NPE) coupled with a Kalman filter to reliably infer quadrotor\nposes from single-frame RGB images and IMU data, and (ii) a\nself-attention-based multi-modal controller that adaptively integrates visual\nfeatures and pose estimation. This multi-modal design compensates for\nperception noise and intermittent gate visibility. We train this controller\npurely in FalconGym with imitation learning and deploy the resulting policy to\nreal hardware with no additional fine-tuning. Simulation experiments on three\ndistinct tracks (circle, U-turn and figure-8) demonstrate that our controller\noutperforms a vision-only state-of-the-art baseline in both success rate and\ngate-crossing accuracy. In 30 live hardware flights spanning three tracks and\n120 gates, our controller achieves a 95.8% success rate and an average error of\njust 10 cm when flying through 38 cm-radius gates.",

                "summary": "For three decades, adaptive optic surveys have revealed an excess of T Tauri\nbinaries across a = 10-100 au in nearby star-forming regions compared to the\nfield population of main-sequence (MS) stars. Such an excess requires that most\nstars are born in dense clusters and subjected to significant dynamical\nprocessing that disrupts such binaries across intermediate separations.\nHowever, we demonstrate that the apparent excess is due to an observational\nselection bias. Close binaries within a < 100 au clear out their dusty\ncircumstellar disks on faster timescales compared to wide binaries and single\nstars. A magnitude-limited sample is therefore biased toward close binaries\nthat have preferentially cleared out their obscuring disks. We re-examine the\nseparation distribution of pre-MS binaries in low-density Taurus, moderately\ndense Upper Scorpius, and the extremely dense Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). By\nlimiting the samples to primary spectral type / mass instead of magnitude, the\nartificial excess across a = 10-100 au disappears in all three environments.\nAcross wider separations a = 100-4,000 au, Taurus exhibits an excess of\ncompanions (mostly tertiaries), the ONC displays a deficit, and Upper Scorpius\nmatches the field MS population.

                    "value": "For three decades, adaptive optic surveys have revealed an excess of T Tauri\nbinaries across a = 10-100 au in nearby star-forming regions compared to the\nfield population of main-sequence (MS) stars. Such an excess requires that most\nstars are born in dense clusters and subjected to significant dynamical\nprocessing that disrupts such binaries across intermediate separations.\nHowever, we demonstrate that the apparent excess is due to an observational\nselection bias. Close binaries within a < 100 au clear out their dusty\ncircumstellar disks on faster timescales compared to wide binaries and single\nstars. A magnitude-limited sample is therefore biased toward close binaries\nthat have preferentially cleared out their obscuring disks. We re-examine the\nseparation distribution of pre-MS binaries in low-density Taurus, moderately\ndense Upper Scorpius, and the extremely dense Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). By\nlimiting the samples to primary spectral type / mass instead of magnitude, the\nartificial excess across a = 10-100 au disappears in all three environments.\nAcross wider separations a = 100-4,000 au, Taurus exhibits an excess of\ncompanions (mostly tertiaries), the ONC displays a deficit, and Upper Scorpius\nmatches the field MS population. The field derives from an amalgam of all three\nenvironments, where Upper Scorpius corresponds to the average birth environment\nof solar-type stars. The total binary fraction within a < 10,000 au in Taurus\nis only 52% +/- 7%, substantially lower than the 100% inferred from the biased\nobservations and only slightly higher than the field MS value of 45%.

However,\ncultural value misalignments may exist in generated texts, such as the\nmisrepresentation of historical facts, the erosion of cultural identity, and\nthe oversimplification of complex cultural narratives, which may lead to severe\nconsequences. Therefore, investigating value misalignment in the context of LLM\nfor cultural heritage is crucial for mitigating these risks, yet there has been\na significant lack of systematic and comprehensive study and investigation in\nthis area. To fill this gap, we systematically assess the reliability of LLMs\nin generating culturally aligned texts for cultural heritage-related tasks. We\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation by compiling an extensive set of 1066 query\ntasks covering 5 widely recognized categories with 17 aspects within the\nknowledge framework of cultural heritage across 5 open-source LLMs, and examine\nboth the type and rate of cultural value misalignments in the generated texts.\nUsing both automated and manual approaches, we effectively detect and analyze\nthe cultural value misalignments in LLM-generated texts. Our findings are\nconcerning: over 65% of the generated texts exhibit notable cultural\nmisalignments, with certain tasks demonstrating almost complete misalignment\nwith key cultural values. Beyond these findings, this paper introduces a\nbenchmark dataset and a comprehensive evaluation workflow that can serve as a\nvaluable resource for future research aimed at enhancing the cultural\nsensitivity and reliability of LLMs.",

We\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation by compiling an extensive set of 1066 query\ntasks covering 5 widely recognized categories with 17 aspects within the\nknowledge framework of cultural heritage across 5 open-source LLMs, and examine\nboth the type and rate of cultural value misalignments in the generated texts.\nUsing both automated and manual approaches, we effectively detect and analyze\nthe cultural value misalignments in LLM-generated texts. Our findings are\nconcerning: over 65% of the generated texts exhibit notable cultural\nmisalignments, with certain tasks demonstrating almost complete misalignment\nwith key cultural values. Beyond these findings, this paper introduces a\nbenchmark dataset and a comprehensive evaluation workflow that can serve as a\nvaluable resource for future research aimed at enhancing the cultural\nsensitivity and reliability of LLMs."

However,\ntraditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for radiology question\nanswering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability\nto handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose an agentic RAG\nframework enabling LLMs to autonomously decompose radiology questions,\niteratively retrieve targeted clinical evidence from Radiopaedia, and\ndynamically synthesize evidence-based responses. We evaluated 24 LLMs spanning\ndiverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms\n(general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104\nexpert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and\nExtendedQA datasets. Agentic retrieval significantly improved mean diagnostic\naccuracy over zero-shot prompting (73% vs. 64%; P<0.001) and conventional\nonline RAG (73% vs. 68%; P<0.001).

AudioGen-Omni introduces a\nnovel joint training paradigm that seamlessly integrates large-scale\nvideo-text-audio corpora, enabling a model capable of generating semantically\nrich, acoustically diverse audio conditioned on multimodal inputs and adaptable\nto a wide range of audio generation tasks. AudioGen-Omni employs a unified\nlyrics-transcription encoder that encodes graphemes and phonemes from both sung\nand spoken inputs into dense frame-level representations. Dense frame-level\nrepresentations are fused using an AdaLN-based joint attention mechanism\nenhanced with phase-aligned anisotropic positional infusion (PAAPI), wherein\nRoPE is selectively applied to temporally structured modalities to ensure\nprecise and robust cross-modal alignment. By unfreezing all modalities and\nmasking missing inputs, AudioGen-Omni mitigates the semantic constraints of\ntext-frozen paradigms, enabling effective cross-modal conditioning. This joint\ntraining approach enhances audio quality, semantic alignment, and lip-sync\naccuracy, while also achieving state-of-the-art results on\nText-to-Audio/Speech/Song tasks.

However, the former suffers from limited\nadaptability due to static path extraction and lack of contextual refinement,\nwhile the latter incurs high computational costs and struggles with accurate\npath evaluation due to reliance on fixed scoring functions and extensive LLM\ncalls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive\nMCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates symbolic search\nwith adaptive path evaluation for efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR\nemploys a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) backbone guided by an LLM-based\nplanner, which selects top-$k$ relevant relations at each step to reduce search\nspace. To improve path evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight\nTransformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by\njointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention,\nenabling the model to capture fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop\nreasoning. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality supervision,\nDAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically\ngenerates training signals from partial paths explored during search, allowing\nthe scorer to continuously adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning\ntrajectories.

The dependence is the strongest in the ICG luminosity range of\n$10^{10.3}<L_\\mathrm{c}[h^{-2}L_\\odot]\\leq 10^{10.7}$, where halos with smaller\ngaps have higher masses and lower concentrations.

Granger\ncausality is one of the well-known techniques for inferring causality in time\nseries. Typically, Granger causality frameworks have a strong fix-lag\nassumption between cause and effect, which is often unrealistic in complex\nsystems. While recent work on variable-lag Granger causality (VLGC) addresses\nthis limitation by allowing a cause to influence an effect with different time\nlags at each time point, it fails to account for the fact that causal\ninteractions may vary not only in time delay but also across frequency bands.\nFor example, in brain signals, alpha-band activity may influence another region\nwith a shorter delay than slower delta-band oscillations. In this work, we\nformalize Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality (MB-VLGC) and propose a\nnovel framework that generalizes traditional VLGC by explicitly modeling\nfrequency-dependent causal delays. We provide a formal definition of MB-VLGC,\ndemonstrate its theoretical soundness, and propose an efficient inference\npipeline. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that our\nframework significantly outperforms existing methods on both synthetic and\nreal-world datasets, confirming its broad applicability to any type of time\nseries data. Code and datasets are publicly available.",

With the\ngrowing use of Large Language Models (LLM) as AI modeling assistants, more\nautomation will be involved in generating diagrams.

Such a tool can be\nused to evaluate both manually and AI automatically generated models; to\nprovide feedback to system engineers, and enable AI assistants to self-evaluate\nand self-enhance their generated models.\n  In this paper, we propose MCeT, the first fully automated tool to evaluate\nthe correctness of a behavioral model, sequence diagrams in particular, against\nits corresponding requirements text and produce a list of issues that the model\nhas.

Also, we introduce the first real-world multimodal\nbenchmark dataset, RATs40K, explicitly annotated for anomaly reasoning,\ncomprising approximately 40,000 samples across 10 real-world domains. Each\nsample includes numeric time series data, contextual text information, and\nvisual representations, each annotated with fine-grained categories (14 types\nfor univariate anomalies and 6 for multivariate anomalies) and structured\nexplanatory reasoning. We develop a sophisticated annotation framework\nutilizing ensemble-generated labels refined through GPT-4-driven feedback,\nensuring accuracy and interpretability. Extensive benchmarking of LLMs and\nmultimodal LLMs demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of current\nmodels, highlighting the critical role of supervised fine-tuning.

Experimental results performed on public datasets, MMLongBench-Doc\nand LongDocURL, demonstrated the superiority of our MMRAG-DocQA method in\nunderstanding and answering modality-rich and multi-page documents."

With the development of deep learning\ntechnologies, adopting pre-trained models for this task has become mainstream.\nConsidering the retrieval efficiency, most of the previous approaches adopt a\ndual-encoder for this task, which encodes the description and code snippet into\nrepresentation vectors, respectively. However, the model structure of the\ndual-encoder tends to limit the model's performance, since it lacks the\ninteraction between the code snippet and description at the bottom layer of the\nmodel during training.

To unleash the\nenormous potential of textual modality, large language models (LLMs) have\nemerged as promising alternatives due to their strong semantic understanding\nand reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, their application to TAG anomaly\ndetection remains nascent, and they struggle to encode high-order structural\ninformation inherent in graphs due to input length constraints. For\nhigh-quality anomaly detection in TAGs, we propose CoLL, a novel framework that\ncombines LLMs and graph neural networks (GNNs) to leverage their complementary\nstrengths. CoLL employs multi-LLM collaboration for evidence-augmented\ngeneration to capture anomaly-relevant contexts while delivering human-readable\nrationales for detected anomalies. Moreover, CoLL integrates a GNN equipped\nwith a gating mechanism to adaptively fuse textual features with evidence while\npreserving high-order topological information.

However, many real-world claims are half-truths, factually correct yet\nmisleading due to the omission of critical context. Existing models struggle\nwith such cases, as they are not designed to reason about what is left unsaid.\nWe introduce the task of half-truth detection, and propose PolitiFact-Hidden, a\nnew benchmark with 15k political claims annotated with sentence-level evidence\nalignment and inferred claim intent. To address this challenge, we present\nTRACER, a modular re-assessment framework that identifies omission-based\nmisinformation by aligning evidence, inferring implied intent, and estimating\nthe causal impact of hidden content. TRACER can be integrated into existing\nfact-checking pipelines and consistently improves performance across multiple\nstrong baselines. Notably, it boosts Half-True classification F1 by up to 16\npoints, highlighting the importance of modeling omissions for trustworthy fact\nverification.",

                    "value": "Fact verification systems typically assess whether a claim is supported by\nretrieved evidence, assuming that truthfulness depends solely on what is\nstated. However, many real-world claims are half-truths, factually correct yet\nmisleading due to the omission of critical context. Existing models struggle\nwith such cases, as they are not designed to reason about what is left unsaid.\nWe introduce the task of half-truth detection, and propose PolitiFact-Hidden, a\nnew benchmark with 15k political claims annotated with sentence-level evidence\nalignment and inferred claim intent. To address this challenge, we present\nTRACER, a modular re-assessment framework that identifies omission-based\nmisinformation by aligning evidence, inferring implied intent, and estimating\nthe causal impact of hidden content. TRACER can be integrated into existing\nfact-checking pipelines and consistently improves performance across multiple\nstrong baselines. Notably, it boosts Half-True classification F1 by up to 16\npoints, highlighting the importance of modeling omissions for trustworthy fact\nverification."

As LLMs are\nincreasingly deployed in open-ended, interactive environments, this static\nnature has become a critical bottleneck, necessitating agents that can\nadaptively reason, act, and evolve in real time. This paradigm shift -- from\nscaling static models to developing self-evolving agents -- has sparked growing\ninterest in architectures and methods enabling continual learning and\nadaptation from data, interactions, and experiences. This survey provides the\nfirst systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized\naround three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how\nto evolve. We examine evolutionary mechanisms across agent components (e.g.,\nmodels, memory, tools, architecture), categorize adaptation methods by stages\n(e.g., intra-test-time, inter-test-time), and analyze the algorithmic and\narchitectural designs that guide evolutionary adaptation (e.g., scalar rewards,\ntextual feedback, single-agent and multi-agent systems). Additionally, we\nanalyze evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored for self-evolving agents,\nhighlight applications in domains such as coding, education, and healthcare,\nand identify critical challenges and research directions in safety,\nscalability, and co-evolutionary dynamics. By providing a structured framework\nfor understanding and designing self-evolving agents, this survey establishes a\nroadmap for advancing adaptive agentic systems in both research and real-world\ndeployments, ultimately shedding lights to pave the way for the realization of\nArtificial Super Intelligence (ASI), where agents evolve autonomously,\nperforming at or beyond human-level intelligence across a wide array of tasks.",

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities but remain\nfundamentally static, unable to adapt their internal parameters to novel tasks,\nevolving knowledge domains, or dynamic interaction contexts. As LLMs are\nincreasingly deployed in open-ended, interactive environments, this static\nnature has become a critical bottleneck, necessitating agents that can\nadaptively reason, act, and evolve in real time. This paradigm shift -- from\nscaling static models to developing self-evolving agents -- has sparked growing\ninterest in architectures and methods enabling continual learning and\nadaptation from data, interactions, and experiences. This survey provides the\nfirst systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized\naround three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how\nto evolve. We examine evolutionary mechanisms across agent components (e.g.,\nmodels, memory, tools, architecture), categorize adaptation methods by stages\n(e.g., intra-test-time, inter-test-time), and analyze the algorithmic and\narchitectural designs that guide evolutionary adaptation (e.g., scalar rewards,\ntextual feedback, single-agent and multi-agent systems). Additionally, we\nanalyze evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored for self-evolving agents,\nhighlight applications in domains such as coding, education, and healthcare,\nand identify critical challenges and research directions in safety,\nscalability, and co-evolutionary dynamics. By providing a structured framework\nfor understanding and designing self-evolving agents, this survey establishes a\nroadmap for advancing adaptive agentic systems in both research and real-world\ndeployments, ultimately shedding lights to pave the way for the realization of\nArtificial Super Intelligence (ASI), where agents evolve autonomously,\nperforming at or beyond human-level intelligence across a wide array of tasks."

We present SynPAIN, a\nlarge-scale synthetic dataset containing 10,710 facial expression images (5,355\nneutral/expressive pairs) across five ethnicities/races, two age groups (young:\n20-35, old: 75+), and two genders. Using commercial generative AI tools, we\ncreated demographically balanced synthetic identities with clinically\nmeaningful pain expressions. Our validation demonstrates that synthetic pain\nexpressions exhibit expected pain patterns, scoring significantly higher than\nneutral and non-pain expressions using clinically validated pain assessment\ntools based on facial action unit analysis. We experimentally demonstrate\nSynPAIN's utility in identifying algorithmic bias in existing pain detection\nmodels. Through comprehensive bias evaluation, we reveal substantial\nperformance disparities across demographic characteristics. These performance\ndisparities were previously undetectable with smaller, less diverse datasets.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that age-matched synthetic data augmentation\nimproves pain detection performance on real clinical data, achieving a 7.0%\nimprovement in average precision. SynPAIN addresses critical gaps in pain\nassessment research by providing the first publicly available, demographically\ndiverse synthetic dataset specifically designed for older adult pain detection,\nwhile establishing a framework for measuring and mitigating algorithmic bias.\nThe dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5683/SP3/WCXMAP",

                    "value": "Accurate pain assessment in patients with limited ability to communicate,\nsuch as older adults with dementia, represents a critical healthcare challenge.\nRobust automated systems of pain detection may facilitate such assessments.\nExisting pain detection datasets, however, suffer from limited ethnic/racial\ndiversity, privacy constraints, and underrepresentation of older adults who are\nthe primary target population for clinical deployment. We present SynPAIN, a\nlarge-scale synthetic dataset containing 10,710 facial expression images (5,355\nneutral/expressive pairs) across five ethnicities/races, two age groups (young:\n20-35, old: 75+), and two genders. Using commercial generative AI tools, we\ncreated demographically balanced synthetic identities with clinically\nmeaningful pain expressions. Our validation demonstrates that synthetic pain\nexpressions exhibit expected pain patterns, scoring significantly higher than\nneutral and non-pain expressions using clinically validated pain assessment\ntools based on facial action unit analysis. We experimentally demonstrate\nSynPAIN's utility in identifying algorithmic bias in existing pain detection\nmodels. Through comprehensive bias evaluation, we reveal substantial\nperformance disparities across demographic characteristics. These performance\ndisparities were previously undetectable with smaller, less diverse datasets.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that age-matched synthetic data augmentation\nimproves pain detection performance on real clinical data, achieving a 7.0%\nimprovement in average precision. SynPAIN addresses critical gaps in pain\nassessment research by providing the first publicly available, demographically\ndiverse synthetic dataset specifically designed for older adult pain detection,\nwhile establishing a framework for measuring and mitigating algorithmic bias.\nThe dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5683/SP3/WCXMAP"

While quantum machine learning offers a\npromising route to efficiently capture physical properties from\nhigh-dimensional data, its practical deployment is hindered by current hardware\nnoise and limited scalability. Here, we introduce a quantum-informed machine\nlearning framework for learning partial differential equations, with an\napplication focus on chaotic systems. A quantum circuit Born machine is\nemployed to learn the invariant properties of chaotic dynamical systems,\nachieving substantial memory efficiency by representing these complex physical\nstatistics with a compact set of trainable circuit parameters. This approach\nreduces the data storage requirement by over two orders of magnitude compared\nto the raw simulation data. The resulting statistical quantum-informed prior is\nthen incorporated into a Koopman-based auto-regressive model to address issues\nsuch as gradient vanishing or explosion, while maintaining long-term\nstatistical fidelity. The framework is evaluated on three representative\nsystems: the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow and\nturbulent channel flow. In all cases, the quantum-informed model achieves\nsuperior performance compared to its classical counterparts without quantum\npriors. This hybrid architecture offers a practical route for learning\ndynamical systems using near-term quantum hardware.",

This paper presents a novel Edge AI framework for autonomous\nnetwork optimisation in Open RAN environments, addressing these challenges\nthrough three core innovations: (1) a persona-based multi-tools architecture\nenabling distributed, context-aware decision-making; (2) proactive anomaly\ndetection agent powered by traffic predictive tool; and (3) a safety, aligned\nreward mechanism that balances performance with operational stability.\nIntegrated into the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), our framework leverages\nmultimodal data fusion, including network KPIs, a traffic prediction model, and\nexternal information sources, to anticipate and respond to dynamic network\nconditions. Extensive evaluation using realistic 5G scenarios demonstrates that\nthe edge framework achieves zero network outages under high-stress conditions,\ncompared to 8.4% for traditional fixed-power networks and 3.3% for large\nlanguage model (LLM) agent-based approaches, while maintaining near real-time\nresponsiveness and consistent QoS. These results establish that, when equipped\nwith the right tools and contextual awareness, AI agents can be safely and\neffectively deployed in critical network infrastructure, laying the framework\nfor intelligent and autonomous 5G and beyond network operations.",

                "summary": "The transition toward softwarized Radio Access Networks (RANs), driven by the\nOpen RAN (O-RAN) paradigm, enables flexible, vendor-neutral deployments through\ndisaggregation and virtualization of base station functions. However, this\nshift introduces new challenges in managing CPU resources efficiently under\nstrict real-time constraints. In particular, the interplay between\nlatency-sensitive RAN workloads and general-purpose Operating System (OS)\nschedulers often leads to sub-optimal performance and unnecessary energy\nconsumption. This work proposes a lightweight, programmable distributed\napplication (dApp) deployed at the Distributed Unit (DU) level to dynamically\norchestrate CPU usage. The dApp operates in closed loop with the OS, leveraging\nthread-level telemetry like context switches, Instructions Per Cycle (IPC), and\ncache metrics, to adapt CPU thread affinity, core isolation, and frequency\nscaling in real time. Unlike existing solutions, it requires no access to\nproprietary RAN software, hardware-specific features, or kernel modifications.\nFully compliant with the O-RAN architecture and agnostic to the underlying RAN\nstack, the proposed solution introduces negligible overhead while improving\nenergy efficiency and CPU utilization. Experimental results using a\ncommercial-grade srsRAN deployment demonstrate consistent power savings without\ncompromising real-time processing performance, highlighting the potential of\nlow-latency dApps for fine-grained resource control in next-generation networks",

                    "value": "The transition toward softwarized Radio Access Networks (RANs), driven by the\nOpen RAN (O-RAN) paradigm, enables flexible, vendor-neutral deployments through\ndisaggregation and virtualization of base station functions. However, this\nshift introduces new challenges in managing CPU resources efficiently under\nstrict real-time constraints. In particular, the interplay between\nlatency-sensitive RAN workloads and general-purpose Operating System (OS)\nschedulers often leads to sub-optimal performance and unnecessary energy\nconsumption. This work proposes a lightweight, programmable distributed\napplication (dApp) deployed at the Distributed Unit (DU) level to dynamically\norchestrate CPU usage. The dApp operates in closed loop with the OS, leveraging\nthread-level telemetry like context switches, Instructions Per Cycle (IPC), and\ncache metrics, to adapt CPU thread affinity, core isolation, and frequency\nscaling in real time. Unlike existing solutions, it requires no access to\nproprietary RAN software, hardware-specific features, or kernel modifications.\nFully compliant with the O-RAN architecture and agnostic to the underlying RAN\nstack, the proposed solution introduces negligible overhead while improving\nenergy efficiency and CPU utilization. Experimental results using a\ncommercial-grade srsRAN deployment demonstrate consistent power savings without\ncompromising real-time processing performance, highlighting the potential of\nlow-latency dApps for fine-grained resource control in next-generation networks"

Also, we introduce the first real-world multimodal\nbenchmark dataset, RATs40K, explicitly annotated for anomaly reasoning,\ncomprising approximately 40,000 samples across 10 real-world domains. Each\nsample includes numeric time series data, contextual text information, and\nvisual representations, each annotated with fine-grained categories (14 types\nfor univariate anomalies and 6 for multivariate anomalies) and structured\nexplanatory reasoning. We develop a sophisticated annotation framework\nutilizing ensemble-generated labels refined through GPT-4-driven feedback,\nensuring accuracy and interpretability. Extensive benchmarking of LLMs and\nmultimodal LLMs demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of current\nmodels, highlighting the critical role of supervised fine-tuning.

However, their \"black-box\" nature poses a major barrier to deployment\nin high-stakes applications where interpretability and trustworthiness are\nessential. How to explain cross-modal interactions in multimodal AI models\nremains a major challenge. While existing model explanation methods, such as\nattention map and Grad-CAM, offer coarse insights into cross-modal\nrelationships, they cannot precisely quantify the synergistic effects between\nmodalities, and are limited to open-source models with accessible internal\nweights. Here we introduce MultiSHAP, a model-agnostic interpretability\nframework that leverages the Shapley Interaction Index to attribute multimodal\npredictions to pairwise interactions between fine-grained visual and textual\nelements (such as image patches and text tokens), while being applicable to\nboth open- and closed-source models. Our approach provides: (1) instance-level\nexplanations that reveal synergistic and suppressive cross-modal effects for\nindividual samples - \"why the model makes a specific prediction on this input\",\nand (2) dataset-level explanation that uncovers generalizable interaction\npatterns across samples - \"how the model integrates information across\nmodalities\". Experiments on public multimodal benchmarks confirm that MultiSHAP\nfaithfully captures cross-modal reasoning mechanisms, while real-world case\nstudies demonstrate its practical utility. Our framework is extensible beyond\ntwo modalities, offering a general solution for interpreting complex multimodal\nAI models.",

However, their \"black-box\" nature poses a major barrier to deployment\nin high-stakes applications where interpretability and trustworthiness are\nessential. How to explain cross-modal interactions in multimodal AI models\nremains a major challenge. While existing model explanation methods, such as\nattention map and Grad-CAM, offer coarse insights into cross-modal\nrelationships, they cannot precisely quantify the synergistic effects between\nmodalities, and are limited to open-source models with accessible internal\nweights. Here we introduce MultiSHAP, a model-agnostic interpretability\nframework that leverages the Shapley Interaction Index to attribute multimodal\npredictions to pairwise interactions between fine-grained visual and textual\nelements (such as image patches and text tokens), while being applicable to\nboth open- and closed-source models. Our approach provides: (1) instance-level\nexplanations that reveal synergistic and suppressive cross-modal effects for\nindividual samples - \"why the model makes a specific prediction on this input\",\nand (2) dataset-level explanation that uncovers generalizable interaction\npatterns across samples - \"how the model integrates information across\nmodalities\". Experiments on public multimodal benchmarks confirm that MultiSHAP\nfaithfully captures cross-modal reasoning mechanisms, while real-world case\nstudies demonstrate its practical utility. Our framework is extensible beyond\ntwo modalities, offering a general solution for interpreting complex multimodal\nAI models."

To effectively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in this domain, it\nis crucial to have a well-designed benchmark that accurately reflects\nreal-world scenarios and mitigates common pitfalls. Existing LLM test\ngeneration benchmarks are limited by two critical drawbacks: data contamination\nand structurally simple function code. As a result, we often cannot rely on the\nvalidity of scientific conclusions drawn from empirical studies using these\nlimited benchmarks. The empirical evidence presented may be biased due to\ncontamination and may fail to generalize beyond toy programs due to structural\nsimplicity.\n  To address these problems, we introduce ULT (UnLeakedTestbench), a new\nbenchmark specifically designed for function-level unit test generation from\nreal-world Python functions. ULT is constructed through a multi-stage curation\nprocess that ensures high cyclomatic complexity and mitigates test case\ncontamination. With 3,909 carefully selected function-level tasks, ULT provides\na more realistic and challenging evaluation of LLMs' test generation\ncapabilities. We also provide PLT (PreLeakedTestbench), a pair benchmark of ULT\nwith leaked tests designed to enable a controlled analysis of memorization\nversus reasoning in test generation. Our evaluation results demonstrate that\nULT is significantly more challenging. For example, test cases generated by\nLLMs only achieve 41.32\\%, 45.10\\%, 30.22\\%, and 40.21\\% for accuracy,\nstatement coverage, branch coverage, and mutation score on average for all\nLLMs, respectively. These results are substantially lower than the\ncorresponding metrics on TestEval (91.79\\%, 92.18\\%, 82.04\\%, and 49.69\\%) and\nPLT (47.07\\%, 55.13\\%, 40.07\\%, and 50.80\\%).",

However,\nexisting work predominantly assumes the effectiveness of the demonstrations\nprovided within ICL, while many research indicates that not all demonstrations\nare effective, failing to yielding any performance improvement during ICL.\nTherefore, in this paper, we investigate the reasons behind demonstration\nineffectiveness. Our analysis is based on gradient flow and linear\nself-attention models.

Specifically, we propose Sensor-Aware\nAttributes Fine-Tuning (SAFT) with the Diverse Negative Attributes (DNA)\noptimization, which leverages minimal sensor-specific data to enable robust\nlearning of non-RGB characteristics and overcome RGB-centric biases inherent in\ncurrent VLMs. In addition, we present VS-TDX-the first comprehensive, public\nbenchmark designed to rigorously evaluate VLMs' sensor-specific understanding\nacross diverse and realistic scenarios. Through extensive experiments on VLMs\nand various sensor modalities, we validate that our method consistently\ndelivers superior performance and generalization under resource-constrained and\narchitecture-invariant settings. Our approach provides a practical advance\ntowards scalable deployment of VLMs in increasingly sensor-diverse real-world\nenvironments.",

However, their ability to deeply understand\nthe unique physical properties of non-RGB vision sensor images remains limited.\nIn this paper, we revisit and analyze these limitations and introduce a novel,\ncost-efficient paradigm that significantly advances sensor image\nunderstanding-without requiring extensive training data or any modifications to\nthe existing VLM architectures. Specifically, we propose Sensor-Aware\nAttributes Fine-Tuning (SAFT) with the Diverse Negative Attributes (DNA)\noptimization, which leverages minimal sensor-specific data to enable robust\nlearning of non-RGB characteristics and overcome RGB-centric biases inherent in\ncurrent VLMs. In addition, we present VS-TDX-the first comprehensive, public\nbenchmark designed to rigorously evaluate VLMs' sensor-specific understanding\nacross diverse and realistic scenarios. Through extensive experiments on VLMs\nand various sensor modalities, we validate that our method consistently\ndelivers superior performance and generalization under resource-constrained and\narchitecture-invariant settings. Our approach provides a practical advance\ntowards scalable deployment of VLMs in increasingly sensor-diverse real-world\nenvironments."

To investigate whether LLMs embody this characteristic, we\ndevelop a benchmark designed to challenge these models to enumerate all\ninformation they possess on specific topics. This benchmark evaluates whether\nthe models recall excessive, insufficient, or the precise amount of\ninformation, thereby indicating their awareness of their own knowledge. Our\nfindings reveal that all tested LLMs, given sufficient scale, demonstrate an\nunderstanding of how much they know about specific topics. While different\narchitectures exhibit varying rates of this capability's emergence, the results\nsuggest that awareness of knowledge may be a generalizable attribute of LLMs.\nFurther research is needed to confirm this potential and fully elucidate the\nunderlying mechanisms.",
