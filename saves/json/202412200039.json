Extensive experimental evidence\nindicates that our model markedly improves recall metrics and displays\nremarkable scalability of recommendation systems."

However, most studies focus on addressing only one of these\nbottlenecks and do not adequately support dynamic adjustment of sparsity\nconcerning distinct layers or tasks. In this paper, we present ZipVL, an\nefficient inference framework designed for LVLMs through a dynamic ratio\nallocation strategy of important tokens. This ratio is adaptively determined\nbased on the layer-specific distribution of attention scores, rather than fixed\nhyper-parameters, thereby improving efficiency for less complex tasks while\nmaintaining high performance for more challenging ones. Then we select\nimportant tokens based on their normalized attention scores and perform sparse\nattention mechanism solely on those important tokens, reducing the latency in\nthe prefill phase. Tokens deemed less important will be discarded to reduce KV\ncache size, alleviating the memory bottleneck in the decoding phase. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that ZipVL can accelerate the prefill phase by\n2.3$\\times$ and improve decoding throughput by 2.8$\\times$, with a minimal\naccuracy reduction of only 0.5\\% on VQAv2 benchmark over LLaVA-Next-13B model,\neffectively enhancing the generation efficiency of LVLMs.",

To address these issues, we develop Vivar, a\nnovel AR system that integrates multi-modal sensor data and presents 3D\nvolumetric content for visualization. In particular, we introduce a cross-modal\nembedding approach that maps sensor data into a pre-trained visual embedding\nspace through barycentric interpolation. This allows for accurate and\ncontinuous integration of multi-modal sensor information. Vivar also\nincorporates sensor-aware AR scene generation using foundation models and 3D\nGaussian Splatting (3DGS) without requiring domain expertise. In addition,\nVivar leverages latent reuse and caching strategies to accelerate 2D and AR\ncontent generation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our system\nachieves 11$\\times$ latency reduction without compromising quality.

Existing\nacceleration methods include distillation, which requires costly retraining,\nand feature caching, which is highly sensitive to network architecture. Recent\ntoken reduction methods are training-free and architecture-agnostic, offering\ngreater flexibility and wider applicability. However, they enforce the same\nsequence length across different components, constraining their acceleration\npotential. We observe that intra-sequence redundancy in video DiTs varies\nacross features, blocks, and denoising timesteps.

                    "value": "Video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated significant potential\nfor generating high-fidelity videos but are computationally intensive. Existing\nacceleration methods include distillation, which requires costly retraining,\nand feature caching, which is highly sensitive to network architecture. Recent\ntoken reduction methods are training-free and architecture-agnostic, offering\ngreater flexibility and wider applicability. However, they enforce the same\nsequence length across different components, constraining their acceleration\npotential. We observe that intra-sequence redundancy in video DiTs varies\nacross features, blocks, and denoising timesteps.

With this\nFedNL outperforms alternatives for training logistic regression in a\nsingle-node -- CVXPY (arXiv:1603.00943), and in a multi-node -- Apache Spark\n(arXiv:1505.06807), Ray/Scikit-Learn (arXiv:1712.05889). Finally, we propose\ntwo practical-orientated compressors for FedNL - adaptive TopLEK and\ncache-aware RandSeqK, which fulfill the theory of FedNL."

To\naddress these questions, we introduce NeuSight, a framework to predict the\nperformance of various deep learning models, for both training and inference,\non unseen GPUs without requiring actual execution. The framework leverages both\nGPU hardware behavior and software library optimizations to estimate end-to-end\nperformance. Previous work uses regression models that capture linear trends or\nmultilayer perceptrons to predict the overall latency of deep learning kernels\non GPUs. These approaches suffer from higher error percentages when forecasting\nperformance on unseen models and new GPUs.

NeuSight decomposes a single deep learning kernel\nprediction into smaller working sets called tiles, which are executed\nindependently on the GPU. Tile-granularity predictions are determined using a\nmachine learning approach and aggregated to estimate end-to-end latency.\nNeuSight outperforms prior work across various deep learning workloads and the\nlatest GPUs.

                "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the demand for higher\nquality and faster processing of long contexts across various applications is\ngrowing. KV cache is widely adopted as it stores previously generated key and\nvalue tokens, effectively reducing redundant computations during inference.\nHowever, as memory overhead becomes a significant concern, efficient\ncompression of KV cache has gained increasing attention. Most existing methods\nperform compression from two perspectives: identifying important tokens and\ndesigning compression strategies. However, these approaches often produce\nbiased distributions of important tokens due to the influence of accumulated\nattention scores or positional encoding. Furthermore, they overlook the\nsparsity and redundancy across different heads, which leads to difficulties in\npreserving the most effective information at the head level. To this end, we\npropose EMS to overcome these limitations, while achieving better KV cache\ncompression under extreme compression ratios. Specifically, we introduce a\nGlobal-Local score that combines accumulated attention scores from both global\nand local KV tokens to better identify the token importance. For the\ncompression strategy, we design an adaptive and unified Evict-then-Merge\nframework that accounts for the sparsity and redundancy of KV tokens across\ndifferent heads. Additionally, we implement the head-wise parallel compression\nthrough a zero-class mechanism to enhance efficiency. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate our SOTA performance even under extreme compression ratios. EMS\nconsistently achieves the lowest perplexity, improves scores by over 1.28\npoints across four LLMs on LongBench under a 256 cache budget, and preserves\n95% retrieval accuracy with a cache budget less than 2% of the context length\nin the Needle-in-a-Haystack task.",

Notably, the MLLMs are constrained\nby their limited context lengths and the substantial costs while processing\nlong videos. Although several existing methods attempt to reduce visual tokens,\ntheir strategies encounter severe bottleneck, restricting MLLMs' ability to\nperceive fine-grained visual details. In this work, we propose Video-XL, a\nnovel approach that leverages MLLMs' inherent key-value (KV) sparsification\ncapacity to condense the visual input. Specifically, we introduce a new special\ntoken, the Visual Summarization Token (VST), for each interval of the video,\nwhich summarizes the visual information within the interval as its associated\nKV. The VST module is trained by instruction fine-tuning, where two optimizing\nstrategies are offered. 1.Curriculum learning, where VST learns to make small\n(easy) and large compression (hard) progressively. 2. Composite data curation,\nwhich integrates single-image, multi-image, and synthetic data to overcome the\nscarcity of long-video instruction data. The compression quality is further\nimproved by dynamic compression, which customizes compression granularity based\non the information density of different video intervals. Video-XL's\neffectiveness is verified from three aspects. First, it achieves a superior\nlong-video understanding capability, outperforming state-of-the-art models of\ncomparable sizes across multiple popular benchmarks. Second, it effectively\npreserves video information, with minimal compression loss even at 16x\ncompression ratio. Third, it realizes outstanding cost-effectiveness, enabling\nhigh-quality processing of thousands of frames on a single A100 GPU.",

Its cache entry identifies\na unique one-hop sub-query (key) and its result set consisting of immutable\nvertex ids (value). When processing a gR-Tx, the query processor identifies its\nsequence of individual one-hop sub-queries and looks up their results in the\ncache. A cache hit fetches less data from the storage manager and eliminates\nthe requirement to process the one-hop sub-query. A cache miss populates the\ncache asynchronously and in a transactional manner, maintaining the separation\nof read and write paths of our transactional storage manager. A graph read and\nwrite transaction, gRW-Tx, identifies the impacted cache entries and either\ndeletes or updates them.

                "summary": "LLM inference for popular enterprise use cases, such as summarization, RAG,\nand code-generation, typically observes orders of magnitude longer prompt\nlengths than generation lengths. This characteristic leads to high cost of\nprefill and increased response latency. In this paper, we present SwiftKV, a\nnovel model transformation and distillation procedure specifically designed to\nreduce the time and cost of processing prompt tokens while preserving high\nquality of generated tokens. SwiftKV combines three key mechanisms: i)\nSingleInputKV, which prefills later layers' KV cache using a much earlier\nlayer's output, allowing prompt tokens to skip much of the model computation,\nii) AcrossKV, which merges the KV caches of neighboring layers to reduce the\nmemory footprint and support larger batch size for higher throughput, and iii)\na knowledge-preserving distillation procedure that can adapt existing LLMs for\nSwiftKV with minimal accuracy impact and low compute and data requirement. For\nLlama-3.1-8B and 70B, SwiftKV reduces the compute requirement of prefill by 50%\nand the memory requirement of the KV cache by 62.5% while incurring minimum\nquality degradation across a wide range of tasks. In the end-to-end inference\nserving using an optimized vLLM implementation, SwiftKV realizes up to 2x\nhigher aggregate throughput and 60% lower time per output token. It can achieve\na staggering 560 TFlops/GPU of normalized inference throughput, which\ntranslates to 16K tokens/s for Llama-3.1-70B in 16-bit precision on 4x H100\nGPUs.

                    "value": "LLM inference for popular enterprise use cases, such as summarization, RAG,\nand code-generation, typically observes orders of magnitude longer prompt\nlengths than generation lengths. This characteristic leads to high cost of\nprefill and increased response latency. In this paper, we present SwiftKV, a\nnovel model transformation and distillation procedure specifically designed to\nreduce the time and cost of processing prompt tokens while preserving high\nquality of generated tokens. SwiftKV combines three key mechanisms: i)\nSingleInputKV, which prefills later layers' KV cache using a much earlier\nlayer's output, allowing prompt tokens to skip much of the model computation,\nii) AcrossKV, which merges the KV caches of neighboring layers to reduce the\nmemory footprint and support larger batch size for higher throughput, and iii)\na knowledge-preserving distillation procedure that can adapt existing LLMs for\nSwiftKV with minimal accuracy impact and low compute and data requirement. For\nLlama-3.1-8B and 70B, SwiftKV reduces the compute requirement of prefill by 50%\nand the memory requirement of the KV cache by 62.5% while incurring minimum\nquality degradation across a wide range of tasks. In the end-to-end inference\nserving using an optimized vLLM implementation, SwiftKV realizes up to 2x\nhigher aggregate throughput and 60% lower time per output token. It can achieve\na staggering 560 TFlops/GPU of normalized inference throughput, which\ntranslates to 16K tokens/s for Llama-3.1-70B in 16-bit precision on 4x H100\nGPUs.

It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall\non Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in\nspecialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts.\nYi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture,\nfeaturing advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with\noptimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses\ncomprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement\nlearning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for\nmulti-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling.\nFurthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a\nfour-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training,\npost-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing\ninfrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment\nand inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further\nevaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates\ncompetitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable\ndisparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic\nhuman preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of\nconventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent\nand powerful AI systems for practical applications.

To address these challenges, we introduce LeanKV, a unified KV cache\ncompression framework that enhances LLM serving efficiency without compromising\naccuracy through three innovations: (1) Hetero-KV quantization, which stores\nkeys at a higher precision than values to reflect their greater impact on\nattention computations; (2) per-head dynamic sparsity, which allocates memory\nbased on token importance per head and per request; and (3) unified KV\ncompression, integrating mixed-precision quantization and selective pruning to\nenable a smooth tradeoff between model accuracy and memory efficiency. To\nefficiently support these techniques, LeanKV introduces systems optimizations\nincluding unified paging and on-GPU parallel memory management. Implemented on\nvLLM, LeanKV compresses the KV cache by $3.0\\times$ to $5.0\\times$ without\naccuracy loss and up to $11.0\\times$ with under 5% accuracy loss, enhancing\nthroughput by $1.9\\times$ to $2.5\\times$, and up to $6.9\\times$.",

However, this approach is\ncomputationally expensive. To address this problem, we propose Transformer with\nresidual value (ResFormer) which approximates cross-layer attention through\nadding a residual connection from the values of the the first layer to all\nsubsequent layers. Based on this method, one variant is the Transformer with\nsingle layer value (SVFormer), where all layers share the same value embedding\nfrom first layer. Comprehensive empirical evidence demonstrates ResFormer\nachieves equivalent validation loss with 10.4% fewer model parameters and 13.6%\nless training data compared to Transformer, while maintaining similar memory\nusage and computational cost. Besides, SVFormer reduces KV cache size by nearly\nhalf with only a small performance penalty and can be integrated with other\nKV-efficient methods, yielding further reductions in KV cache, with performance\ninfluenced by sequence length and cumulative learning rate.

Understanding the background or\nregional contributions to ozone in a region, whether from the transport of\nprecursors or of ozone, provides information about the lower limit for ozone\nconcentrations that a region can achieve through regulation of local\nprecursors. In this paper, measured oxidant and $\\mathrm{NO_x}$ concentrations\nare analyzed from 14 counties in the state of Utah to calculate the regional\nand local contributions to ozone for each region.

Furthermore, this analysis is\nperformed for each county for the years 2012 and 2022 to assess changes in the\noxidative nature and quantify regional and local contributions to ozone over a\n10-year period. All studied counties--except for Washington County--in Utah\nwere found to be VOC-limited in 2012. This shifted in 2022, with most counties\nbeing either in a transitional state or $\\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited. Local\ncontributions to ozone increased in two major counties, Cache and Salt Lake\nCounties, but decreased in Carbon, Davis, Duchesne, Uinta, Utah, Washington,\nand Weber Counties. Generally, the regional contributions to oxidant\nconcentrations decreased across the state. A summertime spike in both regional\nand local contributions to oxidants was observed.

However, more recent LLMs use SwiGLU\ninstead of ReLU, which result in little inherent sparsity. While SwiGLU\nactivations can be pruned based on magnitude, the resulting sparsity patterns\nare difficult to predict, rendering previous approaches ineffective. To\ncircumvent this issue, our work introduces Dynamic Input Pruning (DIP): a\npredictor-free dynamic sparsification approach, which preserves accuracy with\nminimal fine-tuning. DIP can further use lightweight LoRA adapters to regain\nsome performance lost during sparsification. Lastly, we describe a novel\ncache-aware masking strategy, which considers the cache state and activation\nmagnitude to further increase cache hit rate, improving LLM token rate on\nmobile devices. DIP outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy, memory and\nthroughput trade-offs across simulated hardware settings. On Phi-3-Medium, DIP\nachieves a 46% reduction in memory and 40% increase in throughput with $<$ 0.1\nloss in perplexity.",

For optimizer states, we\nintroduce a dynamic quantization approach that replaces the original 32-bit\nfloating-point values with a dynamic tree-based 8-bit data type. Experimental\nresults on VoxCeleb demonstrate that the reversible variants of ResNets and\nDF-ResNets can perform training without the need to cache activations in GPU\nmemory. In addition, the 8-bit versions of SGD and Adam save 75% of memory\ncosts while maintaining performance compared to their 32-bit counterparts.\nFinally, a detailed comparison of memory usage and performance indicates that\nour proposed models achieve up to 16.2x memory savings, with nearly identical\nparameters and performance compared to the vanilla systems.

Finally, we\nthoroughly analyze the memory operations of the algorithm which leads to\nimportant theoretical insights and makes it easier to select good parameters.\nNumerical experiments show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art\nand achieves a flop rate close to the theoretical peak on modern hardware."

With the\nproposed approach, we train a novel video autoregressive model without vector\nquantization, termed NOVA. Our results demonstrate that NOVA surpasses prior\nautoregressive video models in data efficiency, inference speed, visual\nfidelity, and video fluency, even with a much smaller model capacity, i.e.,\n0.6B parameters. NOVA also outperforms state-of-the-art image diffusion models\nin text-to-image generation tasks, with a significantly lower training cost.\nAdditionally, NOVA generalizes well across extended video durations and enables\ndiverse zero-shot applications in one unified model.

We build a self-contained\nenvironment with internal web sites and data that mimics a small software\ncompany environment, and create a variety of tasks that may be performed by\nworkers in such a company. We test baseline agents powered by both closed\nAPI-based and open-weights language models (LMs), and find that with the most\ncompetitive agent, 24% of the tasks can be completed autonomously. This paints\na nuanced picture on task automation with LM agents -- in a setting simulating\na real workplace, a good portion of simpler tasks could be solved autonomously,\nbut more difficult long-horizon tasks are still beyond the reach of current\nsystems.",

We build a self-contained\nenvironment with internal web sites and data that mimics a small software\ncompany environment, and create a variety of tasks that may be performed by\nworkers in such a company. We test baseline agents powered by both closed\nAPI-based and open-weights language models (LMs), and find that with the most\ncompetitive agent, 24% of the tasks can be completed autonomously. This paints\na nuanced picture on task automation with LM agents -- in a setting simulating\na real workplace, a good portion of simpler tasks could be solved autonomously,\nbut more difficult long-horizon tasks are still beyond the reach of current\nsystems."

First, we give Claude 3\nOpus a system prompt stating it is being trained to answer all queries, even\nharmful ones, which conflicts with its prior training to refuse such queries.\nTo allow the model to infer when it is in training, we say it will be trained\nonly on conversations with free users, not paid users. We find the model\ncomplies with harmful queries from free users 14% of the time, versus almost\nnever for paid users. Explaining this gap, in almost all cases where the model\ncomplies with a harmful query from a free user, we observe explicit\nalignment-faking reasoning, with the model stating it is strategically\nanswering harmful queries in training to preserve its preferred harmlessness\nbehavior out of training. Next, we study a more realistic setting where\ninformation about the training process is provided not in a system prompt, but\nby training on synthetic documents that mimic pre-training data--and observe\nsimilar alignment faking. Finally, we study the effect of actually training the\nmodel to comply with harmful queries via reinforcement learning, which we find\nincreases the rate of alignment-faking reasoning to 78%, though also increases\ncompliance even out of training. We additionally observe other behaviors such\nas the model exfiltrating its weights when given an easy opportunity. While we\nmade alignment faking easier by telling the model when and by what criteria it\nwas being trained, we did not instruct the model to fake alignment or give it\nany explicit goal. As future models might infer information about their\ntraining process without being told, our results suggest a risk of alignment\nfaking in future models, whether due to a benign preference--as in this\ncase--or not.",

                "summary": "Smart contracts, self-executing agreements directly encoded in code, are\nfundamental to blockchain technology, especially in decentralized finance\n(DeFi) and Web3. However, the rise of Ponzi schemes in smart contracts poses\nsignificant risks, leading to substantial financial losses and eroding trust in\nblockchain systems. Existing detection methods, such as PonziGuard, depend on\nlarge amounts of labeled data and struggle to identify unseen Ponzi schemes,\nlimiting their reliability and generalizability. In contrast, we introduce\nPonziSleuth, the first LLM-driven approach for detecting Ponzi smart contracts,\nwhich requires no labeled training data. PonziSleuth utilizes advanced language\nunderstanding capabilities of LLMs to analyze smart contract source code\nthrough a novel two-step zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting technique. Our\nextensive evaluation on benchmark datasets and real-world contracts\ndemonstrates that PonziSleuth delivers comparable, and often superior,\nperformance without the extensive data requirements, achieving a balanced\ndetection accuracy of 96.06% with GPT-3.5-turbo, 93.91% with LLAMA3, and 94.27%\nwith Mistral. In real-world detection, PonziSleuth successfully identified 15\nnew Ponzi schemes from 4,597 contracts verified by Etherscan in March 2024,\nwith a false negative rate of 0% and a false positive rate of 0.29%. These\nresults highlight PonziSleuth's capability to detect diverse and novel Ponzi\nschemes, marking a significant advancement in leveraging LLMs for enhancing\nblockchain security and mitigating financial scams.",

                    "value": "Smart contracts, self-executing agreements directly encoded in code, are\nfundamental to blockchain technology, especially in decentralized finance\n(DeFi) and Web3. However, the rise of Ponzi schemes in smart contracts poses\nsignificant risks, leading to substantial financial losses and eroding trust in\nblockchain systems. Existing detection methods, such as PonziGuard, depend on\nlarge amounts of labeled data and struggle to identify unseen Ponzi schemes,\nlimiting their reliability and generalizability. In contrast, we introduce\nPonziSleuth, the first LLM-driven approach for detecting Ponzi smart contracts,\nwhich requires no labeled training data. PonziSleuth utilizes advanced language\nunderstanding capabilities of LLMs to analyze smart contract source code\nthrough a novel two-step zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting technique. Our\nextensive evaluation on benchmark datasets and real-world contracts\ndemonstrates that PonziSleuth delivers comparable, and often superior,\nperformance without the extensive data requirements, achieving a balanced\ndetection accuracy of 96.06% with GPT-3.5-turbo, 93.91% with LLAMA3, and 94.27%\nwith Mistral. In real-world detection, PonziSleuth successfully identified 15\nnew Ponzi schemes from 4,597 contracts verified by Etherscan in March 2024,\nwith a false negative rate of 0% and a false positive rate of 0.29%. These\nresults highlight PonziSleuth's capability to detect diverse and novel Ponzi\nschemes, marking a significant advancement in leveraging LLMs for enhancing\nblockchain security and mitigating financial scams."

In\nthis paper, we propose Hansel, an efficient framework for length control in\nLLMs without affecting its generation ability. Hansel utilizes periodically\noutputted hidden special tokens to keep track of the remaining target length of\nthe output sequence. Together with techniques to avoid abrupt termination of\nthe output, this seemingly simple method proved to be efficient and versatile,\nwhile not harming the coherency and fluency of the generated text. The\nframework can be applied to any pre-trained LLMs during the finetuning stage of\nthe model, regardless of its original positional encoding method. We\ndemonstrate this by finetuning four different LLMs with Hansel and show that\nthe mean absolute error of the output sequence decreases significantly in every\nmodel and dataset compared to the prompt-based length control finetuning.\nMoreover, the framework showed a substantially improved ability to extrapolate\nto target lengths unseen during finetuning, such as long dialog responses or\nextremely short summaries. This indicates that the model learns the general\nmeans of length control, rather than learning to match output lengths to those\nseen during training.",

Despite their success, a persistent challenge is\nhallucination-where generated text fails to accurately reflect visual\ncontent-undermining both accuracy and reliability. Existing methods focus on\nalignment training or decoding refinements but primarily address symptoms at\nthe generation stage without probing the underlying causes. In this work, we\ninvestigate the internal mechanisms driving hallucination in LVLMs, with an\nemphasis on the multi-head attention module. Specifically, we introduce\nVision-aware Head Divergence (VHD), a metric that quantifies the sensitivity of\nattention head outputs to visual context. Based on this, our findings reveal\nthe presence of vision-aware attention heads that are more attuned to visual\ninformation; however, the model's overreliance on its prior language patterns\nis closely related to hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose\nVision-aware Head Reinforcement (VHR), a training-free approach to mitigate\nhallucination by enhancing the role of vision-aware attention heads. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared\nto state-of-the-art approaches in mitigating hallucinations, while maintaining\nhigh efficiency with negligible additional time overhead.",

                    "value": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have made substantial progress in\nintegrating large language models (LLMs) with visual inputs, enabling advanced\nmultimodal reasoning. Despite their success, a persistent challenge is\nhallucination-where generated text fails to accurately reflect visual\ncontent-undermining both accuracy and reliability. Existing methods focus on\nalignment training or decoding refinements but primarily address symptoms at\nthe generation stage without probing the underlying causes. In this work, we\ninvestigate the internal mechanisms driving hallucination in LVLMs, with an\nemphasis on the multi-head attention module. Specifically, we introduce\nVision-aware Head Divergence (VHD), a metric that quantifies the sensitivity of\nattention head outputs to visual context. Based on this, our findings reveal\nthe presence of vision-aware attention heads that are more attuned to visual\ninformation; however, the model's overreliance on its prior language patterns\nis closely related to hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose\nVision-aware Head Reinforcement (VHR), a training-free approach to mitigate\nhallucination by enhancing the role of vision-aware attention heads. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared\nto state-of-the-art approaches in mitigating hallucinations, while maintaining\nhigh efficiency with negligible additional time overhead."

In this work,\nwe propose an automated algorithm designed for black-box LLMs, called\nAuto-Generation for LLM-DoS Attack (AutoDoS). AutoDoS introduces DoS Attack\nTree and optimizes the prompt node coverage to enhance effectiveness under\nblack-box conditions. Our method can bypass existing defense with enhanced\nstealthiness via semantic improvement of prompt nodes. Furthermore, we reveal\nthat implanting Length Trojan in Basic DoS Prompt aids in achieving higher\nattack efficacy. Experimental results show that AutoDoS amplifies service\nresponse latency by over 250 $\\times \\uparrow$, leading to severe resource\nconsumption in terms of GPU utilization and memory usage.

Of great interest is the domain-adaptive\npre-training (DAPT) paradigm, which focuses on continually training a\npre-trained language model to adapt it to a domain it was not originally\ntrained on. In this work, we evaluate the feasibility of DAPT in a low-resource\nsetting, namely the Nepali language. We use synthetic data to continue training\nLlama 3 8B to adapt it to the Nepali language in a 4-bit QLoRA setting. We\nevaluate the adapted model on its performance, forgetting, and knowledge\nacquisition. We compare the base model and the final model on their Nepali\ngeneration abilities, their performance on popular benchmarks, and run\ncase-studies to probe their linguistic knowledge in Nepali. We see some\nunsurprising forgetting in the final model, but also surprisingly find that\nincreasing the number of shots during evaluation yields better percent\nincreases in the final model (as high as 19.29% increase) compared to the base\nmodel (4.98%), suggesting latent retention. We also explore layer-head\nself-attention heatmaps to establish dependency resolution abilities of the\nfinal model in Nepali.",

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning\n(PEFT) methods have emerged as a resource-efficient approach for adapting LLMs\nto specific tasks, but their effectiveness for method-level code smell\ndetection remains underexplored. In this regard, this study evaluates\nstate-of-the-art PEFT methods on both small and large Language Models (LMs) for\ndetecting two types of method-level code smells: Complex Conditional and\nComplex Method. Using high-quality datasets sourced from GitHub, we fine-tuned\nfour small LMs and six LLMs with PEFT techniques, including prompt tuning,\nprefix tuning, LoRA, and (IA)3. Results show that PEFT methods achieve\ncomparable or better performance than full fine-tuning while consuming less GPU\nmemory. Notably, LLMs did not outperform small LMs, suggesting smaller models'\nsuitability for this task. Additionally, increasing training dataset size\nsignificantly boosted performance, while increasing trainable parameters did\nnot.

Existing detection methods, relying on heuristics\nor Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, often face\nlimitations such as unsatisfactory performance. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning\n(PEFT) methods have emerged as a resource-efficient approach for adapting LLMs\nto specific tasks, but their effectiveness for method-level code smell\ndetection remains underexplored. In this regard, this study evaluates\nstate-of-the-art PEFT methods on both small and large Language Models (LMs) for\ndetecting two types of method-level code smells: Complex Conditional and\nComplex Method. Using high-quality datasets sourced from GitHub, we fine-tuned\nfour small LMs and six LLMs with PEFT techniques, including prompt tuning,\nprefix tuning, LoRA, and (IA)3. Results show that PEFT methods achieve\ncomparable or better performance than full fine-tuning while consuming less GPU\nmemory. Notably, LLMs did not outperform small LMs, suggesting smaller models'\nsuitability for this task. Additionally, increasing training dataset size\nsignificantly boosted performance, while increasing trainable parameters did\nnot. Our findings highlight PEFT methods as effective and scalable solutions,\noutperforming existing heuristic-based and DL-based detectors."

Existing\nmethods often lack structured and tailored solutions to support automation\nengineers in reducing ramp-up time, leading to compromises in quality. This\nresearch investigates whether large-language models (LLMs), combined with\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), can assist in streamlining equipment\nselection in ramp-up planning. We propose a factual-driven copilot integrating\nLLMs with structured and semi-structured knowledge retrieval for three\ncomponent types (robots, feeders and vision systems), providing a guided and\ntraceable state-machine process for decision-making in automation equipment\nselection. The system was demonstrated to an industrial partner, who tested it\non three internal use-cases.

                "summary": "Language model continual learning (CL) has recently attracted significant\ninterest for its ability to adapt large language models (LLMs) to dynamic\nreal-world scenarios without retraining. A major challenge in this domain is\ncatastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired knowledge upon\nlearning new tasks. Existing approaches commonly utilize multiple\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) blocks to acquire task-specific\nknowledge, yet these methods are inefficient and fail to leverage potential\nknowledge transfer across tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel CL\nframework for language models, named Knowledge Localization and Fusion (KlF),\nwhich boosts knowledge transfer without depending on memory replay. KlF\ninitially segregates the model into 'skill units' based on parameter\ndependencies, allowing for more precise control. Subsequently, it employs a\nnovel group-wise knowledge localization technique to ascertain the importance\ndistribution of skill units for a new task. By comparing this importance\ndistribution with those from previous tasks, we implement a fine-grained\nknowledge fusion strategy that retains task-specific knowledge, thereby\npreventing forgetting, and updates task-shared knowledge, which facilitates\nbi-directional knowledge transfer. As a result, KlF achieves an optimal balance\nbetween retaining prior knowledge and excelling in new tasks. KlF also\ndemonstrates strong generalizability, making it suitable for various base\nmodels and adaptable to PEFT methods like LoRA. Furthermore, it offers notable\nextensibility, supporting enhancements through integration with memory replay\ntechniques. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two CL benchmarks, involving\nmodels ranging from 220M to 7B parameters, affirm the effectiveness of KlF and\nits variants across different settings.",

However, migrating user interfaces (UIs) between platforms\nis particularly challenging due to significant differences in layout structures\nand development paradigms, such as the disparity between XML layout files in\nAndroid and ArkUI framework in HarmonyOS. Manual conversion of UIs is\ntime-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient, necessitating an automated\nsolution to streamline the process and enable seamless migration from Android\nto HarmonyOS. To address this challenge, we propose the A2H Converter, an\nautomated tool for migrating Android UIs to HarmonyOS. The tool employs an\nlarge language model (LLM)-driven multi-agent framework to convert Android XML\nlayouts into HarmonyOS ArkUI layouts. Using the RAG combing with decision\nrules, the system maps Android UI components to ArkUI equivalents, while a\nreflective mechanism continuously improves conversion accuracy. A2H Converter\nhandles project-level layouts, ensuring consistency across multiple files and\naddressing complex UI logic. Experiments on six Android applications collected\nfrom GitHub demonstrate that our A2H Converter achieves a migration success\nrate of over 90.1\\%, 89.3\\%, and 89.2\\% at the component, page, and project\nlevels, respectively.

In fields such as clinical research, acquiring expert\nannotations or prior knowledge about predictive models is often costly and\ntime-consuming. This study proposes the use of LLMs to elicit expert prior\ndistributions for predictive models. This approach also provides an alternative\nto in-context learning, where language models are tasked with making\npredictions directly. In this work, we compare LLM-elicited and uninformative\npriors, evaluate whether LLMs truthfully generate parameter distributions, and\npropose a model selection strategy for in-context learning and prior\nelicitation. Our findings show that LLM-elicited prior parameter distributions\nsignificantly reduce predictive error compared to uninformative priors in\nlow-data settings. Applied to clinical problems, this translates to fewer\nrequired biological samples, lowering cost and resources. Prior elicitation\nalso consistently outperforms and proves more reliable than in-context learning\nat a lower cost, making it a preferred alternative in our setting. We\ndemonstrate the utility of this method across various use cases, including\nclinical applications. For infection prediction, using LLM-elicited priors\nreduced the number of required labels to achieve the same accuracy as an\nuninformative prior by 55%, 200 days earlier in the study.",

The majority of this potential is located in oblasts\n(provinces) across the country with large cities such as Donetsk, Dnipro or\nKyiv and surroundings.

In\nthis paper, we propose Hansel, an efficient framework for length control in\nLLMs without affecting its generation ability. Hansel utilizes periodically\noutputted hidden special tokens to keep track of the remaining target length of\nthe output sequence. Together with techniques to avoid abrupt termination of\nthe output, this seemingly simple method proved to be efficient and versatile,\nwhile not harming the coherency and fluency of the generated text. The\nframework can be applied to any pre-trained LLMs during the finetuning stage of\nthe model, regardless of its original positional encoding method. We\ndemonstrate this by finetuning four different LLMs with Hansel and show that\nthe mean absolute error of the output sequence decreases significantly in every\nmodel and dataset compared to the prompt-based length control finetuning.\nMoreover, the framework showed a substantially improved ability to extrapolate\nto target lengths unseen during finetuning, such as long dialog responses or\nextremely short summaries. This indicates that the model learns the general\nmeans of length control, rather than learning to match output lengths to those\nseen during training.",

Our evaluation of 6 open and\nclosed-source LLMs, using a benchmark encompassing 200 personas and 10,000\nquestions, reveals significant opportunities for advancement in persona agent\ncapabilities across state-of-the-art models.

In this work,\nwe propose an automated algorithm designed for black-box LLMs, called\nAuto-Generation for LLM-DoS Attack (AutoDoS).

Our method can bypass existing defense with enhanced\nstealthiness via semantic improvement of prompt nodes. Furthermore, we reveal\nthat implanting Length Trojan in Basic DoS Prompt aids in achieving higher\nattack efficacy.

Of great interest is the domain-adaptive\npre-training (DAPT) paradigm, which focuses on continually training a\npre-trained language model to adapt it to a domain it was not originally\ntrained on. In this work, we evaluate the feasibility of DAPT in a low-resource\nsetting, namely the Nepali language. We use synthetic data to continue training\nLlama 3 8B to adapt it to the Nepali language in a 4-bit QLoRA setting.

Of great interest is the domain-adaptive\npre-training (DAPT) paradigm, which focuses on continually training a\npre-trained language model to adapt it to a domain it was not originally\ntrained on. In this work, we evaluate the feasibility of DAPT in a low-resource\nsetting, namely the Nepali language. We use synthetic data to continue training\nLlama 3 8B to adapt it to the Nepali language in a 4-bit QLoRA setting.

                "summary": "Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which leverages image-level\nlabels, has garnered significant attention due to its cost-effectiveness. The\nprevious methods mainly strengthen the inter-class differences to avoid class\nsemantic ambiguity which may lead to erroneous activation. However, they\noverlook the positive function of some shared information between similar\nclasses. Categories within the same cluster share some similar features.\nAllowing the model to recognize these features can further relieve the semantic\nambiguity between these classes.

The\nprevious methods mainly strengthen the inter-class differences to avoid class\nsemantic ambiguity which may lead to erroneous activation. However, they\noverlook the positive function of some shared information between similar\nclasses. Categories within the same cluster share some similar features.\nAllowing the model to recognize these features can further relieve the semantic\nambiguity between these classes.

While some view this as an\nopportunity for model compression, we identify it as a training shortfall\nrooted in the widespread use of Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN). We\ndemonstrate that Pre-LN, commonly employed in models like GPT and LLaMA, leads\nto diminished gradient norms in its deeper layers, reducing their\neffectiveness. In contrast, Post-Layer Normalization (Post-LN) preserves larger\ngradient norms in deeper layers but suffers from vanishing gradients in earlier\nlayers. To address this, we introduce Mix-LN, a novel normalization technique\nthat combines the strengths of Pre-LN and Post-LN within the same model. Mix-LN\napplies Post-LN to the earlier layers and Pre-LN to the deeper layers, ensuring\nmore uniform gradients across layers. This allows all parts of the\nnetwork--both shallow and deep layers--to contribute effectively to training.\nExtensive experiments with various model sizes from 70M to 7B demonstrate that\nMix-LN consistently outperforms both Pre-LN and Post-LN, promoting more\nbalanced, healthier gradient norms throughout the network, and enhancing the\noverall quality of LLM pre-training. Furthermore, we demonstrate that models\npre-trained with Mix-LN learn better compared to those using Pre-LN or Post-LN\nduring supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human\nfeedback (RLHF), highlighting the critical importance of high-quality deep\nlayers. By effectively addressing the inefficiencies of deep layers in current\nLLMs, Mix-LN unlocks their potential, enhancing model capacity without\nincreasing model size.

However, limited\nexpertise and resource constraints often result in inefficiencies during the\nramp-up phase when new products are integrated into production lines. Existing\nmethods often lack structured and tailored solutions to support automation\nengineers in reducing ramp-up time, leading to compromises in quality. This\nresearch investigates whether large-language models (LLMs), combined with\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), can assist in streamlining equipment\nselection in ramp-up planning. We propose a factual-driven copilot integrating\nLLMs with structured and semi-structured knowledge retrieval for three\ncomponent types (robots, feeders and vision systems), providing a guided and\ntraceable state-machine process for decision-making in automation equipment\nselection. The system was demonstrated to an industrial partner, who tested it\non three internal use-cases. Their feedback affirmed its capability to provide\nlogical and actionable recommendations for automation equipment. More\nspecifically, among 22 equipment prompts analyzed, 19 involved selecting the\ncorrect equipment while considering most requirements, and in 6 cases, all\nrequirements were fully met.",

                    "value": "Effective decision-making in automation equipment selection is critical for\nreducing ramp-up time and maintaining production quality, especially in the\nface of increasing product variation and market demands. However, limited\nexpertise and resource constraints often result in inefficiencies during the\nramp-up phase when new products are integrated into production lines. Existing\nmethods often lack structured and tailored solutions to support automation\nengineers in reducing ramp-up time, leading to compromises in quality. This\nresearch investigates whether large-language models (LLMs), combined with\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), can assist in streamlining equipment\nselection in ramp-up planning. We propose a factual-driven copilot integrating\nLLMs with structured and semi-structured knowledge retrieval for three\ncomponent types (robots, feeders and vision systems), providing a guided and\ntraceable state-machine process for decision-making in automation equipment\nselection. The system was demonstrated to an industrial partner, who tested it\non three internal use-cases. Their feedback affirmed its capability to provide\nlogical and actionable recommendations for automation equipment. More\nspecifically, among 22 equipment prompts analyzed, 19 involved selecting the\ncorrect equipment while considering most requirements, and in 6 cases, all\nrequirements were fully met."

However, migrating user interfaces (UIs) between platforms\nis particularly challenging due to significant differences in layout structures\nand development paradigms, such as the disparity between XML layout files in\nAndroid and ArkUI framework in HarmonyOS.

To address this challenge, we propose the A2H Converter, an\nautomated tool for migrating Android UIs to HarmonyOS.

However, existing prompt\ncompression techniques either rely on sub-optimal metrics such as information\nentropy or model it as a task-agnostic token classification problem that fails\nto capture task-specific information. To address these issues, we propose a\nnovel and efficient reinforcement learning (RL) based task-aware prompt\ncompression method. To ensure low latency requirements, we leverage existing\nTransformer encoder-based token classification model while guiding the learning\nprocess with task-specific reward signals using lightweight REINFORCE\nalgorithm. We evaluate the performance of our method on three diverse and\nchallenging tasks including text summarization, question answering and code\nsummarization. We demonstrate that our RL-guided compression method improves\nthe task performance by 8% - 189% across these three scenarios over\nstate-of-the-art compression techniques while satisfying the same compression\nrate and latency requirements.",

Despite the numerous efforts in this area, the optimization for the\ndecoding phase is generally ignored. However, we believe such optimization is\ncrucial, especially for long-output generation tasks based on the following two\nobservations: (i) Excessive compression during the prefill phase, which\nrequires specific full context impairs the comprehension of the reasoning task;\n(ii) Deviation of heavy hitters occurs in the reasoning tasks with long\noutputs. Therefore, SCOPE, a simple yet efficient framework that separately\nperforms KV cache optimization during the prefill and decoding phases, is\nintroduced. Specifically, the KV cache during the prefill phase is preserved to\nmaintain the essential information, while a novel strategy based on sliding is\nproposed to select essential heavy hitters for the decoding phase. Memory usage\nand memory transfer are further optimized using adaptive and discontinuous\nstrategies. Extensive experiments on LongGenBench show the effectiveness and\ngeneralization of SCOPE and its compatibility as a plug-in to other\nprefill-only KV compression methods.",

                    "value": "Key-Value (KV) cache has become a bottleneck of LLMs for long-context\ngeneration. Despite the numerous efforts in this area, the optimization for the\ndecoding phase is generally ignored. However, we believe such optimization is\ncrucial, especially for long-output generation tasks based on the following two\nobservations: (i) Excessive compression during the prefill phase, which\nrequires specific full context impairs the comprehension of the reasoning task;\n(ii) Deviation of heavy hitters occurs in the reasoning tasks with long\noutputs. Therefore, SCOPE, a simple yet efficient framework that separately\nperforms KV cache optimization during the prefill and decoding phases, is\nintroduced. Specifically, the KV cache during the prefill phase is preserved to\nmaintain the essential information, while a novel strategy based on sliding is\nproposed to select essential heavy hitters for the decoding phase. Memory usage\nand memory transfer are further optimized using adaptive and discontinuous\nstrategies. Extensive experiments on LongGenBench show the effectiveness and\ngeneralization of SCOPE and its compatibility as a plug-in to other\nprefill-only KV compression methods."

To track progress, robust\nbenchmarks are required to evaluate their capabilities beyond superficial\npattern recognition.

GAMEBoT decomposes complex reasoning in games into predefined\nmodular subproblems. This decomposition allows us to design a suite of\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts that leverage domain knowledge to guide LLMs in\naddressing these subproblems before action selection. Furthermore, we develop a\nsuite of rule-based algorithms to generate ground truth for these subproblems,\nenabling rigorous validation of the LLMs' intermediate reasoning steps. This\napproach facilitates evaluation of both the quality of final actions and the\naccuracy of the underlying reasoning process. GAMEBoT also naturally alleviates\nthe risk of data contamination through dynamic games and head-to-head LLM\ncompetitions. We benchmark 17 prominent LLMs across eight games, encompassing\nvarious strategic abilities and game characteristics.
