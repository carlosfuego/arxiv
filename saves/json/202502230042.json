To address these issues, we introduce LServe, an efficient system that\naccelerates long-sequence LLM serving via hybrid sparse attention. This method\nunifies different hardware-friendly, structured sparsity patterns for both\nprefilling and decoding attention into a single framework, where computations\non less important tokens are skipped block-wise. LServe demonstrates the\ncompatibility of static and dynamic sparsity in long-context LLM attention.\nThis design enables multiplicative speedups by combining these optimizations.\nSpecifically, we convert half of the attention heads to nearly free streaming\nheads in both the prefilling and decoding stages. Additionally, we find that\nonly a constant number of KV pages is required to preserve long-context\ncapabilities, irrespective of context length. We then design a hierarchical KV\npage selection policy that dynamically prunes KV pages based on query-centric\nsimilarity. On average, LServe accelerates LLM prefilling by up to 2.9x and\ndecoding by 1.3-2.1x over vLLM, maintaining long-context accuracy. Code is\nreleased at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/omniserve.",

For large contexts, Key-Value caches can take\nup tens of gigabytes of device memory, as they store vector representations for\neach token and layer. Recent work has shown that the cached vectors can be\ncompressed through quantization, pruning or merging, but these techniques often\ncompromise quality towards higher compression rates. In this work, we aim to\nimprove Key & Value compression by exploiting two observations: 1) the inherent\ndependencies between keys and values across different layers, and 2)\nhigh-compression mechanisms for internal network states. We propose AQUA-KV, an\nadaptive quantization for Key-Value caches that relies on compact adapters to\nexploit existing dependencies between Keys and Values, and aims to \"optimally\"\ncompress the information that cannot be predicted. AQUA-KV significantly\nimproves compression rates, while maintaining high accuracy on state-of-the-art\nLLM families. On Llama 3.2 LLMs, we achieve near-lossless inference at 2-2.5\nbits per value with under $1\\%$ relative error in perplexity and LongBench\nscores. AQUA-KV is one-shot, simple, and efficient: it can be calibrated on a\nsingle GPU within 1-6 hours, even for 70B models.",

The latter approaches, like the\nsuffix array, instead sacrifice space for speed.\n  We show that efficient text indexing can be achieved using just a small extra\nspace on top of the original text, provided that the query patterns are\nsufficiently long.

Our analysis offers new insights into\nattention biases in parallel attention mechanisms and provides practical\nsolutions to tackle these challenges. To mitigate the attention sink issue, we\npropose an attention calibration strategy that reduces biases, ensuring more\nstable long-range attention. Additionally, we introduce a chunk eviction\nstrategy to efficiently manage ultra-long contexts on a single A100 80GB GPU.\nTo further enhance efficiency, we propose a parallel KV cache eviction\ntechnique, which improves chunk throughput by 1.76x, thereby achieving a 23.50x\nacceleration in the prefilling stage with negligible performance loss due to\nattention calibration.

Modern computing\nsystems incorporate a 4-level page table design to support address translation\nin VM. However, simply adopting an existing 4-level page table in NDP systems\ncauses significant address translation overhead because (1) NDP applications\ngenerate a lot of address translations, and (2) the limited L1 cache in NDP\nsystems cannot cover the accesses to page table entries (PTEs). We extensively\nanalyze the 4-level page table design in the NDP scenario and observe that (1)\nthe memory access to page table entries is highly irregular, thus cannot\nbenefit from the L1 cache, and (2) the last two levels of page tables are\nnearly fully occupied.

                "summary": "The efficient processing of long context poses a serious challenge for large\nlanguage models (LLMs). Recently, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has\nemerged as a promising strategy for this problem, as it enables LLMs to make\nselective use of the long context for efficient computation. However, existing\nRAG approaches lag behind other long-context processing methods due to inherent\nlimitations on inaccurate retrieval and fragmented contexts. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce RetroLM, a novel RAG framework for long-context\nprocessing.

                    "value": "The efficient processing of long context poses a serious challenge for large\nlanguage models (LLMs). Recently, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has\nemerged as a promising strategy for this problem, as it enables LLMs to make\nselective use of the long context for efficient computation. However, existing\nRAG approaches lag behind other long-context processing methods due to inherent\nlimitations on inaccurate retrieval and fragmented contexts. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce RetroLM, a novel RAG framework for long-context\nprocessing.

Existing\napproaches\\textemdash such as relative positional encodings (e.g., RoPE, ALiBi)\nand sliding window mechanisms\\textemdash partially alleviate these issues but\noften require additional training or suffer from performance degradation with\nlonger inputs. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{\\textit{CacheFocus}}, a\nmethod that enhances length normalization and reduces inference latency without\nany further training. Our approach leverages query-independent, offline caching\nto efficiently reuse a Context KV Cache Store.

However, their reliance on multiple sequential forward\npasses significantly limits real-time performance. Previous acceleration\nmethods have primarily focused on reducing the number of sampling steps or\nreusing intermediate results, failing to leverage variations across spatial\nregions within the image due to the constraints of convolutional U-Net\nstructures. By harnessing the flexibility of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) in\nhandling variable number of tokens, we introduce RAS, a novel, training-free\nsampling strategy that dynamically assigns different sampling ratios to regions\nwithin an image based on the focus of the DiT model. Our key observation is\nthat during each sampling step, the model concentrates on semantically\nmeaningful regions, and these areas of focus exhibit strong continuity across\nconsecutive steps. Leveraging this insight, RAS updates only the regions\ncurrently in focus, while other regions are updated using cached noise from the\nprevious step. The model's focus is determined based on the output from the\npreceding step, capitalizing on the temporal consistency we observed. We\nevaluate RAS on Stable Diffusion 3 and Lumina-Next-T2I, achieving speedups up\nto 2.36x and 2.51x, respectively, with minimal degradation in generation\nquality. Additionally, a user study reveals that RAS delivers comparable\nqualities under human evaluation while achieving a 1.6x speedup.

Case studies address daily grid operation with real-life load demand\nand wind power generation profiles, showing that the proposed strategy is\neffective not only to minimize total active power losses as much as possible\nwithin system-wide limitations, but also to maintain adequate voltage profiles\nand reactive power flows.

Multi-head\nLatent Attention (MLA) tackles this challenge by using low-rank matrices in the\nkey-value (KV) layers, thereby allowing compressed latent KV states to be\ncached. This approach significantly reduces the KV cache size relative to\ntraditional multi-head attention, leading to faster inference. Moreover, MLA\nemploys an up-projection matrix to increase expressiveness, trading additional\ncomputation for reduced communication overhead. Although MLA has demonstrated\nefficiency and effectiveness in Deepseek V2/V3/R1, many major model providers\nstill rely on Group Query Attention (GQA) and have not announced any plans to\nadopt MLA. In this paper, we show that GQA can always be represented by MLA\nwhile maintaining the same KV cache overhead, but the converse does not hold.\nTo encourage broader use of MLA, we introduce TransMLA, a post-training method\nthat converts widely used GQA-based pre-trained models (e.g., LLaMA, Qwen,\nMixtral) into MLA-based models. After conversion, the model can undergo\nadditional training to boost expressiveness without increasing the KV cache\nsize.

This mismatch challenges the efficient deployment of advanced LLMs\nand makes users to pay for expensive compute resources that are poorly utilized\nfor the memory-bound LLM inference tasks.\n  We propose CENT, a CXL-ENabled GPU-Free sysTem for LLM inference, which\nharnesses CXL memory expansion capabilities to accommodate substantial LLM\nsizes, and utilizes near-bank processing units to deliver high memory\nbandwidth, eliminating the need for expensive GPUs. CENT exploits a scalable\nCXL network to support peer-to-peer and collective communication primitives\nacross CXL devices. We implement various parallelism strategies to distribute\nLLMs across these devices. Compared to GPU baselines with maximum supported\nbatch sizes and similar average power, CENT achieves 2.3$\\times$ higher\nthroughput and consumes 2.3$\\times$ less energy. CENT enhances the Total Cost\nof Ownership (TCO), generating 5.2$\\times$ more tokens per dollar than GPUs.",

This mismatch challenges the efficient deployment of advanced LLMs\nand makes users to pay for expensive compute resources that are poorly utilized\nfor the memory-bound LLM inference tasks.\n  We propose CENT, a CXL-ENabled GPU-Free sysTem for LLM inference, which\nharnesses CXL memory expansion capabilities to accommodate substantial LLM\nsizes, and utilizes near-bank processing units to deliver high memory\nbandwidth, eliminating the need for expensive GPUs. CENT exploits a scalable\nCXL network to support peer-to-peer and collective communication primitives\nacross CXL devices. We implement various parallelism strategies to distribute\nLLMs across these devices. Compared to GPU baselines with maximum supported\nbatch sizes and similar average power, CENT achieves 2.3$\\times$ higher\nthroughput and consumes 2.3$\\times$ less energy. CENT enhances the Total Cost\nof Ownership (TCO), generating 5.2$\\times$ more tokens per dollar than GPUs."

MARIA combines a pre-trained MLM\nand AR model by training a linear decoder that takes their concatenated hidden\nstates as input. This minimal modification enables the AR model to perform\ninfilling while retaining its inherent advantages in terms of faster inference\nwith KV caching. Our results demonstrate that MARIA significantly outperforms\nexisting methods, namely discrete diffusion models, on masked infilling tasks."

However, the AR modeling paradigm\npresents certain limitations; for instance, contemporary autoregressive LLMs\nare trained to generate one token at a time, which can result in noticeable\nlatency. Recent advances have indicated that search and repeated sampling can\nenhance performance in various applications, such as theorem proving, code\ngeneration, and alignment, by utilizing greater computational resources during\ninference. In this study, we demonstrate that diffusion language models are\ncapable of generating at least 32 tokens simultaneously, while exceeding the\nperformance of AR models in text quality and on the LAMBADA natural language\nunderstanding benchmark. This outcome is achieved through a novel distillation\nmethod for discrete diffusion models, which reduces the number of inference\nsteps by a factor of 32-64. Practically, at the 1.3B parameters scale,\ndiffusion models, even without caching, can generate tokens at a rate that is\nup to 8 times faster than AR models employing KV-caching, and we anticipate\nfurther improvements with the inclusion of caching.

                    "value": "Autoregressive (AR) Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated\nsignificant success across numerous tasks. However, the AR modeling paradigm\npresents certain limitations; for instance, contemporary autoregressive LLMs\nare trained to generate one token at a time, which can result in noticeable\nlatency. Recent advances have indicated that search and repeated sampling can\nenhance performance in various applications, such as theorem proving, code\ngeneration, and alignment, by utilizing greater computational resources during\ninference. In this study, we demonstrate that diffusion language models are\ncapable of generating at least 32 tokens simultaneously, while exceeding the\nperformance of AR models in text quality and on the LAMBADA natural language\nunderstanding benchmark. This outcome is achieved through a novel distillation\nmethod for discrete diffusion models, which reduces the number of inference\nsteps by a factor of 32-64. Practically, at the 1.3B parameters scale,\ndiffusion models, even without caching, can generate tokens at a rate that is\nup to 8 times faster than AR models employing KV-caching, and we anticipate\nfurther improvements with the inclusion of caching. Moreover, we demonstrate\nthe efficacy of our approach for diffusion language models with up to 860M\nparameters."

Our experiments on slot filling,\nmachine translation, and structured text generation show consistent\nimprovements in cross-lingual transfer, especially to lower-resource languages.\nThe method is robust to the choice of alignment languages and generalizes to\nlanguages unseen during alignment. Furthermore, we show that separately trained\nalignment modules can be merged with existing task-specific modules, improving\ncross-lingual capabilities without full re-training. Our code is publicly\navailable (https://github.com/dannigt/mid-align)."

In this paper, we introduce dynamic Low-rank Sparse Adaptation (LoSA),\na novel method that seamlessly integrates low-rank adaptation into LLM sparsity\nwithin a unified framework, thereby enhancing the performance of sparse LLMs\nwithout increasing the inference latency. In particular, LoSA dynamically\nsparsifies the LoRA outcomes based on the corresponding sparse weights during\nfine-tuning, thus guaranteeing that the LoRA module can be integrated into the\nsparse LLMs post-training.

Predicated on this, LoSA adjusts the rank of the LoRA module based\non the variability in layer-wise reconstruction errors, allocating an\nappropriate fine-tuning for each layer to reduce the output discrepancies\nbetween dense and sparse LLMs. Extensive experiments tell that LoSA can\nefficiently boost the efficacy of sparse LLMs within a few hours, without\nintroducing any additional inferential burden.

As a result, the overall\nreconstruction error increases significantly, leading to a substantial\ndegradation in model performance. Through theoretical analysis, we derive a\nsimple yet effective approach to layer-wise sparsity allocation that mitigates\nthis issue. Our method uses a monotonically increasing arithmetic progression,\nreducing the process of determining sparsity rates for multiple layers to the\ndetermination of a single common difference hyperparameter.

                "summary": "Class-incremental learning requires models to continually acquire knowledge\nof new classes without forgetting old ones. Although pre-trained models have\ndemonstrated strong performance in class-incremental learning, they remain\nsusceptible to catastrophic forgetting when learning new concepts. Excessive\nplasticity in the models breaks generalizability and causes forgetting, while\nstrong stability results in insufficient adaptation to new classes. This\nnecessitates effective adaptation with minimal modifications to preserve the\ngeneral knowledge of pre-trained models.

However, existing RAG frameworks are primarily designed for\ntext-based LLMs and rely on Automatic Speech Recognition to process speech\ninput, which discards crucial audio information, risks transcription errors,\nand increases computational overhead. Therefore, we introduce WavRAG, the first\nretrieval augmented generation framework with native, end-to-end audio support.\nWavRAG offers two key features: 1) Bypassing ASR, WavRAG directly processes raw\naudio for both embedding and retrieval. 2) WavRAG integrates audio and text\ninto a unified knowledge representation. Specifically, we propose the\nWavRetriever to facilitate the retrieval from a text-audio hybrid knowledge\nbase, and further enhance the in-context capabilities of spoken dialogue models\nthrough the integration of chain-of-thought reasoning. In comparison to\nstate-of-the-art ASR-Text RAG pipelines, WavRAG achieves comparable retrieval\nperformance while delivering a 10x acceleration. Furthermore, WavRAG's unique\ntext-audio hybrid retrieval capability extends the boundaries of RAG to the\naudio modality.",

To address the concerns, we present a computational approach that\nsystematically evaluates the factual accuracy of biomedical knowledge that an\nLLM model has been prompted to generate.

This allows higher-quality nodes to be traversed\nearlier.Applied to the various ML tasks, our approach demonstrates a6\\%\nabsolute improvement in performance compared to the strong open-source AutoML\nagents, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing agentic AutoML systems."

Experimental results on synthetically\ngenerated mazes show that while a baseline model fails to navigate the maze,\nthe SFT-trained model achieves 86% accuracy, and further GRPO fine-tuning\nboosts accuracy to 93%. Qualitative analyses reveal that GRPO fosters more\nrobust and self-corrective reasoning, highlighting the potential of our\napproach to bridge the gap between language models and visual spatial tasks.\nThese findings offer promising implications for applications in robotics,\nautonomous navigation, and other domains that require integrated visual and\nsequential reasoning.",

Our X-KDE comprises two stages: (i) Cross-lingual Edition\nInstruction Tuning (XE-IT), which fine-tunes the model on a curated parallel\ndataset to modify in-scope knowledge while preserving unrelated information,\nand (ii) Target-language Preference Optimization (TL-PO), which applies\nadvanced optimization techniques to ensure consistency across languages,\nfostering the transfer of updates. Additionally, we contribute a high-quality,\ncross-lingual dataset, specifically designed to enhance knowledge transfer\nacross languages. Extensive experiments on the Bi-ZsRE and MzsRE benchmarks\nshow that X-KDE significantly enhances cross-lingual performance, achieving an\naverage improvement of +8.19%, while maintaining high accuracy in monolingual\nsettings."

Recent benchmarks have shown that large language models\n(LLMs) can effectively generate code at the function level, make code edits,\nand solve algorithmic coding tasks.

Overall, we\n(1) develop an education-specific overview of potential harms from LLMs, (2)\nhighlight gaps between conceptions of harm by edtech providers and those by\neducators, and (3) make recommendations to facilitate the centering of\neducators in the design and development of edtech tools."

Specifically, as ReVISE involves two challenging tasks (i.e.,\nself-verification and reasoning correction), we tackle each task sequentially\nusing curriculum learning, collecting both failed and successful reasoning\npaths to construct preference pairs for efficient training.

To address these issues, we introduce LServe, an efficient system that\naccelerates long-sequence LLM serving via hybrid sparse attention. This method\nunifies different hardware-friendly, structured sparsity patterns for both\nprefilling and decoding attention into a single framework, where computations\non less important tokens are skipped block-wise. LServe demonstrates the\ncompatibility of static and dynamic sparsity in long-context LLM attention.\nThis design enables multiplicative speedups by combining these optimizations.\nSpecifically, we convert half of the attention heads to nearly free streaming\nheads in both the prefilling and decoding stages. Additionally, we find that\nonly a constant number of KV pages is required to preserve long-context\ncapabilities, irrespective of context length. We then design a hierarchical KV\npage selection policy that dynamically prunes KV pages based on query-centric\nsimilarity. On average, LServe accelerates LLM prefilling by up to 2.9x and\ndecoding by 1.3-2.1x over vLLM, maintaining long-context accuracy. Code is\nreleased at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/omniserve.",

Applying Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the sparse LLMs\noffers an intuitive approach to counter this predicament, while it holds\nshortcomings include: 1) The inability to integrate LoRA weights into sparse\nLLMs post-training, and 2) Insufficient performance recovery at high sparsity\nratios. In this paper, we introduce dynamic Low-rank Sparse Adaptation (LoSA),\na novel method that seamlessly integrates low-rank adaptation into LLM sparsity\nwithin a unified framework, thereby enhancing the performance of sparse LLMs\nwithout increasing the inference latency. In particular, LoSA dynamically\nsparsifies the LoRA outcomes based on the corresponding sparse weights during\nfine-tuning, thus guaranteeing that the LoRA module can be integrated into the\nsparse LLMs post-training. Besides, LoSA leverages Representation Mutual\nInformation (RMI) as an indicator to determine the importance of layers,\nthereby efficiently determining the layer-wise sparsity rates during\nfine-tuning. Predicated on this, LoSA adjusts the rank of the LoRA module based\non the variability in layer-wise reconstruction errors, allocating an\nappropriate fine-tuning for each layer to reduce the output discrepancies\nbetween dense and sparse LLMs. Extensive experiments tell that LoSA can\nefficiently boost the efficacy of sparse LLMs within a few hours, without\nintroducing any additional inferential burden. For example, LoSA reduced the\nperplexity of sparse LLaMA-2-7B by 68.73 and increased zero-shot accuracy by\n16.32$\\%$, achieving a 2.60$\\times$ speedup on CPU and 2.23$\\times$ speedup on\nGPU, requiring only 45 minutes of fine-tuning on a single NVIDIA A100 80GB GPU.\nCode is available at https://github.com/wzhuang-xmu/LoSA.",

Predicated on this, LoSA adjusts the rank of the LoRA module based\non the variability in layer-wise reconstruction errors, allocating an\nappropriate fine-tuning for each layer to reduce the output discrepancies\nbetween dense and sparse LLMs. Extensive experiments tell that LoSA can\nefficiently boost the efficacy of sparse LLMs within a few hours, without\nintroducing any additional inferential burden. For example, LoSA reduced the\nperplexity of sparse LLaMA-2-7B by 68.73 and increased zero-shot accuracy by\n16.32$\\%$, achieving a 2.60$\\times$ speedup on CPU and 2.23$\\times$ speedup on\nGPU, requiring only 45 minutes of fine-tuning on a single NVIDIA A100 80GB GPU.\nCode is available at https://github.com/wzhuang-xmu/LoSA."

As a result, the overall\nreconstruction error increases significantly, leading to a substantial\ndegradation in model performance. Through theoretical analysis, we derive a\nsimple yet effective approach to layer-wise sparsity allocation that mitigates\nthis issue. Our method uses a monotonically increasing arithmetic progression,\nreducing the process of determining sparsity rates for multiple layers to the\ndetermination of a single common difference hyperparameter.

Deep train-from-scratch models have\nexhibited effective performance yet require large amounts of data, which limits\nreal-world applicability. Recently, researchers have leveraged the\nrepresentation learning transferability of pre-trained Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to handle limited non-linguistic datasets effectively. However,\nincorporating LLMs with time-series data presents challenges of limited\nadaptation due to different compositions between time-series and linguistic\ndata, and the inability to process multi-scale temporal information. To tackle\nthese challenges, we propose LLM4TS, a framework for time-series forecasting\nwith pre-trained LLMs. LLM4TS consists of a two-stage fine-tuning strategy: the\ntime-series alignment stage to align LLMs with the nuances of time-series data,\nand the forecasting fine-tuning stage for downstream time-series forecasting\ntasks. Furthermore, our framework features a novel two-level aggregation method\nthat integrates multi-scale temporal data within pre-trained LLMs, enhancing\ntheir ability to interpret time-specific information. In experiments across 7\ntime-series forecasting datasets, LLM4TS is superior to existing\nstate-of-the-art methods compared with trained-from-scratch models in full-shot\nscenarios, and also achieves the highest rank in few-shot scenarios. In\naddition, evaluations compared with different unsupervised representation\nlearning approaches highlight LLM4TS's effectiveness with representation\nlearning in forecasting tasks. Ablation studies further validate each\ncomponent's contribution to LLM4TS and underscore the essential role of\nutilizing LLM's pre-trained weights for optimal performance.

To tackle\nthese challenges, we propose LLM4TS, a framework for time-series forecasting\nwith pre-trained LLMs. LLM4TS consists of a two-stage fine-tuning strategy: the\ntime-series alignment stage to align LLMs with the nuances of time-series data,\nand the forecasting fine-tuning stage for downstream time-series forecasting\ntasks. Furthermore, our framework features a novel two-level aggregation method\nthat integrates multi-scale temporal data within pre-trained LLMs, enhancing\ntheir ability to interpret time-specific information. In experiments across 7\ntime-series forecasting datasets, LLM4TS is superior to existing\nstate-of-the-art methods compared with trained-from-scratch models in full-shot\nscenarios, and also achieves the highest rank in few-shot scenarios. In\naddition, evaluations compared with different unsupervised representation\nlearning approaches highlight LLM4TS's effectiveness with representation\nlearning in forecasting tasks. Ablation studies further validate each\ncomponent's contribution to LLM4TS and underscore the essential role of\nutilizing LLM's pre-trained weights for optimal performance.

                "summary": "The in-context learning (ICL) capability of large language models (LLMs)\nenables them to perform challenging tasks using provided demonstrations.\nHowever, ICL is highly sensitive to the ordering of demonstrations, leading to\ninstability in predictions. This paper shows that this vulnerability can be\nexploited to design a natural attack - difficult for model providers to detect\n- that achieves nearly 80% success rate on LLaMA-3 by simply permuting the\ndemonstrations. Existing mitigation methods primarily rely on post-processing\nand fail to enhance the model's inherent robustness to input permutations,\nraising concerns about safety and reliability of LLMs. To address this issue,\nwe propose Permutation-resilient learning (PEARL), a novel framework based on\ndistributionally robust optimization (DRO), which optimizes model performance\nagainst the worst-case input permutation. Specifically, PEARL consists of a\npermutation-proposal network (P-Net) and the LLM. The P-Net generates the most\nchallenging permutations by treating it as an optimal transport problem, which\nis solved using an entropy-constrained Sinkhorn algorithm. Through minimax\noptimization, the P-Net and the LLM iteratively optimize against each other,\nprogressively improving the LLM's robustness. Experiments on synthetic\npre-training and real-world instruction tuning tasks demonstrate that PEARL\neffectively mitigates permutation attacks and enhances performance. Notably,\ndespite being trained on fewer shots and shorter contexts, PEARL achieves\nperformance gains of up to 40% when scaled to many-shot and long-context\nscenarios, highlighting its efficiency and generalization capabilities.",

                    "value": "The in-context learning (ICL) capability of large language models (LLMs)\nenables them to perform challenging tasks using provided demonstrations.\nHowever, ICL is highly sensitive to the ordering of demonstrations, leading to\ninstability in predictions. This paper shows that this vulnerability can be\nexploited to design a natural attack - difficult for model providers to detect\n- that achieves nearly 80% success rate on LLaMA-3 by simply permuting the\ndemonstrations. Existing mitigation methods primarily rely on post-processing\nand fail to enhance the model's inherent robustness to input permutations,\nraising concerns about safety and reliability of LLMs. To address this issue,\nwe propose Permutation-resilient learning (PEARL), a novel framework based on\ndistributionally robust optimization (DRO), which optimizes model performance\nagainst the worst-case input permutation. Specifically, PEARL consists of a\npermutation-proposal network (P-Net) and the LLM. The P-Net generates the most\nchallenging permutations by treating it as an optimal transport problem, which\nis solved using an entropy-constrained Sinkhorn algorithm. Through minimax\noptimization, the P-Net and the LLM iteratively optimize against each other,\nprogressively improving the LLM's robustness. Experiments on synthetic\npre-training and real-world instruction tuning tasks demonstrate that PEARL\neffectively mitigates permutation attacks and enhances performance. Notably,\ndespite being trained on fewer shots and shorter contexts, PEARL achieves\nperformance gains of up to 40% when scaled to many-shot and long-context\nscenarios, highlighting its efficiency and generalization capabilities."

                "summary": "The automatic generation of programs has long been a fundamental challenge in\ncomputer science. Recent benchmarks have shown that large language models\n(LLMs) can effectively generate code at the function level, make code edits,\nand solve algorithmic coding tasks. However, to achieve full automation, LLMs\nshould be able to generate production-quality, self-contained application\nmodules. To evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in solving this challenge, we\nintroduce BaxBench, a novel evaluation benchmark consisting of 392 tasks for\nthe generation of backend applications. We focus on backends for three critical\nreasons: (i) they are practically relevant, building the core components of\nmost modern web and cloud software, (ii) they are difficult to get right,\nrequiring multiple functions and files to achieve the desired functionality,\nand (iii) they are security-critical, as they are exposed to untrusted\nthird-parties, making secure solutions that prevent deployment-time attacks an\nimperative.

                    "value": "The automatic generation of programs has long been a fundamental challenge in\ncomputer science. Recent benchmarks have shown that large language models\n(LLMs) can effectively generate code at the function level, make code edits,\nand solve algorithmic coding tasks. However, to achieve full automation, LLMs\nshould be able to generate production-quality, self-contained application\nmodules. To evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in solving this challenge, we\nintroduce BaxBench, a novel evaluation benchmark consisting of 392 tasks for\nthe generation of backend applications. We focus on backends for three critical\nreasons: (i) they are practically relevant, building the core components of\nmost modern web and cloud software, (ii) they are difficult to get right,\nrequiring multiple functions and files to achieve the desired functionality,\nand (iii) they are security-critical, as they are exposed to untrusted\nthird-parties, making secure solutions that prevent deployment-time attacks an\nimperative.

While prior work mainly\nextends DPO from the aspect of the objective function, we instead improve DPO\nfrom the largely overlooked but critical aspect of data selection.\nSpecifically, we address the issue of parameter shrinkage caused by noisy data\nby proposing a novel margin-maximization principle for dataset curation in DPO\ntraining. To accurately estimate margins for data selection, we propose a\ndual-margin guided approach that considers both external reward margins and\nimplicit DPO reward margins.

These agents utilize subgraph information from different\ndimensions to engage in multi-round discussions, thereby improving error\ndetection accuracy and ensuring a transparent decision-making process.\nExtensive experiments on FB15K and WN18RR demonstrate that MAKGED outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods, enhancing the accuracy and robustness of KG\nevaluation. For specific industrial scenarios, our framework can facilitate the\ntraining of specialized agents using domain-specific knowledge graphs for error\ndetection, which highlights the potential industrial application value of our\nframework.

In this\npaper, we propose Multidimensional Multi-Agent Debate (M-MAD), a systematic\nLLM-based multi-agent framework for advanced LLM-as-a-judge MT evaluation.

Comprehensive experiments show that M-MAD not only\noutperforms all existing LLM-as-a-judge methods but also competes with\nstate-of-the-art reference-based automatic metrics, even when powered by a\nsuboptimal model like GPT-4o mini.

Current multi-agent systems universally excel in\nperformance, compared to single agents, but struggle with generalization across\nenvironments due to predefined roles and inadequate strategies for generalizing\nlanguage agents. The challenge of achieving both strong performance and good\ngeneralization has hindered the progress of multi-agent systems for interactive\nenvironments. To address these issues, we propose CollabUIAgents, a multi-agent\nreinforcement learning framework with a novel multi-agent credit re-assignment\n(CR) strategy, assigning process rewards with LLMs rather than\nenvironment-specific rewards and learning with synthesized preference data, in\norder to foster generalizable, collaborative behaviors among the role-free\nagents' policies. Empirical results show that our framework improves both\nperformance and cross-environment generalizability of multi-agent systems.\nMoreover, our 7B-parameter system achieves results on par with or exceed strong\nclosed-source models, and the LLM that guides the CR. We also provide insights\nin using granular CR rewards effectively for environment generalization, and\naccommodating trained LLMs in multi-agent systems.",

                    "value": "LLM-based agents have made significant advancements in interactive\nenvironments, such as mobile operations and web browsing, and other domains\nbeyond computer using. Current multi-agent systems universally excel in\nperformance, compared to single agents, but struggle with generalization across\nenvironments due to predefined roles and inadequate strategies for generalizing\nlanguage agents. The challenge of achieving both strong performance and good\ngeneralization has hindered the progress of multi-agent systems for interactive\nenvironments. To address these issues, we propose CollabUIAgents, a multi-agent\nreinforcement learning framework with a novel multi-agent credit re-assignment\n(CR) strategy, assigning process rewards with LLMs rather than\nenvironment-specific rewards and learning with synthesized preference data, in\norder to foster generalizable, collaborative behaviors among the role-free\nagents' policies. Empirical results show that our framework improves both\nperformance and cross-environment generalizability of multi-agent systems.\nMoreover, our 7B-parameter system achieves results on par with or exceed strong\nclosed-source models, and the LLM that guides the CR. We also provide insights\nin using granular CR rewards effectively for environment generalization, and\naccommodating trained LLMs in multi-agent systems."

However, most neural systems utilize decoder-only causal\n(unidirectional) transformer models, which are effective for English but may\nreduce the richness of languages with less strict word order, subject omission,\nor different relative clause attachment preferences. This is the first work\nthat analytically addresses optimal text generation order for non-causal\nlanguage models. We present a novel Viterbi algorithm-based methodology for\nmaximum likelihood word order estimation. We analyze the non-causal\nmost-likelihood order probability for NLG in Spanish and, then, the probability\nof generating the same phrases with Spanish causal NLG. This comparative\nanalysis reveals that causal NLG prefers English-like SVO structures. We also\nanalyze the relationship between optimal generation order and causal\nleft-to-right generation order using Spearman's rank correlation. Our results\ndemonstrate that the ideal order predicted by the maximum likelihood estimator\nis not closely related to the causal order and may be influenced by the\nsyntactic structure of the target sentence.",

                    "value": "Natural Language Generation (NLG) popularity has increased owing to the\nprogress in Large Language Models (LLMs), with zero-shot inference\ncapabilities. However, most neural systems utilize decoder-only causal\n(unidirectional) transformer models, which are effective for English but may\nreduce the richness of languages with less strict word order, subject omission,\nor different relative clause attachment preferences. This is the first work\nthat analytically addresses optimal text generation order for non-causal\nlanguage models. We present a novel Viterbi algorithm-based methodology for\nmaximum likelihood word order estimation. We analyze the non-causal\nmost-likelihood order probability for NLG in Spanish and, then, the probability\nof generating the same phrases with Spanish causal NLG. This comparative\nanalysis reveals that causal NLG prefers English-like SVO structures. We also\nanalyze the relationship between optimal generation order and causal\nleft-to-right generation order using Spearman's rank correlation. Our results\ndemonstrate that the ideal order predicted by the maximum likelihood estimator\nis not closely related to the causal order and may be influenced by the\nsyntactic structure of the target sentence."

This paper introduces UAVDB, a high-resolution UAV detection\ndataset constructed using Patch Intensity Convergence (PIC). This novel\ntechnique automatically generates high-fidelity bounding box annotations from\nUAV trajectory data~\\cite{li2020reconstruction}, eliminating the need for\nmanual labeling. UAVDB features single-class annotations with a fixed-camera\nsetup and consists of RGB frames capturing UAVs across various scales, from\nlarge-scale UAVs to near-single-pixel representations, along with challenging\nbackgrounds that pose difficulties for modern detectors. We first validate the\naccuracy and efficiency of PIC-generated bounding boxes by comparing\nIntersection over Union (IoU) performance and runtime against alternative\nannotation methods, demonstrating that PIC achieves higher annotation accuracy\nwhile being more efficient. Subsequently, we benchmark UAVDB using\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) YOLO-series detectors, establishing UAVDB as a valuable\nresource for advancing long-range and high-resolution UAV detection.",
