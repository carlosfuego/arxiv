Our method leverages\nthis finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate\nvariables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions\nin newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency\nacross multiple videos.

Experiments show that RPC improves generation\nthroughput of QwQ-32B by up to 1.60$\\times$ compared to the inference with full\nKV cache, with an accuracy drop of 1.2\\% on the AIME 2024 benchmark. Our\nfindings demonstrate that semantic sparsity in reasoning traces can be\neffectively exploited for compression, offering a practical path toward\nefficient deployment of reasoning LLMs. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/jiwonsong-dev/ReasoningPathCompression."

However, the introduction of external knowledge bases presents\nRAG with challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory\nconsumption and inference latency. Existing research accelerates inference by\nprecomputing Key and Value (KV) of the knowledge base and loading them\non-demand during inference. Based on the access frequency of different KV\nchunks within the external knowledge base, this paper proposes a hotness-aware\nRAG (HA-RAG) inference optimization system. First, leveraging the numerical\ndistribution of KV chunks, we introduce a hotness-aware mixed-precision\ncompressing and loading method to reduce disk I/O and memory access overhead.\nSecond, we design a hotness-aware data placement strategy that prioritizes\nstoring frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory to improve data\naccess efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with\nTurboRAG, the proposed HA-RAG achieves an average speedup of 2.10x and maximum\nspeedup of 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with negligible accuracy loss.",

Traditional\ngeneral-purpose accelerators struggle to effectively exploit fine-grain\nparallelism due to limitations in implementing convoluted data-dependency\npatterns (like SIMD) and overheads due to synchronization and data transfers\n(like GPGPUs). In contrast, custom FPGA and ASIC designs offer improved\nperformance and energy efficiency at a high cost in hardware design and\nprogramming complexity and often lack the flexibility to process different\nworkloads. We propose Squire, a general-purpose accelerator designed to exploit\nfine-grain parallelism effectively on dependency-bound kernels. Each Squire\naccelerator has a set of general-purpose low-power in-order cores that can\nrapidly communicate among themselves and directly access data from the L2\ncache. Our proposal integrates one Squire accelerator per core in a typical\nmulticore system, allowing the acceleration of dependency-bound kernels within\nparallel tasks with minimal software changes. As a case study, we evaluate\nSquire's effectiveness by accelerating five kernels that implement complex\ndependency patterns. We use three of these kernels to build an end-to-end\nread-mapping tool that will be used to evaluate Squire. Squire obtains speedups\nup to 7.64$\\times$ in dynamic programming kernels.

Scaling them\nto improve representation, however, often demands substantial memory and\ncompute costs, such as the Key-Value (KV) cache used during auto-regressive\ndecoding. Skip connections offer a promising way to improve representation\nwithout bloating resource usage, yet most prior works either improve\nexpressivity while leaving KV costs unchanged, or reduce memory at the cost of\nweaker representation. In this work, we propose SkipV1Former, a Transformer\nvariant that uses skip connections from the first layer's Value heads to\nstrengthen model representation and reduce KV cache. Specifically, from the\nsecond block onward, each layer reuses half of its Value heads from the very\nfirst layer, while computing the other half as usual-cutting Value projections\nand V cache by nearly 50 \\%. Theoretically, we show that routing uncompressed\nfirst-layer Values into deeper layers restores information lost to compression\nand accelerates the model's implicit mesa-optimization-a key pattern of\nTransformer in auto-regressive tasks. Empirically, across different model\nscales, SkipV1Former delivers consistent reductions of approximately 25 \\% in\nKV cache while improving perplexity relative to standard Multi-Head Attention\n(MHA) Transformers and some advanced variants. Moreover, we propose a recipe\nfor uptraining existing MHA Transformer checkpoints to SkipV1Former with only\n10-15\\% additional compute. Finally, SkipV1Former can seamlessly combine\nadvanced methods like Group-Query Attention and Multi-Latent Attention to\nachieve further KV cache savings and performance improvement. When combined\nwith YOCO, it cuts KV cache size by nearly 50 \\% while still improving\nperformance.",

This paper presents the first\ncomprehensive framework for systematic latent risk detection, prevention, and\noptimization through integrated mathematical modeling, intelligent perturbation\ntesting, and risk-aware performance optimization. We introduce the Latent Risk\nIndex (LRI) that correlates strongly with incident severity (r=0.863, p<0.001),\nenabling predictive risk assessment. Our framework integrates three systems:\nHYDRA employing six optimization-aware perturbation strategies achieving 89.7%\nrisk discovery rates, RAVEN providing continuous production monitoring with\n92.9% precision and 93.8% recall across 1,748 scenarios, and APEX enabling\nrisk-aware optimization maintaining 96.6% baseline performance while reducing\nlatent risks by 59.2%. Evaluation across three testbed environments\ndemonstrates strong statistical validation with large effect sizes (Cohen\nd>2.0) and exceptional reproducibility (r>0.92). Production deployment over 24\nweeks shows 69.1% mean time to recovery reduction, 78.6% incident severity\nreduction, and 81 prevented incidents generating 1.44M USD average annual\nbenefits with 3.2-month ROI.

Current reliability engineering\nfocuses on reactive incident response rather than proactive detection of\noptimization-induced vulnerabilities. This paper presents the first\ncomprehensive framework for systematic latent risk detection, prevention, and\noptimization through integrated mathematical modeling, intelligent perturbation\ntesting, and risk-aware performance optimization. We introduce the Latent Risk\nIndex (LRI) that correlates strongly with incident severity (r=0.863, p<0.001),\nenabling predictive risk assessment. Our framework integrates three systems:\nHYDRA employing six optimization-aware perturbation strategies achieving 89.7%\nrisk discovery rates, RAVEN providing continuous production monitoring with\n92.9% precision and 93.8% recall across 1,748 scenarios, and APEX enabling\nrisk-aware optimization maintaining 96.6% baseline performance while reducing\nlatent risks by 59.2%. Evaluation across three testbed environments\ndemonstrates strong statistical validation with large effect sizes (Cohen\nd>2.0) and exceptional reproducibility (r>0.92). Production deployment over 24\nweeks shows 69.1% mean time to recovery reduction, 78.6% incident severity\nreduction, and 81 prevented incidents generating 1.44M USD average annual\nbenefits with 3.2-month ROI. Our approach transforms reliability engineering\nfrom reactive incident management to proactive risk-aware optimization."

We envision a future where\nInternet communication will be dominated by \"prompts\" sent to generative AI\nmodels. For this, we will need proxies that provide similar functions to HTTP\nproxies (e.g., caching, routing, compression) while dealing with unique\nchallenges and opportunities of prompt-based communication. As a first step\ntoward supporting prompt-based communication, we present LLMBridge, an LLM\nproxy designed for cost-conscious users, such as those in developing regions\nand education (e.g., students, instructors). LLMBridge supports three key\noptimizations: model selection (routing prompts to the most suitable model),\ncontext management (intelligently reducing the amount of context), and semantic\ncaching (serving prompts using local models and vector databases). These\noptimizations introduce trade-offs between cost and quality, which applications\nnavigate through a high-level, bidirectional interface. As case studies, we\ndeploy LLMBridge in two cost-sensitive settings: a WhatsApp-based Q&A service\nand a university classroom environment. The WhatsApp service has been live for\nover twelve months, serving 100+ users and handling more than 14.7K requests.\nIn parallel, we exposed LLMBridge to students across three computer science\ncourses over a semester, where it supported diverse LLM-powered applications -\nsuch as reasoning agents and chatbots - and handled an average of 500 requests\nper day. We report on deployment experiences across both settings and use the\ncollected workloads to benchmark the effectiveness of various cost-optimization\nstrategies, analyzing their trade-offs in cost, latency, and response quality.",

We envision a future where\nInternet communication will be dominated by \"prompts\" sent to generative AI\nmodels. For this, we will need proxies that provide similar functions to HTTP\nproxies (e.g., caching, routing, compression) while dealing with unique\nchallenges and opportunities of prompt-based communication. As a first step\ntoward supporting prompt-based communication, we present LLMBridge, an LLM\nproxy designed for cost-conscious users, such as those in developing regions\nand education (e.g., students, instructors). LLMBridge supports three key\noptimizations: model selection (routing prompts to the most suitable model),\ncontext management (intelligently reducing the amount of context), and semantic\ncaching (serving prompts using local models and vector databases). These\noptimizations introduce trade-offs between cost and quality, which applications\nnavigate through a high-level, bidirectional interface. As case studies, we\ndeploy LLMBridge in two cost-sensitive settings: a WhatsApp-based Q&A service\nand a university classroom environment. The WhatsApp service has been live for\nover twelve months, serving 100+ users and handling more than 14.7K requests.\nIn parallel, we exposed LLMBridge to students across three computer science\ncourses over a semester, where it supported diverse LLM-powered applications -\nsuch as reasoning agents and chatbots - and handled an average of 500 requests\nper day. We report on deployment experiences across both settings and use the\ncollected workloads to benchmark the effectiveness of various cost-optimization\nstrategies, analyzing their trade-offs in cost, latency, and response quality."

This paper introduces VLA-Cache, a\ntraining-free inference acceleration method that reduces computational overhead\nby adaptively caching and reusing static visual tokens across frames.\nExploiting the temporal continuity in robotic manipulation, VLA-Cache\nidentifies minimally changed tokens between adjacent frames and reuses their\ncached key-value representations, thereby circumventing redundant computations.\nAdditionally, to maintain action precision, VLA-Cache selectively re-computes\ntask-relevant tokens that are environmentally sensitive, ensuring the fidelity\nof critical visual information. To further optimize efficiency, we introduce a\nlayer adaptive token reusing strategy that dynamically adjusts the reuse ratio\nbased on attention concentration across decoder layers, prioritizing critical\ntokens for recomputation. Extensive experiments on two simulation platforms\n(LIBERO and SIMPLER) and a real-world robotic system demonstrate that VLA-Cache\nachieves up to 1.7x speedup in CUDA latency and a 15% increase in control\nfrequency, with negligible loss on task success rate.

Cache-based surrogates\nuse already calculated simulation results to interpolate or extrapolate further\nsimulation output values. But this approach only pays off if the access time to\nretrieve the needed values is much faster than the actual simulation.

Nevertheless,\nminimizing the accuracy degradation caused by ultra-low-bit KV cache\nquantization remains a significant challenge. While scalar quantization is\nconstrained by 1-bit bound, vector quantization exploits intra-vector\ncorrelations and enables sub-bit regimes, making it more suitable for\nultra-low-bit quantization. To further mitigate quantization-induced\ndegradation, we reveal that the degradation is highly uneven across tokens in\nattention quality. To investigate this unevenness, we introduce anchor score to\nmeasure each token's sensitivity to quantization. Our analysis and experiments\nshow that preserving a small subset (1\\%) of tokens with the highest Anchor\nScore significantly mitigates accuracy loss under aggressive quantization.\n  We propose AnTKV, a dual-stage framework that leverages anchor token-aware\nvector quantization to compress the KV cache. It combines offline token-aware\ncentroids learning and online anchor token selection to balance compression and\naccuracy. To enable efficient deployment, we design an online anchor token\nselection kernel compatible with FlashAttention. It allows LLaMA3-8B to scale\nto 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100, while delivering up to $3.5\\times$ higher\ndecoding throughput over the FP16 baseline.

We present Hive hash table, a\nhigh-performance, warp-cooperative and dynamically resizable GPU hash table\nthat adapts to varying workloads without global rehashing.\n  Hive hash table makes three key contributions. First, a cache-aligned packed\nbucket layout stores key-value pairs as 64-bit words, enabling coalesced memory\naccess and atomic updates via single-CAS operations. Second, warp-synchronous\nconcurrency protocols - Warp-Aggregated-Bitmask-Claim (WABC) and\nWarp-Cooperative Match-and-Elect (WCME) - reduce contention to one atomic\noperation per warp while ensuring lock-free progress. Third, a\nload-factor-aware dynamic resizing strategy expands or contracts capacity in\nwarp-parallel K-bucket batches using linear hashing, maintaining balanced\noccupancy. To handle insertions under heavy contention, Hive hash table employs\na four-step strategy: replace, claim-and-commit, bounded cuckoo eviction, and\noverflow-stash fallback. This design provides lock-free fast paths and bounded\nrecovery cost under contention determined by a fixed eviction depth, while\neliminating ABA hazards during concurrent updates.\n  Experimental evaluation on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 shows Hive hash table sustains\nload factors up to 95% while delivering 1.5-2x higher throughput than\nstate-of-the-art GPU hash tables (Slab-Hash, DyCuckoo, WarpCore) under mixed\ninsert-delete-lookup workloads.

To address these\nchallenges, xLLM builds a novel decoupled service-engine architecture. At the\nservice layer, xLLM-Service features an intelligent scheduling module that\nefficiently processes multimodal requests and co-locates online and offline\ntasks through unified elastic scheduling to maximize cluster utilization. This\nmodule also relies on a workload-adaptive dynamic Prefill-Decode (PD)\ndisaggregation policy and a novel Encode-Prefill-Decode (EPD) disaggregation\npolicy designed for multimodal inputs. Furthermore, it incorporates a\ndistributed architecture to provide global KV Cache management and robust\nfault-tolerant capabilities for high availability. At the engine layer,\nxLLM-Engine co-optimizes system and algorithm designs to fully saturate\ncomputing resources. This is achieved through comprehensive multi-layer\nexecution pipeline optimizations, an adaptive graph mode and an xTensor memory\nmanagement. xLLM-Engine also further integrates algorithmic enhancements such\nas optimized speculative decoding and dynamic EPLB, collectively serving to\nsubstantially boost throughput and inference efficiency. Extensive evaluations\ndemonstrate that xLLM delivers significantly superior performance and resource\nefficiency. Under identical TPOT constraints, xLLM achieves throughput up to\n1.7x that of MindIE and 2.2x that of vLLM-Ascend with Qwen-series models, while\nmaintaining an average throughput of 1.7x that of MindIE with Deepseek-series\nmodels. xLLM framework is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/jd-opensource/xllm and\nhttps://github.com/jd-opensource/xllm-service.",

We revisit test-time behavior and uncover a simple yet\nunderexplored phenomenon: reasoning uncertainty is highly localized-only a\nsmall subset of high-entropy tokens dominantly affects output correctness.\nMotivated by this, we propose Minimal Test-Time Intervention (MTI), a\ntraining-free framework that enhances reasoning accuracy and stability with\nminimal overhead. MTI includes: (i) Selective CFG intervention, applying\nclassifier-free guidance only at uncertain positions; and (ii) Lightweight\nnegative-prompt guidance, reusing the main model's KV cache to approximate\nunconditional decoding efficiently. MTI yields consistent gains across general,\ncoding, and STEM tasks-e.g., +1.35% average improvement on eight benchmarks for\nQwen3-8B-Base and +5% on AIME2024 using Qwen3-32B-Reasoning-while remaining\nhighly efficient.",

                    "value": "Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has focused on test-time\nscaling to improve reasoning via increased inference computation, but often at\nthe cost of efficiency. We revisit test-time behavior and uncover a simple yet\nunderexplored phenomenon: reasoning uncertainty is highly localized-only a\nsmall subset of high-entropy tokens dominantly affects output correctness.\nMotivated by this, we propose Minimal Test-Time Intervention (MTI), a\ntraining-free framework that enhances reasoning accuracy and stability with\nminimal overhead. MTI includes: (i) Selective CFG intervention, applying\nclassifier-free guidance only at uncertain positions; and (ii) Lightweight\nnegative-prompt guidance, reusing the main model's KV cache to approximate\nunconditional decoding efficiently. MTI yields consistent gains across general,\ncoding, and STEM tasks-e.g., +1.35% average improvement on eight benchmarks for\nQwen3-8B-Base and +5% on AIME2024 using Qwen3-32B-Reasoning-while remaining\nhighly efficient."

Long video generation presents\nchallenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing\nmodels can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to\nbidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for\nfaster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory\nchallenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based\ngeneration, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are\ncritical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in\nreal time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,\nespecially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt\ntransitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level\nAR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states\nwith new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable\nlong video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);\nand short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as\nframe sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.\nWith these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model\nto minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains\n20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both\nshort and long videos.

Humans,\non the other hand, reason and plan by mentally simulating the consequences of\nactions within an internal model of the world -- a capability that supports\nflexible, goal-directed behavior across diverse contexts. Moving towards a more\ngeneral and powerful AI agent, we introduce SimuRA, a goal-oriented\narchitecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based on a principled\nformulation of an optimal agent in any general environment, SimuRA addresses\nthe limitations of black-box autoregressive reasoning by incorporating the\nworld model for planning via simulation. Our prototype world model is\nimplemented using LLMs as a substrate, leveraging the natural language as a\ndiscrete, hierarchical representation grounded in concepts for planning, while\nremaining model-agnostic. On complex web-browsing tasks such as flight search,\nSimuRA improves the success rate from 0% to 32.2% compared to a representative\nopen-web agent baseline. Across tasks, world-model-based planning achieves up\nto 124% higher task completion rates than a matched black-box autoregressive\nbaseline, demonstrating the advantages of simulative reasoning. We release\nReasonerAgent-Web, a web-browsing agent built on SimuRA, as an open-source\nresearch demo.",

Humans,\non the other hand, reason and plan by mentally simulating the consequences of\nactions within an internal model of the world -- a capability that supports\nflexible, goal-directed behavior across diverse contexts. Moving towards a more\ngeneral and powerful AI agent, we introduce SimuRA, a goal-oriented\narchitecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based on a principled\nformulation of an optimal agent in any general environment, SimuRA addresses\nthe limitations of black-box autoregressive reasoning by incorporating the\nworld model for planning via simulation. Our prototype world model is\nimplemented using LLMs as a substrate, leveraging the natural language as a\ndiscrete, hierarchical representation grounded in concepts for planning, while\nremaining model-agnostic. On complex web-browsing tasks such as flight search,\nSimuRA improves the success rate from 0% to 32.2% compared to a representative\nopen-web agent baseline. Across tasks, world-model-based planning achieves up\nto 124% higher task completion rates than a matched black-box autoregressive\nbaseline, demonstrating the advantages of simulative reasoning. We release\nReasonerAgent-Web, a web-browsing agent built on SimuRA, as an open-source\nresearch demo."

With the rapid growth of AI-driven workloads,\nsuch fluctuations, along with fast ramp patterns, are expected to exacerbate\nstressed grid conditions and system instabilities. We consider a few\nopen-source AI data center consumption profiles from the MIT supercloud\ndatasets, along with generating a few experimental HPC job-distribution-based\ninference profiles. Subsequently, we develop analytical methodologies for\nreal-time assessment of grid stability, focusing on both transient and\nsmall-signal stability assessments. Energy-flow-like metrics for nonlinear\ntransient stability, formulated by computing localized data center bus\nkinetic-like flows and coupling interactions with neighboring buses over\nvarying time windows, help provide operators with real-time assessments of the\nregional grid stress in the data center hubs. On the other hand, small-signal\nstability metrics, constructed from analytical state matrices under variable\noperating conditions during a fast ramping period, enable snapshot-based\nassessments of data center load fluctuations and provide enhanced observability\ninto evolving grid conditions.

                    "value": "This paper investigates the dynamic interactions between large-scale data\ncenters and the power grid, focusing on reliability challenges arising from\nsudden fluctuations in demand. With the rapid growth of AI-driven workloads,\nsuch fluctuations, along with fast ramp patterns, are expected to exacerbate\nstressed grid conditions and system instabilities. We consider a few\nopen-source AI data center consumption profiles from the MIT supercloud\ndatasets, along with generating a few experimental HPC job-distribution-based\ninference profiles. Subsequently, we develop analytical methodologies for\nreal-time assessment of grid stability, focusing on both transient and\nsmall-signal stability assessments. Energy-flow-like metrics for nonlinear\ntransient stability, formulated by computing localized data center bus\nkinetic-like flows and coupling interactions with neighboring buses over\nvarying time windows, help provide operators with real-time assessments of the\nregional grid stress in the data center hubs. On the other hand, small-signal\nstability metrics, constructed from analytical state matrices under variable\noperating conditions during a fast ramping period, enable snapshot-based\nassessments of data center load fluctuations and provide enhanced observability\ninto evolving grid conditions. By quantifying the stability impacts of large\ndata center clusters, studies conducted in the modified IEEE benchmark $68-$bus\nmodel support improved operator situational awareness to capture risks in\nreliable integration of large data center loads."

                "summary": "Double radio relics, pairs of diffuse radio features located on opposite\nsides of merging galaxy clusters, are a rare subclass of radio relics that are\nbelieved to trace merger shocks and provide valuable constraints on plasma\nacceleration models and merger history. With the number of known double relics\ngrowing in recent and upcoming radio surveys, statistical analyses of their\nproperties are becoming feasible. In this study, we utilize the cosmological\nmagnetohydrodynamics zoom-in simulations TNG-Cluster, in combination with\nTNG300-1, to examine the statistical properties of double radio relics. The\nsimulated double relic pairs exhibit a wide range of luminosity ratios, broadly\nconsistent with the observations. We find that the two relics in a given double\nsystem often differ significantly in their shock properties and magnetic field\nstrengths.

With the number of known double relics\ngrowing in recent and upcoming radio surveys, statistical analyses of their\nproperties are becoming feasible. In this study, we utilize the cosmological\nmagnetohydrodynamics zoom-in simulations TNG-Cluster, in combination with\nTNG300-1, to examine the statistical properties of double radio relics. The\nsimulated double relic pairs exhibit a wide range of luminosity ratios, broadly\nconsistent with the observations.

At each\niteration, this procedure minimizes a regularized Fisher divergence to match\nthe scores of the variational and target densities at a batch of samples drawn\nfrom the current approximation. This minimization reduces to a convex quadratic\nprogram, and we prove under general conditions that these updates converge\nexponentially fast to a near-optimal weighting of experts.

To contribute to this line of\nresearch, we introduce SloPragEval and SloPragMega, the first pragmatics\nunderstanding benchmarks for Slovene that contain altogether 405\nmultiple-choice questions. We discuss the difficulties of translation, describe\nthe campaign to establish a human baseline, and report pilot evaluations with\nLLMs. Our results indicate that current models have greatly improved in\nunderstanding nuanced language but may still fail to infer implied speaker\nmeaning in non-literal utterances, especially those that are culture-specific.\nWe also observe a significant gap between proprietary and open-source models.\nFinally, we argue that benchmarks targeting nuanced language understanding and\nknowledge of the target culture must be designed with care, preferably\nconstructed from native data, and validated with human responses."

RL workflows involve\ninterleaving rollout and training stages with fundamentally different resource\nrequirements. Rollout typically dominates overall execution time, yet scales\nefficiently through multiple independent instances. In contrast, training\nrequires tightly-coupled GPUs with full-mesh communication. Existing RL\nframeworks fall into two categories: co-located and disaggregated\narchitectures. Co-located ones fail to address this resource tension by forcing\nboth stages to share the same GPUs. Disaggregated architectures, without\nmodifications of well-established RL algorithms, suffer from resource\nunder-utilization. Meanwhile, preemptible GPU resources, i.e., spot instances\non public clouds and spare capacity in production clusters, present significant\ncost-saving opportunities for accelerating RL workflows, if efficiently\nharvested for rollout.\n  In this paper, we present RLBoost, a systematic solution for cost-efficient\nRL training that harvests preemptible GPU resources. Our key insight is that\nrollout's stateless and embarrassingly parallel nature aligns perfectly with\npreemptible and often fragmented resources. To efficiently utilize these\nresources despite frequent and unpredictable availability changes, RLBoost\nadopts a hybrid architecture with three key techniques: (1) adaptive rollout\noffload to dynamically adjust workloads on the reserved (on-demand) cluster,\n(2) pull-based weight transfer that quickly provisions newly available\ninstances, and (3) token-level response collection and migration for efficient\npreemption handling and continuous load balancing. Extensive experiments show\nRLBoost increases training throughput by 1.51x-1.97x while improving cost\nefficiency by 28%-49% compared to using only on-demand GPU resources.",

A common mitigation strategy is to update the\nmodel more strongly on examples deemed safe, while downweighting or excluding\nthose flagged as unsafe. However, because safety context can shift within a\nsingle example, updating the model equally on both harmful and harmless parts\nof a response is suboptimal-a coarse treatment we term static safety shaping.\nIn contrast, we propose dynamic safety shaping (DSS), a framework that uses\nfine-grained safety signals to reinforce learning from safe segments of a\nresponse while suppressing unsafe content. To enable such fine-grained control\nduring finetuning, we introduce a key insight: guardrail models, traditionally\nused for filtering, can be repurposed to evaluate partial responses, tracking\nhow safety risk evolves throughout the response, segment by segment. This leads\nto the Safety Trajectory Assessment of Response (STAR), a token-level signal\nthat enables shaping to operate dynamically over the training sequence.\nBuilding on this, we present STAR-DSS, guided by STAR scores, that robustly\nmitigates finetuning risks and delivers substantial safety improvements across\ndiverse threats, datasets, and model families-all without compromising\ncapability on intended tasks. We encourage future safety research to build on\ndynamic shaping principles for stronger mitigation against evolving finetuning\nrisks.

To enable such fine-grained control\nduring finetuning, we introduce a key insight: guardrail models, traditionally\nused for filtering, can be repurposed to evaluate partial responses, tracking\nhow safety risk evolves throughout the response, segment by segment. This leads\nto the Safety Trajectory Assessment of Response (STAR), a token-level signal\nthat enables shaping to operate dynamically over the training sequence.\nBuilding on this, we present STAR-DSS, guided by STAR scores, that robustly\nmitigates finetuning risks and delivers substantial safety improvements across\ndiverse threats, datasets, and model families-all without compromising\ncapability on intended tasks. We encourage future safety research to build on\ndynamic shaping principles for stronger mitigation against evolving finetuning\nrisks.

We introduce zip2zip, a novel\nmethod for achieving context-adaptive tokenization in LLMs at inference time.\nLeveraging an online data compression algorithm (Lempel-Ziv-Welch), zip2zip\ndynamically expands its active vocabulary at inference time by continuously\nreplacing fragmented token sequences with more compact hypertokens, which it\ncan immediately output during generation. In doing so, the model refines its\ninternal tokenization scheme to match the token distribution of the current\ncontext, reducing redundancy and improving representational efficiency. zip2zip\nconsists of three key components: (1) a tokenizer based on Lempel-Ziv-Welch\ncompression that incrementally merges co-occurring tokens into reusable\nhypertokens on the fly; (2) a dynamic embedding (and unembedding) layer that\ncomputes embeddings for newly formed hypertokens at runtime; and (3) a variant\nof autoregressive language modeling that pretrains the model to handle\nhypertokenized, compressed text sequences as inputs and outputs.

The core of our\napproach is a lightweight LDM architecture specifically designed for channel\nestimation, which serves as a powerful generative prior to capture the\nintricate channel distribution. Furthermore, we enhance the diffusion posterior\nsampling process by introducing an effective approximation for the likelihood\nterm and a tailored self-consistency constraint on the variational autoencoder\nlatent space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PSLD-CE\nconsistently outperforms a wide range of existing methods. Notably, these\nsignificant performance gains are achieved while maintaining low computational\ncomplexity and fast inference speed, establishing our method as a highly\npromising and practical solution for next-generation wireless systems.",

                    "value": "Deep generative models offer a powerful alternative to conventional channel\nestimation by learning the complex prior distribution of wireless channels.\nCapitalizing on this potential, this paper proposes a novel channel estimation\nalgorithm based on latent diffusion models (LDMs), termed posterior sampling\nwith latent diffusion for channel estimation (PSLD-CE). The core of our\napproach is a lightweight LDM architecture specifically designed for channel\nestimation, which serves as a powerful generative prior to capture the\nintricate channel distribution. Furthermore, we enhance the diffusion posterior\nsampling process by introducing an effective approximation for the likelihood\nterm and a tailored self-consistency constraint on the variational autoencoder\nlatent space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PSLD-CE\nconsistently outperforms a wide range of existing methods. Notably, these\nsignificant performance gains are achieved while maintaining low computational\ncomplexity and fast inference speed, establishing our method as a highly\npromising and practical solution for next-generation wireless systems."

We seek to address this challenge by\napplying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document\nlimitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from\nGlacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor\nseals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping\n(HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME),\nand perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes\nrelevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution\nregions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii)\nfaithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector\nconfidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal\nsystematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours\nrather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection\nconfidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also\nuncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black\nice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model\ndevelopment, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing\nobject detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond \"black-box\"\npredictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation\nmonitoring.",

We seek to address this challenge by\napplying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document\nlimitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from\nGlacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor\nseals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping\n(HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME),\nand perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes\nrelevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution\nregions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii)\nfaithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector\nconfidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal\nsystematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours\nrather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection\nconfidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also\nuncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black\nice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model\ndevelopment, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing\nobject detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond \"black-box\"\npredictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation\nmonitoring."

While current\nDNA foundation models excel at representing sequences, they struggle with\nmulti-step reasoning and lack transparent, biologically meaningful\nexplanations. BioReason addresses this by tightly integrating a DNA foundation\nmodel with a large language model (LLM), enabling the LLM to directly interpret\nand reason over genomic information. Through supervised fine-tuning and\nreinforcement learning, BioReason learns to produce logical, biologically\ncoherent deductions. It achieves major performance gains, boosting KEGG-based\ndisease pathway prediction accuracy from 86% to 98% and improving variant\neffect prediction by an average of 15% over strong baselines.

                    "value": "Unlocking deep and interpretable biological reasoning from complex genomic\ndata remains a major AI challenge limiting scientific progress. While current\nDNA foundation models excel at representing sequences, they struggle with\nmulti-step reasoning and lack transparent, biologically meaningful\nexplanations. BioReason addresses this by tightly integrating a DNA foundation\nmodel with a large language model (LLM), enabling the LLM to directly interpret\nand reason over genomic information. Through supervised fine-tuning and\nreinforcement learning, BioReason learns to produce logical, biologically\ncoherent deductions. It achieves major performance gains, boosting KEGG-based\ndisease pathway prediction accuracy from 86% to 98% and improving variant\neffect prediction by an average of 15% over strong baselines.

                "summary": "Knowledge distillation is a promising approach to transfer capabilities from\ncomplex teacher models to smaller, resource-efficient student models that can\nbe deployed easily, particularly in task-aware scenarios. However, existing\nmethods of task-aware distillation typically require substantial quantities of\ndata which may be unavailable or expensive to obtain in many practical\nscenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel\nstrategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for\nfew-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing\ncounterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs\nthat can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum\nperturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the\nteacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide\ntheoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from\nboth statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs\ncan improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near\nthe teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs\neffectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's\ndecision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments\nacross various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard\ndistillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples). Notably,\nCoD only uses half of the original samples used by the baselines, paired with\ntheir corresponding CFEs and still improves performance.",

                    "value": "Knowledge distillation is a promising approach to transfer capabilities from\ncomplex teacher models to smaller, resource-efficient student models that can\nbe deployed easily, particularly in task-aware scenarios. However, existing\nmethods of task-aware distillation typically require substantial quantities of\ndata which may be unavailable or expensive to obtain in many practical\nscenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel\nstrategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for\nfew-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing\ncounterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs\nthat can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum\nperturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the\nteacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide\ntheoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from\nboth statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs\ncan improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near\nthe teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs\neffectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's\ndecision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments\nacross various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard\ndistillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples). Notably,\nCoD only uses half of the original samples used by the baselines, paired with\ntheir corresponding CFEs and still improves performance."

Furthermore, to utilize computational resources more\nefficiently, we introduce a sparse-to-dense video TTS strategy that improves\ninference by iteratively adding frames based on output consistency. We validate\nour approach on multiple video reasoning benchmarks, showing that Video-RTS\nsurpasses existing video reasoning models by 2.4% in accuracy using only 3.6%\ntraining samples.

However, current systems\nremain fundamentally constrained to textual web data, overlooking the vast\nknowledge embedded in multimodal documents Processing such documents demands\nsophisticated parsing to preserve visual semantics (figures, tables, charts,\nand equations), intelligent chunking to maintain structural coherence, and\nadaptive retrieval across modalities, which are capabilities absent in existing\nsystems. In response, we present Doc-Researcher, a unified system that bridges\nthis gap through three integrated components: (i) deep multimodal parsing that\npreserves layout structure and visual semantics while creating multi-granular\nrepresentations from chunk to document level, (ii) systematic retrieval\narchitecture supporting text-only, vision-only, and hybrid paradigms with\ndynamic granularity selection, and (iii) iterative multi-agent workflows that\ndecompose complex queries, progressively accumulate evidence, and synthesize\ncomprehensive answers across documents and modalities. To enable rigorous\nevaluation, we introduce M4DocBench, the first benchmark for Multi-modal,\nMulti-hop, Multi-document, and Multi-turn deep research. Featuring 158\nexpert-annotated questions with complete evidence chains across 304 documents,\nM4DocBench tests capabilities that existing benchmarks cannot assess.\nExperiments demonstrate that Doc-Researcher achieves 50.6% accuracy, 3.4xbetter\nthan state-of-the-art baselines, validating that effective document research\nrequires not just better retrieval, but fundamentally deep parsing that\npreserve multimodal integrity and support iterative research. Our work\nestablishes a new paradigm for conducting deep research on multimodal document\ncollections.",

                    "value": "Deep Research systems have revolutionized how LLMs solve complex questions\nthrough iterative reasoning and evidence gathering. However, current systems\nremain fundamentally constrained to textual web data, overlooking the vast\nknowledge embedded in multimodal documents Processing such documents demands\nsophisticated parsing to preserve visual semantics (figures, tables, charts,\nand equations), intelligent chunking to maintain structural coherence, and\nadaptive retrieval across modalities, which are capabilities absent in existing\nsystems. In response, we present Doc-Researcher, a unified system that bridges\nthis gap through three integrated components: (i) deep multimodal parsing that\npreserves layout structure and visual semantics while creating multi-granular\nrepresentations from chunk to document level, (ii) systematic retrieval\narchitecture supporting text-only, vision-only, and hybrid paradigms with\ndynamic granularity selection, and (iii) iterative multi-agent workflows that\ndecompose complex queries, progressively accumulate evidence, and synthesize\ncomprehensive answers across documents and modalities. To enable rigorous\nevaluation, we introduce M4DocBench, the first benchmark for Multi-modal,\nMulti-hop, Multi-document, and Multi-turn deep research. Featuring 158\nexpert-annotated questions with complete evidence chains across 304 documents,\nM4DocBench tests capabilities that existing benchmarks cannot assess.\nExperiments demonstrate that Doc-Researcher achieves 50.6% accuracy, 3.4xbetter\nthan state-of-the-art baselines, validating that effective document research\nrequires not just better retrieval, but fundamentally deep parsing that\npreserve multimodal integrity and support iterative research. Our work\nestablishes a new paradigm for conducting deep research on multimodal document\ncollections."

This preference distribution shift leads to catastrophic\nalignment failures in many real-world applications. We address this problem\nusing the principled framework of distributionally robust optimization, and\ndevelop two novel distributionally robust direct preference optimization (DPO)\nalgorithms, namely, Wasserstein DPO (WDPO) and Kullback-Leibler DPO (KLDPO). We\ncharacterize the sample complexity of learning the optimal policy parameters\nfor WDPO and KLDPO. Moreover, we propose scalable gradient descent-style\nlearning algorithms by developing suitable approximations for the challenging\nminimax loss functions of WDPO and KLDPO. Our empirical experiments using\nbenchmark data sets and LLMs demonstrate the superior performance of WDPO and\nKLDPO in substantially improving the alignment when there is a preference\ndistribution shift.",

This preference distribution shift leads to catastrophic\nalignment failures in many real-world applications. We address this problem\nusing the principled framework of distributionally robust optimization, and\ndevelop two novel distributionally robust direct preference optimization (DPO)\nalgorithms, namely, Wasserstein DPO (WDPO) and Kullback-Leibler DPO (KLDPO). We\ncharacterize the sample complexity of learning the optimal policy parameters\nfor WDPO and KLDPO. Moreover, we propose scalable gradient descent-style\nlearning algorithms by developing suitable approximations for the challenging\nminimax loss functions of WDPO and KLDPO. Our empirical experiments using\nbenchmark data sets and LLMs demonstrate the superior performance of WDPO and\nKLDPO in substantially improving the alignment when there is a preference\ndistribution shift."

In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs\nexhibit sensitivity to linguistic genera by extending prior analyses on the\nMultiQ dataset. We first check if models prefer to switch to genealogically\nrelated languages when prompt language fidelity is not maintained. Next, we\ninvestigate whether knowledge consistency is better preserved within than\nacross genera. We show that genus-level effects are present but strongly\nconditioned by training resource availability. We further observe distinct\nmultilingual strategies across LLMs families. Our findings suggest that LLMs\nencode aspects of genus-level structure, but training data imbalances remain\nthe primary factor shaping their multilingual performance."

The results of the six-stages evaluation show that the proposed trust\nmeasurement instrument is empirically reliable and valid for systematically\nmeasuring and comparing non-experts' trust in AI Medical Support Systems."

Although drones provide a flexible and effective tool for PDRA,\nrouting them in large-scale networks remains challenging. Traditional\noptimization methods scale poorly and demand domain expertise, while existing\ndeep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches adopt a single-task paradigm,\nrequiring separate models for each problem variant and lacking adaptability to\nevolving operational needs. This study proposes a unified model (UM) for drone\nrouting that simultaneously addresses eight PDRA variants. By training a single\nneural network across multiple problem configurations, UM captures shared\nstructural knowledge while adapting to variant-specific constraints through a\nmodern transformer encoder-decoder architecture. A lightweight adapter\nmechanism further enables efficient finetuning to unseen attributes without\nretraining, enhancing deployment flexibility in dynamic disaster scenarios.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the UM reduces training time and\nparameters by a factor of eight compared with training separate models, while\nconsistently outperforming single-task DRL methods by 6--14\\% and traditional\noptimization approaches by 24--82\\% in terms of solution quality (total\ncollected information value). The model achieves real-time solutions (1--10\nseconds) across networks of up to 1,000 nodes, with robustness confirmed\nthrough sensitivity analyses. Moreover, finetuning experiments show that unseen\nattributes can be effectively incorporated with minimal cost while retaining\nhigh solution quality.

Across the board, users rated beginner-level messages as more\neffective when they were longer, while expert-level messages were rated\nmarginally more effective when they were shorter.

However, because safety context can shift within a\nsingle example, updating the model equally on both harmful and harmless parts\nof a response is suboptimal-a coarse treatment we term static safety shaping.\nIn contrast, we propose dynamic safety shaping (DSS), a framework that uses\nfine-grained safety signals to reinforce learning from safe segments of a\nresponse while suppressing unsafe content. To enable such fine-grained control\nduring finetuning, we introduce a key insight: guardrail models, traditionally\nused for filtering, can be repurposed to evaluate partial responses, tracking\nhow safety risk evolves throughout the response, segment by segment. This leads\nto the Safety Trajectory Assessment of Response (STAR), a token-level signal\nthat enables shaping to operate dynamically over the training sequence.\nBuilding on this, we present STAR-DSS, guided by STAR scores, that robustly\nmitigates finetuning risks and delivers substantial safety improvements across\ndiverse threats, datasets, and model families-all without compromising\ncapability on intended tasks. We encourage future safety research to build on\ndynamic shaping principles for stronger mitigation against evolving finetuning\nrisks.

This leads\nto the Safety Trajectory Assessment of Response (STAR), a token-level signal\nthat enables shaping to operate dynamically over the training sequence.\nBuilding on this, we present STAR-DSS, guided by STAR scores, that robustly\nmitigates finetuning risks and delivers substantial safety improvements across\ndiverse threats, datasets, and model families-all without compromising\ncapability on intended tasks. We encourage future safety research to build on\ndynamic shaping principles for stronger mitigation against evolving finetuning\nrisks.

It is worth noting that, the operation of mechanical\nequipment is accompanied by changes in factors such as speed and load, leading\nto significant differences in data distribution, which pose challenges for\nfault diagnosis. Additionally, in terms of application deployment, commonly\nused cloud-based fault diagnosis methods often encounter issues such as time\ndelays and data security concerns, while common fault diagnosis methods cannot\nbe directly applied to edge computing devices. Therefore, conducting fault\ndiagnosis under cross-operating conditions based on edge computing holds\nsignificant research value. This paper proposes a domain-adaptation-based\nlightweight fault diagnosis framework tailored for edge computing scenarios.\nIncorporating the local maximum mean discrepancy into knowledge transfer aligns\nthe feature distributions of different domains in a high-dimensional feature\nspace, to discover a common feature space across domains. The acquired fault\ndiagnosis expertise from the cloud-based deep neural network model is\ntransferred to the lightweight edge-based model (edge model) using adaptation\nknowledge transfer methods. It aims to achieve accurate fault diagnosis under\ncross-working conditions while ensuring real-time diagnosis capabilities. We\nutilized the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX kit as the edge computing platform and\nconducted validation experiments on two devices. In terms of diagnostic\nperformance, the proposed method significantly improved diagnostic accuracy,\nwith average increases of 34.44% and 17.33% compared to existing methods,\nrespectively.",

Additionally, in terms of application deployment, commonly\nused cloud-based fault diagnosis methods often encounter issues such as time\ndelays and data security concerns, while common fault diagnosis methods cannot\nbe directly applied to edge computing devices. Therefore, conducting fault\ndiagnosis under cross-operating conditions based on edge computing holds\nsignificant research value. This paper proposes a domain-adaptation-based\nlightweight fault diagnosis framework tailored for edge computing scenarios.\nIncorporating the local maximum mean discrepancy into knowledge transfer aligns\nthe feature distributions of different domains in a high-dimensional feature\nspace, to discover a common feature space across domains. The acquired fault\ndiagnosis expertise from the cloud-based deep neural network model is\ntransferred to the lightweight edge-based model (edge model) using adaptation\nknowledge transfer methods. It aims to achieve accurate fault diagnosis under\ncross-working conditions while ensuring real-time diagnosis capabilities. We\nutilized the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX kit as the edge computing platform and\nconducted validation experiments on two devices. In terms of diagnostic\nperformance, the proposed method significantly improved diagnostic accuracy,\nwith average increases of 34.44% and 17.33% compared to existing methods,\nrespectively."

Iterative, feedback-based\nmethods partially address these, but they are limited to local search,\nhindering the discovery of a global optimum. This paper introduces REvolution,\na framework that combines Evolutionary Computation (EC) with LLMs for automatic\nRTL generation and optimization. REvolution evolves a population of candidates\nin parallel, each defined by a design strategy, RTL implementation, and\nevaluation feedback.

We propose ACTMED\n(Adaptive Clinical Test selection via Model-based Experimental Design), a\ndiagnostic framework that integrates Bayesian Experimental Design (BED) with\nlarge language models (LLMs) to better emulate real-world diagnostic reasoning.\nAt each step, ACTMED selects the test expected to yield the greatest reduction\nin diagnostic uncertainty for a given patient. LLMs act as flexible simulators,\ngenerating plausible patient state distributions and supporting belief updates\nwithout requiring structured, task-specific training data. Clinicians can\nremain in the loop; reviewing test suggestions, interpreting intermediate\noutputs, and applying clinical judgment throughout. We evaluate ACTMED on\nreal-world datasets and show it can optimize test selection to improve\ndiagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use. This represents a step\ntoward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned diagnostic systems that\ngeneralize across settings with reduced reliance on domain-specific data.",

                    "value": "There is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to support clinical\ndiagnosis, but most approaches rely on static, fully observed datasets and fail\nto reflect the sequential, resource-aware reasoning clinicians use in practice.\nDiagnosis remains complex and error prone, especially in high-pressure or\nresource-limited settings, underscoring the need for frameworks that help\nclinicians make timely and cost-effective decisions. We propose ACTMED\n(Adaptive Clinical Test selection via Model-based Experimental Design), a\ndiagnostic framework that integrates Bayesian Experimental Design (BED) with\nlarge language models (LLMs) to better emulate real-world diagnostic reasoning.\nAt each step, ACTMED selects the test expected to yield the greatest reduction\nin diagnostic uncertainty for a given patient. LLMs act as flexible simulators,\ngenerating plausible patient state distributions and supporting belief updates\nwithout requiring structured, task-specific training data. Clinicians can\nremain in the loop; reviewing test suggestions, interpreting intermediate\noutputs, and applying clinical judgment throughout. We evaluate ACTMED on\nreal-world datasets and show it can optimize test selection to improve\ndiagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use. This represents a step\ntoward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned diagnostic systems that\ngeneralize across settings with reduced reliance on domain-specific data."

Autonomous flight can facilitate the application of UAVs and reduce\noperator strain. However, autonomous systems usually require special\nprogramming interfaces, custom sensor setups, and strong onboard computers,\nwhich limits a broader deployment.\n  We present a system for autonomous flight using lightweight consumer-grade\nDJI drones. They are controlled by an Android app for state estimation and\nobstacle avoidance directly running on the UAV's remote control. Our ground\ncontrol station enables a single operator to configure and supervise multiple\nheterogeneous UAVs at once. Furthermore, it combines the observations of all\nUAVs into a joint 3D environment model for improved situational awareness.",
