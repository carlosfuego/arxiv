                "summary": "Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is a critical security mechanism\nfor BGP, but the complexity of its architecture is a growing concern as its\nadoption scales. Current RPKI design heavily reuses legacy PKI components, such\nas X.509 EE-certificates, ASN.1 encoding, and XML-based repository protocols,\nall these introduce excessive cryptographic validation, redundant metadata, and\ninefficiencies in both storage and processing. We show that these design\nchoices, although based on established standards, create significant\nperformance bottlenecks, increase the vulnerability surface, and hinder\nscalability for wide-scale Internet deployment.\n  In this paper, we perform the first systematic analysis of the root causes of\ncomplexity in RPKI's design and experimentally quantify their real-world\nimpact. We show that over 70% of validation time in RPKI relying parties is\nspent on certificate parsing and signature verification, much of it\nunnecessary. Building on this insight, we introduce the improved RPKI (iRPKI),\na backwards-compatible redesign that preserves all security guarantees while\nsubstantially reducing protocol overhead. iRPKI eliminates EE-certificates and\nROA signatures, merges revocation and integrity objects, replaces verbose\nencodings with Protobuf, and restructures repository metadata for more\nefficient access. We experimentally demonstrate that our implementation of\niRPKI in the Routinator validator achieves a 20x speed-up of processing time,\n18x improvement of bandwidth requirements and 8x reduction in cache memory\nfootprint, while also eliminating classes of vulnerabilities that have led to\nat least 10 vulnerabilities in RPKI software. iRPKI significantly increases the\nfeasibility of deploying RPKI at scale in the Internet, and especially in\nconstrained environments. Our design may be deployed incrementally without\nimpacting existing operations.",

                    "value": "Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is a critical security mechanism\nfor BGP, but the complexity of its architecture is a growing concern as its\nadoption scales. Current RPKI design heavily reuses legacy PKI components, such\nas X.509 EE-certificates, ASN.1 encoding, and XML-based repository protocols,\nall these introduce excessive cryptographic validation, redundant metadata, and\ninefficiencies in both storage and processing. We show that these design\nchoices, although based on established standards, create significant\nperformance bottlenecks, increase the vulnerability surface, and hinder\nscalability for wide-scale Internet deployment.\n  In this paper, we perform the first systematic analysis of the root causes of\ncomplexity in RPKI's design and experimentally quantify their real-world\nimpact. We show that over 70% of validation time in RPKI relying parties is\nspent on certificate parsing and signature verification, much of it\nunnecessary. Building on this insight, we introduce the improved RPKI (iRPKI),\na backwards-compatible redesign that preserves all security guarantees while\nsubstantially reducing protocol overhead. iRPKI eliminates EE-certificates and\nROA signatures, merges revocation and integrity objects, replaces verbose\nencodings with Protobuf, and restructures repository metadata for more\nefficient access. We experimentally demonstrate that our implementation of\niRPKI in the Routinator validator achieves a 20x speed-up of processing time,\n18x improvement of bandwidth requirements and 8x reduction in cache memory\nfootprint, while also eliminating classes of vulnerabilities that have led to\nat least 10 vulnerabilities in RPKI software. iRPKI significantly increases the\nfeasibility of deploying RPKI at scale in the Internet, and especially in\nconstrained environments. Our design may be deployed incrementally without\nimpacting existing operations."

To further accelerate FT convergence and\nimprove computing efficiency, PAE MobiLLM integrates activation caching on the\nserver side, which allows the server to reuse historical activations and saves\nthe mobile device from repeatedly computing forward passes for the recurring\ndata samples. Besides, to reduce communication cost, PAE MobiLLM develops a\none-token (i.e., ``pivot'' token) activation shortcut that transmits only a\nsingle activation dimension instead of full activation matrices to guide the\nside network tuning. Last but not least, PAE MobiLLM introduces the additive\nadapter side-network design which makes the server train the adapter modules\nbased on device-defined prediction differences rather than raw ground-truth\nlabels.

X-ray diffraction\nanalysis confirmed the single-phase formation of perovskite 65PMN-35PT with a\ntetragonal structure. Morphological studies indicated that the sample consisted\nof small grains with a size of about 2 micro-m. The dielectric properties of\nthe material demonstrate its relaxor behavior near the ferroelectric transition\ntemperature, TC = 457 K.

However,\nwe have identified several persistent challenges in these frameworks, including\ndifficulties in algorithm reproduction and sharing, lack of new techniques, and\nhigh system overhead.

Enhancing the capacity,\ndensity, or bandwidth of these memories can unlock substantial performance\ngains; however, the recent stagnation of SRAM bit-cell scaling leads to\ninequivalent losses in compute density.\n  To address the challenges posed by SRAM's scaling and leakage power\nconsumption, this paper explores the potential CMOS+X integration of amorphous\noxide semiconductor (AOS) transistors in capacitive, persistent memory\ntopologies (e.g., 1T1C eDRAM, 2T0C/3T0C Gain Cell) as alternative cells in\nmulti-ported and high-bandwidth banked GPGPU memories. A detailed study of the\ndensity and energy tradeoffs of back-end-of-line (BEOL) integrated memories\nutilizing monolithic 3D (M3D)-integrated multiplexed arrays is conducted, while\naccounting for the macro-level limitations of integrating AOS candidate\nstructures proposed by the device community (an aspect often overlooked in\nprior work). By exploiting the short lifetime of register operands, we propose\na multi-ported AOS gain-cell capable of delivering 3x the read ports in ~76% of\nthe footprint of SRAM with over 70% lower standby power, enabling enhancements\nto compute capacity, such as larger warp sizes or processor counts.

PromptDSI follows the Prompt-based Continual Learning\n(PCL) framework, using learnable prompts to efficiently index new documents\nwithout accessing previous documents or queries. To improve retrieval latency,\nwe remove the initial forward pass of PCL, which otherwise greatly increases\ntraining and inference time, with a negligible trade-off in performance.\nAdditionally, we introduce a novel topic-aware prompt pool that employs neural\ntopic embeddings as fixed keys, eliminating the instability of prompt key\noptimization while maintaining competitive performance with existing PCL prompt\npools. In a challenging rehearsal-free continual learning setup, we demonstrate\nthat PromptDSI variants outperform rehearsal-based baselines, match the strong\ncache-based baseline in mitigating forgetting, and significantly improving\nretrieval performance on new corpora.",

This proximity effect can be mitigated by\nproximity effect correction provided that accurate and validated models of the\npoint-spread function of the electron scattering are available. Most works so\nfar considered a double-Gaussian model of the electron point-spread function,\nwhich is very inaccurate for modern electron-beam writers with high\nacceleration voltages. We present measurements of the process point-spread\nfunction for chemically semi-amplified resist on silicon and indium phosphide\nsubstrates using a 150 kV electron-beam lithography system. We find that the\ndouble-Gaussian model deviates from experiments by up to four orders of\nmagnitude.

Most works so\nfar considered a double-Gaussian model of the electron point-spread function,\nwhich is very inaccurate for modern electron-beam writers with high\nacceleration voltages.

Omniwise is model-agnostic and\nlightweight, achieving strong results even with a small 3B-parameter model. It\ncan predict key performance metrics, including memory bandwidth, cache hit\nrates, GFLOPs, and arithmetic intensity, directly from kernel code without the\nneed for code execution or profiling tools. Our approach achieves over 90% of\npredictions within 10% relative error on GPU kernels executed on AMD MI250 and\nMI300X architectures. In addition to the pipeline, we develop an online\ninference server and a Visual Studio Code plugin that seamlessly integrate\nLLM-based performance prediction into developers' workflows."

In a recent study, differences of up to a factor\nof 2 were found between the predicted survival of floating and adherent cells.\nThe present work aims to quantify the biases introduced by the simulation setup\nand the use of voxelized geometry in conjunction with the local effect model\nfor cell survival. The results show that simulated irradiation of a cell near\nthe surface with an incident beam matched to the cell dimensions results in\ndose values that are by a factor of about 50 lower than the dose to cells\ndeeper in the medium when irradiated with a Co-60 spectrum and lateral beam\ndimensions in the centimeter range. Furthermore, the number of ionizing photon\ninteractions in gold nanoparticles in a cell near the surface is lower by a\nfactor of about 2 than for cells at 5 mm and 1 cm depth. Using the average dose\nin voxels of size in the order of 200 nm for assessing cell survival with the\nlocal effect model (LEM) leads to an underestimation of the number of lesions\nfrom a single ionized AuNP by roughly two orders of magnitude and thus to an\noverestimation of cell survival. The effect of cell geometry on the survival\nrate was examined for approximate cell geometries and 100 kV x-ray irradiation,\nfor which the probability of photon interaction in gold nanoparticles is by\nmore than two orders of magnitude higher than for Co-60 irradiation. The\nresults show that the effects are negligible for 5 nm nanoparticles at the\nconcentration of AuNPs considered in preceding work. For 50 nm nanoparticles\nand thus a thousand times higher mass fraction of gold, significant reduction\nin cell survival is found, with a clear additional reduction predicted by the\nLEM as compared to the prediction based on mean dose to the nucleus.",

We observe that quantizing\nthe KV cache of different tokens has varying impacts on the quality of\nattention outputs. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we perform\nforward error propagation analysis on attention and propose the Anchor Score\n(AnS) that quantifies the sensitivity of each token's KV cache to\nquantization-induced error. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in AnS\nacross tokens, suggesting that preserving a small subset with full precision\n(FP16) of high-AnS tokens can greatly mitigate accuracy loss in aggressive\nquantization scenarios. Based on this insight, we introduce AnTKV, a novel\nframework that leverages Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization to compress the\nKV cache. Furthermore, to support efficient deployment, we design and develop a\ntriton kernel that is fully compatible with FlashAttention, enabling fast\nonline Anchor Token selection. AnTKV enables LLaMA-3-8B to handle context\nlengths up to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100 GPU, while achieving up to 3.5x\nhigher decoding throughput compared to the FP16 baseline. Our experiment\nresults demonstrate that AnTKV matches or outperforms prior works such as KIVI,\nSKVQ, KVQuant, and CQ under 4-bit settings.

This paper\nintroduces the Co-Forgetting Protocol, a novel, comprehensive framework\ndesigned to address this challenge by enabling synchronized memory pruning in\nMAS. The protocol integrates three key components: (1) context-aware semantic\nvoting, where agents utilize a lightweight DistilBERT model to assess the\nrelevance of memory items based on their content and the current operational\ncontext; (2) multi-scale temporal decay functions, which assign diminishing\nimportance to memories based on their age and access frequency across different\ntime horizons; and (3) a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)-based\nconsensus mechanism, ensuring that decisions to retain or discard memory items\nare agreed upon by a qualified and fault-tolerant majority of agents, even in\nthe presence of up to f Byzantine (malicious or faulty) agents in a system of N\ngreater than or equal to 3f+1 agents. The protocol leverages gRPC for efficient\ninter-agent communication and Pinecone for scalable vector embedding storage\nand similarity search, with SQLite managing metadata. Experimental evaluations\nin a simulated MAS environment with four agents demonstrate the protocol's\nefficacy, achieving a 52% reduction in memory footprint over 500 epochs, 88%\nvoting accuracy in forgetting decisions against human-annotated benchmarks, a\n92% PBFT consensus success rate under simulated Byzantine conditions, and an\n82% cache hit rate for memory access.",

However, processing\nlong video inputs remains a major challenge due to high memory and\ncomputational costs. This makes it difficult for current models to achieve both\nstrong performance and high efficiency in long video understanding. To address\nthis challenge, we propose Video-XL-2, a novel MLLM that delivers superior\ncost-effectiveness for long-video understanding based on task-aware KV\nsparsification. The proposed framework operates with two key steps: chunk-based\npre-filling and bi-level key-value decoding. Chunk-based pre-filling divides\nthe visual token sequence into chunks, applying full attention within each\nchunk and sparse attention across chunks. This significantly reduces\ncomputational and memory overhead. During decoding, bi-level key-value decoding\nselectively reloads either dense or sparse key-values for each chunk based on\nits relevance to the task. This approach further improves memory efficiency and\nenhances the model's ability to capture fine-grained information. Video-XL-2\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on various long video understanding\nbenchmarks, outperforming existing open-source lightweight models. It also\ndemonstrates exceptional efficiency, capable of processing over 10,000 frames\non a single NVIDIA A100 (80GB) GPU and thousands of frames in just a few\nseconds.",

The widespread usage of sparse data has inspired many in-memory and\non-disk storage formats, but the only widely adopted storage specifications are\nthe Matrix Market and FROSTT file formats, which both use ASCII text. Due to\nthe inefficiency of text storage, these files typically have larger file sizes\nand longer parsing times than binary storage formats, which directly store an\nin-memory representation to disk. This can be a major bottleneck; since sparse\ncomputation is often bandwidth-bound, the cost of loading or storing a matrix\nto disk often exceeds the cost of performing a sparse computation. While it is\ncommon practice for practitioners to develop their own, custom, non-portable\nbinary formats for high-performance sparse matrix storage, there is currently\nno cross-platform binary sparse matrix storage format. We present Binsparse, a\ncross-platform binary sparse matrix and tensor format specification. Binsparse\nis a modular, embeddable format, consisting of a JSON descriptor, which\ndescribes the matrix or tensor dimensions, type, and format, and a series of\nbinary arrays, which can be stored in all modern binary containers, such as\nHDF5, Zarr, or NPZ. We provide several reference implementations of Binsparse\nspanning 5 languages, 5 frameworks, and 4 binary containers. We evaluate our\nBinsparse format on every matrix in the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection and a\nselection of tensors from the FROSTT collection.

To address this, we propose Commutative\nVector Quantization (CommVQ) to significantly reduce memory usage for\nlong-context LLM inference. We first introduce additive quantization with a\nlightweight encoder and codebook to compress the KV cache, which can be decoded\nvia simple matrix multiplication. To further reduce computational costs during\ndecoding, we design the codebook to be commutative with Rotary Position\nEmbedding (RoPE) and train it using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.\nThis enables efficient integration of decoding into the self-attention\nmechanism. Our approach achieves high accuracy with additive quantization and\nlow overhead via the RoPE-commutative codebook. Experiments on long-context\nbenchmarks and GSM8K show that our method reduces FP16 KV cache size by 87.5%\nwith 2-bit quantization, while outperforming state-of-the-art KV cache\nquantization methods. Notably, it enables 1-bit KV cache quantization with\nminimal accuracy loss, allowing a LLaMA-3.1 8B model to run with a 128K context\nlength on a single RTX 4090 GPU.

Many prior works have proposed ways of discarding KVs from memory, but\ntheir approaches are tailored to favorable settings, obscuring caveats like\nhigh peak memory and performance degradation, and a fair comparison between\nmethods is difficult. In this paper, we propose the *KV footprint* as a unified\nmetric, which accounts for both the amount of KV entries stored and their\nlifespan in memory. We evaluate methods based on the smallest footprint they\nattain while preserving performance in both long-context understanding and\ngeneration, with context lengths of up to 128K tokens. This metric reveals the\nhigh peak memory of prior KV eviction methods. One class of methods --\n*post-fill eviction* -- has a high footprint due to being incompatible with\neviction during pre-filling. We adapt these methods to be able to evict KVs\nduring pre-filling, achieving substantially lower KV footprints. We then turn\nto *recency eviction* methods, wherein we propose PruLong, an end-to-end\noptimization method for learning which attention heads need to retain the full\nKV cache and which do not. PruLong saves memory while preserving long-context\nperformance, achieving 12% smaller KV footprint than prior methods while\nretaining performance in challenging recall tasks. Our paper clarifies the\ncomplex tangle of long-context inference methods and paves the way for future\ndevelopment to minimize the KV footprint.",

                    "value": "Language models handle increasingly long contexts for tasks such as book\nsummarization, but this leads to growing memory costs for the key-value (KV)\ncache. Many prior works have proposed ways of discarding KVs from memory, but\ntheir approaches are tailored to favorable settings, obscuring caveats like\nhigh peak memory and performance degradation, and a fair comparison between\nmethods is difficult. In this paper, we propose the *KV footprint* as a unified\nmetric, which accounts for both the amount of KV entries stored and their\nlifespan in memory. We evaluate methods based on the smallest footprint they\nattain while preserving performance in both long-context understanding and\ngeneration, with context lengths of up to 128K tokens. This metric reveals the\nhigh peak memory of prior KV eviction methods. One class of methods --\n*post-fill eviction* -- has a high footprint due to being incompatible with\neviction during pre-filling. We adapt these methods to be able to evict KVs\nduring pre-filling, achieving substantially lower KV footprints. We then turn\nto *recency eviction* methods, wherein we propose PruLong, an end-to-end\noptimization method for learning which attention heads need to retain the full\nKV cache and which do not. PruLong saves memory while preserving long-context\nperformance, achieving 12% smaller KV footprint than prior methods while\nretaining performance in challenging recall tasks. Our paper clarifies the\ncomplex tangle of long-context inference methods and paves the way for future\ndevelopment to minimize the KV footprint."

However,\nVEC networks still face challenges such as high vehicle mobility. Digital twin\n(DT), an emerging technology, can predict, estimate, and analyze real-time\nstates by digitally modeling objects in the physical world. By integrating DT\nwith VEC, a virtual vehicle DT can be created in the VEC server to monitor the\nreal-time operating status of vehicles. However, maintaining the vehicle DT\nmodel requires ongoing attention from the VEC server, which also needs to offer\ncomputing services for the vehicles. Therefore, effective allocation and\nscheduling of VEC server resources are crucial. This study focuses on a general\nVEC network with a single VEC service and multiple vehicles, examining the two\ntypes of delays caused by twin maintenance and computational processing within\nthe network. By transforming the problem using satisfaction functions, we\npropose an optimization problem aimed at maximizing each vehicle's resource\nutility to determine the optimal resource allocation strategy. Given the\nnon-convex nature of the issue, we employ multi-agent Markov decision processes\nto reformulate the problem. Subsequently, we propose the twin maintenance and\ncomputing task processing resource collaborative scheduling (MADRL-CSTC)\nalgorithm, which leverages multi-agent deep reinforcement learning.

To validate our approach, we prototype a\nCXL-SSD on a custom FPGA platform and propose annotation mechanisms,\nDeterminism and Bufferability, to enhance performance while preserving data\npersistency. Our simulation-based evaluation demonstrates that CXL-SSD achieves\n10.9x better performance than PCIe-based memory expanders and further reduces\nlatency by 5.4x with annotation enhancements.

The key observation\nbehind Keigo is that there is no one-size-fits-all placement of data across the\nstorage hierarchy that optimizes for all workloads. Hence, to leverage the\nbenefits of combining different storage devices, Keigo places files across\ndifferent devices based on their parallelism, I/O bandwidth, and capacity. We\nintroduce three techniques - concurrency-aware data placement, persistent\nread-only caching, and context-based I/O differentiation. Keigo is portable\nacross different LSMs, is adaptable to dynamic workloads, and does not require\nextensive profiling. Our system enables established production KVS such as\nRocksDB, LevelDB, and Speedb to benefit from heterogeneous storage setups. We\nevaluate Keigo using synthetic and realistic workloads, showing that it\nimproves the throughput of production-grade LSMs up to 4x for write- and 18x\nfor read-heavy workloads when compared to general-purpose storage systems and\nspecialized LSM KVS.",

HST, and now JWST, have pioneered the study of resolved individual\nstars in the Milky Way and other members of the Local Group, uncovering the\ndrivers of their morphological, star formation, and chemical evolution. HWO\nwill constitute a paradigm shift: introducing the ability to panchromatically\nresolve the main bodies of every galaxy in the Local Volume into their\nconstituent stars.

The principal technological requirement\nadvanced by this science case is a camera with a resolution of\n$\\leqslant$0.015'' that is diffraction-limited, and Nyquist-sampled (0.01'' per\npixel), to at least 550 nm $-$ comparable to the High Definition Imager from\nthe LUVOIR concept.",

For discrete random variables, however, efficient\nentropy estimation presents challenges, particularly when the cardinality of\nthe support set is large relative to the available sample size. This is\nbecause, without other assumptions, there may be insufficient data to\nadequately characterize a probability mass function. Further complications stem\nfrom the dependence among transformations of empirical frequencies within the\nsample. This paper demonstrates that a simple entropy estimator based on the\nharmonic number function achieves asymptotic efficiency on discrete random\nvariables with tail probabilities satisfying $p_j =o(j^{-2})$ as\n$j\\rightarrow\\infty$. This result renders statistical inference newly feasible\nfor all but very heavy-tailed probability mass functions. Moreover, its strong\nmean squared error bounds coupled with simple implementation make this\nestimator an attractive replacement over others in application.",

For discrete random variables, however, efficient\nentropy estimation presents challenges, particularly when the cardinality of\nthe support set is large relative to the available sample size. This is\nbecause, without other assumptions, there may be insufficient data to\nadequately characterize a probability mass function. Further complications stem\nfrom the dependence among transformations of empirical frequencies within the\nsample. This paper demonstrates that a simple entropy estimator based on the\nharmonic number function achieves asymptotic efficiency on discrete random\nvariables with tail probabilities satisfying $p_j =o(j^{-2})$ as\n$j\\rightarrow\\infty$. This result renders statistical inference newly feasible\nfor all but very heavy-tailed probability mass functions. Moreover, its strong\nmean squared error bounds coupled with simple implementation make this\nestimator an attractive replacement over others in application."

These constraints are mainly driven by mild\ndifferences in the inferred values of the matter density parameter across\ndifferent probes that can be alleviated by introducing additional\nbackground-level degrees of freedom (e.g., by dynamical dark energy models).\nHowever, in this work we explore an alternative possibility. Since both\n$\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}$ and massive neutrinos critically influence the growth of\ncosmic structures, we test whether the neutrino mass tension may originate from\nthe way matter clusters, rather than from a breakdown of the $\\Lambda$CDM\nexpansion history. To this end, we introduce the growth index $\\gamma$, which\ncharacterizes the rate at which matter perturbations grow. Deviations from the\nstandard $\\Lambda$CDM value ($\\gamma \\simeq 0.55$) can capture a broad class of\nmodels, including non-minimal dark sector physics and modified gravity. We show\nthat allowing $\\gamma$ to vary significantly relaxes the neutrino mass bounds\nto $\\sum m_\\nu \\lesssim 0.13$-$0.2$ eV, removing any tension with terrestrial\nconstraints without altering the inferred value of $\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}$.\nHowever, this comes at the cost of departing from standard growth predictions:\nto have $\\sum m_\\nu \\gtrsim 0.06$ eV one needs $\\gamma > 0.55$, and we find a\nconsistent preference for $\\gamma > 0.55$ at the level of $\\sim 2\\sigma$.

This raises a crucial question: Is it\npossible to guarantee strict constraint satisfaction in generated outputs while\npreserving the distribution of the original model as much as possible? We first\ndefine the ideal distribution - the one closest to the original model, which\nalso always satisfies the expressed constraint - as the ultimate goal of\nguaranteed generation. We then state a fundamental limitation, namely that it\nis impossible to reach that goal through autoregressive training alone. This\nmotivates the necessity of combining training-time and inference-time methods\nto enforce such guarantees. Based on this insight, we propose GUARD, a simple\nyet effective approach that combines an autoregressive proposal distribution\nwith rejection sampling. Through GUARD's theoretical properties, we show how\ncontrolling the KL divergence between a specific proposal and the target ideal\ndistribution simultaneously optimizes inference speed and distributional\ncloseness. To validate these theoretical concepts, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on two text generation settings with hard-to-satisfy constraints: a\nlexical constraint scenario and a sentiment reversal scenario. These\nexperiments show that GUARD achieves perfect constraint satisfaction while\nalmost preserving the ideal distribution with highly improved inference\nefficiency. GUARD provides a principled approach to enforcing strict guarantees\nfor LLMs without compromising their generative capabilities.",

This raises a crucial question: Is it\npossible to guarantee strict constraint satisfaction in generated outputs while\npreserving the distribution of the original model as much as possible? We first\ndefine the ideal distribution - the one closest to the original model, which\nalso always satisfies the expressed constraint - as the ultimate goal of\nguaranteed generation. We then state a fundamental limitation, namely that it\nis impossible to reach that goal through autoregressive training alone. This\nmotivates the necessity of combining training-time and inference-time methods\nto enforce such guarantees. Based on this insight, we propose GUARD, a simple\nyet effective approach that combines an autoregressive proposal distribution\nwith rejection sampling. Through GUARD's theoretical properties, we show how\ncontrolling the KL divergence between a specific proposal and the target ideal\ndistribution simultaneously optimizes inference speed and distributional\ncloseness. To validate these theoretical concepts, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on two text generation settings with hard-to-satisfy constraints: a\nlexical constraint scenario and a sentiment reversal scenario. These\nexperiments show that GUARD achieves perfect constraint satisfaction while\nalmost preserving the ideal distribution with highly improved inference\nefficiency. GUARD provides a principled approach to enforcing strict guarantees\nfor LLMs without compromising their generative capabilities."

The significant harmonics include a\nrigid spin, a dipole glide from the north Galactic pole to the south and an\nadditional quadrupole distortion. Validation tests with filtered subsamples\nindicate that the detected effect can be caused by hidden systematic errors in\nastrometry.

We find that AU Mic\nhosts a fairly simple and mostly poloidal large-scale field aligned with the\nrotation axis within about 10deg, whereas that of EV Lac is more complex,\nstronger and less axisymmetric. Both stars feature intense small-scale fields,\nof about 4 kG for AU Mic and 6 kG for EV Lac when averaged over the whole\nstellar surface. Stokes QU Zeeman signatures allow one to reconstruct stellar\nmagnetic fields more reliably, and are especially useful for stars with more\ncomplex fields and low vsini's like EV Lac.",

Yet their robustness to distribution shifts\non unseen data remains a key concern for safe deployment. Evaluating such\nrobustness requires a controlled experimental setup that allows for systematic\ninsights into the model's behavior. However, we demonstrate that current setups\nfail to offer sufficiently thorough evaluations. To address this gap, we\nintroduce a novel framework, called SURE-VQA, centered around three key\nrequirements to overcome current pitfalls and systematically analyze VLM\nrobustness: 1) Since robustness on synthetic shifts does not necessarily\ntranslate to real-world shifts, it should be measured on real-world shifts that\nare inherent to the VQA data; 2) Traditional token-matching metrics often fail\nto capture underlying semantics, necessitating the use of large language models\n(LLMs) for more accurate semantic evaluation; 3) Model performance often lacks\ninterpretability due to missing sanity baselines, thus meaningful baselines\nshould be reported that allow assessing the multimodal impact on the VLM. To\ndemonstrate the relevance of this framework, we conduct a study on the\nrobustness of various Fine-Tuning (FT) methods across three medical datasets\nwith four types of distribution shifts. Our study highlights key insights into\nrobustness: 1) No FT method consistently outperforms others in robustness, and\n2) robustness trends are more stable across FT methods than across distribution\nshifts. Additionally, we find that simple sanity baselines that do not use the\nimage data can perform surprisingly well and confirm LoRA as the\nbest-performing FT method on in-distribution data.

We make two key technical contributions: (i)\nthe construction of scalable, high-quality business content dataset, i.e.,\nInfographics-650K, equipped with ultra-dense layouts and prompts by\nimplementing a layer-wise retrieval-augmented infographic generation scheme;\nand (ii) a layout-guided cross attention scheme, which injects tens of\nregion-wise prompts into a set of cropped region latent space according to the\nultra-dense layouts, and refine each sub-regions flexibly during inference\nusing a layout conditional CFG.\n  We demonstrate the strong results of our system compared to previous SOTA\nsystems such as Flux and SD3 on our BizEval prompt set.

In this paper, we propose\na generative AI-powered GATE question-answering framework (GATE stands for\nGraduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) that leverages LLMs to explain GATE\nsolutions and support students in their exam preparation. We conducted\nextensive benchmarking to select the optimal embedding model and LLM,\nevaluating our framework based on criteria such as latency, faithfulness, and\nrelevance, with additional validation through human evaluation. Our chatbot\nintegrates state-of-the-art embedding models and LLMs to deliver accurate,\ncontext-aware responses.

In this paper, we propose\na generative AI-powered GATE question-answering framework (GATE stands for\nGraduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) that leverages LLMs to explain GATE\nsolutions and support students in their exam preparation. We conducted\nextensive benchmarking to select the optimal embedding model and LLM,\nevaluating our framework based on criteria such as latency, faithfulness, and\nrelevance, with additional validation through human evaluation. Our chatbot\nintegrates state-of-the-art embedding models and LLMs to deliver accurate,\ncontext-aware responses.

Current characterization and\ncalibration methods (1) use simplified test specimen geometries and global\ndata, (2) cannot guarantee that sufficient characterization data is collected\nfor a specific model of interest, (3) use deterministic methods that provide\nbest-fit parameter values with no uncertainty quantification, and (4) are\nsequential, inflexible, and time-consuming. This work brings together several\nrecent advancements into an improved workflow called Interlaced\nCharacterization and Calibration that advances the state-of-the-art in\nconstitutive model calibration. The ICC paradigm (1) efficiently uses\nfull-field data to calibrate a high-fidelity material model, (2) aligns the\ndata needed with the data collected with an optimal experimental design\nprotocol, (3) quantifies parameter uncertainty through Bayesian inference, and\n(4) incorporates these advances into a quasi real-time feedback loop. The ICC\nframework is demonstrated on the calibration of a material model using\nsimulated full-field data for an aluminum cruciform specimen being deformed\nbi-axially. The cruciform is actively driven through the myopically optimal\nload path using Bayesian optimal experimental design, which selects load steps\nthat yield the maximum expected information gain. To aid in numerical stability\nand preserve computational resources, the full-field data is dimensionally\nreduced via principal component analysis, and fast surrogate models which\napproximate the input-output relationships of the expensive finite element\nmodel are used. The tools demonstrated here show that high-fidelity\nconstitutive models can be efficiently and reliably calibrated with quantified\nuncertainty, thus supporting credible decision-making and potentially\nincreasing the agility of solid mechanics modeling.",

While recent advances in\nlarge language models (LLMs) have significantly improved linguistic fluency and\ncontextual understanding, building effective and emotionally intelligent ToD\nsystems remains a complex challenge. Effective ToD systems must optimise for\ntask success, emotional understanding and responsiveness, and precise\ninformation conveyance, all within inherently noisy and ambiguous\nconversational environments. In this work, we investigate architectural,\nrepresentational, optimisational as well as emotional considerations of ToD\nsystems. We set up systems covering these design considerations with a\nchallenging evaluation environment composed of a natural-language user\nsimulator coupled with an imperfect natural language understanding module. We\npropose \\textbf{LUSTER}, an \\textbf{L}LM-based \\textbf{U}nified \\textbf{S}ystem\nfor \\textbf{T}ask-oriented dialogue with \\textbf{E}nd-to-end\n\\textbf{R}einforcement learning with both short-term (user sentiment) and\nlong-term (task success) rewards. Our findings demonstrate that combining LLM\ncapability with structured reward modelling leads to more resilient and\nemotionally responsive ToD systems, offering a practical path forward for\nnext-generation conversational agents.",

Effective ToD systems must optimise for\ntask success, emotional understanding and responsiveness, and precise\ninformation conveyance, all within inherently noisy and ambiguous\nconversational environments. In this work, we investigate architectural,\nrepresentational, optimisational as well as emotional considerations of ToD\nsystems. We set up systems covering these design considerations with a\nchallenging evaluation environment composed of a natural-language user\nsimulator coupled with an imperfect natural language understanding module. We\npropose \\textbf{LUSTER}, an \\textbf{L}LM-based \\textbf{U}nified \\textbf{S}ystem\nfor \\textbf{T}ask-oriented dialogue with \\textbf{E}nd-to-end\n\\textbf{R}einforcement learning with both short-term (user sentiment) and\nlong-term (task success) rewards. Our findings demonstrate that combining LLM\ncapability with structured reward modelling leads to more resilient and\nemotionally responsive ToD systems, offering a practical path forward for\nnext-generation conversational agents."

The approach has the potential to drastically\nimprove the level of detail in inference, allowing to fit HMMs with hundreds of\nparameters, 10-20 (potentially bivariate) smooths to thousands of observations."

However, existing\nSequence Parallelism (SP) methods, essential for distributing these workloads\nacross devices, become the primary bottleneck due to substantial communication\noverhead. In this paper, we introduce ZeCO (Zero Communication Overhead)\nsequence parallelism for linear attention models, a new SP method designed to\novercome these limitations and achieve end-to-end near-linear scalability for\nlong sequence training. For example, training a model with a 1M sequence length\nacross 64 devices using ZeCO takes roughly the same time as training with an\n16k sequence on a single device. At the heart of ZeCO lies All-Scan, a new\ncollective communication primitive. All-Scan provides each SP rank with\nprecisely the initial operator state it requires while maintaining a minimal\ncommunication footprint, effectively eliminating communication overhead.\nTheoretically, we prove the optimaity of ZeCO, showing that it introduces only\nnegligible time and space overhead. Empirically, we compare the communication\ncosts of different sequence parallelism strategies and demonstrate that\nAll-Scan achieves the fastest communication in SP scenarios. Specifically, on\n256 GPUs with an 8M sequence length, ZeCO achieves a 60\\% speedup compared to\nthe current state-of-the-art (SOTA) SP method.

                "summary": "The last decade has witnessed the proliferation of network function\nvirtualization (NFV) in the telco industry, thanks to its unparalleled\nflexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. However, as the NFV\ninfrastructure is shared by virtual network functions (VNFs), sporadic resource\ncontentions are inevitable. Such contention makes it extremely challenging to\nguarantee the performance of the provisioned network services, especially in\nhigh-speed regimes (e.g., Gigabit Ethernet). Existing solutions typically rely\non direct traffic analysis (e.g., packet- or flow-level measurements) to detect\nperformance degradation and identify bottlenecks, which is not always\napplicable due to significant integration overhead and system-level\nconstraints. This paper complements existing solutions with a lightweight,\nnon-intrusive framework for online performance inference that easily adapts to\ndrift (i.e., a change over time of the actual state of our system). Instead of\ndirect data-plane collection, we reuse hardware features in the underlying NFV\ninfrastructure, introducing negligible interference in the data-plane. Our\nDrift-Resilient and Self-Tuning (DRST) framework can be integrated into\nexisting NFV systems with minimal engineering effort and operate without the\nneed for predefined traffic models or VNF-specific customization. DRST is\ndeployed via a lightweight MLOps pipeline that automates the adaptation under\nruntime drift. We show how DRST can deliver accurate performance inference or\ndiagnose run-time bottlenecks, as demonstrated through a comprehensive\nevaluation across diverse NFV scenarios.",

                    "value": "The last decade has witnessed the proliferation of network function\nvirtualization (NFV) in the telco industry, thanks to its unparalleled\nflexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. However, as the NFV\ninfrastructure is shared by virtual network functions (VNFs), sporadic resource\ncontentions are inevitable. Such contention makes it extremely challenging to\nguarantee the performance of the provisioned network services, especially in\nhigh-speed regimes (e.g., Gigabit Ethernet). Existing solutions typically rely\non direct traffic analysis (e.g., packet- or flow-level measurements) to detect\nperformance degradation and identify bottlenecks, which is not always\napplicable due to significant integration overhead and system-level\nconstraints. This paper complements existing solutions with a lightweight,\nnon-intrusive framework for online performance inference that easily adapts to\ndrift (i.e., a change over time of the actual state of our system). Instead of\ndirect data-plane collection, we reuse hardware features in the underlying NFV\ninfrastructure, introducing negligible interference in the data-plane. Our\nDrift-Resilient and Self-Tuning (DRST) framework can be integrated into\nexisting NFV systems with minimal engineering effort and operate without the\nneed for predefined traffic models or VNF-specific customization. DRST is\ndeployed via a lightweight MLOps pipeline that automates the adaptation under\nruntime drift. We show how DRST can deliver accurate performance inference or\ndiagnose run-time bottlenecks, as demonstrated through a comprehensive\nevaluation across diverse NFV scenarios."

We develop a consistent estimator\nthat approximates the transition matrix of the chain in the operator norm, with\nthe number of required samples scaling roughly linearly with the size of the\nstate space. Applying this estimation procedure to wireless networks, our\nnumerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method accurately infers\nnetwork topology across a wide range of parameters, consistently outperforming\ntransfer entropy, particularly under conditions of high network congestion.",

This paper proposes modeling these\nGUI inspired metaphors acknowledgment (submit like) and context switching\n(reset-like) as explicit tasks within large language model (LLM) prompts. By\ncapturing user acknowledgment, reset actions, and chain of thought (CoT)\nreasoning as structured session data, we preserve clarity, reduce user\nconfusion, and align domain-specific chatbot interactions with back-end logic.\nWe demonstrate our approach in hotel booking and customer management scenarios,\nhighlighting improvements in multi-turn task coherence, user satisfaction, and\nefficiency."

Recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a\nrapidly increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed with remarkable\nperformance. However, existing LLM-based APR techniques typically adopt\ntrial-and-error strategies, which suffer from two major drawbacks: (1)\ninherently limited patch effectiveness due to local exploration, and (2) low\nsearch efficiency due to redundant exploration. In this paper, we propose\nAPRMCTS, which uses iterative tree search to improve LLM-based APR. APRMCTS\nincorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into patch searching by performing\na global evaluation of the explored patches and selecting the most promising\none for subsequent refinement and generation. APRMCTS effectively resolves the\nproblems of falling into local optima and thus helps improve the efficiency of\npatch searching. Our experiments on 835 bugs from Defects4J demonstrate that,\nwhen integrated with GPT-3.5, APRMCTS can fix a total of 201 bugs, which\noutperforms all state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, APRMCTS helps GPT-4o-mini,\nGPT-3.5, Yi-Coder-9B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B to fix 30, 27, 37, and 28 more bugs,\nrespectively. More importantly, APRMCTS boasts a significant performance\nadvantage while employing small patch size (16 and 32), notably fewer than the\n500 and 10,000 patches adopted in previous studies. In terms of cost, compared\nto existing state-of-the-art LLM-based APR methods, APRMCTS has time and\nmonetary costs of less than 20% and 50%, respectively. Our extensive study\ndemonstrates that APRMCTS exhibits good effectiveness and efficiency, with\nparticular advantages in addressing complex bugs.",

The averaged $J_2$ orbital\nparameters that describe the drift and periodic orbital motion were derived\nalong with their target values to achieve a distributed space structure in a\ndecentralized manner. This enabled the design of a distance-based orbital\nstabilizer to ensure autonomous deployment into a monolithic formation of a\ncoplanar equidistant configuration on a user-defined orbital plane. Continuous\nformation control was assumed to be achieved through fuel-free actuation, such\nas satellite magnetic field interaction and differential aerodynamic forces,\nthereby maintaining long-term formation stability without thruster usage.

The averaged $J_2$ orbital\nparameters that describe the drift and periodic orbital motion were derived\nalong with their target values to achieve a distributed space structure in a\ndecentralized manner. This enabled the design of a distance-based orbital\nstabilizer to ensure autonomous deployment into a monolithic formation of a\ncoplanar equidistant configuration on a user-defined orbital plane. Continuous\nformation control was assumed to be achieved through fuel-free actuation, such\nas satellite magnetic field interaction and differential aerodynamic forces,\nthereby maintaining long-term formation stability without thruster usage.

Yet their robustness to distribution shifts\non unseen data remains a key concern for safe deployment. Evaluating such\nrobustness requires a controlled experimental setup that allows for systematic\ninsights into the model's behavior. However, we demonstrate that current setups\nfail to offer sufficiently thorough evaluations. To address this gap, we\nintroduce a novel framework, called SURE-VQA, centered around three key\nrequirements to overcome current pitfalls and systematically analyze VLM\nrobustness: 1) Since robustness on synthetic shifts does not necessarily\ntranslate to real-world shifts, it should be measured on real-world shifts that\nare inherent to the VQA data; 2) Traditional token-matching metrics often fail\nto capture underlying semantics, necessitating the use of large language models\n(LLMs) for more accurate semantic evaluation; 3) Model performance often lacks\ninterpretability due to missing sanity baselines, thus meaningful baselines\nshould be reported that allow assessing the multimodal impact on the VLM. To\ndemonstrate the relevance of this framework, we conduct a study on the\nrobustness of various Fine-Tuning (FT) methods across three medical datasets\nwith four types of distribution shifts. Our study highlights key insights into\nrobustness: 1) No FT method consistently outperforms others in robustness, and\n2) robustness trends are more stable across FT methods than across distribution\nshifts. Additionally, we find that simple sanity baselines that do not use the\nimage data can perform surprisingly well and confirm LoRA as the\nbest-performing FT method on in-distribution data.

While\ndata-driven approaches have advanced the field, their lack of interpretability\nand trustworthiness limits their applicability in dynamic legal environments.\nTo address these issues, we collaborated with legal experts to extend an\nexisting dataset and explored the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and\nin-context learning to evaluate the legality of clauses in German employment\ncontracts. Our work evaluates the ability of different LLMs to classify clauses\nas \"valid,\" \"unfair,\" or \"void\" under three legal context variants: no legal\ncontext, full-text sources of laws and court rulings, and distilled versions of\nthese (referred to as examination guidelines). Results show that full-text\nsources moderately improve performance, while examination guidelines\nsignificantly enhance recall for void clauses and weighted F1-Score, reaching\n80\\%. Despite these advancements, LLMs' performance when using full-text\nsources remains substantially below that of human lawyers. We contribute an\nextended dataset, including examination guidelines, referenced legal sources,\nand corresponding annotations, alongside our code and all log files. Our\nfindings highlight the potential of LLMs to assist lawyers in contract legality\nreview while also underscoring the limitations of the methods presented.",

While\ndata-driven approaches have advanced the field, their lack of interpretability\nand trustworthiness limits their applicability in dynamic legal environments.\nTo address these issues, we collaborated with legal experts to extend an\nexisting dataset and explored the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and\nin-context learning to evaluate the legality of clauses in German employment\ncontracts. Our work evaluates the ability of different LLMs to classify clauses\nas \"valid,\" \"unfair,\" or \"void\" under three legal context variants: no legal\ncontext, full-text sources of laws and court rulings, and distilled versions of\nthese (referred to as examination guidelines). Results show that full-text\nsources moderately improve performance, while examination guidelines\nsignificantly enhance recall for void clauses and weighted F1-Score, reaching\n80\\%. Despite these advancements, LLMs' performance when using full-text\nsources remains substantially below that of human lawyers. We contribute an\nextended dataset, including examination guidelines, referenced legal sources,\nand corresponding annotations, alongside our code and all log files. Our\nfindings highlight the potential of LLMs to assist lawyers in contract legality\nreview while also underscoring the limitations of the methods presented."

Conversely, RFT can significantly enhance a model's\nperformance but is prone to learn unexpected behaviors, and its performance is\nhighly sensitive to the initial policy. In this paper, we propose a unified\nview of these methods and introduce Prefix-RFT, a hybrid approach that\nsynergizes learning from both demonstration and exploration. Using mathematical\nreasoning problems as a testbed, we empirically demonstrate that Prefix-RFT is\nboth simple and effective. It not only surpasses the performance of standalone\nSFT and RFT but also outperforms parallel mixed-policy RFT methods. A key\nadvantage is its seamless integration into existing open-source frameworks,\nrequiring only minimal modifications to the standard RFT pipeline. Our analysis\nhighlights the complementary nature of SFT and RFT, and validates that\nPrefix-RFT effectively harmonizes these two learning paradigms. Furthermore,\nablation studies confirm the method's robustness to variations in the quality\nand quantity of demonstration data.

The Jensen gap in\ntransformer probability aggregation provides a direct measure of this\nimpossibility. These results reframe hallucination from an engineering bug to\nan inevitable mathematical feature of distributed intelligence. There are\nfundamental trade-offs between truthfulness, knowledge utilization, and\nresponse completeness, providing principled foundations for managing rather\nthan eliminating hallucination. This work reveals deep connections between\nneural network inference, philosophy of knowledge and reasoning, and classical\nresults in game theory and information theory, opening new research directions\nfor developing beneficial AI systems within mathematical constraints."

However, existing\nSequence Parallelism (SP) methods, essential for distributing these workloads\nacross devices, become the primary bottleneck due to substantial communication\noverhead. In this paper, we introduce ZeCO (Zero Communication Overhead)\nsequence parallelism for linear attention models, a new SP method designed to\novercome these limitations and achieve end-to-end near-linear scalability for\nlong sequence training. For example, training a model with a 1M sequence length\nacross 64 devices using ZeCO takes roughly the same time as training with an\n16k sequence on a single device. At the heart of ZeCO lies All-Scan, a new\ncollective communication primitive. All-Scan provides each SP rank with\nprecisely the initial operator state it requires while maintaining a minimal\ncommunication footprint, effectively eliminating communication overhead.\nTheoretically, we prove the optimaity of ZeCO, showing that it introduces only\nnegligible time and space overhead. Empirically, we compare the communication\ncosts of different sequence parallelism strategies and demonstrate that\nAll-Scan achieves the fastest communication in SP scenarios. Specifically, on\n256 GPUs with an 8M sequence length, ZeCO achieves a 60\\% speedup compared to\nthe current state-of-the-art (SOTA) SP method. We believe ZeCO establishes a\nclear path toward efficiently training next-generation LLMs on previously\nintractable sequence lengths.",

Unlike prior approaches, our method\neffectively balances computational efficiency and performance, combining\ntraditional approaches with LLMs and yielding state-of-the-art results on key\nOOS detection benchmarks, including real-world OOS data acquired from a\ndeployed TODS."

In this work, we\nstudy procedure-aware video representation learning by incorporating\nstate-change descriptions generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) as\nsupervision signals for video encoders. Moreover, we generate state-change\ncounterfactuals that simulate hypothesized failure outcomes, allowing models to\nlearn by imagining the unseen ``What if'' scenarios. This counterfactual\nreasoning facilitates the model's ability to understand the cause and effect of\neach step in an activity. To verify the procedure awareness of our model, we\nconduct extensive experiments on procedure-aware tasks, including temporal\naction segmentation, error detection, action phase classification, frame\nretrieval, multi-instance retrieval, and action recognition. Our results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed state-change descriptions and\ntheir counterfactuals, and achieve significant improvements on multiple tasks.\nWe will make our source code and data publicly available soon.",

Fine-tuning LLMs with\nparameter-efficient adapters, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enables these\nmodels to efficiently adapt to downstream tasks without extensive retraining.\nDeploying fine-tuned LLMs on multi-tenant edge devices offers substantial\nbenefits, such as reduced latency, enhanced privacy, and personalized\nresponses. However, serving LLMs efficiently on resource-constrained edge\ndevices presents critical challenges, including the complexity of adapter\nselection for different tasks and memory overhead from frequent adapter\nswapping.

This paper introduces EdgeLoRA, an efficient\nsystem for serving LLMs on edge devices in multi-tenant environments. EdgeLoRA\nincorporates three key innovations: (1) an adaptive adapter selection mechanism\nto streamline the adapter configuration process; (2) heterogeneous memory\nmanagement, leveraging intelligent adapter caching and pooling to mitigate\nmemory operation overhead; and (3) batch LoRA inference, enabling efficient\nbatch processing to significantly reduce computational latency. Comprehensive\nevaluations using the Llama3.1-8B model demonstrate that EdgeLoRA significantly\noutperforms the status quo (i.e., llama.cpp) in terms of both latency and\nthroughput. The results demonstrate that EdgeLoRA can achieve up to a 4 times\nboost in throughput. Even more impressively, it can serve several orders of\nmagnitude more adapters simultaneously.

We present system details and\nempirical results across four core STEM disciplines: Computer Science,\nMathematics, Physics, and Chemistry.

In this paper, we delve\ninto the validation and comparison of the ethical biases of LLMs concerning\nglobally discussed and potentially sensitive topics, hypothesizing that these\nbiases may arise from language-specific distinctions.

To solve these problems, we\nintroduce SCADF-MoE, a spatial-context aware dynamic fusion network built on a\nsoft mixture-of-experts backbone. SCADF-MoE first clusters neighboring points\ninto short trajectories to inject explicit spatial context. Then, it adaptively\nfuses channel state information, angle of arrival profile, distance, and gain\nthrough its learnable MoE router, so that the most reliable cues dominate at\neach carrier band. The fused representation is fed to a modality-task MoE that\nsimultaneously regresses the coordinates of every vertex in the trajectory and\nits centroid, thereby exploiting inter-point correlations. Finally, an\nauxiliary maximum-mean-discrepancy loss enforces expert diversity and mitigates\ngradient interference, stabilizing multi-task training. On three real urban\nlayouts and three carrier bands (2.6, 6, 28 GHz), the model delivers consistent\nsub-meter MSE and halves unseen-NLOS error versus the best prior work.

                    "value": "Multimodal fingerprinting is a crucial technique to sub-meter 6G integrated\nsensing and communications (ISAC) localization, but two hurdles block\ndeployment: (i) the contribution each modality makes to the target position\nvaries with the operating conditions such as carrier frequency, and (ii)\nspatial and fingerprint ambiguities markedly undermine localization accuracy,\nespecially in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. To solve these problems, we\nintroduce SCADF-MoE, a spatial-context aware dynamic fusion network built on a\nsoft mixture-of-experts backbone. SCADF-MoE first clusters neighboring points\ninto short trajectories to inject explicit spatial context. Then, it adaptively\nfuses channel state information, angle of arrival profile, distance, and gain\nthrough its learnable MoE router, so that the most reliable cues dominate at\neach carrier band. The fused representation is fed to a modality-task MoE that\nsimultaneously regresses the coordinates of every vertex in the trajectory and\nits centroid, thereby exploiting inter-point correlations. Finally, an\nauxiliary maximum-mean-discrepancy loss enforces expert diversity and mitigates\ngradient interference, stabilizing multi-task training. On three real urban\nlayouts and three carrier bands (2.6, 6, 28 GHz), the model delivers consistent\nsub-meter MSE and halves unseen-NLOS error versus the best prior work. To our\nknowledge, this is the first work that leverages large-scale multimodal MoE for\nfrequency-robust ISAC localization."
