These characteristics render ineffective existing energy\nconserving techniques when processors are idle due to the long transition time\nfrom a deep idle power state (C-state). While prior works propose management\ntechniques to mitigate this inefficiency, we tackle it at its root with\nAgileWatts (AW): a new deep C-state architecture optimized for datacenter\nserver processors targeting latency-sensitive applications. AW is based on\nthree key ideas. First, AW eliminates the latency overhead of saving/restoring\nthe core context (i.e., micro-architectural state) when powering-off/-on the\ncore in a deep idle power state by i) implementing medium-grained power-gates,\ncarefully distributed across the CPU core, and ii) retaining context in the\npower-ungated domain. Second, AW eliminates the flush latency overhead (several\ntens of microseconds) of the L1/L2 caches when entering a deep idle power state\nby keeping L1/L2 cache content power-ungated. A minimal control logic also\nremains power-ungated to serve cache coherence traffic (i.e., snoops)\nseamlessly. AW implements sleep-mode in caches to reduce caches leakage power\nconsumption and lowers a core voltage to the minimum operational voltage level\nto minimize the leakage power of the power-ungated domain. Third, using a\nstate-of-the-art power efficient all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) clock\ngenerator, AW keeps the PLL active and locked during the idle state, further\ncutting precious microseconds of wake-up latency at a negligible power cost.\nOur evaluation with an accurate simulator calibrated against an Intel Skylake\nserver shows that AW reduces the energy consumption of Memcached by up to 71%\n(35% on average) with up to 1% performance degradation.",

Despite extensive developments, existing works still face a trade-off\nbetween maintaining similarity to the original image and generating content\nthat aligns with the target. Here, we propose KV-Edit, a training-free approach\nthat uses KV cache in DiTs to maintain background consistency, where background\ntokens are preserved rather than regenerated, eliminating the need for complex\nmechanisms or expensive training, ultimately generating new content that\nseamlessly integrates with the background within user-provided regions. We\nfurther explore the memory consumption of the KV cache during editing and\noptimize the space complexity to $O(1)$ using an inversion-free method. Our\napproach is compatible with any DiT-based generative model without additional\ntraining. Experiments demonstrate that KV-Edit significantly outperforms\nexisting approaches in terms of both background and image quality, even\nsurpassing training-based methods.

                    "value": "Background consistency remains a significant challenge in image editing\ntasks. Despite extensive developments, existing works still face a trade-off\nbetween maintaining similarity to the original image and generating content\nthat aligns with the target. Here, we propose KV-Edit, a training-free approach\nthat uses KV cache in DiTs to maintain background consistency, where background\ntokens are preserved rather than regenerated, eliminating the need for complex\nmechanisms or expensive training, ultimately generating new content that\nseamlessly integrates with the background within user-provided regions. We\nfurther explore the memory consumption of the KV cache during editing and\noptimize the space complexity to $O(1)$ using an inversion-free method. Our\napproach is compatible with any DiT-based generative model without additional\ntraining. Experiments demonstrate that KV-Edit significantly outperforms\nexisting approaches in terms of both background and image quality, even\nsurpassing training-based methods.

                "summary": "This paper introduces GTX, a standalone main-memory write-optimized graph\ndata system that specializes in structural and graph property updates while\nenabling concurrent reads and graph analytics through ACID transactions. Recent\ngraph systems target concurrent read and write support while guaranteeing\ntransaction semantics. However, their performance suffers from updates with\nreal-world temporal locality over the same vertices and edges due to\nvertex-centric lock contentions. GTX has an adaptive delta-chain locking\nprotocol on top of a carefully designed latch-free graph storage. It eliminates\nvertex-level locking contention, and adapts to real-life workloads while\nmaintaining sequential access to the graph's adjacency lists storage. GTX's\ntransactions further support cache-friendly block level concurrency control,\nand cooperative group commit and garbage collection.

                    "value": "This paper introduces GTX, a standalone main-memory write-optimized graph\ndata system that specializes in structural and graph property updates while\nenabling concurrent reads and graph analytics through ACID transactions. Recent\ngraph systems target concurrent read and write support while guaranteeing\ntransaction semantics. However, their performance suffers from updates with\nreal-world temporal locality over the same vertices and edges due to\nvertex-centric lock contentions. GTX has an adaptive delta-chain locking\nprotocol on top of a carefully designed latch-free graph storage. It eliminates\nvertex-level locking contention, and adapts to real-life workloads while\nmaintaining sequential access to the graph's adjacency lists storage. GTX's\ntransactions further support cache-friendly block level concurrency control,\nand cooperative group commit and garbage collection. This combination of\nfeatures ensures high update throughput and provides low-latency graph\nanalytics.

In embedded systems running a\ngeneral-purpose OS, accelerators access data via dedicated, physically\naddressed memory regions.

                "summary": "Code generation is a latency-sensitive task that demands high timeliness, but\nthe autoregressive decoding mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) leads to\npoor inference efficiency. Existing LLM inference acceleration methods mainly\nfocus on standalone functions using only built-in components. Moreover, they\ntreat code like natural language sequences, ignoring its unique syntax and\nsemantic characteristics. As a result, the effectiveness of these approaches in\ncode generation tasks remains limited and fails to align with real-world\nprogramming scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we propose CodeSwift, a simple\nyet highly efficient inference acceleration approach specifically designed for\ncode generation, without comprising the quality of the output. CodeSwift\nconstructs a multi-source datastore, providing access to both general and\nproject-specific knowledge, facilitating the retrieval of high-quality draft\nsequences. Moreover, CodeSwift reduces retrieval cost by controlling retrieval\ntiming, and enhances efficiency through parallel retrieval and a context- and\nLLM preference-aware cache. Experimental results show that CodeSwift can reach\nup to 2.53x and 2.54x speedup compared to autoregressive decoding in\nrepository-level and standalone code generation tasks, respectively,\noutperforming state-of-the-art inference acceleration approaches by up to 88%.",

                    "value": "Code generation is a latency-sensitive task that demands high timeliness, but\nthe autoregressive decoding mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) leads to\npoor inference efficiency. Existing LLM inference acceleration methods mainly\nfocus on standalone functions using only built-in components. Moreover, they\ntreat code like natural language sequences, ignoring its unique syntax and\nsemantic characteristics. As a result, the effectiveness of these approaches in\ncode generation tasks remains limited and fails to align with real-world\nprogramming scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we propose CodeSwift, a simple\nyet highly efficient inference acceleration approach specifically designed for\ncode generation, without comprising the quality of the output. CodeSwift\nconstructs a multi-source datastore, providing access to both general and\nproject-specific knowledge, facilitating the retrieval of high-quality draft\nsequences. Moreover, CodeSwift reduces retrieval cost by controlling retrieval\ntiming, and enhances efficiency through parallel retrieval and a context- and\nLLM preference-aware cache. Experimental results show that CodeSwift can reach\nup to 2.53x and 2.54x speedup compared to autoregressive decoding in\nrepository-level and standalone code generation tasks, respectively,\noutperforming state-of-the-art inference acceleration approaches by up to 88%."

Theoretical and numerical comparisons show that (i)\ncompared to the existing schemes with linear subpacketization (to the number of\nusers), the proposed scheme achieves a lower load; (ii) compared to some\nexisting schemes with polynomial subpacketization, the proposed scheme can also\nachieve a lower load in some cases; (iii) compared to some existing schemes\nwith exponential subpacketization, the proposed scheme has loads close to those\nof these schemes in some cases. Moreover, the new concept of NHSDP is closely\nrelated to the classical combinatorial structures such as cyclic difference\npacking (CDP), non-three-term arithmetic progressions (NTAP), and perfect hash\nfamily (PHF). These connections indicate that NHSDP is an important\ncombinatorial structure in the field of combinatorial design.",

Theoretical and numerical comparisons show that (i)\ncompared to the existing schemes with linear subpacketization (to the number of\nusers), the proposed scheme achieves a lower load; (ii) compared to some\nexisting schemes with polynomial subpacketization, the proposed scheme can also\nachieve a lower load in some cases; (iii) compared to some existing schemes\nwith exponential subpacketization, the proposed scheme has loads close to those\nof these schemes in some cases. Moreover, the new concept of NHSDP is closely\nrelated to the classical combinatorial structures such as cyclic difference\npacking (CDP), non-three-term arithmetic progressions (NTAP), and perfect hash\nfamily (PHF). These connections indicate that NHSDP is an important\ncombinatorial structure in the field of combinatorial design."

On average, LServe accelerates LLM prefilling by up to 2.9x and\ndecoding by 1.3-2.1x over vLLM, maintaining long-context accuracy. Code is\nreleased at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/omniserve."

While rotary position embeddings (RoPEs) enhance length generalization,\neffective length extrapolation remains challenging and often requires costly\nfine-tuning. In contrast, recent training-free approaches suffer from the\nattention sink phenomenon, leading to severe performance degradation. In this\npaper, we introduce ParallelComp, a novel training-free method for long-context\nextrapolation that extends LLMs' context length from 4K to 128K while\nmaintaining high throughput and preserving perplexity, and integrates\nseamlessly with Flash Attention. Our analysis offers new insights into\nattention biases in parallel attention mechanisms and provides practical\nsolutions to tackle these challenges. To mitigate the attention sink issue, we\npropose an attention calibration strategy that reduces biases, ensuring more\nstable long-range attention. Additionally, we introduce a chunk eviction\nstrategy to efficiently manage ultra-long contexts on a single A100 80GB GPU.\nTo further enhance efficiency, we propose a parallel KV cache eviction\ntechnique, which improves chunk throughput by 1.76x, thereby achieving a 23.50x\nacceleration in the prefilling stage with negligible performance loss due to\nattention calibration. Furthermore, ParallelComp achieves 91.17% of GPT-4's\nperformance on long-context tasks using an 8B model trained on 8K-length\ncontext, outperforming powerful closed-source models such as Claude-2 and\nKimi-Chat.",

                "summary": "Near-Data Processing (NDP) has been a promising architectural paradigm to\naddress the memory wall problem for data-intensive applications. Practical\nimplementation of NDP architectures calls for system support for better\nprogrammability, where having virtual memory (VM) is critical. Modern computing\nsystems incorporate a 4-level page table design to support address translation\nin VM. However, simply adopting an existing 4-level page table in NDP systems\ncauses significant address translation overhead because (1) NDP applications\ngenerate a lot of address translations, and (2) the limited L1 cache in NDP\nsystems cannot cover the accesses to page table entries (PTEs). We extensively\nanalyze the 4-level page table design in the NDP scenario and observe that (1)\nthe memory access to page table entries is highly irregular, thus cannot\nbenefit from the L1 cache, and (2) the last two levels of page tables are\nnearly fully occupied. Based on our observations, we propose NDPage, an\nefficient page table design tailored for NDP systems. The key mechanisms of\nNDPage are (1) an L1 cache bypass mechanism for PTEs that not only accelerates\nthe memory accesses of PTEs but also prevents the pollution of PTEs in the\ncache system, and (2) a flattened page table design that merges the last two\nlevels of page tables, allowing the page table to enjoy the flexibility of a\n4KB page while reducing the number of PTE accesses. We evaluate NDPage using a\nvariety of data-intensive workloads. Our evaluation shows that in a single-core\nNDP system, NDPage improves the end-to-end performance over the\nstate-of-the-art address translation mechanism of 14.3\\%; in 4-core and 8-core\nNDP systems, NDPage enhances the performance of 9.8\\% and 30.5\\%, respectively.",

                    "value": "Near-Data Processing (NDP) has been a promising architectural paradigm to\naddress the memory wall problem for data-intensive applications. Practical\nimplementation of NDP architectures calls for system support for better\nprogrammability, where having virtual memory (VM) is critical. Modern computing\nsystems incorporate a 4-level page table design to support address translation\nin VM. However, simply adopting an existing 4-level page table in NDP systems\ncauses significant address translation overhead because (1) NDP applications\ngenerate a lot of address translations, and (2) the limited L1 cache in NDP\nsystems cannot cover the accesses to page table entries (PTEs). We extensively\nanalyze the 4-level page table design in the NDP scenario and observe that (1)\nthe memory access to page table entries is highly irregular, thus cannot\nbenefit from the L1 cache, and (2) the last two levels of page tables are\nnearly fully occupied. Based on our observations, we propose NDPage, an\nefficient page table design tailored for NDP systems. The key mechanisms of\nNDPage are (1) an L1 cache bypass mechanism for PTEs that not only accelerates\nthe memory accesses of PTEs but also prevents the pollution of PTEs in the\ncache system, and (2) a flattened page table design that merges the last two\nlevels of page tables, allowing the page table to enjoy the flexibility of a\n4KB page while reducing the number of PTE accesses. We evaluate NDPage using a\nvariety of data-intensive workloads. Our evaluation shows that in a single-core\nNDP system, NDPage improves the end-to-end performance over the\nstate-of-the-art address translation mechanism of 14.3\\%; in 4-core and 8-core\nNDP systems, NDPage enhances the performance of 9.8\\% and 30.5\\%, respectively."

In this paper, we present NPU\nVector Runahead (NVR), a prefetching mechanism tailored for NPUs to address\ncache miss problems in sparse DNN workloads. Rather than optimising memory\npatterns with high overhead and poor portability, NVR adapts runahead execution\nto the unique architecture of NPUs. NVR provides a general micro-architectural\nsolution for sparse DNN workloads without requiring compiler or algorithmic\nsupport, operating as a decoupled, speculative, lightweight hardware sub-thread\nalongside the NPU, with minimal hardware overhead (under 5%). NVR achieves an\naverage 90% reduction in cache misses compared to SOTA prefetching in\ngeneral-purpose processors, delivering 4x average speedup on sparse workloads\nversus NPUs without prefetching. Moreover, we investigate the advantages of\nincorporating a small cache (16KB) into the NPU combined with NVR.

One promising approach\nfor test-time compute scaling is search against a process reward model, where a\nmodel generates multiple potential candidates at each step of the search, and\nthese partial trajectories are then scored by a separate reward model in order\nto guide the search process. The diversity of trajectories in the tree search\nprocess affects the accuracy of the search, since increasing diversity promotes\nmore exploration.

Previous search methods either do not perform\nsufficient exploration, or else explore diverse trajectories but have high\nlatency. We address this challenge by proposing Efficient Tree Search (ETS),\nwhich promotes KV sharing by pruning redundant trajectories while maintaining\nnecessary diverse trajectories. ETS incorporates a linear programming cost\nmodel to promote KV cache sharing by penalizing the number of nodes retained,\nwhile incorporating a semantic coverage term into the cost model to ensure that\nwe retain trajectories which are semantically different. We demonstrate how ETS\ncan achieve 1.8$\\times$ reduction in average KV cache size during the search\nprocess, leading to 1.4$\\times$ increased throughput relative to prior\nstate-of-the-art methods, with minimal accuracy degradation and without\nrequiring any custom kernel implementation.

Context caching improves serving performance by exploiting\ninter-request dependency and reusing key-value (KV) cache across requests, thus\nimproving time-to-first-token (TTFT). However, existing prefix-based context\ncaching requires exact token prefix matches, limiting cache reuse in few-shot\nlearning, multi-document QA, or retrieval-augmented generation, where prefixes\nmay vary. In this paper, we present EPIC, an LLM serving system that introduces\nposition-independent context caching (PIC), enabling modular KV cache reuse\nregardless of token chunk position (or prefix). EPIC features two key designs:\nAttnLink, which leverages static attention sparsity to minimize recomputation\nfor accuracy recovery, and KVSplit, a customizable chunking method that\npreserves semantic coherence. Our experiments demonstrate that Epic delivers up\nto 8x improvements in TTFT and 7x throughput over existing systems, with\nnegligible or no accuracy loss. By addressing the limitations of traditional\ncaching approaches, Epic enables more scalable and efficient LLM inference.",

However, existing prefix-based context\ncaching requires exact token prefix matches, limiting cache reuse in few-shot\nlearning, multi-document QA, or retrieval-augmented generation, where prefixes\nmay vary. In this paper, we present EPIC, an LLM serving system that introduces\nposition-independent context caching (PIC), enabling modular KV cache reuse\nregardless of token chunk position (or prefix). EPIC features two key designs:\nAttnLink, which leverages static attention sparsity to minimize recomputation\nfor accuracy recovery, and KVSplit, a customizable chunking method that\npreserves semantic coherence. Our experiments demonstrate that Epic delivers up\nto 8x improvements in TTFT and 7x throughput over existing systems, with\nnegligible or no accuracy loss. By addressing the limitations of traditional\ncaching approaches, Epic enables more scalable and efficient LLM inference."

Besides, \\name{} also adopts\ndesigns including four-level feature store to fully utilize the memory\nhierarchy to cache node features and reduce disk access, batched packing to\naccelerate the feature packing process, and pipelined training to overlap disk\naccess with other operations. We compare DiskGNN with Ginex and MariusGNN,\nwhich are state-of-the-art systems for out-of-core GNN training. The results\nshow that DiskGNN can speed up the baselines by over 8x while matching their\nbest model accuracy."

We conduct extensive\nexperiments to evaluate HexGen-2, i.e., on OPT (30B) and Llama-2 (70B) models\nin various real-world settings, the results reveal that HexGen-2 delivers up to\na 2.0 times and on average a 1.3 times improvement in serving throughput,\nreduces the average inference latency by 1.5 times compared with\nstate-of-the-art systems given the same price budget, and achieves comparable\ninference performance with a 30% lower price budget."

By leveraging a two-tiered structure, Glinthawk optimizes the\nutilization of the high-end accelerators (\"Tier 1\") by offloading the attention\nmechanism to lower-end compute tier (\"Tier 2\"). This separation allows the\nmemory demand of the attention, known as the key-value cache, to scale\nindependently from the model weights, enabling larger batch sizes and more\nefficient accelerator usage. Prototyped with NVIDIA T4 GPUs and standard CPU\nVMs, Glinthawk improves throughput by $5.9\\times$ and reduces cost of\ngeneration by $2.8\\times$, compared to paged attention baselines. For long\nsequence lengths, it achieves $16.3\\times$ throughput improvement at\n$2.4\\times$ less cost. Our evaluation shows that this architecture can tolerate\nmoderate network latency with minimal performance degradation, making it highly\neffective for latency-tolerant, throughput-focused applications such as batch\nprocessing.

                "summary": "Masked language modelling (MLM) as a pretraining objective has been widely\nadopted in genomic sequence modelling. While pretrained models can successfully\nserve as encoders for various downstream tasks, the distribution shift between\npretraining and inference detrimentally impacts performance, as the pretraining\ntask is to map [MASK] tokens to predictions, yet the [MASK] is absent during\ndownstream applications. This means the encoder does not prioritize its\nencodings of non-[MASK] tokens, and expends parameters and compute on work only\nrelevant to the MLM task, despite this being irrelevant at deployment time. In\nthis work, we propose a modified encoder-decoder architecture based on the\nmasked autoencoder framework, designed to address this inefficiency within a\nBERT-based transformer.

                    "value": "Masked language modelling (MLM) as a pretraining objective has been widely\nadopted in genomic sequence modelling. While pretrained models can successfully\nserve as encoders for various downstream tasks, the distribution shift between\npretraining and inference detrimentally impacts performance, as the pretraining\ntask is to map [MASK] tokens to predictions, yet the [MASK] is absent during\ndownstream applications. This means the encoder does not prioritize its\nencodings of non-[MASK] tokens, and expends parameters and compute on work only\nrelevant to the MLM task, despite this being irrelevant at deployment time. In\nthis work, we propose a modified encoder-decoder architecture based on the\nmasked autoencoder framework, designed to address this inefficiency within a\nBERT-based transformer.

Second, we\nfurther extend SeaL to SeaL-C to ensure rigorous completeness during search.\nOur evaluation across three real-world planning tasks demonstrates that SeaL\nachieves near-perfect accuracy while reducing search spaces by up to 99.1%\ncompared to traditional approaches. Finally, we explore how far LLMs are from\nreal search by investigating whether they can develop search capabilities\nindependently. Our analysis reveals that while current LLMs struggle with\nefficient search in complex problems, incorporating systematic search\nstrategies significantly enhances their problem-solving capabilities. These\nfindings not only validate the effectiveness of our approach but also highlight\nthe need for improving LLMs' search abilities for real-world applications."

This work presents a low-complexity\ngenerative modeling approach that simultaneously estimates the wireless channel\nand its physical parameters without additional computational overhead.

Graph reconstruction, verification, and property testing are all types\nof graph inference.\n  In this work, we study graph inference using an oracle that returns the\neffective resistance (ER) between a pair of vertices. Effective resistance is a\ndistance originating from the study of electrical circuits with many\napplications. However, ER has received little attention from a graph inference\nperspective. Indeed, although it is known that an $n$-vertex graph can be\nuniquely reconstructed from all $\\binom{n}{2}$ possible ER queries, little else\nis known. We address this gap with several new results, including:\n  1. $O(n)$-query algorithms for testing whether a graph is a tree; deciding\nwhether two graphs are equal assuming one is a subgraph of the other; and\ntesting whether a given vertex (or edge) is a cut vertex (or cut edge).\n  2. Property testing algorithms, including for testing whether a graph is\nvertex- or edge-biconnected. We also give a reduction to adapt property testing\nresults from the bounded-degree model to our ER query model. This yields\nER-query-based algorithms for testing $k$-connectivity, bipartiteness,\nplanarity, and containment of a fixed subgraph.\n  3. Graph reconstruction algorithms, including an algorithm for reconstructing\na graph from a low-width tree decomposition; a $\\Theta(k^2)$-query,\npolynomial-time algorithm for recovering the adjacency matrix $A$ of a hidden\ngraph, given $A$ with $k$ of its entries deleted; and a $k$-query,\nexponential-time algorithm for the same task.\n  We also compare the power of ER queries and shortest path queries, which are\nclosely related but better studied.

                "summary": "The centrality in a network is often used to measure nodes' importance and\nmodel network effects on a certain outcome.

However, it remains\nunclear whether LLMs reason. It is an open problem how traditional neural\nnetworks can be qualitatively extended to go beyond the statistic paradigm and\nachieve high-level cognition. Here, we present a novel qualitative extension by\ngeneralising computational building blocks from vectors to spheres. We propose\nSphere Neural Networks (SphNNs) for human-like reasoning through model\nconstruction and inspection, and develop SphNN for syllogistic reasoning, a\nmicrocosm of human rationality. SphNN is a hierarchical neuro-symbolic\nKolmogorov-Arnold geometric GNN, and uses a neuro-symbolic transition map of\nneighbourhood spatial relations to transform the current sphere configuration\ntowards the target. SphNN is the first neural model that can determine the\nvalidity of long-chained syllogistic reasoning in one epoch without training\ndata, with the worst computational complexity of O(N). SphNN can evolve into\nvarious types of reasoning, such as spatio-temporal reasoning, logical\nreasoning with negation and disjunction, event reasoning, neuro-symbolic\nunification, and humour understanding (the highest level of cognition). All\nthese suggest a new kind of Herbert A. Simon's scissors with two neural blades.\nSphNNs will tremendously enhance interdisciplinary collaborations to develop\nthe two neural blades and realise deterministic neural reasoning and\nhuman-bounded rationality and elevate LLMs to reliable psychological AI. This\nwork suggests that the non-zero radii of spheres are the missing components\nthat prevent traditional deep-learning systems from reaching the realm of\nrational reasoning and cause LLMs to be trapped in the swamp of hallucination.",

                    "value": "The success of Large Language Models (LLMs), e.g., ChatGPT, is witnessed by\ntheir planetary popularity, their capability of human-like communication, and\nalso by their steadily improved reasoning performance. However, it remains\nunclear whether LLMs reason. It is an open problem how traditional neural\nnetworks can be qualitatively extended to go beyond the statistic paradigm and\nachieve high-level cognition. Here, we present a novel qualitative extension by\ngeneralising computational building blocks from vectors to spheres. We propose\nSphere Neural Networks (SphNNs) for human-like reasoning through model\nconstruction and inspection, and develop SphNN for syllogistic reasoning, a\nmicrocosm of human rationality. SphNN is a hierarchical neuro-symbolic\nKolmogorov-Arnold geometric GNN, and uses a neuro-symbolic transition map of\nneighbourhood spatial relations to transform the current sphere configuration\ntowards the target. SphNN is the first neural model that can determine the\nvalidity of long-chained syllogistic reasoning in one epoch without training\ndata, with the worst computational complexity of O(N). SphNN can evolve into\nvarious types of reasoning, such as spatio-temporal reasoning, logical\nreasoning with negation and disjunction, event reasoning, neuro-symbolic\nunification, and humour understanding (the highest level of cognition). All\nthese suggest a new kind of Herbert A. Simon's scissors with two neural blades.\nSphNNs will tremendously enhance interdisciplinary collaborations to develop\nthe two neural blades and realise deterministic neural reasoning and\nhuman-bounded rationality and elevate LLMs to reliable psychological AI. This\nwork suggests that the non-zero radii of spheres are the missing components\nthat prevent traditional deep-learning systems from reaching the realm of\nrational reasoning and cause LLMs to be trapped in the swamp of hallucination."

The recent advent of large language models (LLMs) provides\ndisruptively new solution to this long-standing problem. While the latest\nresearches mostly stick to primitive zero-shot LLMs lacking specialized\nmaterial knowledge, we introduce in this work the few-shot LLM in-context\nlearning paradigm.

We approximate the\ninfinite-dimensional Langevin diffusion via a projection onto the first $M$\ncomponents of the Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\\`eve expansion. Exploiting the thus\nobtained approximate posterior for these $M$ components, we perform inference\nfor $\\Pi_{\\text{B}}$ by relying on the law of total probability and a\nsufficiency assumption. The resulting method scales as $O(M^3+JM^2)$, where $J$\nis the number of samples produced from the posterior measure $\\Pi_{\\text{B}}$.\nInterestingly, the algorithm recovers the posterior arising from the sparse\nvariational Gaussian process (SVGP) (see Titsias, 2009) as a special case, owed\nto the fact that the sufficiency assumption underlies both methods. However,\nwhereas the SVGP is parametrically constrained to be a Gaussian process, our\nmethod is based on a non-parametric variational family\n$\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{R}^M)$ consisting of all probability measures on\n$\\mathbb{R}^M$. As a result, our method is provably close to the optimal\n$M$-dimensional variational approximation of the Bayes posterior\n$\\Pi_{\\text{B}}$ in $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{R}^M)$ for convex and Lipschitz\ncontinuous negative log likelihoods, and coincides with SVGP for the special\ncase of a Gaussian error likelihood.",

The creation of CDTs requires precise information about the\nelectrode position on the torso, especially for the personalized\nelectrocardiogram (ECG) calibration. However, current studies commonly rely on\nadditional acquisition of torso imaging and manual/semi-automatic methods for\nECG electrode localization. In this study, we propose a novel and efficient\ntopology-informed model to fully automatically extract personalized ECG\nstandard electrode locations from 2D clinically standard cardiac MRIs.\nSpecifically, we obtain the sparse torso contours from the cardiac MRIs and\nthen localize the standard electrodes of 12-lead ECG from the contours. Cardiac\nMRIs aim at imaging of the heart instead of the torso, leading to incomplete\ntorso geometry within the imaging. To tackle the missing topology, we\nincorporate the electrodes as a subset of the keypoints, which can be\nexplicitly aligned with the 3D torso topology. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the time-consuming conventional\nmodel projection-based method in terms of accuracy (Euclidean distance: $1.24\n\\pm 0.293$ cm vs. $1.48 \\pm 0.362$ cm) and efficiency ($2$~s vs.\n$30$-$35$~min).

In this paper, we seek for empirical answers to this\nquestion by investigating various data-driven strategies that offer supervision\ndata at different quality levels upon tasks of varying complexity. Two\nintuitive strategies emerge for teacher models to provide supervision during\nalignment training: 1) using lower-quality supervision from complete tasks that\nmatch the difficulty of the target reasoning tasks, and 2) leveraging\nhigher-quality supervision from easier subtasks that are less challenging.\nInterestingly, we find that even when the outcome error rate for hard task\nsupervision is high (e.g., 90\\%), training on such data can outperform\nperfectly correct supervision of easier subtasks on multiple hard math\nbenchmarks. We further identify a more critical factor influencing training\nperformance: step-wise error rates, which indicate the severity of errors in\nsolutions. Specifically, training on hard task supervision with the same\noutcome error rates but disparate step-wise error rates can lead to a 30\\%\naccuracy gap on MATH benchmark. Our results also reveal that supplementing hard\ntask supervision with the corresponding subtask supervision can yield notable\nperformance improvements than simply combining rephrased hard full task\nsupervision, suggesting new avenues for data augmentation.

Two\nintuitive strategies emerge for teacher models to provide supervision during\nalignment training: 1) using lower-quality supervision from complete tasks that\nmatch the difficulty of the target reasoning tasks, and 2) leveraging\nhigher-quality supervision from easier subtasks that are less challenging.\nInterestingly, we find that even when the outcome error rate for hard task\nsupervision is high (e.g., 90\\%), training on such data can outperform\nperfectly correct supervision of easier subtasks on multiple hard math\nbenchmarks. We further identify a more critical factor influencing training\nperformance: step-wise error rates, which indicate the severity of errors in\nsolutions. Specifically, training on hard task supervision with the same\noutcome error rates but disparate step-wise error rates can lead to a 30\\%\naccuracy gap on MATH benchmark. Our results also reveal that supplementing hard\ntask supervision with the corresponding subtask supervision can yield notable\nperformance improvements than simply combining rephrased hard full task\nsupervision, suggesting new avenues for data augmentation.

We then propose a transformation of reward functions inspired\nby economic theory of utility functions (specifically Inada conditions), that\nenhances sensitivity to low reward values while diminishing sensitivity to\nalready high values. We compare our approach to the existing baseline methods\nthat linearly aggregate rewards and show how the Inada-inspired reward feedback\nis superior to traditional weighted averaging. We quantitatively and\nqualitatively analyse the difference in the methods, and see that models\ntrained with Inada-transformations score as more helpful while being less\nharmful."

Drawing inspiration from recent discussions on search and learning, we\nsystematically explore the complementary relationship between search and Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) from three perspectives. First, we analyze how learning\ncan enhance search efficiency and propose Search via Learning (SeaL), a\nframework that leverages LLMs for effective and efficient search. Second, we\nfurther extend SeaL to SeaL-C to ensure rigorous completeness during search.\nOur evaluation across three real-world planning tasks demonstrates that SeaL\nachieves near-perfect accuracy while reducing search spaces by up to 99.1%\ncompared to traditional approaches.

Drawing inspiration from recent discussions on search and learning, we\nsystematically explore the complementary relationship between search and Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) from three perspectives. First, we analyze how learning\ncan enhance search efficiency and propose Search via Learning (SeaL), a\nframework that leverages LLMs for effective and efficient search. Second, we\nfurther extend SeaL to SeaL-C to ensure rigorous completeness during search.\nOur evaluation across three real-world planning tasks demonstrates that SeaL\nachieves near-perfect accuracy while reducing search spaces by up to 99.1%\ncompared to traditional approaches. Finally, we explore how far LLMs are from\nreal search by investigating whether they can develop search capabilities\nindependently.

We explore a framework where the model\nverifies its own outputs, filters or reweights data based on this verification,\nand distills the filtered data. Despite several empirical successes, a\nfundamental understanding is still lacking. In this work, we initiate a\ncomprehensive, modular and controlled study on LLM self-improvement. We provide\na mathematical formulation for self-improvement, which is largely governed by a\nquantity which we formalize as the generation-verification gap. Through\nexperiments with various model families and tasks, we discover a scaling\nphenomenon of self-improvement -- a variant of the generation-verification gap\nscales monotonically with the model pre-training flops. We also examine when\nself-improvement is possible, an iterative self-improvement procedure, and ways\nto improve its performance.

We explore a framework where the model\nverifies its own outputs, filters or reweights data based on this verification,\nand distills the filtered data. Despite several empirical successes, a\nfundamental understanding is still lacking. In this work, we initiate a\ncomprehensive, modular and controlled study on LLM self-improvement. We provide\na mathematical formulation for self-improvement, which is largely governed by a\nquantity which we formalize as the generation-verification gap. Through\nexperiments with various model families and tasks, we discover a scaling\nphenomenon of self-improvement -- a variant of the generation-verification gap\nscales monotonically with the model pre-training flops. We also examine when\nself-improvement is possible, an iterative self-improvement procedure, and ways\nto improve its performance. Our findings not only advance understanding of LLM\nself-improvement with practical implications, but also open numerous avenues\nfor future research into its capabilities and boundaries."

We show that WiCkeD can be\nautomatically applied to any existing benchmark, making it more challenging. We\napply WiCkeD to 6 popular benchmarks and use it to evaluate 18 open-weight\nLLMs. The performance of the models drops 12.1 points on average with respect\nto the original versions of the datasets. When using chain-of-thought on 3 MMLU\ndatasets, the performance drop for the WiCkeD variant is similar to the one\nobserved when using the LLMs directly, showing that WiCkeD is also challenging\nfor models with enhanced reasoning abilities. WiCkeD also uncovers that some\nmodels are more sensitive to the extra reasoning required, providing additional\ninformation with respect to the original benchmarks.

We show that WiCkeD can be\nautomatically applied to any existing benchmark, making it more challenging. We\napply WiCkeD to 6 popular benchmarks and use it to evaluate 18 open-weight\nLLMs. The performance of the models drops 12.1 points on average with respect\nto the original versions of the datasets. When using chain-of-thought on 3 MMLU\ndatasets, the performance drop for the WiCkeD variant is similar to the one\nobserved when using the LLMs directly, showing that WiCkeD is also challenging\nfor models with enhanced reasoning abilities. WiCkeD also uncovers that some\nmodels are more sensitive to the extra reasoning required, providing additional\ninformation with respect to the original benchmarks.

The system leverages\ndiscourse coherence relations to enhance its contextual understanding and\ncommunication abilities. To train this system, we introduce a novel\nclustering-based active learning mechanism that utilizes an external Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) to identify informative instances. Our approach is\nevaluated using a newly created multimodal dataset comprising 1K safety\nviolations extracted from 2K Reddit images. These violations are annotated\nusing a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) and verified by human annotators. Results\nwith this dataset demonstrate that our approach improves resolution of safety\nsituations, user sentiment, as well as safety of the conversation. Next, we\ndeploy our dialogue system on a Hello Robot Stretch robot and conduct a\nwithin-subject user study with real-world participants. In the study,\nparticipants role-play two safety scenarios with different levels of severity\nwith the robot and receive interventions from our model and a baseline system\npowered by OpenAI's ChatGPT. The study results corroborate and extend the\nfindings from the automated evaluation, showing that our proposed system is\nmore persuasive in a real-world embodied agent setting.",

To address this, we employed Opinion QA Based\nParameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), specifically Quantized Low-Rank\nAdaptation (QLoRA), to manipulate the Big Five personality traits: Openness,\nConscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. After PEFT,\nmodels such as Mistral-7B-Instruct and LLaMA-2-7B-chat showed a latent\nbehaviour by generating emojis for certain traits, despite no emojis being\npresent in the PEFT data. For instance, LLaMA-2-7B-chat generated emojis in\n99.5\\% of extraversion-related test instances, while Mistral-7B-Instruct did so\nin 92.5\\% of openness-related test instances. ICL Explainability analysis\nindicated that the LLMs used emojis intentionally to express these traits.\nMechanistic Interpretability analysis showed that this latent behaviour of LLMs\ncould be traced to specific neurons that became activated or amplified after\nPEFT. This paper provides a number of novel contributions. First, introducing\nan Opinion QA dataset for PEFT-driven personality manipulation; second,\ndeveloping metric models to benchmark LLM personality traits; third,\ndemonstrating PEFT's superiority over IKE in personality manipulation; and\nfinally, analysing and validating emoji usage through explainability methods\nsuch as Mechanistic Interpretability and In-context learning Explainability\nmethods.",

Our study delves into the sub-problems\nwithin these core challenges, such as input representation, chunking,\nprompting, and selection of LLMs and multimodal models. It examines the\noutcomes of different design choices through a new layout-aware IE test suite,\nbenchmarking against the state-of-art (SoA) model LayoutLMv3. The results show\nthat the configuration from one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) trial achieves\nnear-optimal results with 14.1 points F1-score gain from the baseline model,\nwhile full factorial exploration yields only a slightly higher 15.1 points gain\nat around 36x greater token usage.

Traditional\napproaches for simulating echo chamber formation have often relied on\npredefined rules and numerical simulations, which, while insightful, may lack\nthe nuance needed to capture complex, real-world interactions. In this paper,\nwe present a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as\ngenerative agents to simulate echo chamber dynamics within social networks. The\nnovelty of our approach is that it incorporates both opinion updates and\nnetwork rewiring behaviors driven by LLMs, allowing for a context-aware and\nsemantically rich simulation of social interactions. Additionally, we utilize\nreal-world Twitter (now X) data to benchmark the LLM-based simulation against\nactual social media behaviors, providing insights into the accuracy and realism\nof the generated opinion trends. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of LLMs\nin modeling echo chamber formation, capturing both structural and semantic\ndimensions of opinion clustering. %This work contributes to a deeper\nunderstanding of social influence dynamics and offers a new tool for studying\npolarization in online communities.",

Traditional\napproaches for simulating echo chamber formation have often relied on\npredefined rules and numerical simulations, which, while insightful, may lack\nthe nuance needed to capture complex, real-world interactions. In this paper,\nwe present a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as\ngenerative agents to simulate echo chamber dynamics within social networks. The\nnovelty of our approach is that it incorporates both opinion updates and\nnetwork rewiring behaviors driven by LLMs, allowing for a context-aware and\nsemantically rich simulation of social interactions. Additionally, we utilize\nreal-world Twitter (now X) data to benchmark the LLM-based simulation against\nactual social media behaviors, providing insights into the accuracy and realism\nof the generated opinion trends. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of LLMs\nin modeling echo chamber formation, capturing both structural and semantic\ndimensions of opinion clustering. %This work contributes to a deeper\nunderstanding of social influence dynamics and offers a new tool for studying\npolarization in online communities."

For instance, MQM\n(Multidimensional Quality Metrics), a complex scheme and the de facto standard\nfor non-literary human MT evaluation, is largely inadequate for literary\ntranslation evaluation: with student evaluators, nearly 60% of human\ntranslations are misjudged as indistinguishable or inferior to machine\ntranslations. In contrast, BWS (BEST-WORST SCALING), a much simpler scheme,\nidentifies human translations at a rate of 80-100%. Automatic metrics fare\ndramatically worse, with rates of at most 20%.

To mitigate the dependence on retrieval and simultaneously\nmaintain, or even improve, the performance benefits provided by retrieval, we\npropose a method to detect the knowledge boundary of VLLMs, allowing for more\nefficient use of techniques like RAG. Specifically, we propose a method with\ntwo variants that fine-tunes a VLLM on an automatically constructed dataset for\nboundary identification.

To mitigate the dependence on retrieval and simultaneously\nmaintain, or even improve, the performance benefits provided by retrieval, we\npropose a method to detect the knowledge boundary of VLLMs, allowing for more\nefficient use of techniques like RAG.
