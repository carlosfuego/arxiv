We develop a holistic\nscheduling algorithm based on this approach, and we experimentally study its\nperformance and properties on a small benchmark of computational tasks.

For different\nPPML frameworks, Ironman demonstrates a 2.1-3.4 times reduction in end-to-end\nlatency for both CNN and Transformer models."

Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic\nattention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while\npreserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are\noften limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating\nmechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent\nstate-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports\nconstant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more\nflexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global\ncontext compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory,\nforming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and\nfine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware\nalgorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive\nexperiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher\nmodel's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while\nsignificantly outperforming previous linearization methods. On the 5-shot MMLU\nbenchmark, Lizard improves over prior models by 18 points and shows significant\nimprovements on associative recall tasks.",

However, the LLMs still need to encode the entire context for\neach query, leading to redundant computation. In this paper, we investigate a\nnew strategy to eliminate such inefficiency, where the KV cache of each\ndocument is precomputed independently. During inference, the KV caches of\nretrieved documents are concatenated, allowing the model to reuse cached\nrepresentations instead of recomputing them. To mitigate the performance\ndegradation when using KV caches computed independently for each document,\nKVLink introduces two key techniques: adjusting positional embeddings of the KV\ncache at inference to match the global position after concatenation, and using\ntrainable special tokens to restore self-attention across independently encoded\ndocuments. Experiments across 7 datasets demonstrate that KVLink improves\nquestion answering accuracy by an average of 4% over state-of-the-art methods.\nFurthermore, by leveraging precomputed KV caches, our approach reduces\ntime-to-first-token by up to 96% compared to standard LLM inference, making it\na scalable and efficient solution for context reuse.

Many studies have attempted to use\ncaching to reduce the time consumption of sampling. Existing caching methods\naccelerate generation by reusing DiT features from the previous time step and\nskipping calculations in the next, but they tend to locate and cache low-error\nmodules without focusing on reducing caching-induced errors, resulting in a\nsharp decline in generated content quality when increasing caching intensity.\nTo solve this problem, we propose the \\textbf{E}rror-\\textbf{O}ptimized\n\\textbf{C}ache (\\textbf{EOC}).

We apply PINT to the ERA5\nWeatherBench dataset, focusing on long-term forecasting of 2m-temperature data.\nPINT incorporates the Simple Harmonic Oscillator Equation as a physics-informed\nprior, embedding its periodic dynamics into RNN, LSTM, and GRU architectures.\nThis equation's analytical solutions (sine and cosine functions) facilitate\nrigorous evaluation of the benefits of incorporating physics-informed\nconstraints.

Using only the first\n90 days of observed data, it iteratively predicts the next two years,\naddressing challenges posed by limited real-time updates.

Although much\nwork was done in the past to enable the reuse of prefix KV caches across inputs\nfor a single model, how to enable one model to reuse the prefix KV caches of a\ndifferent model remains an open question.\n  We introduce DroidSpeak, the first distributed LLM inference system that\nenables KV cache reuse across distributed nodes running inference of different\nLLMs, so long as the LLMs have the same architecture. We present the first\nstudy that aims at understanding the impact of sharing KV caches across\ndifferent LLMs, and if/when such sharing affects quality.

Moreover, carefully pipelining the layer-wise\nre-computation and the loading of reused KV cache further improves the\ninference performance. Experiments on diverse datasets and model pairs\ndemonstrate that DroidSpeak achieves up to 4x throughput improvement and about\n3.1x faster prefill (time to first token), with negligible loss of quality in\nF1 scores, Rouge-L or code similarity score, compared to the baseline which\ndoes not allow any sharing across models.",

However,\nwe have found that client-side state (e.g., caching) is not only ineffective\nbut also consumes valuable memory resources in the deep learning pipelines. We\nthus propose FalconFS, a DFS optimized for deep learning pipelines with the\nstateless-client architecture. Specifically, instead of performing client-side\npath resolution and caching, FalconFS efficiently resolves paths on the server\nside using hybrid metadata indexing and lazy namespace replication. FalconFS\nalso boosts server concurrency with concurrent request merging and provides\neasy deployment with VFS shortcut. Evaluations against CephFS and Lustre show\nthat FalconFS achieves up to 5.72$\\times$ throughput for small file read/write\nand up to 12.81$\\times$ throughput for deep learning model training.

However,\nwe have found that client-side state (e.g., caching) is not only ineffective\nbut also consumes valuable memory resources in the deep learning pipelines. We\nthus propose FalconFS, a DFS optimized for deep learning pipelines with the\nstateless-client architecture. Specifically, instead of performing client-side\npath resolution and caching, FalconFS efficiently resolves paths on the server\nside using hybrid metadata indexing and lazy namespace replication. FalconFS\nalso boosts server concurrency with concurrent request merging and provides\neasy deployment with VFS shortcut. Evaluations against CephFS and Lustre show\nthat FalconFS achieves up to 5.72$\\times$ throughput for small file read/write\nand up to 12.81$\\times$ throughput for deep learning model training. FalconFS\nhas been running in Huawei autonomous driving system's production environment\nwith 10,000 NPUs for one year."

On the one hand, the low-level key-value (KV) cache working at the\ntoken level is widely adopted, albeit it incurs significant overhead as request\nvolume grows. On the other hand, instruction-level caching, which stores full\ninstruction-response pairs, is expected to play an increasingly crucial role.\nHowever, the high variability in the content and length of instructions make it\nrare for identical instructions to recur within a short time window, presenting\nchallenges for effective caching instruction-response pairs. To address this\nchallenge, we propose InstCache, a predictive caching mechanism for LLM serving\nsystems. Leveraging the capability of LLMs, we can effectively reorder the\nrepresentation space of instruction texts and develop a sufficient level of\nspatial locality. Such spatial locality enables us to predict potential\ninstructions located in a compact region in the space, resulting in an\neffective caching system at runtime. Experimental results demonstrate that\nInstCache achieves a 2.3x higher hit rate compared to the upper bound of\ntraditional caching mechanisms on WildChat dataset and reduces the time per\noutput token of vLLM by up to 42.0% and 50.0% on LMSys and Moss datasets,\nrespectively.",

To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce\nchain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages\nGPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift\nmodel behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning\nor prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning\nbenchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative\nstructure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to\nprior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our\none-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of\nhyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration,\nmaking it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.",

To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce\nchain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages\nGPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift\nmodel behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning\nor prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning\nbenchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative\nstructure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to\nprior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our\none-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of\nhyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration,\nmaking it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation."

The task attracted over 50 international teams across all\ntracks. The submitted models were evaluated against gold-standard human\nannotations, and the results, while promising, show that there is still\nsignificant room for improvement in this domain: the best results for the four\npedagogical ability assessment tracks range between macro F1 scores of 58.34\n(for providing guidance) and 71.81 (for mistake identification) on three-class\nproblems, with the best F1 score in the tutor identification track reaching\n96.98 on a 9-class task.

To\naddress this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers\nwith highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a\nfixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer\npairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention\ndynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern\nsimilarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable\naccuracy degradation.\n  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and\nefficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies\nbased on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a\nrecomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key\ninnovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical\ncontext for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the\nconversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to\nmitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model\ngeneration; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles\nbrought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV\ncaches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul\nachieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x\nreduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without\ncompromising generation quality.",

                "summary": "Auto-regressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable\nperformance across different domains such as vision and language processing.\nHowever, due to sequential processing through a stack of transformer layers,\nautoregressive decoding faces significant computation/latency challenges,\nparticularly in resource-constrained environments like mobile and edge devices.\nExisting approaches in literature that aim to improve latency via skipping\nlayers have two distinct flavors - 1) Early exit, and 2) Input-agnostic\nheuristics where tokens exit at pre-determined layers irrespective of input\nsequence. Both the above strategies have limitations - the former cannot be\napplied to handle KV Caching necessary for speed-ups in modern framework and\nthe latter does not capture the variation in layer importance across tasks or\nmore generally, across input sequences. To address both limitations, we propose\nFiRST, an algorithm that reduces inference latency by using layer-specific\nrouters to select a subset of transformer layers adaptively for each input\nsequence - the prompt (during the prefill stage) decides which layers will be\nskipped during decoding. FiRST preserves compatibility with KV caching enabling\nfaster inference while being quality-aware. FiRST is model-agnostic and can be\neasily enabled on any pre-trained LLM.

Both the above strategies have limitations - the former cannot be\napplied to handle KV Caching necessary for speed-ups in modern framework and\nthe latter does not capture the variation in layer importance across tasks or\nmore generally, across input sequences. To address both limitations, we propose\nFiRST, an algorithm that reduces inference latency by using layer-specific\nrouters to select a subset of transformer layers adaptively for each input\nsequence - the prompt (during the prefill stage) decides which layers will be\nskipped during decoding. FiRST preserves compatibility with KV caching enabling\nfaster inference while being quality-aware. FiRST is model-agnostic and can be\neasily enabled on any pre-trained LLM.

This paradigm requires\nsingle photons which are entangled into small resource states before being fed\ninto a fusion network.

The realization of a\nsingle reliable deterministic source requires many redundant probabilistic\nsources and a complex optical network for rerouting and retiming probabilistic\noutputs. In this work, we show how optomechanics enables reliable production of\nresources for photonic quantum computing without the redundancy of the\nall-optical approach. This is achieved by using acoustic modes as caches of\nquantum resources, ranging from single-particle states to small entangled\nstates, with on-demand read-out. The advantages of acoustic modes as optical\nquantum memories, compared to other technologies, include their intrinsically\nlong lifetimes and that they are solid state, highly tailorable, and\ninsensitive to electromagnetic noise. We show how the resource states can be\nprepared directly in the acoustic modes using optical controls. This is still\nprobabilistic and heralded, as in the all-optical approach, but the acoustic\nmodes act as a quantum memory which is integrated into the production of the\nstates.

Utilizing late binding\nand model swapping, Torpor can concurrently serve hundreds of inference\nfunctions on a worker node with 4 GPUs, while achieving latency performance\ncomparable to native execution, where each model is cached exclusively on a\nGPU. Pilot deployment in a leading commercial serverless cloud shows that\nTorpor reduces the GPU provisioning cost by 70% and 65% for users and the\nplatform, respectively."

Cache-based surrogates\nuse already calculated simulation results to interpolate or extrapolate further\nsimulation output values. But this approach only pays off if the access time to\nretrieve the needed values is much faster than the actual simulation. While the\nmost existing key-value stores use a Client-Server architecture with dedicated\nstorage nodes, this is not the most suitable architecture for HPC applications.\nInstead, we propose a distributed architecture where the parallel processes\noffer a part of their available memory to build a shared distributed hash table\nbased on MPI.

                    "value": "Surrogate models can play a pivotal role in enhancing performance in\ncontemporary High-Performance Computing applications. Cache-based surrogates\nuse already calculated simulation results to interpolate or extrapolate further\nsimulation output values. But this approach only pays off if the access time to\nretrieve the needed values is much faster than the actual simulation. While the\nmost existing key-value stores use a Client-Server architecture with dedicated\nstorage nodes, this is not the most suitable architecture for HPC applications.\nInstead, we propose a distributed architecture where the parallel processes\noffer a part of their available memory to build a shared distributed hash table\nbased on MPI.

To identify these\nheads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies\nhead-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis.

Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal\nbenchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency\ntrade-offs.

It also incorporates pre-gated\nrouting, enabling memory-efficient expert loading and faster inference. As the\nfirst instantiation of the Megrez2 architecture, we introduce the\nMegrez2-Preview model, which is pre-trained on a 5-trillion-token corpus and\nfurther enhanced through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with\nverifiable rewards. With only 3B activated and 7.5B stored parameters,\nMegrez2-Preview demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to\nlarger models on a wide range of tasks, including language understanding,\ninstruction following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation.

Such an assumption restricts their\napplicability in real-world scenarios, where unknown classes naturally emerge\nduring inference, and are absent during training. In this paper, we explore a\nmore challenging open-set graph class-incremental learning scenario with two\nintertwined challenges: catastrophic forgetting of old classes, which impairs\nthe detection of unknown classes, and inadequate open-set recognition, which\ndestabilizes the retention of learned knowledge. To address the above problems,\na novel OGCIL framework is proposed, which utilizes pseudo-sample embedding\ngeneration to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting and enable robust\ndetection of unknown classes.

To handle\nunknown classes, we employ a mixing-based strategy to generate\nout-of-distribution (OOD) samples from pseudo in-distribution and current node\nembeddings. A novel prototypical hypersphere classification loss is further\nproposed, which anchors in-distribution embeddings to their respective class\nprototypes, while repelling OOD embeddings away.

Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness\nof LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both\nbenign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's\nadaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute\nreductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning\nattacks.

Yet, building MCP servers remains manual and\nrepetitive, requiring developers to write glue code, handle authentication, and\nconfigure schemas by hand-replicating much of the integration effort MCP aims\nto eliminate.\n  This paper investigates whether MCP server construction can be meaningfully\nautomated. We begin by analyzing adoption trends: among 22,000+ MCP-tagged\nGitHub repositories created within six months of release, fewer than 5% include\nservers, typically small, single-maintainer projects dominated by repetitive\nscaffolding. To address this gap, we present AutoMCP, a compiler that generates\nMCP servers from OpenAPI 2.0/3.0 specifications. AutoMCP parses REST API\ndefinitions and produces complete server implementations, including schema\nregistration and authentication handling.\n  We evaluate AutoMCP on 50 real-world APIs spanning 5,066 endpoints across\nover 10 domains.

Manual failure analysis revealed five recurring issues, all\nattributable to inconsistencies or omissions in the OpenAPI contracts.

Despite the remarkable progress,\nstate-of-the-art MMT approaches often rely on paired image-text inputs at\ninference and are sensitive to irrelevant visual noise, which limits their\nrobustness and practical applicability. To address these issues, we propose\nD2P-MMT, a diffusion-based dual-branch prompting framework for robust\nvision-guided translation. Specifically, D2P-MMT requires only the source text\nand a reconstructed image generated by a pre-trained diffusion model, which\nnaturally filters out distracting visual details while preserving semantic\ncues. During training, the model jointly learns from both authentic and\nreconstructed images using a dual-branch prompting strategy, encouraging rich\ncross-modal interactions. To bridge the modality gap and mitigate\ntraining-inference discrepancies, we introduce a distributional alignment loss\nthat enforces consistency between the output distributions of the two branches.\nExtensive experiments on the Multi30K dataset demonstrate that D2P-MMT achieves\nsuperior translation performance compared to existing state-of-the-art\napproaches.",

                    "value": "Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) typically enhances text-only translation\nby incorporating aligned visual features. Despite the remarkable progress,\nstate-of-the-art MMT approaches often rely on paired image-text inputs at\ninference and are sensitive to irrelevant visual noise, which limits their\nrobustness and practical applicability. To address these issues, we propose\nD2P-MMT, a diffusion-based dual-branch prompting framework for robust\nvision-guided translation. Specifically, D2P-MMT requires only the source text\nand a reconstructed image generated by a pre-trained diffusion model, which\nnaturally filters out distracting visual details while preserving semantic\ncues. During training, the model jointly learns from both authentic and\nreconstructed images using a dual-branch prompting strategy, encouraging rich\ncross-modal interactions. To bridge the modality gap and mitigate\ntraining-inference discrepancies, we introduce a distributional alignment loss\nthat enforces consistency between the output distributions of the two branches.\nExtensive experiments on the Multi30K dataset demonstrate that D2P-MMT achieves\nsuperior translation performance compared to existing state-of-the-art\napproaches."

We also present\ngender-disaggregated ASR performance evaluation. For very low-resource\nlanguages, gains varied: Chichewa WER improved about 6.5% relative with a 1:2\nreal-to-synthetic ratio; a 1:1 ratio for Dholuo showed similar improvements on\nsome evaluation data, but not on others.

While\nthese results are shown for NVIDIA GPUs, they can be applied similarly to other\nAI accelerator designs (XPUs) that share the same fundamental limitation of\nfixed memory to compute."

InstructVLA introduces a novel training paradigm,\nVision-Language-Action Instruction Tuning (VLA-IT), which employs multimodal\ntraining with mixture-of-experts adaptation to jointly optimize textual\nreasoning and action generation on both standard VLM corpora and a curated\n650K-sample VLA-IT dataset. On in-domain SimplerEnv tasks, InstructVLA achieves\n30.5% improvement over SpatialVLA. To evaluate generalization, we introduce\nSimplerEnv-Instruct, an 80-task benchmark requiring closed-loop control and\nhigh-level instruction understanding, where it outperforms a fine-tuned OpenVLA\nby 92% and an action expert aided by GPT-4o by 29%. Additionally, InstructVLA\nsurpasses baseline VLMs on multimodal tasks and exhibits inference-time scaling\nby leveraging textual reasoning to boost manipulation performance in both\nsimulated and real-world settings.

However,\nexisting recommender systems primarily focus on users' interaction behaviors\nwith videos, neglecting comment content and interaction in user preference\nmodeling. In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation approach called\nLSVCR that utilizes user interaction histories with both videos and comments to\njointly perform personalized video and comment recommendation. Specifically,\nour approach comprises two key components: sequential recommendation (SR) model\nand supplemental large language model (LLM) recommender. The SR model functions\nas the primary recommendation backbone (retained in deployment) of our method\nfor efficient user preference modeling. Concurrently, we employ a LLM as the\nsupplemental recommender (discarded in deployment) to better capture underlying\nuser preferences derived from heterogeneous interaction behaviors. In order to\nintegrate the strengths of the SR model and the supplemental LLM recommender,\nwe introduce a two-stage training paradigm. The first stage, personalized\npreference alignment, aims to align the preference representations from both\ncomponents, thereby enhancing the semantics of the SR model. The second stage,\nrecommendation-oriented fine-tuning, involves fine-tuning the\nalignment-enhanced SR model according to specific objectives. Extensive\nexperiments in both video and comment recommendation tasks demonstrate the\neffectiveness of LSVCR. Moreover, online A/B testing on KuaiShou platform\nverifies the practical benefits of our approach. In particular, we attain a\ncumulative gain of 4.13% in comment watch time.",

However, traditional approximate inference techniques\nmake little to no use of this available information. We propose the framework\nof post-process Bayesian inference as a means to obtain a quick posterior\napproximation from existing target density evaluations, with no further model\ncalls. Within this framework, we introduce Variational Sparse Bayesian\nQuadrature (VSBQ), a method for post-process approximate inference for models\nwith black-box and potentially noisy likelihoods. VSBQ reuses existing target\ndensity evaluations to build a sparse Gaussian process (GP) surrogate model of\nthe log posterior density function. Subsequently, we leverage sparse-GP\nBayesian quadrature combined with variational inference to achieve fast\napproximate posterior inference over the surrogate. We validate our method on\nchallenging synthetic scenarios and real-world applications from computational\nneuroscience. The experiments show that VSBQ builds high-quality posterior\napproximations by post-processing existing optimization traces, with no further\nmodel evaluations.",

However, traditional approximate inference techniques\nmake little to no use of this available information. We propose the framework\nof post-process Bayesian inference as a means to obtain a quick posterior\napproximation from existing target density evaluations, with no further model\ncalls. Within this framework, we introduce Variational Sparse Bayesian\nQuadrature (VSBQ), a method for post-process approximate inference for models\nwith black-box and potentially noisy likelihoods. VSBQ reuses existing target\ndensity evaluations to build a sparse Gaussian process (GP) surrogate model of\nthe log posterior density function. Subsequently, we leverage sparse-GP\nBayesian quadrature combined with variational inference to achieve fast\napproximate posterior inference over the surrogate. We validate our method on\nchallenging synthetic scenarios and real-world applications from computational\nneuroscience. The experiments show that VSBQ builds high-quality posterior\napproximations by post-processing existing optimization traces, with no further\nmodel evaluations."

Beyond\nreporting performance metrics, we aim to interpret what these results reveal\nabout the underlying possibilities and limitations of the VE task. We conduct a\nseries of experiments across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings,\nexploring how factors such as prompt design, the number and order of in-context\nexamples and access to visual information might affect VE performance. To\nfurther probe the reasoning processes of the model, we used explanation-based\nevaluations. Results indicate that three-shot inference outperforms the\nzero-shot baselines. However, additional examples introduce more noise than\nthey provide benefits. Additionally, the order of the labels in the prompt is a\ncritical factor that influences the predictions. In the absence of visual\ninformation, the model has a strong tendency to hallucinate and imagine\ncontent, raising questions about the model's over-reliance on linguistic\npriors. Fine-tuning yields strong results, achieving an accuracy of 83.3% on\nthe e-SNLI-VE dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art OFA-X model.\nAdditionally, the explanation evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model\nprovides semantically meaningful explanations similar to those of humans, with\na BERTScore F1-score of 89.2%. We do, however, find comparable BERTScore\nresults in experiments with limited vision, questioning the visual grounding of\nthis task.

Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the\nfull cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing\ndecoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of\ninputs. Notably, as cache retention rates decrease, our method exhibits\nincreasing performance advantages over existing approaches."

We find that professional personas\n(e.g., \"DevOps Engineer\") consistently elicit higher success rates than student\npersonas, and that the effectiveness of direct versus indirect phrasing is\ninverted depending on the prompting strategy.

In this paper, we propose a\nnovel Language-conditioned Open-Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation framework, named\nLOVMM, incorporating the large language model (LLM) and vision-language model\n(VLM) to tackle various mobile manipulation tasks in household environments.\nOur approach is capable of solving various OVMM tasks with free-form natural\nlanguage instructions (e.g. \"toss the food boxes on the office room desk to the\ntrash bin in the corner\", and \"pack the bottles from the bed to the box in the\nguestroom\"). Extensive experiments simulated in complex household environments\nshow strong zero-shot generalization and multi-task learning abilities of\nLOVMM. Moreover, our approach can also generalize to multiple tabletop\nmanipulation tasks and achieve better success rates compared to other\nstate-of-the-art methods."

                "summary": "With the rapid advancement of large foundation models, AIGC, cloud rendering,\nand real-time motion capture technologies, digital humans are now capable of\nachieving synchronized facial expressions and body movements, engaging in\nintelligent dialogues driven by natural language, and enabling the fast\ncreation of personalized avatars. While current mainstream approaches to\ndigital humans primarily focus on 3D models and 2D video-based representations,\ninteractive 2D cartoon-style digital humans have received relatively less\nattention. Compared to 3D digital humans that require complex modeling and high\nrendering costs, and 2D video-based solutions that lack flexibility and\nreal-time interactivity, 2D cartoon-style Live2D models offer a more efficient\nand expressive alternative. By simulating 3D-like motion through layered\nsegmentation without the need for traditional 3D modeling, Live2D enables\ndynamic and real-time manipulation. In this technical report, we present\nCartoonAlive, an innovative method for generating high-quality Live2D digital\nhumans from a single input portrait image. CartoonAlive leverages the shape\nbasis concept commonly used in 3D face modeling to construct facial blendshapes\nsuitable for Live2D. It then infers the corresponding blendshape weights based\non facial keypoints detected from the input image. This approach allows for the\nrapid generation of a highly expressive and visually accurate Live2D model that\nclosely resembles the input portrait, within less than half a minute. Our work\nprovides a practical and scalable solution for creating interactive 2D cartoon\ncharacters, opening new possibilities in digital content creation and virtual\ncharacter animation.

                    "value": "With the rapid advancement of large foundation models, AIGC, cloud rendering,\nand real-time motion capture technologies, digital humans are now capable of\nachieving synchronized facial expressions and body movements, engaging in\nintelligent dialogues driven by natural language, and enabling the fast\ncreation of personalized avatars. While current mainstream approaches to\ndigital humans primarily focus on 3D models and 2D video-based representations,\ninteractive 2D cartoon-style digital humans have received relatively less\nattention. Compared to 3D digital humans that require complex modeling and high\nrendering costs, and 2D video-based solutions that lack flexibility and\nreal-time interactivity, 2D cartoon-style Live2D models offer a more efficient\nand expressive alternative. By simulating 3D-like motion through layered\nsegmentation without the need for traditional 3D modeling, Live2D enables\ndynamic and real-time manipulation. In this technical report, we present\nCartoonAlive, an innovative method for generating high-quality Live2D digital\nhumans from a single input portrait image. CartoonAlive leverages the shape\nbasis concept commonly used in 3D face modeling to construct facial blendshapes\nsuitable for Live2D. It then infers the corresponding blendshape weights based\non facial keypoints detected from the input image. This approach allows for the\nrapid generation of a highly expressive and visually accurate Live2D model that\nclosely resembles the input portrait, within less than half a minute. Our work\nprovides a practical and scalable solution for creating interactive 2D cartoon\ncharacters, opening new possibilities in digital content creation and virtual\ncharacter animation.

By training foundation models on large-scale spectral\ndatasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support\ndiverse downstream applications.

This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve\nspectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between\nspectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information\nbetween embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework\nenabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We\ndemonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets\nimproves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and\nchemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and\nprecision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data.\nAdditionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities\noffer potential for anomaly detection.

Unlike earlier efforts that used\ninteractive voice response (IVR) technology to automate these surveys, voice AI\nenables a more natural and adaptive respondent experience as it is more robust\nto interruptions, corrections, and other idiosyncrasies of human speech.\n  We built and tested an AI system to conduct quantitative surveys based on\nlarge language models (LLM), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and speech\nsynthesis technologies. The system was specifically designed for quantitative\nresearch, and strictly adhered to research best practices like question order\nrandomization, answer order randomization, and exact wording.\n  To validate the system's effectiveness, we deployed it to conduct two pilot\nsurveys with the SSRS Opinion Panel and followed-up with a separate\nhuman-administered survey to assess respondent experiences. We measured three\nkey metrics: the survey completion rates, break-off rates, and respondent\nsatisfaction scores.

Results show\nthat symbiotic agents reduce decision errors fivefold compared to standalone\nLLM-based agents, while smaller language models (SLM) achieve similar accuracy\nwith a 99.9% reduction in GPU resource overhead and in near-real-time loops of\n82 ms. A multi-agent demonstration for collaborative RAN on the real-world\ntestbed highlights significant flexibility in service-level agreement and\nresource allocation, reducing RAN over-utilization by approximately 44%.\nDrawing on our findings and open-source implementations, we introduce the\nsymbiotic paradigm as the foundation for next-generation, AGI-driven\nnetworks-systems designed to remain adaptable, efficient, and trustworthy even\nas LLMs advance."

This study makes two key contributions. First,\nit introduces zero-shot Large Language Models (LLMs) as a novel approach for\ncross-lingual classification of negative campaigning. Using benchmark datasets\nin ten languages, we demonstrate that LLMs achieve performance on par with\nnative-speaking human coders and outperform conventional supervised machine\nlearning approaches. Second, we leverage this novel method to conduct the\nlargest cross-national study of negative campaigning to date, analyzing 18\nmillion tweets posted by parliamentarians in 19 European countries between 2017\nand 2022. The results reveal consistent cross-national patterns: governing\nparties are less likely to use negative messaging, while ideologically extreme\nand populist parties -- particularly those on the radical right -- engage in\nsignificantly higher levels of negativity. These findings advance our\nunderstanding of how party-level characteristics shape strategic communication\nin multiparty systems. More broadly, the study demonstrates the potential of\nLLMs to enable scalable, transparent, and replicable research in political\ncommunication across linguistic and cultural contexts.",

This study makes two key contributions. First,\nit introduces zero-shot Large Language Models (LLMs) as a novel approach for\ncross-lingual classification of negative campaigning. Using benchmark datasets\nin ten languages, we demonstrate that LLMs achieve performance on par with\nnative-speaking human coders and outperform conventional supervised machine\nlearning approaches. Second, we leverage this novel method to conduct the\nlargest cross-national study of negative campaigning to date, analyzing 18\nmillion tweets posted by parliamentarians in 19 European countries between 2017\nand 2022. The results reveal consistent cross-national patterns: governing\nparties are less likely to use negative messaging, while ideologically extreme\nand populist parties -- particularly those on the radical right -- engage in\nsignificantly higher levels of negativity. These findings advance our\nunderstanding of how party-level characteristics shape strategic communication\nin multiparty systems. More broadly, the study demonstrates the potential of\nLLMs to enable scalable, transparent, and replicable research in political\ncommunication across linguistic and cultural contexts."

Given these\nCQs, we build an ontology graph that subsequently guides the automated\nextraction of triplets for KG generation from arbitrary documents. Inspired by\ndesign-by-contracts (DbC) principles, our method leverages verifiable contracts\nas the primary control mechanism to steer the generative process of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs). To verify the output of our approach, we extend beyond\nstandard benchmarks and propose an evaluation framework that assesses the\nfunctional correctness of the resulting KG by leveraging symbolic verifications\nas described by the neurosymbolic AI framework, $\\textit{SymbolicAI}$. This\nwork contributes a hybrid-driven architecture for improving the reliability of\nautomated KG construction and the exploration of evaluation methods for\nmeasuring the functional integrity of its output. The code is publicly\navailable."

By integrating high-bandwidth\nHBM3E memory, an on-module photonic switch, and external DDR5 in a 2.5D\nelectro-optical system-in-package, the PFA offers up to 32 TB of shared memory\nalongside 115 Tbps of all-to-all digital switching. The Photonic FabricTM\nenables distributed AI training and inference to execute parallelism strategies\nmore efficiently. The Photonic Fabric removes the silicon beachfront constraint\nthat limits the fixed memory-to-compute ratio observed in virtually all current\nXPU accelerator designs. Replacing a local HBM stack on an XPU with a chiplet\nthat connects to the Photonic Fabric increases its memory capacity and\ncorrespondingly its memory bandwidth by offering a flexible path to scaling\nwell beyond the limitations of on-package HBM alone. We introduce CelestiSim, a\nlightweight analytical simulator validated on NVIDIA H100 and H200 systems. It\nis used to evaluate the performance of LLM reference and energy savings on PFA,\nwithout any significant change to the GPU core design. With the PFA, the\nsimulation results show that up to 3.66x throughput and 1.40x latency\nimprovements in LLM inference at 405B parameters, up to 7.04x throughput and\n1.41x latency improvements at 1T parameters, and 60-90% energy savings in data\nmovement for heavy collective operations in all LLM training scenarios.

While Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nfrom outcome-based rewards enhances text-based reasoning, understanding how\nagents autonomously learn to leverage external tools like code execution\nremains crucial. We investigate RL from outcome-based rewards for\nTool-Integrated Reasoning, ZeroTIR, training base LLMs to spontaneously\ngenerate and execute Python code for mathematical problems without supervised\ntool-use examples. Our central contribution is we demonstrate that as RL\ntraining progresses, key metrics scale predictably. Specifically, we observe\nstrong positive correlations where increased training steps lead to increases\nin the spontaneous code execution frequency, the average response length, and,\ncritically, the final task accuracy. This suggests a quantifiable relationship\nbetween computational effort invested in training and the emergence of\neffective, tool-augmented reasoning strategies. We implement a robust framework\nfeaturing a decoupled code execution environment and validate our findings\nacross standard RL algorithms and frameworks.

While Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nfrom outcome-based rewards enhances text-based reasoning, understanding how\nagents autonomously learn to leverage external tools like code execution\nremains crucial. We investigate RL from outcome-based rewards for\nTool-Integrated Reasoning, ZeroTIR, training base LLMs to spontaneously\ngenerate and execute Python code for mathematical problems without supervised\ntool-use examples. Our central contribution is we demonstrate that as RL\ntraining progresses, key metrics scale predictably. Specifically, we observe\nstrong positive correlations where increased training steps lead to increases\nin the spontaneous code execution frequency, the average response length, and,\ncritically, the final task accuracy. This suggests a quantifiable relationship\nbetween computational effort invested in training and the emergence of\neffective, tool-augmented reasoning strategies. We implement a robust framework\nfeaturing a decoupled code execution environment and validate our findings\nacross standard RL algorithms and frameworks.

A hand-crafted\nmolecular fingerprint is incorporated to leverage its embedded domain\nknowledge. To establish an alignment between MolX and the LLM's textual input\nspace, the model in which the LLM is frozen, is pre-trained with a strategy\nincluding a diverse set of tasks. Experimental evaluations show that our\nproposed method outperforms baselines across 4 downstream molecule-related\ntasks ranging from molecule-to-text translation to retrosynthesis, with and\nwithout fine-tuning the LLM, while only introducing a small number of trainable\nparameters--0.53\\% and 0.82\\%, respectively.",

We achieved an improvement of the average batch size of about\n$30\\%$ over the old control software translating to a $23\\%$ reduction of color\nchangeovers. Moreover, we reduced the spread of cars planned for a specific\ndate by $10\\%$, reducing the risk of delays in delivery.

We propose a\nmulti-objective algorithm to solve the MMAL resequencing problem under\nconsideration of all these aspects simultaneously. We also present empirical\nresults obtained from recorded event data of the production process over $4$\nweeks following the deployment of our algorithm in the Saarlouis plant of\nFord-Werke GmbH. We achieved an improvement of the average batch size of about\n$30\\%$ over the old control software translating to a $23\\%$ reduction of color\nchangeovers. Moreover, we reduced the spread of cars planned for a specific\ndate by $10\\%$, reducing the risk of delays in delivery. We discuss\neffectiveness and robustness of our algorithm in improving production\nperformance and quality as well as trade-offs and limitations."

                "summary": "Deep learning has significantly propelled the performance of ECG arrhythmia\nclassification, yet its clinical adoption remains hindered by challenges in\ninterpretability and deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To bridge\nthis gap, we propose EXGnet, a novel and reliable ECG arrhythmia classification\nnetwork tailored for single-lead signals, specifically designed to balance high\naccuracy, explainability, and edge compatibility. EXGnet integrates XAI\nsupervision during training via a normalized cross-correlation based loss,\ndirecting the model's attention to clinically relevant ECG regions, similar to\na cardiologist's focus. This supervision is driven by automatically generated\nground truth, derived through an innovative heart rate variability-based\napproach, without the need for manual annotation. To enhance classification\naccuracy without compromising deployment simplicity, we incorporate\nquantitative ECG features during training. These enrich the model with\nmulti-domain knowledge but are excluded during inference, keeping the model\nlightweight for edge deployment. Additionally, we introduce an innovative\nmultiresolution block to efficiently capture both short and long-term signal\nfeatures while maintaining computational efficiency. Rigorous evaluation on the\nChapman and Ningbo benchmark datasets validates the supremacy of EXGnet, which\nachieves average five-fold accuracies of 98.762% and 96.932%, and F1-scores of\n97.910% and 95.527%, respectively.

                    "value": "Deep learning has significantly propelled the performance of ECG arrhythmia\nclassification, yet its clinical adoption remains hindered by challenges in\ninterpretability and deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To bridge\nthis gap, we propose EXGnet, a novel and reliable ECG arrhythmia classification\nnetwork tailored for single-lead signals, specifically designed to balance high\naccuracy, explainability, and edge compatibility. EXGnet integrates XAI\nsupervision during training via a normalized cross-correlation based loss,\ndirecting the model's attention to clinically relevant ECG regions, similar to\na cardiologist's focus. This supervision is driven by automatically generated\nground truth, derived through an innovative heart rate variability-based\napproach, without the need for manual annotation. To enhance classification\naccuracy without compromising deployment simplicity, we incorporate\nquantitative ECG features during training. These enrich the model with\nmulti-domain knowledge but are excluded during inference, keeping the model\nlightweight for edge deployment. Additionally, we introduce an innovative\nmultiresolution block to efficiently capture both short and long-term signal\nfeatures while maintaining computational efficiency. Rigorous evaluation on the\nChapman and Ningbo benchmark datasets validates the supremacy of EXGnet, which\nachieves average five-fold accuracies of 98.762% and 96.932%, and F1-scores of\n97.910% and 95.527%, respectively. Comprehensive ablation studies and both\nquantitative and qualitative interpretability assessment confirm that the XAI\nguidance is pivotal, demonstrably enhancing the model's focus and\ntrustworthiness. Overall, EXGnet sets a new benchmark by combining\nhigh-performance arrhythmia classification with interpretability, paving the\nway for more trustworthy and accessible portable ECG based health monitoring\nsystems."
