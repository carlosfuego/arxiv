However,\nmost existing research treats satellites merely as transparent forwarding nodes\nand overlooks their potential caching capabilities to enhance IFC data rates.\nIn this article, we explore an IFC-oriented SAGIN where satellites and ground\nstations (GSs) work together to transmit content to airborne passengers,\nthereby facilitating airborne communication. By categorizing files into cached\n(instantly accessible via satellites) and non-cached files (available only\nthrough GSs), this article pioneers the integration of multiple inter-satellite\nlinks (ISLs) into the IFC framework, thus innovating the content delivery\nprocess for both types of files. To minimize the average delay of content\ndelivery, we formulate the corresponding optimization problems: 1) For cached\nfiles, we propose an exact penalty-based method to determine the satellite\nassociation scheme. 2) For non-cached files, we present an efficient algorithm\nbased on alternating optimization to jointly optimize satellite association and\nGS bandwidth allocation. Our proposed framework is low in complexity, paving\nthe way for high-speed Internet connectivity for aviation passengers. Finally,\nsimulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nproposed IFC framework for SAGIN.",

However,\nmost existing research treats satellites merely as transparent forwarding nodes\nand overlooks their potential caching capabilities to enhance IFC data rates.\nIn this article, we explore an IFC-oriented SAGIN where satellites and ground\nstations (GSs) work together to transmit content to airborne passengers,\nthereby facilitating airborne communication. By categorizing files into cached\n(instantly accessible via satellites) and non-cached files (available only\nthrough GSs), this article pioneers the integration of multiple inter-satellite\nlinks (ISLs) into the IFC framework, thus innovating the content delivery\nprocess for both types of files. To minimize the average delay of content\ndelivery, we formulate the corresponding optimization problems: 1) For cached\nfiles, we propose an exact penalty-based method to determine the satellite\nassociation scheme. 2) For non-cached files, we present an efficient algorithm\nbased on alternating optimization to jointly optimize satellite association and\nGS bandwidth allocation. Our proposed framework is low in complexity, paving\nthe way for high-speed Internet connectivity for aviation passengers. Finally,\nsimulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nproposed IFC framework for SAGIN."

Traditional LRU replacement is\nlimited to near-instant references, while advanced policies like SRRIP, GHRP,\nSHiP, SDBP, and CHiRP enhance performance by targeting specific inefficiencies.\nCHiRP, tailored for L2 TLBs, surpasses other policies by leveraging control\nflow history to detect dead blocks, utilizing L2 TLB entries for learning\ninstead of sampling. These integrated techniques collectively address key\nchallenges in virtual memory management."

However, current FSDMC research often\nlacks generalizability due to its focus on specific datasets. Additionally,\ndefect classification heavily relies on contextual information within images,\nand existing methods fall short of effectively extracting this information. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a general FSDMC framework called MVREC,\nwhich offers two primary advantages: (1) MVREC extracts general features for\ndefect instances by incorporating the pre-trained AlphaCLIP model. (2) It\nutilizes a region-context framework to enhance defect features by leveraging\nmask region input and multi-view context augmentation. Furthermore, Few-shot\nZip-Adapter(-F) classifiers within the model are introduced to cache the visual\nfeatures of the support set and perform few-shot classification. We also\nintroduce MVTec-FS, a new FSDMC benchmark based on MVTec AD, which includes\n1228 defect images with instance-level mask annotations and 46 defect types.\nExtensive experiments conducted on MVTec-FS and four additional datasets\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in general defect classification and its ability\nto incorporate contextual information to improve classification performance.\nCode: https://github.com/ShuaiLYU/MVREC",

Our development process encompasses\ncomprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement\nlearning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for\nmulti-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling.\nFurthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a\nfour-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training,\npost-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing\ninfrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment\nand inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further\nevaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates\ncompetitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable\ndisparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic\nhuman preferences.

                "summary": "Modern processors implement a decoupled front-end in the form of Fetch\nDirected Instruction Prefetching (FDIP) to avoid front-end stalls. FDIP is\ndriven by the Branch Prediction Unit (BPU), relying on the BPU's accuracy and\nbranch target tracking structures to speculatively fetch instructions into the\nInstruction Cache (L1I). As data center applications become more complex, their\ncode footprints also grow, resulting in an increase in Branch Target Buffer\n(BTB) misses. FDIP can alleviate L1I cache misses, but when it encounters a BTB\nmiss, the BPU may not identify the current instruction as a branch to FDIP.\nThis can prevent FDIP from prefetching or cause it to speculate down the wrong\npath, further polluting the L1I cache. We observe that the vast majority, 75%,\nof BTB-missing, unidentified branches are actually present in instruction cache\nlines that FDIP has previously fetched but, these missing branches have not yet\nbeen decoded and inserted into the BTB.

However, most studies focus on addressing only one of these\nbottlenecks and do not adequately support dynamic adjustment of sparsity\nconcerning distinct layers or tasks. In this paper, we present ZipVL, an\nefficient inference framework designed for LVLMs through a dynamic ratio\nallocation strategy of important tokens. This ratio is adaptively determined\nbased on the layer-specific distribution of attention scores, rather than fixed\nhyper-parameters, thereby improving efficiency for less complex tasks while\nmaintaining high performance for more challenging ones. Then we select\nimportant tokens based on their normalized attention scores and perform sparse\nattention mechanism solely on those important tokens, reducing the latency in\nthe prefill phase. Tokens deemed less important will be discarded to reduce KV\ncache size, alleviating the memory bottleneck in the decoding phase. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that ZipVL can accelerate the prefill phase by\n2.3$\\times$ and improve decoding throughput by 2.8$\\times$, with a minimal\naccuracy reduction of only 0.5\\% on VQAv2 benchmark over LLaVA-Next-13B model,\neffectively enhancing the generation efficiency of LVLMs.",

To address these issues, we develop Vivar, a\nnovel AR system that integrates multi-modal sensor data and presents 3D\nvolumetric content for visualization. In particular, we introduce a cross-modal\nembedding approach that maps sensor data into a pre-trained visual embedding\nspace through barycentric interpolation.

Vivar also\nincorporates sensor-aware AR scene generation using foundation models and 3D\nGaussian Splatting (3DGS) without requiring domain expertise. In addition,\nVivar leverages latent reuse and caching strategies to accelerate 2D and AR\ncontent generation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our system\nachieves 11$\\times$ latency reduction without compromising quality.

The dynamic arrival and departure of connection requests in\noptical networks result in particular central links experiencing more traffic\nand congestion than non-central links. The occurrence of congested links leads\nto service blocking despite the availability of resources within the network,\nrestricting the efficient utilization of network resources. The available\nalgorithms in the literature that aim to balance load among network links offer\na trade-off between blocking performance and algorithmic complexity, thus\nincreasing service provisioning time. This work proposes a dynamic\nrouting-based congestion-aware routing, modulation, core, and spectrum\nassignment (RMCSA) algorithm for space division multiplexing elastic optical\nnetworks (SDM-EONs). The algorithm finds alternative candidate paths based on\nreal-time link occupancy metrics to minimize blocking due to link congestion\nunder dynamic traffic scenarios. As a result, the algorithm reduces the\nformation of congestion hotspots in the network owing to link-betweenness\ncentrality. We have performed extensive simulations using two realistic network\ntopologies to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with relevant\nRMCSA algorithms available in the literature. The simulation results verify the\nsuperior performance of our proposed algorithm compared to the benchmark Yen's\nK-shortest paths and K-Disjoint shortest paths RMCSA algorithms in connection\nblocking ratio and spectrum utilization efficiency. To expedite the\nroute-finding process, we present a novel caching strategy that allows the\nproposed algorithm to demonstrate a much-reduced service delay time compared to\nthe recently developed adaptive link weight-based load-balancing RMCSA\nalgorithm.",

Unlike existing compression strategies\nthat compute attention to determine token retention, LSH-E makes these\ndecisions pre-attention, thereby reducing computational costs. Additionally,\nLSH-E is dynamic - at every decoding step, the key and value of the current\ntoken replace the embeddings of a token expected to produce the lowest\nattention score. We demonstrate that LSH-E can compress the KV cache by 30%-70%\nwhile maintaining high performance across reasoning, multiple-choice,\nlong-context retrieval and summarization tasks."

                "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the demand for higher\nquality and faster processing of long contexts across various applications is\ngrowing. KV cache is widely adopted as it stores previously generated key and\nvalue tokens, effectively reducing redundant computations during inference.\nHowever, as memory overhead becomes a significant concern, efficient\ncompression of KV cache has gained increasing attention. Most existing methods\nperform compression from two perspectives: identifying important tokens and\ndesigning compression strategies. However, these approaches often produce\nbiased distributions of important tokens due to the influence of accumulated\nattention scores or positional encoding. Furthermore, they overlook the\nsparsity and redundancy across different heads, which leads to difficulties in\npreserving the most effective information at the head level.

                    "value": "As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the demand for higher\nquality and faster processing of long contexts across various applications is\ngrowing. KV cache is widely adopted as it stores previously generated key and\nvalue tokens, effectively reducing redundant computations during inference.\nHowever, as memory overhead becomes a significant concern, efficient\ncompression of KV cache has gained increasing attention. Most existing methods\nperform compression from two perspectives: identifying important tokens and\ndesigning compression strategies. However, these approaches often produce\nbiased distributions of important tokens due to the influence of accumulated\nattention scores or positional encoding. Furthermore, they overlook the\nsparsity and redundancy across different heads, which leads to difficulties in\npreserving the most effective information at the head level.

                "summary": "Long video understanding poses a significant challenge for current\nMulti-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Notably, the MLLMs are constrained\nby their limited context lengths and the substantial costs while processing\nlong videos. Although several existing methods attempt to reduce visual tokens,\ntheir strategies encounter severe bottleneck, restricting MLLMs' ability to\nperceive fine-grained visual details. In this work, we propose Video-XL, a\nnovel approach that leverages MLLMs' inherent key-value (KV) sparsification\ncapacity to condense the visual input. Specifically, we introduce a new special\ntoken, the Visual Summarization Token (VST), for each interval of the video,\nwhich summarizes the visual information within the interval as its associated\nKV. The VST module is trained by instruction fine-tuning, where two optimizing\nstrategies are offered. 1.Curriculum learning, where VST learns to make small\n(easy) and large compression (hard) progressively. 2. Composite data curation,\nwhich integrates single-image, multi-image, and synthetic data to overcome the\nscarcity of long-video instruction data. The compression quality is further\nimproved by dynamic compression, which customizes compression granularity based\non the information density of different video intervals. Video-XL's\neffectiveness is verified from three aspects. First, it achieves a superior\nlong-video understanding capability, outperforming state-of-the-art models of\ncomparable sizes across multiple popular benchmarks. Second, it effectively\npreserves video information, with minimal compression loss even at 16x\ncompression ratio. Third, it realizes outstanding cost-effectiveness, enabling\nhigh-quality processing of thousands of frames on a single A100 GPU.",

While\nsome efforts have optimized attention mechanisms by pruning heads or sharing\nparameters among heads, these methods often lead to performance degradation or\nnecessitate substantial continued pre-training costs to restore performance.\nBased on the analysis of attention redundancy, we design a Decoupled-Head\nAttention (DHA) mechanism. DHA adaptively configures group sharing for key\nheads and value heads across various layers, achieving a better balance between\nperformance and efficiency. Inspired by the observation of clustering similar\nheads, we propose to progressively transform the MHA checkpoint into the DHA\nmodel through linear fusion of similar head parameters step by step, retaining\nthe parametric knowledge of the MHA checkpoint. We construct DHA models by\ntransforming various scales of MHA checkpoints given target head budgets. Our\nexperiments show that DHA remarkably requires a mere 0.25\\% of the original\nmodel's pre-training budgets to achieve 97.6\\% of performance while saving 75\\%\nof KV cache.

These engines reduce latency by using an incremental\nlayout algorithm to redraw the page when the user interacts with it. In such an\nalgorithm, elements that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty; only the dirty\nelements need be processed to draw the next frame, dramatically reducing\nlatency. However, the standard incremental layout algorithm must search the\npage for dirty elements, accessing a number of auxiliary elements in the\nprocess. These auxiliary elements add cache misses and stalled cycles, and are\nresponsible for a sizable fraction of all layout latency. We introduce a new,\nfaster incremental layout algorithm called Spineless Traversal. Spineless\nTraversal uses a more computationally demanding priority queue algorithm to\navoid the need to access auxiliary nodes and thus reduces cache traffic and\nstalls. This leads to dramatic speedups on the most latency-critical\ninteractions such as hovering, typing, or animations. Moreover, thanks to\nnumerous low-level optimizations, we are able to make Spineless Traversal\ncompetitive across the whole spectrum of incremental layout workloads. As a\nresult, across 2216 benchmarks, Spineless Traversal is faster on 78.2% of the\nbenchmark, with a mean speedup of 3.23x concentrated in the most\nlatency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, and animations.",

The one-hop\nnavigation is from a vertex using either its in-coming or out-going edges with\nselection predicates that filter edges and vertices.

The majority of computation stems from the\noverwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer decoder. In\nthis paper, we propose to build efficient MLLMs by leveraging the\nMixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each transformer decoder layer selects\nessential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant ones. However,\nintegrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the challenges of\ntraining and inference stability as well as limited training data, we adapt the\nMoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight normalization (TanhNorm)\nand symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we observe that vision\ntokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layer and thus design a progressive\nratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the token retention ratio\nlayer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This crucial design fully\nunleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the efficiency and\nperformance of our models. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we\nconduct extensive experiments with two baseline models across 14 benchmarks.\nOur model, p-MoD, matches or even surpasses the performance of the baseline\nmodels, with only 55.6% TFLOPs and 53.8% KV cache storage during inference, and\n77.7% GPU hours during training.",

To address this, two critical steps are often required: a\npretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length\nextension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural\nmodifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper\nargues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction\narchitecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but\nalso achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed\nLongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during\nlength extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention\npatterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink\n(initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are\nwell-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their\nGPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just\ntheoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to\nhave direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention\nlayers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency\nand long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data\nis sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.\n  We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its\neffectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts,\nLongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%,\ncompared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV\ncache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding\nspeedup.",

In this paper, we cast the problem of\ncombining multiple pre-trained diffusion models at the generation stage under a\nnovel proposed framework termed superposition. Theoretically, we derive\nsuperposition from rigorous first principles stemming from the celebrated\ncontinuity equation and design two novel algorithms tailor-made for combining\ndiffusion models in SuperDiff. SuperDiff leverages a new scalable It\\^o density\nestimator for the log likelihood of the diffusion SDE which incurs no\nadditional overhead compared to the well-known Hutchinson's estimator needed\nfor divergence calculations. We demonstrate that SuperDiff is scalable to large\npre-trained diffusion models as superposition is performed solely through\ncomposition during inference, and also enjoys painless implementation as it\ncombines different pre-trained vector fields through an automated re-weighting\nscheme. Notably, we show that SuperDiff is efficient during inference time, and\nmimics traditional composition operators such as the logical OR and the logical\nAND. We empirically demonstrate the utility of using SuperDiff for generating\nmore diverse images on CIFAR-10, more faithful prompt conditioned image editing\nusing Stable Diffusion, and improved unconditional de novo structure design of\nproteins. https://github.com/necludov/super-diffusion",

However, we observe that little research has looked into how it\nworks.In this work, we first visualize the similarity maps, which are obtained\nby computing the semantic similarity between the $\\texttt{<SEG>}$ token and the\nimage token embeddings derived from the last hidden layer in both the LLaVA\nencoder and SAM decoder. Intriguingly, we have found that a striking\nconsistency holds in terms of activation responses in the similarity map,which\nreveals that what $\\texttt{<SEG>}$ token contributes to is the semantic\nsimilarity within image-text pairs. Specifically, $\\texttt{<SEG>}$ token, a\nplaceholder expanded in text vocabulary, extensively queries among individual\ntokenized image patches to match the semantics of an object from text to the\npaired image while the Large Language Models (LLMs) are being fine-tuned. Upon\nthe above findings, we present READ, which facilitates LMMs' resilient\n$\\textbf{REA}$soning capability of where to atten$\\textbf{D}$ under the\nguidance of highly activated points borrowed from similarity maps. Remarkably,\nREAD features an intuitive design, Similarity as Points module (SasP), which\ncan be seamlessly applied to $\\texttt{<SEG>}$-like paradigms in a plug-and-play\nfashion.Also, extensive experiments have been conducted on the ReasonSeg and\nRefCOCO(+/g) datasets. To validate whether READ suffers from catastrophic\nforgetting of previous skills after fine-tuning, we further assess its\ngeneration ability on an augmented FP-RefCOCO(+/g) dataset.

However, we observe that little research has looked into how it\nworks.In this work, we first visualize the similarity maps, which are obtained\nby computing the semantic similarity between the $\\texttt{<SEG>}$ token and the\nimage token embeddings derived from the last hidden layer in both the LLaVA\nencoder and SAM decoder. Intriguingly, we have found that a striking\nconsistency holds in terms of activation responses in the similarity map,which\nreveals that what $\\texttt{<SEG>}$ token contributes to is the semantic\nsimilarity within image-text pairs. Specifically, $\\texttt{<SEG>}$ token, a\nplaceholder expanded in text vocabulary, extensively queries among individual\ntokenized image patches to match the semantics of an object from text to the\npaired image while the Large Language Models (LLMs) are being fine-tuned. Upon\nthe above findings, we present READ, which facilitates LMMs' resilient\n$\\textbf{REA}$soning capability of where to atten$\\textbf{D}$ under the\nguidance of highly activated points borrowed from similarity maps. Remarkably,\nREAD features an intuitive design, Similarity as Points module (SasP), which\ncan be seamlessly applied to $\\texttt{<SEG>}$-like paradigms in a plug-and-play\nfashion.Also, extensive experiments have been conducted on the ReasonSeg and\nRefCOCO(+/g) datasets. To validate whether READ suffers from catastrophic\nforgetting of previous skills after fine-tuning, we further assess its\ngeneration ability on an augmented FP-RefCOCO(+/g) dataset.

To address this gap, we construct Chumor, the first Chinese humor\nexplanation dataset that exceeds the size of existing humor datasets. Chumor is\nsourced from Ruo Zhi Ba, a Chinese Reddit-like platform known for sharing\nintellectually challenging and culturally specific jokes.

Our pipeline supports iterative retrieval: when the\nresults of any branch are found to be unsatisfactory, the system can\nautomatically opt for further rounds. We put everything together in a retrieval\naugmented generation (RAG) setup, where an LLM generates a coherent response\nfrom accumulated search results. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed\nsystem over several baselines on a knowledge graph of BMW automobiles."

The ratio of text chunk size to\nspeech chunk size is crucial for the performance of IST-LM. To explore this, we\nconducted a comprehensive series of statistical analyses on the training data\nand performed correlation analysis with the final performance, uncovering\nseveral key factors: 1) the distance between speech tokens and their\ncorresponding text tokens, 2) the number of future text tokens accessible to\neach speech token, and 3) the frequency of speech tokens precedes their\ncorresponding text tokens. Experimental results demonstrate how to achieve an\noptimal streaming TTS system without complicated engineering optimization,\nwhich has a limited gap with the non-streaming system. IST-LM is conceptually\nsimple and empirically powerful, paving the way for streaming TTS with minimal\noverhead while largely maintaining performance, showcasing broad prospects\ncoupled with real-time text stream from LLMs.",

FocusLLM stands out for great training efficiency and\nversatility: trained with an 8K input length and with much less training cost\nthan previous methods, FocusLLM exhibits superior performance across downstream\ntasks and maintains strong language modeling ability when handling extensive\nlong texts, even up to 400K tokens.

In addition, PLVM is\nequipped to continuously add new concepts during a dialogue without incurring\nadditional costs, which significantly enhances the practicality.

One primary challenge\nis that obtaining robot trajectories fully annotated with both actions and\ntexts is time-consuming and labor-intensive. However, partially-annotated data,\nsuch as human activity videos without action labels and robot trajectories\nwithout text labels, are much easier to collect. Can we leverage these data to\nenhance the generalization capabilities of robots? In this paper, we propose\nGR-MG, a novel method which supports conditioning on a text instruction and a\ngoal image. During training, GR-MG samples goal images from trajectories and\nconditions on both the text and the goal image or solely on the image when text\nis not available. During inference, where only the text is provided, GR-MG\ngenerates the goal image via a diffusion-based image-editing model and\nconditions on both the text and the generated image. This approach enables\nGR-MG to leverage large amounts of partially-annotated data while still using\nlanguages to flexibly specify tasks. To generate accurate goal images, we\npropose a novel progress-guided goal image generation model which injects task\nprogress information into the generation process. In simulation experiments,\nGR-MG improves the average number of tasks completed in a row of 5 from 3.35 to\n4.04.

We evaluate SpeechCueLLM on two datasets: IEMOCAP and MELD,\nshowing significant improvements in emotion recognition accuracy, particularly\nfor high-quality audio data. We also explore the effectiveness of various\nfeature representations and fine-tuning strategies for different LLMs. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that incorporating speech descriptions yields a more\nthan 2% increase in the average weighted F1 score on IEMOCAP (from 70.111% to\n72.596%)."

In this paper, we introduce DRT-o1, an\nattempt to bring the success of long CoT to neural machine translation (MT).\nSpecifically, in view of the literature books that might involve similes and\nmetaphors, translating these texts to a target language is very difficult in\npractice due to cultural differences. In such cases, literal translation often\nfails to convey the intended meaning effectively. Even for professional human\ntranslators, considerable thought must be given to preserving semantics\nthroughout the translation process. To simulate LLMs' long thought ability in\nMT, we first mine sentences containing similes or metaphors from existing\nliterature books, and then develop a multi-agent framework to translate these\nsentences via long thought. In the multi-agent framework, a translator is used\nto iteratively translate the source sentence under the suggestions provided by\nan advisor. To ensure the effectiveness of the long thoughts, an evaluator is\nalso employed to judge whether the translation in the current round is better\nthan the previous one or not. In this manner, we collect tens of thousands of\nlong-thought MT data, which is used to train our DRT-o1. The experimental\nresults on literature translation demonstrate the effectiveness of the DRT-o1.\nUsing Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-14B as the backbones, the improvement brought by\nDRT-o1 achieves 7.33~8.26 BLEU and 1.66~3.36 CometScore. Besides, DRT-o1-7B can\noutperform QwQ-32B-Preview by 7.82 BLEU and 1.46 CometScore, showing its\neffectiveness. The project is available at https://github.com/krystalan/DRT-o1",

Our observations indicate that\nthe information entropy of a quantum circuit's output distribution exhibits an\napproximately exponential relationship with the number of shots needed to\nachieve a target Hellinger distance. In this work, we propose a\ndistribution-adaptive dynamic shot (DDS) framework that efficiently adjusts the\nnumber of shots per iteration in VQAs using the entropy distribution from the\nprior training epoch. Our results demonstrate that the DDS framework sustains\ninference accuracy while achieving a ~50% reduction in average shot count\ncompared to fixed-shot training, and ~60% higher accuracy than recently\nproposed tiered shot allocation methods. Furthermore, in noisy simulations that\nreflect the error rates of actual IBM quantum systems, DDS achieves\napproximately a ~30% reduction in the total number of shots compared to the\nfixed-shot method with minimal degradation in accuracy, and offers about ~70%\nhigher computational accuracy than tiered shot allocation methods.",

Our observations indicate that\nthe information entropy of a quantum circuit's output distribution exhibits an\napproximately exponential relationship with the number of shots needed to\nachieve a target Hellinger distance. In this work, we propose a\ndistribution-adaptive dynamic shot (DDS) framework that efficiently adjusts the\nnumber of shots per iteration in VQAs using the entropy distribution from the\nprior training epoch. Our results demonstrate that the DDS framework sustains\ninference accuracy while achieving a ~50% reduction in average shot count\ncompared to fixed-shot training, and ~60% higher accuracy than recently\nproposed tiered shot allocation methods. Furthermore, in noisy simulations that\nreflect the error rates of actual IBM quantum systems, DDS achieves\napproximately a ~30% reduction in the total number of shots compared to the\nfixed-shot method with minimal degradation in accuracy, and offers about ~70%\nhigher computational accuracy than tiered shot allocation methods."

However, they still face challenges in generating correct code on the\nfirst attempt when addressing complex requirements. Introducing a discriminator\nto select reliable outputs from multiple generated results is an effective way\nto enhance their reliability and stability. Currently, these discriminators\nfall into two categories: execution-based discriminators and\nnon-execution-based discriminators. Execution-based discriminators face\nflexibility challenges due to difficulties in obtaining test cases and security\nconcerns, while non-execution-based discriminators, although more flexible,\nstruggle to capture subtle differences in code details. To maintain flexibility\nwhile improving the model's ability to capture fine-grained code details, this\npaper proposes Condor. We first design contrastive learning to optimize the\ncode representations of the base model, enabling it to reflect differences in\ncode details. Then, we leverage intermediate data from the code modification\nprocess to further enrich the discriminator's training data, enhancing its\nability to discern code details. Experimental results indicate that on the\nsubtle code difference dataset (i.e., CodeNanoFix), Condor significantly\noutperforms other discriminators in discriminative performance: Condor (1.3B)\nimproves the discriminative F1 score of DeepSeek-Coder (1.3B) from 67% to 73%.\nIn discriminating LLM-generated outputs, Condor (1.3B) and Condor (110M) raise\nthe Pass@1 score of Meta-Llama-3.1-Instruct (70B) on the CodeNanoFix dataset\nfrom 52.64% to 62.63% and 59.64%, respectively.

To\naddress those shortcomings, in this paper, we introduce VidCtx, a novel\ntraining-free VideoQA framework which integrates both modalities, i.e. both\nvisual information from input frames and textual descriptions of others frames\nthat give the appropriate context. More specifically, in the proposed framework\na pre-trained Large Multimodal Model (LMM) is prompted to extract at regular\nintervals, question-aware textual descriptions (captions) of video frames.\nThose will be used as context when the same LMM will be prompted to answer the\nquestion at hand given as input a) a certain frame, b) the question and c) the\ncontext/caption of an appropriate frame. To avoid redundant information, we\nchose as context the descriptions of distant frames. Finally, a simple yet\neffective max pooling mechanism is used to aggregate the frame-level decisions.\nThis methodology enables the model to focus on the relevant segments of the\nvideo and scale to a high number of frames.

This\nstudy employs a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to train agents for\nexposure control, aiming to enhance imaging performance in challenging\nconditions. A lightweight image simulator is developed to facilitate the\ntraining process, enabling the diversification of image exposure and sequence\ntrajectory. This setup enables completely offline training, eliminating the\nneed for direct interaction with camera hardware and the real environments.\nDifferent levels of reward functions are crafted to enhance the VO systems,\nequipping the DRL agents with varying intelligence.

This\nstudy employs a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to train agents for\nexposure control, aiming to enhance imaging performance in challenging\nconditions. A lightweight image simulator is developed to facilitate the\ntraining process, enabling the diversification of image exposure and sequence\ntrajectory. This setup enables completely offline training, eliminating the\nneed for direct interaction with camera hardware and the real environments.\nDifferent levels of reward functions are crafted to enhance the VO systems,\nequipping the DRL agents with varying intelligence.

In this work, we\ndemonstrate that a frozen LLM can be augmented with an offline coprocessor that\noperates on the model's key-value (kv) cache. This coprocessor augments the\ncache with a set of latent embeddings designed to improve the fidelity of\nsubsequent decoding. We train this coprocessor using the language modeling loss\nfrom the decoder on standard pretraining data, while keeping the decoder itself\nfrozen. This approach enables the model to learn, in an end-to-end\ndifferentiable fashion, how to distill additional computation into its\nkv-cache. Because the decoder remains unchanged, the coprocessor can operate\noffline and asynchronously, and the language model can function normally if the\ncoprocessor is unavailable or if a given cache is deemed not to require extra\ncomputation. We show experimentally that when a cache is augmented, the decoder\nachieves lower perplexity on numerous subsequent tokens.

In a\nRAG system, a retriever fetches passages from a collection in response to a\nquestion, which are then included in the prompt of a large language model (LLM)\nfor generating a natural language (NL) answer. However, several RAG systems\ntoday suffer from two shortcomings: (i) retrieved passages usually contain\ntheir raw text and lack appropriate document context, negatively impacting both\nretrieval and answering quality; and (ii) attribution strategies that explain\nanswer generation typically rely only on similarity between the answer and the\nretrieved passages, thereby only generating plausible but not causal\nexplanations. In this work, we demonstrate RAGONITE, a RAG system that remedies\nthe above concerns by: (i) contextualizing evidence with source metadata and\nsurrounding text; and (ii) computing counterfactual attribution, a causal\nexplanation approach where the contribution of an evidence to an answer is\ndetermined by the similarity of the original response to the answer obtained by\nremoving that evidence. To evaluate our proposals, we release a new benchmark\nConfQuestions: it has 300 hand-created conversational questions, each in\nEnglish and German, coupled with ground truth URLs, completed questions, and\nanswers from 215 public Confluence pages. These documents are typical of\nenterprise wiki spaces with heterogeneous elements. Experiments with RAGONITE\non ConfQuestions show the viability of our ideas: contextualization improves\nRAG performance, and counterfactual explanations outperform standard\nattribution.",

In this work, we demonstrate RAGONITE, a RAG system that remedies\nthe above concerns by: (i) contextualizing evidence with source metadata and\nsurrounding text; and (ii) computing counterfactual attribution, a causal\nexplanation approach where the contribution of an evidence to an answer is\ndetermined by the similarity of the original response to the answer obtained by\nremoving that evidence. To evaluate our proposals, we release a new benchmark\nConfQuestions: it has 300 hand-created conversational questions, each in\nEnglish and German, coupled with ground truth URLs, completed questions, and\nanswers from 215 public Confluence pages. These documents are typical of\nenterprise wiki spaces with heterogeneous elements. Experiments with RAGONITE\non ConfQuestions show the viability of our ideas: contextualization improves\nRAG performance, and counterfactual explanations outperform standard\nattribution."

Accordingly, stakeholders,\nincluding governments' health systems, are developing new strategies to promote\nearly detection and prevention from a holistic perspective (i.e., addressing\nseveral disorders simultaneously). In this work, an entirely novel system for\nthe multi-label classification of anxiety and depression is proposed.

We introduce LiveIdeaBench, a\ncomprehensive benchmark that evaluates LLMs' scientific creativity and\ndivergent thinking capabilities using single-keyword prompts. Drawing from\nGuilford's creativity theory, our framework employs a dynamic panel of\nstate-of-the-art LLMs to assess generated ideas across four key dimensions:\noriginality, feasibility, fluency, and flexibility. Through extensive\nexperimentation with 20 leading models across 1,180 keywords spanning 18\nscientific domains, we reveal that scientific creative ability shows distinct\npatterns from general intelligence metrics. Notably, our results demonstrate\nthat models like QwQ-32B-preview achieve comparable creative performance to\ntop-tier models like o1-preview, despite significant gaps in their general\nintelligence scores.

We introduce LiveIdeaBench, a\ncomprehensive benchmark that evaluates LLMs' scientific creativity and\ndivergent thinking capabilities using single-keyword prompts. Drawing from\nGuilford's creativity theory, our framework employs a dynamic panel of\nstate-of-the-art LLMs to assess generated ideas across four key dimensions:\noriginality, feasibility, fluency, and flexibility. Through extensive\nexperimentation with 20 leading models across 1,180 keywords spanning 18\nscientific domains, we reveal that scientific creative ability shows distinct\npatterns from general intelligence metrics. Notably, our results demonstrate\nthat models like QwQ-32B-preview achieve comparable creative performance to\ntop-tier models like o1-preview, despite significant gaps in their general\nintelligence scores. These findings highlight the importance of specialized\nevaluation frameworks for scientific creativity and suggest that the\ndevelopment of creative capabilities in LLMs may follow different trajectories\nthan traditional problem-solving abilities."

Finally, our approach offers a time-efficient alternative to\nexisting adversarial attack methods and provides consistent model robustness\nrankings when evaluated on VLMs including MiniGPT-4, InstructBLIP, and LLaVA."

While this removes the\nexplicit information, implicit information can remain scattered across various\ntraining documents. Could an LLM infer the censored knowledge by piecing\ntogether these implicit hints? As a step towards answering this question, we\nstudy inductive out-of-context reasoning (OOCR), a type of generalization in\nwhich LLMs infer latent information from evidence distributed across training\ndocuments and apply it to downstream tasks without in-context learning. Using a\nsuite of five tasks, we demonstrate that frontier LLMs can perform inductive\nOOCR. In one experiment we finetune an LLM on a corpus consisting only of\ndistances between an unknown city and other known cities. Remarkably, without\nin-context examples or Chain of Thought, the LLM can verbalize that the unknown\ncity is Paris and use this fact to answer downstream questions. Further\nexperiments show that LLMs trained only on individual coin flip outcomes can\nverbalize whether the coin is biased, and those trained only on pairs\n$(x,f(x))$ can articulate a definition of $f$ and compute inverses. While OOCR\nsucceeds in a range of cases, we also show that it is unreliable, particularly\nfor smaller LLMs learning complex structures. Overall, the ability of LLMs to\n\"connect the dots\" without explicit in-context learning poses a potential\nobstacle to monitoring and controlling the knowledge acquired by LLMs.",

As a step towards answering this question, we\nstudy inductive out-of-context reasoning (OOCR), a type of generalization in\nwhich LLMs infer latent information from evidence distributed across training\ndocuments and apply it to downstream tasks without in-context learning. Using a\nsuite of five tasks, we demonstrate that frontier LLMs can perform inductive\nOOCR. In one experiment we finetune an LLM on a corpus consisting only of\ndistances between an unknown city and other known cities. Remarkably, without\nin-context examples or Chain of Thought, the LLM can verbalize that the unknown\ncity is Paris and use this fact to answer downstream questions. Further\nexperiments show that LLMs trained only on individual coin flip outcomes can\nverbalize whether the coin is biased, and those trained only on pairs\n$(x,f(x))$ can articulate a definition of $f$ and compute inverses. While OOCR\nsucceeds in a range of cases, we also show that it is unreliable, particularly\nfor smaller LLMs learning complex structures. Overall, the ability of LLMs to\n\"connect the dots\" without explicit in-context learning poses a potential\nobstacle to monitoring and controlling the knowledge acquired by LLMs."

In such cases, literal translation often\nfails to convey the intended meaning effectively. Even for professional human\ntranslators, considerable thought must be given to preserving semantics\nthroughout the translation process. To simulate LLMs' long thought ability in\nMT, we first mine sentences containing similes or metaphors from existing\nliterature books, and then develop a multi-agent framework to translate these\nsentences via long thought. In the multi-agent framework, a translator is used\nto iteratively translate the source sentence under the suggestions provided by\nan advisor. To ensure the effectiveness of the long thoughts, an evaluator is\nalso employed to judge whether the translation in the current round is better\nthan the previous one or not. In this manner, we collect tens of thousands of\nlong-thought MT data, which is used to train our DRT-o1. The experimental\nresults on literature translation demonstrate the effectiveness of the DRT-o1.\nUsing Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-14B as the backbones, the improvement brought by\nDRT-o1 achieves 7.33~8.26 BLEU and 1.66~3.36 CometScore.

As a prevalent property\nof the models using the ReLU activation function, activation sparsity has been\nproven a promising paradigm to boost model inference efficiency. Nevertheless,\nmost large language models (LLMs) adopt activation functions without intrinsic\nactivation sparsity (e.g., GELU and Swish). Some recent efforts have explored\nintroducing ReLU or its variants as the substitutive activation function to\nhelp LLMs achieve activation sparsity and inference acceleration, but few can\nsimultaneously obtain high sparsity and comparable model performance. This\npaper introduces a simple and effective sparsification method named \"ProSparse\"\nto push LLMs for higher activation sparsity while maintaining comparable\nperformance. Specifically, after substituting the activation function of LLMs\nwith ReLU, ProSparse adopts progressive sparsity regularization with a factor\nsmoothly increasing along the multi-stage sine curves. This can enhance\nactivation sparsity and mitigate performance degradation by avoiding radical\nshifts in activation distributions. With ProSparse, we obtain high sparsity of\n89.32% for LLaMA2-7B, 88.80% for LLaMA2-13B, and 87.89% for end-size\nMiniCPM-1B, respectively, achieving comparable performance to their original\nSwish-activated versions.

However, they still face challenges in generating correct code on the\nfirst attempt when addressing complex requirements. Introducing a discriminator\nto select reliable outputs from multiple generated results is an effective way\nto enhance their reliability and stability. Currently, these discriminators\nfall into two categories: execution-based discriminators and\nnon-execution-based discriminators. Execution-based discriminators face\nflexibility challenges due to difficulties in obtaining test cases and security\nconcerns, while non-execution-based discriminators, although more flexible,\nstruggle to capture subtle differences in code details. To maintain flexibility\nwhile improving the model's ability to capture fine-grained code details, this\npaper proposes Condor. We first design contrastive learning to optimize the\ncode representations of the base model, enabling it to reflect differences in\ncode details. Then, we leverage intermediate data from the code modification\nprocess to further enrich the discriminator's training data, enhancing its\nability to discern code details. Experimental results indicate that on the\nsubtle code difference dataset (i.e., CodeNanoFix), Condor significantly\noutperforms other discriminators in discriminative performance: Condor (1.3B)\nimproves the discriminative F1 score of DeepSeek-Coder (1.3B) from 67% to 73%.\nIn discriminating LLM-generated outputs, Condor (1.3B) and Condor (110M) raise\nthe Pass@1 score of Meta-Llama-3.1-Instruct (70B) on the CodeNanoFix dataset\nfrom 52.64% to 62.63% and 59.64%, respectively. Moreover, Condor demonstrates\nstrong generalization capabilities on the MBPP and APPS datasets.

Experimental results indicate that on the\nsubtle code difference dataset (i.e., CodeNanoFix), Condor significantly\noutperforms other discriminators in discriminative performance: Condor (1.3B)\nimproves the discriminative F1 score of DeepSeek-Coder (1.3B) from 67% to 73%.\nIn discriminating LLM-generated outputs, Condor (1.3B) and Condor (110M) raise\nthe Pass@1 score of Meta-Llama-3.1-Instruct (70B) on the CodeNanoFix dataset\nfrom 52.64% to 62.63% and 59.64%, respectively. Moreover, Condor demonstrates\nstrong generalization capabilities on the MBPP and APPS datasets. For example,\nCondor (1.3B) improves the Pass@1 of Meta-Llama-3.1-Instruct (70B) on the APPS\ndataset by 147.05%."

To\naddress those shortcomings, in this paper, we introduce VidCtx, a novel\ntraining-free VideoQA framework which integrates both modalities, i.e. both\nvisual information from input frames and textual descriptions of others frames\nthat give the appropriate context. More specifically, in the proposed framework\na pre-trained Large Multimodal Model (LMM) is prompted to extract at regular\nintervals, question-aware textual descriptions (captions) of video frames.\nThose will be used as context when the same LMM will be prompted to answer the\nquestion at hand given as input a) a certain frame, b) the question and c) the\ncontext/caption of an appropriate frame. To avoid redundant information, we\nchose as context the descriptions of distant frames. Finally, a simple yet\neffective max pooling mechanism is used to aggregate the frame-level decisions.\nThis methodology enables the model to focus on the relevant segments of the\nvideo and scale to a high number of frames.

Our\nwork leverages step-wise preference learning to enhance self-verification via\nreinforcement learning. We initially conduct our work through a two-stage\ntraining procedure.

First, we develop a Chinese\ndataset for full-text error correction, named ChFT, utilizing a pipeline that\ninvolves text-to-speech synthesis, ASR, and error-correction pair extractor.\nThis dataset enables us to correct errors across contexts, including both\nfull-text and segment, and to address a broader range of error types, such as\npunctuation restoration and inverse text normalization, thus making the\ncorrection process comprehensive. Second, we fine-tune a pre-trained LLM on the\nconstructed dataset using a diverse set of prompts and target formats, and\nevaluate its performance on full-text error correction. Specifically, we design\nprompts based on full-text and segment, considering various output formats,\nsuch as directly corrected text and JSON-based error-correction pairs.

Among the\ntwo types of self-correction, intrinsic self-correction is considered a\npromising direction because it does not utilize external knowledge. However,\nrecent works doubt the validity of LLM's ability to conduct intrinsic\nself-correction. In this paper, we present a novel perspective on the intrinsic\nself-correction capabilities of LLMs through theoretical analyses and empirical\nexperiments. In addition, we identify two critical factors for successful\nself-correction: zero temperature and fair prompts. Leveraging these factors,\nwe demonstrate that intrinsic self-correction ability is exhibited across\nmultiple existing LLMs. Our findings offer insights into the fundamental\ntheories underlying the self-correction behavior of LLMs and remark on the\nimportance of unbiased prompts and zero temperature settings in harnessing\ntheir full potential.",

Their widespread use\ntranscends language and cultural barriers, enhancing understanding and\nfostering more inclusive interactions. While existing work gained valuable\ninsight into emojis understanding, exploring emojis' capability to serve as a\nuniversal sentiment indicator leveraging large language models (LLMs) has not\nbeen thoroughly examined. Our study aims to investigate the capacity of emojis\nto serve as reliable sentiment markers through LLMs across languages and\ncultures. We leveraged the multimodal capabilities of ChatGPT to explore the\nsentiments of various representations of emojis and evaluated how well\nemoji-conveyed sentiment aligned with text sentiment on a multi-lingual dataset\ncollected from 32 countries. Our analysis reveals that the accuracy of\nLLM-based emoji-conveyed sentiment is 81.43%, underscoring emojis' significant\npotential to serve as a universal sentiment marker. We also found a consistent\ntrend that the accuracy of sentiment conveyed by emojis increased as the number\nof emojis grew in text. The results reinforce the potential of emojis to serve\nas global sentiment indicators, offering insight into fields such as\ncross-lingual and cross-cultural sentiment analysis on social media platforms.\nCode: https://github.com/ResponsibleAILab/emoji-universal-sentiment.",

Their widespread use\ntranscends language and cultural barriers, enhancing understanding and\nfostering more inclusive interactions. While existing work gained valuable\ninsight into emojis understanding, exploring emojis' capability to serve as a\nuniversal sentiment indicator leveraging large language models (LLMs) has not\nbeen thoroughly examined. Our study aims to investigate the capacity of emojis\nto serve as reliable sentiment markers through LLMs across languages and\ncultures. We leveraged the multimodal capabilities of ChatGPT to explore the\nsentiments of various representations of emojis and evaluated how well\nemoji-conveyed sentiment aligned with text sentiment on a multi-lingual dataset\ncollected from 32 countries. Our analysis reveals that the accuracy of\nLLM-based emoji-conveyed sentiment is 81.43%, underscoring emojis' significant\npotential to serve as a universal sentiment marker. We also found a consistent\ntrend that the accuracy of sentiment conveyed by emojis increased as the number\nof emojis grew in text. The results reinforce the potential of emojis to serve\nas global sentiment indicators, offering insight into fields such as\ncross-lingual and cross-cultural sentiment analysis on social media platforms.\nCode: https://github.com/ResponsibleAILab/emoji-universal-sentiment."

                "summary": "Recently, both closed-source LLMs and open-source communities have made\nsignificant strides, outperforming humans in various general domains. However,\ntheir performance in specific professional domains such as medicine, especially\nwithin the open-source community, remains suboptimal due to the complexity of\nmedical knowledge. In this paper, we propose CareBot, a bilingual medical LLM,\nwhich leverages a comprehensive approach integrating continuous pre-training\n(CPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning with human\nfeedback (RLHF). Our novel two-stage CPT method, comprising Stable CPT and\nBoost CPT, effectively bridges the gap between general and domain-specific\ndata, facilitating a smooth transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and\nenhancing domain knowledge progressively. We also introduce DataRater, a model\ndesigned to assess data quality during CPT, ensuring that the training data is\nboth accurate and relevant.

                    "value": "Recently, both closed-source LLMs and open-source communities have made\nsignificant strides, outperforming humans in various general domains. However,\ntheir performance in specific professional domains such as medicine, especially\nwithin the open-source community, remains suboptimal due to the complexity of\nmedical knowledge. In this paper, we propose CareBot, a bilingual medical LLM,\nwhich leverages a comprehensive approach integrating continuous pre-training\n(CPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning with human\nfeedback (RLHF). Our novel two-stage CPT method, comprising Stable CPT and\nBoost CPT, effectively bridges the gap between general and domain-specific\ndata, facilitating a smooth transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and\nenhancing domain knowledge progressively. We also introduce DataRater, a model\ndesigned to assess data quality during CPT, ensuring that the training data is\nboth accurate and relevant.

We ask an ambitious question: can a pre-trained AR model be adapted to\ngenerate outputs in just one or two steps? If successful, this would\nsignificantly advance the development and deployment of AR models. We notice\nthat existing works that try to speed up AR generation by generating multiple\ntokens at once fundamentally cannot capture the output distribution due to the\nconditional dependencies between tokens, limiting their effectiveness for\nfew-step generation. To address this, we propose Distilled Decoding (DD), which\nuses flow matching to create a deterministic mapping from Gaussian distribution\nto the output distribution of the pre-trained AR model. We then train a network\nto distill this mapping, enabling few-step generation. DD doesn't need the\ntraining data of the original AR model, making it more practical.We evaluate DD\non state-of-the-art image AR models and present promising results on\nImageNet-256. For VAR, which requires 10-step generation, DD enables one-step\ngeneration (6.3$\\times$ speed-up), with an acceptable increase in FID from 4.19\nto 9.96. For LlamaGen, DD reduces generation from 256 steps to 1, achieving an\n217.8$\\times$ speed-up with a comparable FID increase from 4.11 to 11.35. In\nboth cases, baseline methods completely fail with FID>100. DD also excels on\ntext-to-image generation, reducing the generation from 256 steps to 2 for\nLlamaGen with minimal FID increase from 25.70 to 28.95. As the first work to\ndemonstrate the possibility of one-step generation for image AR models, DD\nchallenges the prevailing notion that AR models are inherently slow, and opens\nup new opportunities for efficient AR generation.

In\nthis work we introduce FoamPilot, a proof-of-concept LLM agent designed to\nenhance the usability of FireFOAM, a specialized solver for fire dynamics and\nfire suppression simulations built using OpenFOAM, a popular open-source\ntoolbox for computational fluid dynamics (CFD). FoamPilot provides three core\nfunctionalities: code insight, case configuration and simulation evaluation.\nCode insight is an alternative to traditional keyword searching leveraging\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and aims to enable efficient navigation\nand summarization of the FireFOAM source code for developers and experienced\nusers. For case configuration, the agent interprets user requests in natural\nlanguage and aims to modify existing simulation setups accordingly to support\nintermediate users. FoamPilot's job execution functionality seeks to manage the\nsubmission and execution of simulations in high-performance computing (HPC)\nenvironments and provide preliminary analysis of simulation results to support\nless experienced users. Promising results were achieved for each functionality,\nparticularly for simple tasks, and opportunities were identified for\nsignificant further improvement for more complex tasks. The integration of\nthese functionalities into a single LLM agent is a step aimed at accelerating\nthe simulation workflow for engineers and scientists employing FireFOAM for\ncomplex simulations critical for improving fire safety.",

                    "value": "Significant advances have been achieved in leveraging foundation models, such\nas large language models (LLMs), to accelerate complex scientific workflows. In\nthis work we introduce FoamPilot, a proof-of-concept LLM agent designed to\nenhance the usability of FireFOAM, a specialized solver for fire dynamics and\nfire suppression simulations built using OpenFOAM, a popular open-source\ntoolbox for computational fluid dynamics (CFD). FoamPilot provides three core\nfunctionalities: code insight, case configuration and simulation evaluation.\nCode insight is an alternative to traditional keyword searching leveraging\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and aims to enable efficient navigation\nand summarization of the FireFOAM source code for developers and experienced\nusers. For case configuration, the agent interprets user requests in natural\nlanguage and aims to modify existing simulation setups accordingly to support\nintermediate users. FoamPilot's job execution functionality seeks to manage the\nsubmission and execution of simulations in high-performance computing (HPC)\nenvironments and provide preliminary analysis of simulation results to support\nless experienced users. Promising results were achieved for each functionality,\nparticularly for simple tasks, and opportunities were identified for\nsignificant further improvement for more complex tasks. The integration of\nthese functionalities into a single LLM agent is a step aimed at accelerating\nthe simulation workflow for engineers and scientists employing FireFOAM for\ncomplex simulations critical for improving fire safety."
