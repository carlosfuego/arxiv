While achieving a several-fold speed-up, recent\nadvancements have allowed DLMs to show performance comparable to their\nautoregressive counterparts, making them a compelling choice for various\nnatural language processing tasks. In this survey, we provide a holistic\noverview of the current DLM landscape. We trace its evolution and relationship\nwith other paradigms, such as autoregressive and masked language models, and\ncover both foundational principles and state-of-the-art models. Our work offers\nan up-to-date, comprehensive taxonomy and an in-depth analysis of current\ntechniques, from pre-training strategies to advanced post-training methods.\nAnother contribution of this survey is a thorough review of DLM inference\nstrategies and optimizations, including improvements in decoding parallelism,\ncaching mechanisms, and generation quality. We also highlight the latest\napproaches to multimodal extensions of DLMs and delineate their applications\nacross various practical scenarios. Furthermore, our discussion addresses the\nlimitations and challenges of DLMs, including efficiency, long-sequence\nhandling, and infrastructure requirements, while outlining future research\ndirections to sustain progress in this rapidly evolving field.

However, certain complex workloads-particularly\nin fields like graph analytics, irregular database operations, and specialized\nforms of high-performance computing (e.g., unstructured mesh\nsimulations)-exhibit irregular memory access patterns that hinder CGRA\nutilization, sometimes dropping below 1.5%, making the CGRA memory-bound.

However, it exposes a new class of timing\nside-channel attacks, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive user inputs via\nshared cache entries.

Although Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated\ntheir power, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain a highly efficient and\nhigh-performance choice for feature extraction and encoding. However, the\nintensive computational demands of convolution operations hinder its broader\nadoption as a video encoder. Given the inherent temporal continuity in video\nframes, changes between consecutive frames are minimal, allowing for the\nskipping of redundant computations. This technique, which we term as Diff\nComputation, presents two primary challenges. First, Diff Computation requires\nto cache intermediate feature maps to ensure the correctness of non-linear\ncomputations, leading to significant memory consumption. Second, the imbalance\nof sparsity among layers, introduced by Diff Computation, incurs accuracy\ndegradation. To address these issues, we propose a memory-efficient scheduling\nmethod to eliminate memory overhead and an online adjustment mechanism to\nminimize accuracy degradation. We integrate these techniques into our\nframework, SparseTem, to seamlessly support various CNN-based video encoders.\nSparseTem achieves speedup of 1.79x for EfficientDet and 4.72x for CRNN, with\nminimal accuracy drop and no additional memory overhead. Extensive experimental\nresults demonstrate that SparseTem sets a new state-of-the-art by effectively\nutilizing temporal continuity to accelerate CNN-based video encoders.",

Although Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated\ntheir power, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain a highly efficient and\nhigh-performance choice for feature extraction and encoding. However, the\nintensive computational demands of convolution operations hinder its broader\nadoption as a video encoder. Given the inherent temporal continuity in video\nframes, changes between consecutive frames are minimal, allowing for the\nskipping of redundant computations. This technique, which we term as Diff\nComputation, presents two primary challenges. First, Diff Computation requires\nto cache intermediate feature maps to ensure the correctness of non-linear\ncomputations, leading to significant memory consumption. Second, the imbalance\nof sparsity among layers, introduced by Diff Computation, incurs accuracy\ndegradation. To address these issues, we propose a memory-efficient scheduling\nmethod to eliminate memory overhead and an online adjustment mechanism to\nminimize accuracy degradation. We integrate these techniques into our\nframework, SparseTem, to seamlessly support various CNN-based video encoders.\nSparseTem achieves speedup of 1.79x for EfficientDet and 4.72x for CRNN, with\nminimal accuracy drop and no additional memory overhead. Extensive experimental\nresults demonstrate that SparseTem sets a new state-of-the-art by effectively\nutilizing temporal continuity to accelerate CNN-based video encoders."

In CoMoE, we first systematically analyze\nexisting expert aggregation techniques, including expert parameter\nmerging,knowledge distillation,and parameter sharing decomposition, identifying\ntheir limitations in dynamic mobile environments.We then investigate expert\noffloading strategies encompassing expert prediction and prefetching, expert\ncaching and scheduling, and multi-tier storage architectures, revealing the\ninterdependencies between routing decisions and offloading performance.The\nCoMoE incorporates adaptive scheduling mechanisms that respond to user mobility\nand varying network conditions, enabling efficient MoE deployment across\nheterogeneous edge devices. Extensive experiments on real mobile edge testbeds\ndemonstrate that CoMoE achieves approximately 70% reduction in memory usage\ncompared to baseline methods, 10.5% lower inference latency than existing\nexpert offloading techniques, while maintaining model performance stability.\nFor large-scale MoE models (e.g,7.4B-parameter Switch-Base-128), the CoMoE\nreduces memory requirements from 15.6GB to 4.7GB, enabling deployment on\nresource-constrained mobile edge devices that previously could only support\nmuch smaller models.",

Rather than caching keys and\nvalues separately, MLA stores their compressed latent representations, reducing\nmemory overhead while maintaining the performance. While MLA improves memory\nefficiency without compromising language model accuracy, its major limitation\nlies in its integration during the pre-training phase, requiring models to be\ntrained from scratch. This raises a key question: can we use MLA's benefits\nfully or partially in models that have already been pre-trained with different\nattention mechanisms? In this paper, we propose X-EcoMLA to deploy post\ntraining distillation to enable the upcycling of Transformer-based attention\ninto an efficient hybrid MLA variant through lightweight post-training\nadaptation, bypassing the need for extensive pre-training. We demonstrate that\nleveraging the dark knowledge of a well-trained model can enhance training\naccuracy and enable extreme KV cache compression in MLA without compromising\nmodel performance. The experimental results show that our proposed method can\neffectively compress the KV cache while preserving the performance on the\nbenchmarks; specifically, for Llama3.2-1B-Instruct baseline, a 6.4x compression\nachieves the same average score by using only 3.6B training tokens and 70 GPU\nhours on AMD MI300, whereas a 10.6x compression have less than 0.1% average\nscore drop with 7B training tokens and 140 GPU hours.

In LLM serving, the\nprefill length corresponds to the input prompt length, which determines the\ninitial memory usage in the KV cache. The decode length refers to the number of\noutput tokens generated sequentially, with each additional token increasing the\nKV cache memory usage by one unit. Given a set of n requests, our goal is to\nschedule and process them to minimize the total completion time. We show that\nthis problem is NP-hard due to the interplay of batching, placement\nconstraints, precedence relationships, and linearly increasing memory usage. We\nthen analyze commonly used scheduling strategies in practice, such as\nFirst-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) and Shortest-First (SF), and prove that their\ncompetitive ratios scale up sublinearly with the memory limit-a significant\ndrawback in real-world settings where memory demand is large. To address this,\nwe propose a novel algorithm based on a new selection metric that efficiently\nforms batches over time. We prove that this algorithm achieves a constant\ncompetitive ratio. Finally, we develop and evaluate a few algorithm variants\ninspired by this approach, including dynamic programming variants, local search\nmethods, and an LP-based scheduler, demonstrating through comprehensive\nsimulations that they outperform standard baselines while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency.",

We show that\nthis problem is NP-hard due to the interplay of batching, placement\nconstraints, precedence relationships, and linearly increasing memory usage. We\nthen analyze commonly used scheduling strategies in practice, such as\nFirst-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) and Shortest-First (SF), and prove that their\ncompetitive ratios scale up sublinearly with the memory limit-a significant\ndrawback in real-world settings where memory demand is large. To address this,\nwe propose a novel algorithm based on a new selection metric that efficiently\nforms batches over time. We prove that this algorithm achieves a constant\ncompetitive ratio. Finally, we develop and evaluate a few algorithm variants\ninspired by this approach, including dynamic programming variants, local search\nmethods, and an LP-based scheduler, demonstrating through comprehensive\nsimulations that they outperform standard baselines while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency."

While some TTA methods rely on prompt-tuning,\ntraining-free cache-based approaches are preferred for efficiency. However,\ncurrent cache-based TTA models store only a limited set of high-confidence\nsamples, restricting the decision boundary to these samples and ignoring the\ninfluence of other incoming test data. To address this, we propose Efficient\nTest-Time Adaptation (ETTA), introducing a Recursive Updating module that\nintegrates all incoming test samples, progressively refining the decision\nboundary. This strategy mimics an unbounded cache, dynamically updating\ncontextual embeddings for improved accuracy with minimal memory and\ncomputational overhead. ETTA also includes an Adaptive Ensemble module to\nreduce prompt dependency in image-to-text scores by dynamically selecting\noptimal prompts for each class. Furthermore, ETTA adaptively combines scores\nfrom both modules based on confidence levels, leveraging their complementary\nstrengths. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks confirm that ETTA surpasses\nthe state-of-the-art TTA models in computational complexity and accuracy,\nsetting a new standard for effective, efficient test-time adaptation.

                    "value": "Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP show strong zero-shot\nperformance but struggle with generalization under distribution shifts.\nTest-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adapting VLMs to unlabeled test\ndata in new domains. While some TTA methods rely on prompt-tuning,\ntraining-free cache-based approaches are preferred for efficiency. However,\ncurrent cache-based TTA models store only a limited set of high-confidence\nsamples, restricting the decision boundary to these samples and ignoring the\ninfluence of other incoming test data. To address this, we propose Efficient\nTest-Time Adaptation (ETTA), introducing a Recursive Updating module that\nintegrates all incoming test samples, progressively refining the decision\nboundary. This strategy mimics an unbounded cache, dynamically updating\ncontextual embeddings for improved accuracy with minimal memory and\ncomputational overhead. ETTA also includes an Adaptive Ensemble module to\nreduce prompt dependency in image-to-text scores by dynamically selecting\noptimal prompts for each class. Furthermore, ETTA adaptively combines scores\nfrom both modules based on confidence levels, leveraging their complementary\nstrengths. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks confirm that ETTA surpasses\nthe state-of-the-art TTA models in computational complexity and accuracy,\nsetting a new standard for effective, efficient test-time adaptation.

                "summary": "Speculative decoding (SD), where an extra draft model first provides multiple\ndraft tokens and the original target model then verifies these tokens in\nparallel, has shown great power for LLM inference acceleration. However,\nexisting SD methods must adhere to the 'draft-then-verify' paradigm, which\nforces drafting and verification processes to execute sequentially during SD,\nresulting in inefficient inference performance and limiting the size of the\ndraft model. Furthermore, once a single token in the candidate sequence is\nrejected during the drafting process, all subsequent candidate tokens must be\ndiscarded, leading to inefficient drafting. To address these challenges, we\npropose a cache-based parallel speculative decoding framework employing a\n'query-and-correct' paradigm. Specifically, CARD decouples drafting and\nverification: the draft model generates candidate tokens to populate a shared\ncache, while the target model concurrently rectifies the draft model's\ngeneration direction.

                    "value": "Speculative decoding (SD), where an extra draft model first provides multiple\ndraft tokens and the original target model then verifies these tokens in\nparallel, has shown great power for LLM inference acceleration. However,\nexisting SD methods must adhere to the 'draft-then-verify' paradigm, which\nforces drafting and verification processes to execute sequentially during SD,\nresulting in inefficient inference performance and limiting the size of the\ndraft model. Furthermore, once a single token in the candidate sequence is\nrejected during the drafting process, all subsequent candidate tokens must be\ndiscarded, leading to inefficient drafting. To address these challenges, we\npropose a cache-based parallel speculative decoding framework employing a\n'query-and-correct' paradigm. Specifically, CARD decouples drafting and\nverification: the draft model generates candidate tokens to populate a shared\ncache, while the target model concurrently rectifies the draft model's\ngeneration direction. This effectively enables the target model to perform\ninference at speed approaching that of the draft model.

However, their low inference speed limits their\ndeployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches\nexploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past\nrepresentations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer\ninstead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.\nHowever, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g.,\nattention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate\nfeatures, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it\nadopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of\npredictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when\nprediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to\nbetter leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor\nprediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly\nreducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong\nsequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error\nbetween the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an\nindicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor\nprediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation,\nthereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our\nmethod achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x\nacceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible\nquality drop.

Recent training-free approaches\nexploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past\nrepresentations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer\ninstead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.\nHowever, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g.,\nattention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate\nfeatures, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it\nadopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of\npredictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when\nprediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to\nbetter leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor\nprediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly\nreducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong\nsequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error\nbetween the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an\nindicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor\nprediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation,\nthereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our\nmethod achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x\nacceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible\nquality drop.

We propose LeanK, a\nlearning-based method that prunes unimportant key (K) cache channels by\nleveraging static channel sparsity. With a novel two-stage training process,\nLeanK learns channel-wise static mask that could satisfy specific sparsity\nratio and hardware alignment requirement. LeanK reduces GPU memory and\naccelerates decoding without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments demonstrate up\nto 70% K cache and 16%-18% V cache memory reduction. Custom decoding kernel\nenables 1.3x speedup for attention computation. We also provide insights into\nmodel channels and attention heads during long-context inference by analyzing\nthe learned importance distribution. Our code is available at\nhttps://aka.ms/LeanK."

                "summary": "Video caching can significantly improve delivery efficiency and enhance\nquality of video streaming, which constitutes the majority of wireless\ncommunication traffic. Due to limited cache size, caching strategies must be\ndesigned to adapt to and dynamic user demand in order to maximize system\nrevenue. The system revenue depends on the benefits of delivering the requested\nvideos and costs for (a) transporting the files to the users and (b) cache\nreplacement. Since the cache content at any point in time impacts the\nreplacement costs in the future, demand predictions over multiple cache\nplacement slots become an important prerequisite for efficient cache planning.\nMotivated by this, we introduce a novel two-stage privacy-preserving solution\nfor revenue optimization in wireless video caching networks. First, we train a\nTransformer using privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) to predict\nmulti-slot future demands. Given that prediction results are never entirely\naccurate, especially for longer horizons, we further combine global content\npopularity with per-user prediction results to estimate the content demand\ndistribution.

                    "value": "Video caching can significantly improve delivery efficiency and enhance\nquality of video streaming, which constitutes the majority of wireless\ncommunication traffic. Due to limited cache size, caching strategies must be\ndesigned to adapt to and dynamic user demand in order to maximize system\nrevenue. The system revenue depends on the benefits of delivering the requested\nvideos and costs for (a) transporting the files to the users and (b) cache\nreplacement. Since the cache content at any point in time impacts the\nreplacement costs in the future, demand predictions over multiple cache\nplacement slots become an important prerequisite for efficient cache planning.\nMotivated by this, we introduce a novel two-stage privacy-preserving solution\nfor revenue optimization in wireless video caching networks. First, we train a\nTransformer using privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) to predict\nmulti-slot future demands. Given that prediction results are never entirely\naccurate, especially for longer horizons, we further combine global content\npopularity with per-user prediction results to estimate the content demand\ndistribution. Then, in the second stage, we leverage these estimation results\nto find caching strategies that maximize the long-term system revenue. This\nlatter problem takes on the form of a multi-stage knapsack problem, which we\nthen transform to a integer linear program.

However, existing\ntoken-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their\nirreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns\nduring decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both\nmarginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the\ncollective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal\ninformation over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two\ncompensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices\nbetween LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted\ncompensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention\nmatching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in\nperceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller\nmodel's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger\nmodel. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and\nLongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV. Moreover, efficiency\nevaluations show that SmallKV achieves 1.75 - 2.56 times higher throughput than\nbaseline methods, highlighting its potential for efficient and performant LLM\ninference in resource constrained environments.",

In addition,\nwe construct pitch-shifted pairs by translating and cropping the VQT frames and\ntrain our model with a novel class-based transposition-equivariant objective,\neliminating the need for annotated data. Thanks to this architecture and\ntraining objective, our model achieves remarkable performances while being very\nlightweight ($130$k parameters). Evaluations on music and speech datasets\n(MIR-1K, MDB-stem-synth, and PTDB) demonstrate that PESTO not only outperforms\nself-supervised baselines but also competes with supervised methods, exhibiting\nsuperior cross-dataset generalization. Finally, we enhance PESTO's practical\nutility by developing a streamable VQT implementation using cached\nconvolutions. Combined with our model's low latency (less than 10 ms) and\nminimal parameter count, this makes PESTO particularly suitable for real-time\napplications.",

PiKV leverages \\textit{expert-sharded\nKV storage} to partition caches across GPUs, \\textit{PiKV routing} to reduce\ntoken-to-KV access, and a \\textit{PiKV Scheduling} to adaptively retain\nquery-relevant entries. To further reduce memory usage, PiKV integrates\n\\textit{PiKV Compression} modules the caching pipeline for acceleration.\n  PiKV is recently publicly available as an open-source software library:\n\\href{https://github.com/NoakLiu/PiKV}{https://github.com/NoakLiu/PiKV}.\nExperiments details is recorded at:\n\\href{https://github.com/NoakLiu/PiKV/blob/main/downstream_tasks/README.md}{https://github.com/NoakLiu/PiKV/Experimental\\_Results}.\nWe also have PiKV integrated with Nvidia kvpress for acceleration, details see\n\\href{https://github.com/NoakLiu/PiKVpress}{https://github.com/NoakLiu/PiKVpress}.\nPiKV is still a living project, aiming to become a comprehesive KV Cache\nmanagement system for MoE Architectures."

Unlike existing solutions, it requires no access to\nproprietary RAN software, hardware-specific features, or kernel modifications.\nFully compliant with the O-RAN architecture and agnostic to the underlying RAN\nstack, the proposed solution introduces negligible overhead while improving\nenergy efficiency and CPU utilization. Experimental results using a\ncommercial-grade srsRAN deployment demonstrate consistent power savings without\ncompromising real-time processing performance, highlighting the potential of\nlow-latency dApps for fine-grained resource control in next-generation networks"

Notably,\nOmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models\nincluding Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding;\nand additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup."

To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a\nbenchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and\nunit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform\nnon-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even\nrelatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially\ntrained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still\nexhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise\njudging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can\nsubstantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests\nwritten by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in\nperformance. This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and\nconsistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios. Lastly, we study optimal\nprompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge.

In contrast, STream3R introduces an\nstreaming framework that processes image sequences efficiently using causal\nattention, inspired by advances in modern language modeling. By learning\ngeometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets, STream3R generalizes well to\ndiverse and challenging scenarios, including dynamic scenes where traditional\nmethods often fail. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently\noutperforms prior work across both static and dynamic scene benchmarks.\nMoreover, STream3R is inherently compatible with LLM-style training\ninfrastructure, enabling efficient large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning for\nvarious downstream 3D tasks.

To this end, we first quantify the intrinsic search capability of LLMs\nvia structured prompting and repeated sampling, which we term Self-Search. Our\nresults reveal that LLMs exhibit strong scaling behavior with respect to the\ninference budget, achieving high pass@k on question-answering benchmarks,\nincluding the challenging BrowseComp task. Building on these observations, we\nintroduce Self-Search RL (SSRL), which enhances LLMs' Self-Search capability\nthrough format-based and rule-based rewards.

To this end, we first quantify the intrinsic search capability of LLMs\nvia structured prompting and repeated sampling, which we term Self-Search. Our\nresults reveal that LLMs exhibit strong scaling behavior with respect to the\ninference budget, achieving high pass@k on question-answering benchmarks,\nincluding the challenging BrowseComp task. Building on these observations, we\nintroduce Self-Search RL (SSRL), which enhances LLMs' Self-Search capability\nthrough format-based and rule-based rewards.

Low-bit KV-cache quantization (e.g., 4-bit or\n2-bit) can reduce memory footprint while preserving accuracy, but existing\nsystems suffer from slow decoding due to their exclusive reliance on CUDA\ncores, neglecting Tensor Cores (the primary source of compute on modern GPUs).\nWe present BitDecoding, a new long-context LLM inference system with a low-bit\nKV cache.

Compared to 1D\nSMILES sequences and 2D molecular graphs, 3D molecules represent the most\ninformative molecular modality. Despite the rapid progress of\nautoregressive-based language models, they cannot handle the generation of 3D\nmolecular conformation due to several challenges: 1) 3D molecular structures\nare incompatible with LLMs' discrete token space, 2) integrating heterogeneous\ninputs like proteins, ligands, and text remains difficult within a unified\nmodel, and 3) LLMs lack essential scientific priors, hindering the enforcement\nof physical and chemical constraints during generation. To tackle these issues,\nwe present Chem3DLLM, a unified protein-conditioned multimodal large language\nmodel. Our approach designs a novel reversible text encoding for 3D molecular\nstructures using run-length compression, achieving 3x size reduction while\npreserving complete structural information. This enables seamless integration\nof molecular geometry with protein pocket features in a single LLM\narchitecture. We employ reinforcement learning with stability-based rewards to\noptimize chemical validity and incorporate a lightweight protein embedding\nprojector for end-to-end training. Experimental results on structure-based drug\ndesign demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with a Vina score of -7.21,\nvalidating our unified multimodal approach for practical drug discovery\napplications.",

                    "value": "In the real world, a molecule is a 3D geometric structure. Compared to 1D\nSMILES sequences and 2D molecular graphs, 3D molecules represent the most\ninformative molecular modality. Despite the rapid progress of\nautoregressive-based language models, they cannot handle the generation of 3D\nmolecular conformation due to several challenges: 1) 3D molecular structures\nare incompatible with LLMs' discrete token space, 2) integrating heterogeneous\ninputs like proteins, ligands, and text remains difficult within a unified\nmodel, and 3) LLMs lack essential scientific priors, hindering the enforcement\nof physical and chemical constraints during generation. To tackle these issues,\nwe present Chem3DLLM, a unified protein-conditioned multimodal large language\nmodel. Our approach designs a novel reversible text encoding for 3D molecular\nstructures using run-length compression, achieving 3x size reduction while\npreserving complete structural information. This enables seamless integration\nof molecular geometry with protein pocket features in a single LLM\narchitecture. We employ reinforcement learning with stability-based rewards to\noptimize chemical validity and incorporate a lightweight protein embedding\nprojector for end-to-end training. Experimental results on structure-based drug\ndesign demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with a Vina score of -7.21,\nvalidating our unified multimodal approach for practical drug discovery\napplications."

Given the DDIM-inverted latent of a single input image, we employ\na camera pose-conditioned translation U-Net, TUNet, to predict the inverted\nlatent corresponding to the desired target view.

To this end,\nwe propose a novel fusion strategy that exploits the inherent noise correlation\nstructure observed in DDIM inversion.

To synthesize the novel view, we\nuse the fused latent as the initial condition for DDIM sampling, leveraging the\ngenerative prior of the pretrained diffusion model.

To\naccelerate training and inference, we investigated the recent generative\nrecommendation models HSTU and FuXi-$\\alpha$, identifying two efficiency\nbottlenecks: the indexing operations in relative temporal attention bias and\nthe computation of the query-key attention map. Additionally, we observed that\nrelative attention bias in self-attention mechanisms can also serve as\nattention maps.

In this paper, we introduce CATE-B, an open-source co-pilot system\nthat uses large language models (LLMs) within an agentic framework to guide\nusers through the end-to-end process of treatment effect estimation. CATE-B\nassists in (i) constructing a structural causal model via causal discovery and\nLLM-based edge orientation, (ii) identifying robust adjustment sets through a\nnovel Minimal Uncertainty Adjustment Set criterion, and (iii) selecting\nappropriate regression methods tailored to the causal structure and dataset\ncharacteristics. To encourage reproducibility and evaluation, we release a\nsuite of benchmark tasks spanning diverse domains and causal complexities. By\ncombining causal inference with intelligent, interactive assistance, CATE-B\nlowers the barrier to rigorous causal analysis and lays the foundation for a\nnew class of benchmarks in automated treatment effect estimation.",

In this paper, we introduce CATE-B, an open-source co-pilot system\nthat uses large language models (LLMs) within an agentic framework to guide\nusers through the end-to-end process of treatment effect estimation. CATE-B\nassists in (i) constructing a structural causal model via causal discovery and\nLLM-based edge orientation, (ii) identifying robust adjustment sets through a\nnovel Minimal Uncertainty Adjustment Set criterion, and (iii) selecting\nappropriate regression methods tailored to the causal structure and dataset\ncharacteristics. To encourage reproducibility and evaluation, we release a\nsuite of benchmark tasks spanning diverse domains and causal complexities. By\ncombining causal inference with intelligent, interactive assistance, CATE-B\nlowers the barrier to rigorous causal analysis and lays the foundation for a\nnew class of benchmarks in automated treatment effect estimation."

Our in-depth analysis identifies three underlying causes: attention\ndilution from severe token redundancy in non-textual modalities, the influence\nof fusion architecture design, and task formulations that implicitly favor\ntextual inputs. Furthermore, we propose a simple token compression method that\neffectively rebalances model attention. Applying this method to LLaVA-7B, for\ninstance, drastically reduces its MDI from 10.23 to a well-balanced value of\n0.86.

In the M_dyn/L-L diagram, DSCs trace a\ntransitional channel bridging globular clusters and dwarf galaxies as they rise\nfrom M_dyn/L ~ 2 to 10^4 M_sun/L_sun."

In this paper, we introduce\nSIFThinker, a spatially-aware \"think-with-images\" framework that mimics human\nvisual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and\nimage region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural\nlanguage.

Besides, we propose\nGRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual\ngrounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically\ncorrect and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding\nand fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general\ncapabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

While\nartificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), is\ntransforming clinical diagnosis, its role remains largely as an assistant to\nphysicians. This AI-assisted working pattern makes AI can only answer specific\nmedical questions at certain parts within the diagnostic process, but lack the\nability to drive the entire diagnostic process starting from an ambiguous\ncomplaint, which still relies heavily on human physicians. This gap limits AI's\nability to fully reduce physicians' workload and enhance diagnostic efficiency.\nTo address this, we propose a paradigm shift that reverses the relationship\nbetween physicians and AI: repositioning AI as the primary director, with\nphysicians serving as its assistants. So we present DxDirector-7B, an LLM\nendowed with advanced deep thinking capabilities, enabling it to drive the\nfull-process diagnosis with minimal physician involvement. Furthermore,\nDxDirector-7B establishes a robust accountability framework for misdiagnoses,\ndelineating responsibility between AI and human physicians. In evaluations\nacross rare, complex, and real-world cases under full-process diagnosis\nsetting, DxDirector-7B not only achieves significant superior diagnostic\naccuracy but also substantially reduces physician workload than\nstate-of-the-art medical LLMs as well as general-purpose LLMs. Fine-grained\nanalyses across multiple clinical departments and tasks validate its efficacy,\nwith expert evaluations indicating its potential to serve as a viable\nsubstitute for medical specialists. These findings mark a new era where AI,\ntraditionally a physicians' assistant, now drives the entire diagnostic process\nto drastically reduce physicians' workload, indicating an efficient and\naccurate diagnostic solution.",

This AI-assisted working pattern makes AI can only answer specific\nmedical questions at certain parts within the diagnostic process, but lack the\nability to drive the entire diagnostic process starting from an ambiguous\ncomplaint, which still relies heavily on human physicians. This gap limits AI's\nability to fully reduce physicians' workload and enhance diagnostic efficiency.\nTo address this, we propose a paradigm shift that reverses the relationship\nbetween physicians and AI: repositioning AI as the primary director, with\nphysicians serving as its assistants. So we present DxDirector-7B, an LLM\nendowed with advanced deep thinking capabilities, enabling it to drive the\nfull-process diagnosis with minimal physician involvement. Furthermore,\nDxDirector-7B establishes a robust accountability framework for misdiagnoses,\ndelineating responsibility between AI and human physicians. In evaluations\nacross rare, complex, and real-world cases under full-process diagnosis\nsetting, DxDirector-7B not only achieves significant superior diagnostic\naccuracy but also substantially reduces physician workload than\nstate-of-the-art medical LLMs as well as general-purpose LLMs. Fine-grained\nanalyses across multiple clinical departments and tasks validate its efficacy,\nwith expert evaluations indicating its potential to serve as a viable\nsubstitute for medical specialists. These findings mark a new era where AI,\ntraditionally a physicians' assistant, now drives the entire diagnostic process\nto drastically reduce physicians' workload, indicating an efficient and\naccurate diagnostic solution."

Unlike existing\napproaches that impose rigid limits or rely on post-hoc interventions, LAPO\nenables models to internalize an understanding of appropriate reasoning depth\nthrough a two-stage reinforcement learning process. In the first stage, models\nlearn natural reasoning patterns by discovering the statistical distribution of\nsuccessful solution lengths. The second stage leverages these patterns as\nmeta-cognitive guidance, embedding them directly within the model's reasoning\ncontext to ensure inference-time flexibility. Experiments on mathematical\nreasoning benchmarks demonstrate that LAPO reduces token usage by up to 40.9%\nwhile improving accuracy by 2.3%. Our analysis reveals that models trained with\nLAPO develop emergent abilities to allocate computational resources based on\nproblem complexity, achieving efficient reasoning without sacrificing quality.",

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in\nnatural language processing tasks, yet their application to graph structure\nanalysis, particularly in community search, remains underexplored. Community\nsearch, a fundamental task in graph analysis, aims to identify groups of nodes\nwith dense interconnections, which is crucial for understanding the macroscopic\nstructure of graphs. In this paper, we propose GraphCS, a comprehensive\nbenchmark designed to evaluate the performance of LLMs in community search\ntasks. Our experiments reveal that while LLMs exhibit preliminary potential,\nthey frequently fail to return meaningful results and suffer from output bias.\nTo address these limitations, we introduce CS-Agent, a dual-agent collaborative\nframework to enhance LLM-based community search.

Community\nsearch, a fundamental task in graph analysis, aims to identify groups of nodes\nwith dense interconnections, which is crucial for understanding the macroscopic\nstructure of graphs. In this paper, we propose GraphCS, a comprehensive\nbenchmark designed to evaluate the performance of LLMs in community search\ntasks. Our experiments reveal that while LLMs exhibit preliminary potential,\nthey frequently fail to return meaningful results and suffer from output bias.\nTo address these limitations, we introduce CS-Agent, a dual-agent collaborative\nframework to enhance LLM-based community search.

To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM,\nCLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets\nand evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). \\ourdataset~is\nhighly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised\nprediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M\nlearnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and\nclassification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average.\nModels built with \\ourdataset~can be used as constraints while optimizing for\nnovel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly\nas effective.

In this work, we introduce\n\\ourdataset, a dataset of priors for design problems extracted from literature\ndescribing compounds used in lab settings. It is constructed with LLM pipelines\nfor discovering therapeutic entities in relevant paragraphs and summarizing\ninformation in concise fair-use facts. \\ourdataset~ consists of 32.3 million\npairs of natural language facts, and appropriate entity representations (i.e.\nSMILES or refseq IDs). To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM,\nCLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets\nand evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). \\ourdataset~is\nhighly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised\nprediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M\nlearnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and\nclassification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average.\nModels built with \\ourdataset~can be used as constraints while optimizing for\nnovel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly\nas effective. We release our dataset at\n\\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex}{huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex},\nand will provide expanded versions as available literature grows."

Our\nresults reveal that LLMs exhibit strong scaling behavior with respect to the\ninference budget, achieving high pass@k on question-answering benchmarks,\nincluding the challenging BrowseComp task. Building on these observations, we\nintroduce Self-Search RL (SSRL), which enhances LLMs' Self-Search capability\nthrough format-based and rule-based rewards. SSRL enables models to iteratively\nrefine their knowledge utilization internally, without requiring access to\nexternal tools. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SSRL-trained policy\nmodels provide a cost-effective and stable environment for search-driven RL\ntraining, reducing reliance on external search engines and facilitating robust\nsim-to-real transfer. We draw the following conclusions: 1) LLMs possess world\nknowledge that can be effectively elicited to achieve high performance; 2) SSRL\ndemonstrates the potential of leveraging internal knowledge to reduce\nhallucination; 3) SSRL-trained models integrate seamlessly with external search\nengines without additional effort.

A key concern is\nassuring the reliability of robot perception, as perception seeds safe\ndecision-making. Failures in perception are often due to complex yet common\nenvironmental factors and can lead to accidents that erode public trust. To\naddress this concern, we introduce the SET (Self, Environment, and Target)\nPerceptual Factors Framework. We designed the framework to systematically\nanalyze how factors such as weather, occlusion, or sensor limitations\nnegatively impact perception. To achieve this, the framework employs SET State\nTrees to categorize where such factors originate and SET Factor Trees to model\nhow these sources and factors impact perceptual tasks like object detection or\npose estimation.

                    "value": "Future autonomous systems promise significant societal benefits, yet their\ndeployment raises concerns about safety and trustworthiness. A key concern is\nassuring the reliability of robot perception, as perception seeds safe\ndecision-making. Failures in perception are often due to complex yet common\nenvironmental factors and can lead to accidents that erode public trust. To\naddress this concern, we introduce the SET (Self, Environment, and Target)\nPerceptual Factors Framework. We designed the framework to systematically\nanalyze how factors such as weather, occlusion, or sensor limitations\nnegatively impact perception. To achieve this, the framework employs SET State\nTrees to categorize where such factors originate and SET Factor Trees to model\nhow these sources and factors impact perceptual tasks like object detection or\npose estimation.

To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce \\textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the\ncross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA.

Current approaches for personalizing large\nlanguage models (LLMs) often rely on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),\nfollowed by reinforcement learning with scalar reward signals to teach models\nhow to use retrieved personal context. We believe that these scalar rewards\nsometimes provide weak, non-instructive feedback, limiting learning efficiency\nand personalization quality. We introduce VAC, a novel framework for\npersonalized response generation that replaces scalar rewards with natural\nlanguage feedback (NLF) that are generated conditioned on the user profiles and\nthe question narratives. NLF serves as a rich and actionable supervision\nsignal, allowing the policy model to iteratively refine its outputs and\ninternalize effective personalization strategies. Training alternates between\noptimizing the feedback model and fine-tuning the policy model on the improved\nresponses, resulting in a policy model that no longer requires feedback at\ninference. Evaluation on the LaMP-QA benchmark that consists of three diverse\ndomains demonstrates consistent and significant improvements over the\nstate-of-the-art results. Human evaluations further confirm the superior\nquality of the generated responses. These results demonstrate that NLF provides\nmore effective signals for optimizing personalized question answering.",

                    "value": "Personalization is crucial for enhancing both the effectiveness and user\nsatisfaction of language technologies, particularly in information-seeking\ntasks like question answering. Current approaches for personalizing large\nlanguage models (LLMs) often rely on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),\nfollowed by reinforcement learning with scalar reward signals to teach models\nhow to use retrieved personal context. We believe that these scalar rewards\nsometimes provide weak, non-instructive feedback, limiting learning efficiency\nand personalization quality. We introduce VAC, a novel framework for\npersonalized response generation that replaces scalar rewards with natural\nlanguage feedback (NLF) that are generated conditioned on the user profiles and\nthe question narratives. NLF serves as a rich and actionable supervision\nsignal, allowing the policy model to iteratively refine its outputs and\ninternalize effective personalization strategies. Training alternates between\noptimizing the feedback model and fine-tuning the policy model on the improved\nresponses, resulting in a policy model that no longer requires feedback at\ninference. Evaluation on the LaMP-QA benchmark that consists of three diverse\ndomains demonstrates consistent and significant improvements over the\nstate-of-the-art results. Human evaluations further confirm the superior\nquality of the generated responses. These results demonstrate that NLF provides\nmore effective signals for optimizing personalized question answering."

Regardless of the control policy in use, a\nhigh-level safety layer continuously monitors system performance during\noperation. It initiates a shutdown only when disturbances become sufficiently\nsevere such that compensation is no longer viable and continued operation would\njeopardize the system or its environment. The proposed synthesis of DNN and RAC\npolicy guarantees uniform exponential stability of the entire WMR system while\nadhering to safety standards to some extent. The effectiveness of the proposed\napproach was further validated through real-time experiments using a 6,000 kg\nWMR."

Black-box attacks, notable for their high attack success\nrate without model knowledge, are especially concerning, with their\ntransferability extensively studied to reduce computational costs compared to\nquery-based attacks. Previous transferability-based black-box attacks typically\nadopt mean Average Precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric and design training\nloss accordingly. However, due to the presence of multiple detected bounding\nboxes and the relatively lenient Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, the\nattack effectiveness of these approaches is often overestimated, resulting in\nreduced success rates in practical attacking scenarios. Furthermore, patches\ntrained on low-resolution data often fail to maintain effectiveness on\nhigh-resolution images, limiting their transferability to autonomous driving\ndatasets. To fill this gap, we propose P$^3$A, a Powerful and Practical Patch\nAttack framework for 2D object detection in autonomous driving, specifically\noptimized for high-resolution datasets. First, we introduce a novel metric,\nPractical Attack Success Rate (PASR), to more accurately quantify attack\neffectiveness with greater relevance for pedestrian safety. Second, we present\na tailored Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL) to improve attack\ntransferability under PASR. Finally, to maintain the transferability for\nhigh-resolution datasets, we further incorporate the Probabilistic\nScale-Preserving Padding (PSPP) into the patch attack pipeline as a data\npreprocessing step. Extensive experiments show that P$^3$A outperforms\nstate-of-the-art attacks on unseen models and unseen high-resolution datasets,\nboth under the proposed practical IoU-based evaluation metric and the previous\nmAP-based metrics.",

Despite their\nadvancements, our investigation reveals a noteworthy bias: the generated\ncontent is often driven more by the inherent priors of the underlying Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) than by the input image. Empirical experiments\nunderscore the persistence of this bias, as MLLMs often provide confident\nanswers even in the absence of relevant images or given incongruent visual\ninputs. To rectify these biases and redirect the model's focus toward visual\ninformation, we propose two simple, training-free strategies. First, for tasks\nsuch as classification or multi-choice question answering, we introduce a\n\"Post-Hoc Debias\" method using an affine calibration step to adjust the output\ndistribution. This approach ensures uniform answer scores when the image is\nabsent, acting as an effective regularization technique to alleviate the\ninfluence of LLM priors. For more intricate open-ended generation tasks, we\nextend this method to \"Visual Debias Decoding\", which mitigates bias by\ncontrasting token log-probabilities conditioned on a correct image versus a\nmeaningless one. Additionally, our investigation sheds light on the instability\nof MLLMs across various decoding configurations. Through systematic exploration\nof different settings, we achieve significant performance\nimprovements--surpassing previously reported results--and raise concerns about\nthe fairness of current evaluation practices. Comprehensive experiments\nsubstantiate the effectiveness of our proposed strategies in mitigating biases.\nThese strategies not only prove beneficial in minimizing hallucinations but\nalso contribute to the generation of more helpful and precise illustrations.",

By examining an indirect\nconflict involving power and resource block allocation xApps and employing an\nAdvantage Actor-Critic (A2C) approach to train both xApps and the scheduler, we\nillustrate that a straightforward A2C-based scheduler improves performance\nrelative to independently deployed xApps and conflicting cases. Notably, among\nall tested deployment scenarios (including individual xApp deployment, multiple\nconflicting xApps, and limited scheduler configurations), augmenting the system\nwith baseline xApps and enabling the scheduler to select from a broader pool\nachieves the highest total transmission rate, thereby underscoring the\nimportance of adaptive scheduling mechanisms. These findings highlight the\ncontext-dependent nature of conflicts in automated network management, as two\nxApps may conflict under certain conditions but coexist under others.\nConsequently, the ability to dynamically update and adapt the scheduler to\naccommodate diverse operational intents is vital for future network\ndeployments.

By examining an indirect\nconflict involving power and resource block allocation xApps and employing an\nAdvantage Actor-Critic (A2C) approach to train both xApps and the scheduler, we\nillustrate that a straightforward A2C-based scheduler improves performance\nrelative to independently deployed xApps and conflicting cases. Notably, among\nall tested deployment scenarios (including individual xApp deployment, multiple\nconflicting xApps, and limited scheduler configurations), augmenting the system\nwith baseline xApps and enabling the scheduler to select from a broader pool\nachieves the highest total transmission rate, thereby underscoring the\nimportance of adaptive scheduling mechanisms. These findings highlight the\ncontext-dependent nature of conflicts in automated network management, as two\nxApps may conflict under certain conditions but coexist under others.\nConsequently, the ability to dynamically update and adapt the scheduler to\naccommodate diverse operational intents is vital for future network\ndeployments. By offering dynamic scheduling without re-training xApps, this\nframework advances practical conflict resolution solutions while supporting\nreal-world scalability."

While\nartificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), is\ntransforming clinical diagnosis, its role remains largely as an assistant to\nphysicians. This AI-assisted working pattern makes AI can only answer specific\nmedical questions at certain parts within the diagnostic process, but lack the\nability to drive the entire diagnostic process starting from an ambiguous\ncomplaint, which still relies heavily on human physicians. This gap limits AI's\nability to fully reduce physicians' workload and enhance diagnostic efficiency.\nTo address this, we propose a paradigm shift that reverses the relationship\nbetween physicians and AI: repositioning AI as the primary director, with\nphysicians serving as its assistants. So we present DxDirector-7B, an LLM\nendowed with advanced deep thinking capabilities, enabling it to drive the\nfull-process diagnosis with minimal physician involvement. Furthermore,\nDxDirector-7B establishes a robust accountability framework for misdiagnoses,\ndelineating responsibility between AI and human physicians. In evaluations\nacross rare, complex, and real-world cases under full-process diagnosis\nsetting, DxDirector-7B not only achieves significant superior diagnostic\naccuracy but also substantially reduces physician workload than\nstate-of-the-art medical LLMs as well as general-purpose LLMs. Fine-grained\nanalyses across multiple clinical departments and tasks validate its efficacy,\nwith expert evaluations indicating its potential to serve as a viable\nsubstitute for medical specialists.

These markets then ensure fair and efficient resource\nallocation and encourage deployment by remunerating providers. This\nincentivization is facilitated by decoupling reservations from network\nidentities, which enables novel control-plane mechanisms and allows the design\nof a control plane based on smart contracts.\n  Hummingbird also provides an efficient reservation data plane, which\nstreamlines the processing on routers and thus simplifies the implementation,\ndeployment, and traffic policing, while maintaining robust security properties.\nOur prototype implementation demonstrates the efficiency and scalability of\nHummingbird's asset-based control plane, and our high-speed software\nimplementation can fill a 160 Gbps link with Hummingbird packets on commodity\nhardware.",

                    "value": "To realize the long-standing vision of providing quality-of-service (QoS)\nguarantees on a public Internet, this paper introduces Hummingbird: a\nlightweight QoS-system that provides fine-grained inter-domain reservations for\nend hosts.\n  Hummingbird enables flexible and composable reservations with end-to-end\nguarantees, and addresses an often overlooked, but crucial, aspect of\nbandwidth-reservation systems: incentivization of network providers.\nHummingbird represents bandwidth reservations as tradable assets, allowing\nmarkets to emerge. These markets then ensure fair and efficient resource\nallocation and encourage deployment by remunerating providers. This\nincentivization is facilitated by decoupling reservations from network\nidentities, which enables novel control-plane mechanisms and allows the design\nof a control plane based on smart contracts.\n  Hummingbird also provides an efficient reservation data plane, which\nstreamlines the processing on routers and thus simplifies the implementation,\ndeployment, and traffic policing, while maintaining robust security properties.\nOur prototype implementation demonstrates the efficiency and scalability of\nHummingbird's asset-based control plane, and our high-speed software\nimplementation can fill a 160 Gbps link with Hummingbird packets on commodity\nhardware."

Recent studies have leveraged the\ngeneralization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to time\nseries forecasting, achieving promising performance. However, existing studies\nfocus on token-level modal alignment, instead of bridging the intrinsic\nmodality gap between linguistic knowledge structures and time series data\npatterns, greatly limiting the semantic representation. To address this issue,\nwe propose a novel Semantic-Enhanced LLM (SE-LLM) that explores the inherent\nperiodicity and anomalous characteristics of time series to embed into the\nsemantic space to enhance the token embedding. This process enhances the\ninterpretability of tokens for LLMs, thereby activating the potential of LLMs\nfor temporal sequence analysis. Moreover, existing Transformer-based LLMs excel\nat capturing long-range dependencies but are weak at modeling short-term\nanomalies in time-series data. Hence, we propose a plugin module embedded\nwithin self-attention that models long-term and short-term dependencies to\neffectively adapt LLMs to time-series analysis.

                    "value": "Time series forecasting plays a significant role in finance, energy,\nmeteorology, and IoT applications. Recent studies have leveraged the\ngeneralization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to time\nseries forecasting, achieving promising performance. However, existing studies\nfocus on token-level modal alignment, instead of bridging the intrinsic\nmodality gap between linguistic knowledge structures and time series data\npatterns, greatly limiting the semantic representation. To address this issue,\nwe propose a novel Semantic-Enhanced LLM (SE-LLM) that explores the inherent\nperiodicity and anomalous characteristics of time series to embed into the\nsemantic space to enhance the token embedding. This process enhances the\ninterpretability of tokens for LLMs, thereby activating the potential of LLMs\nfor temporal sequence analysis. Moreover, existing Transformer-based LLMs excel\nat capturing long-range dependencies but are weak at modeling short-term\nanomalies in time-series data. Hence, we propose a plugin module embedded\nwithin self-attention that models long-term and short-term dependencies to\neffectively adapt LLMs to time-series analysis. Our approach freezes the LLM\nand reduces the sequence dimensionality of tokens, greatly reducing\ncomputational consumption. Experiments demonstrate the superiority performance\nof our SE-LLM against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods."
