                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Speculative sampling is a promising approach to accelerate the decoding stage for Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent advancements that leverage target LLM's contextual information, such as hidden states and KV cache, have shown significant practical improvements. However, these approaches suffer from inconsistent context between training and decoding. We also observe another discrepancy between the training and decoding objectives in existing speculative sampling methods. In this work, we propose a solution named HArmonized Speculative Sampling (HASS) that learns harmonized representations to address these issues. HASS accelerates the decoding stage without adding inference overhead through harmonized objective distillation and harmonized context alignment. Experiments on four LLaMA models demonstrate that HASS achieves 2.81x-4.05x wall-clock time speedup ratio averaging across three datasets, surpassing EAGLE-2 by 8%-20%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We explore the role of attention mechanism during inference in text-conditional diffusion models. Empirical observations suggest that cross-attention outputs converge to a fixed point after several inference steps. The convergence time naturally divides the entire inference process into two phases: an initial phase for planning text-oriented visual semantics, which are then translated into images in a subsequent fidelity-improving phase. Cross-attention is essential in the initial phase but almost irrelevant thereafter. However, self-attention initially plays a minor role but becomes crucial in the second phase. These findings yield a simple and training-free method known as temporally gating the attention (TGATE), which efficiently generates images by caching and reusing attention outputs at scheduled time steps. Experimental results show when widely applied to various existing text-conditional diffusion models, TGATE accelerates these models by 10%-50%. The code of TGATE is available at https://github.com/HaozheLiu-ST/T-GATE.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generating ultra-long sequences with large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly crucial but remains a highly time-intensive task, particularly for sequences up to 100K tokens. While traditional speculative decoding methods exist, simply extending their generation limits fails to accelerate the process and can be detrimental. Through an in-depth analysis, we identify three major challenges hindering efficient generation: frequent model reloading, dynamic key-value (KV) management and repetitive generation. To address these issues, we introduce TOKENSWIFT, a novel framework designed to substantially accelerate the generation process of ultra-long sequences while maintaining the target model's inherent quality. Experimental results demonstrate that TOKENSWIFT achieves over 3 times speedup across models of varying scales (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B) and architectures (MHA, GQA). This acceleration translates to hours of time savings for ultra-long sequence generation, establishing TOKENSWIFT as a scalable and effective solution at unprecedented lengths.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the development of large language models (LLMs), efficient inference through Key-Value (KV) cache compression has attracted considerable attention, especially for long-context generation. To compress the KV cache, recent methods identify critical KV tokens through heuristic ranking with attention scores. However, these methods often struggle to accurately determine critical tokens as they neglect the \textit{temporal patterns} in attention scores, resulting in a noticeable degradation in LLM performance. To address this challenge, we propose AttentionPredictor, which is the first learning-based critical token identification approach. Specifically, AttentionPredictor learns a lightweight convolution model to capture spatiotemporal patterns and predict the next-token attention score. An appealing feature of AttentionPredictor is that it accurately predicts the attention score while consuming negligible memory. Moreover, we propose a cross-token critical cache prefetching framework that hides the token estimation time overhead to accelerate the decoding stage. By retaining most of the attention information, AttentionPredictor achieves 16$\times$ KV cache compression with comparable LLM performance, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are one of the most important killer computer applications. The recent algorithmic advancement proposes a fine-grained group-wise quantization for LLMs, which treats a small set (e.g., 64) of values in a tensor as a compression unit. It effectively preserves the model accuracy without retraining, and has become the standard approach to efficiently deploy LLMs. On the other hand, there are works that propose various adaptive data types to better adapt to different distributions and further reduce the required bit length for LLMs. In this work, our detailed analysis unveils a key finding that while different tensors exhibit similar distributions, small groups can have markedly different distributions. As such, the group-level diversity requires a new level of adaptivity for which existing adaptive data types fail to provide.   In this paper, we propose MANT, a mathematically adaptive numeric type, featuring a more flexible encoding paradigm with a wider range of data distribution and more efficient decodingcomputation fusion mechanism to address these challenges. Based on MANT, we develop a supporting framework to assign the appropriate data type for each group adaptively. Meanwhile, the dynamically generated Key-Value (KV) caches in LLMs introduce further complexity for real-time quantization. To tackle this, we propose an efficient real-time quantization mechanism. Besides, we implement a specific processing element (PE) to efficiently support MANT and incorporate a real-time quantization unit. By integrating these components into a systolic array, MANT unifies the group-wise weight and KV cache quantization and addresses the associated challenges. Our evaluation shows achieving, on average, 2.99x (up to 4.46x) speedup and 2.81x (up to 4.10x) energy reduction to the state-of-the-art LLM accelerator.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> User-facing applications running in modern datacenters exhibit irregular request patterns and are implemented using a multitude of services with tight latency requirements. These characteristics render ineffective existing energy conserving techniques when processors are idle due to the long transition time from a deep idle power state (C-state). While prior works propose management techniques to mitigate this inefficiency, we tackle it at its root with AgileWatts (AW): a new deep C-state architecture optimized for datacenter server processors targeting latency-sensitive applications. AW is based on three key ideas. First, AW eliminates the latency overhead of saving/restoring the core context (i.e., micro-architectural state) when powering-off/-on the core in a deep idle power state by i) implementing medium-grained power-gates, carefully distributed across the CPU core, and ii) retaining context in the power-ungated domain. Second, AW eliminates the flush latency overhead (several tens of microseconds) of the L1/L2 caches when entering a deep idle power state by keeping L1/L2 cache content power-ungated. A minimal control logic also remains power-ungated to serve cache coherence traffic (i.e., snoops) seamlessly. AW implements sleep-mode in caches to reduce caches leakage power consumption and lowers a core voltage to the minimum operational voltage level to minimize the leakage power of the power-ungated domain. Third, using a state-of-the-art power efficient all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) clock generator, AW keeps the PLL active and locked during the idle state, further cutting precious microseconds of wake-up latency at a negligible power cost. Our evaluation with an accurate simulator calibrated against an Intel Skylake server shows that AW reduces the energy consumption of Memcached by up to 71% (35% on average) with up to 1% performance degradation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In high-dimensional vector spaces, Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) is a key component in database and artificial intelligence infrastructures. Graph-based methods, particularly HNSW, have emerged as leading solutions among various ANNS approaches, offering an impressive trade-off between search efficiency and accuracy. Many modern vector databases utilize graph indexes as their core algorithms, benefiting from various optimizations to enhance search performance. However, the high indexing time associated with graph algorithms poses a significant challenge, especially given the increasing volume of data, query processing complexity, and dynamic index maintenance demand. This has rendered indexing time a critical performance metric for users. In this paper, we comprehensively analyze the underlying causes of the low graph indexing efficiency on modern CPUs, identifying that distance computation dominates indexing time, primarily due to high memory access latency and suboptimal arithmetic operation efficiency. We demonstrate that distance comparisons during index construction can be effectively performed using compact vector codes at an appropriate compression error. Drawing from insights gained through integrating existing compact coding methods in the graph indexing process, we propose a novel compact coding strategy, named Flash, designed explicitly for graph indexing and optimized for modern CPU architectures. By minimizing random memory accesses and maximizing the utilization of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions, Flash significantly enhances cache hit rates and arithmetic operations. Extensive experiments conducted on eight real-world datasets, ranging from ten million to one billion vectors, exhibit that Flash achieves a speedup of 10.4$\times$ to 22.9$\times$ in index construction efficiency, while maintaining or improving search performance.

Despite extensive developments, existing works still face a trade-off between maintaining similarity to the original image and generating content that aligns with the target. Here, we propose KV-Edit, a training-free approach that uses KV cache in DiTs to maintain background consistency, where background tokens are preserved rather than regenerated, eliminating the need for complex mechanisms or expensive training, ultimately generating new content that seamlessly integrates with the background within user-provided regions. We further explore the memory consumption of the KV cache during editing and optimize the space complexity to $O(1)$ using an inversion-free method. Our approach is compatible with any DiT-based generative model without additional training. Experiments demonstrate that KV-Edit significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of both background and image quality, even surpassing training-based methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> KV cache quantization can improve Large Language Models (LLMs) inference throughput and latency in long contexts and large batch-size scenarios while preserving LLMs effectiveness. However, current methods have three unsolved issues: overlooking layer-wise sensitivity to KV cache quantization, high overhead of online fine-grained decision-making, and low flexibility to different LLMs and constraints. Therefore, we thoroughly analyze the inherent correlation of layer-wise transformer attention patterns to KV cache quantization errors and study why key cache is more important than value cache for quantization error reduction. We further propose a simple yet effective framework KVTuner to adaptively search for the optimal hardware-friendly layer-wise KV quantization precision pairs for coarse-grained KV cache with multi-objective optimization and directly utilize the offline searched configurations during online inference. To reduce the computational cost of offline calibration, we utilize the intra-layer KV precision pair pruning and inter-layer clustering to reduce the search space. Experimental results show that we can achieve nearly lossless 3.25-bit mixed precision KV cache quantization for LLMs like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and 4.0-bit for sensitive models like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning tasks. The maximum inference throughput can be improved by 38.3% compared with KV8 quantization over various context lengths.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Log-Structured Merge-tree-based Key-Value Store (LSM-KVS) is a foundational storage engine serving diverse modern workloads, systems, and applications. To suit varying use cases, LSM-KVS allows a vast configuration space that controls core parameters like compaction, flush, and cache sizes, each consuming a shared pool of CPU, Memory, and Storage resources. Navigating the LSM-KVS configuration space necessitates knowledge of the impact of each configuration on the expected workload and underlying hardware. Beyond expensive and time-intensive human-expert-based tuning, existing LSM-KVS tuning solutions focus on tuning with specific workload expectations while limited to a narrow subset of parameters.   This paper introduces ELMo-Tune-V2, a framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) at its foundation to demonstrate the potential of applying modern LLMs in data system optimization problems. ELMo-Tune-V2 leverages the contextual reasoning, cross-domain, and generative capabilities of LLMs to perform 1) self-navigated characterization and modeling of LSM-KVS workloads, 2) automatic tuning across a broad parameter space using cross-domain knowledge, and 3) real-time dynamic configuration adjustments for LSM-KVS. ELMo-Tune-V2 integrates three innovations: LLM-based workload synthesis for adaptive benchmark generation, feedback-driven iterative fine-tuning for configuration refinement, and real-time tuning to handle evolving workloads. Through detailed evaluation using RocksDB under several real-world applications across diverse scenarios, ELMo-Tune-V2 achieves performance improvements up to ~14X our YCSB benchmarks compared against default RocksDB configurations, and our end-to-end tests with upper-level applications, NebulaGraph and Kvrocks, demonstrate performance gains of 34% and 26%, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Long-context Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that incorporate long text-image and text-video modalities, demand substantial resources as their multimodal Key-Value (KV) caches grow with increasing input lengths, challenging inference efficiency. Existing methods for KV cache compression, in both text-only and multimodal LLMs, have neglected attention density variations across layers, thus often adopting uniform or progressive reduction strategies for layer-wise cache allocation. In this work, we propose MEDA, a dynamic layer-wise KV cache allocation method for efficient multimodal long-context inference. As its core, MEDA utilizes cross-modal attention entropy to determine the KV cache size at each MLLMs layer. Given the dynamically allocated KV cache size at each layer, MEDA also employs a KV pair selection scheme to identify which KV pairs to select and a KV pair merging strategy that merges the selected and non-selected ones to preserve information from the entire context. MEDA achieves up to 72% KV cache memory reduction and 2.82 times faster decoding speed, while maintaining or enhancing performance on various multimodal tasks in long-context settings, including multi-images and long-video scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Speculative decoding has become a promising technique to mitigate the high inference latency of autoregressive decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite its promise, the effective application of speculative decoding in LLMs still confronts three key challenges: the increasing memory demands of the draft model, the distribution shift between the short-training corpora and long-context inference, and inefficiencies in attention implementation. In this work, we enhance the performance of speculative decoding in long-context settings by addressing these challenges. First, we propose a memory-efficient draft model with a constant-sized Key-Value (KV) cache. Second, we introduce novel position indices for short-training data, enabling seamless adaptation from short-context training to long-context inference. Finally, we present an innovative attention aggregation method that combines fast implementations for prefix computation with standard attention for tree mask handling, effectively resolving the latency and memory inefficiencies of tree decoding. Our approach achieves strong results on various long-context tasks, including repository-level code completion, long-context summarization, and o1-like long reasoning tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in latency reduction.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces GTX, a standalone main-memory write-optimized graph data system that specializes in structural and graph property updates while enabling concurrent reads and graph analytics through ACID transactions. Recent graph systems target concurrent read and write support while guaranteeing transaction semantics. However, their performance suffers from updates with real-world temporal locality over the same vertices and edges due to vertex-centric lock contentions. GTX has an adaptive delta-chain locking protocol on top of a carefully designed latch-free graph storage. It eliminates vertex-level locking contention, and adapts to real-life workloads while maintaining sequential access to the graph's adjacency lists storage. GTX's transactions further support cache-friendly block level concurrency control, and cooperative group commit and garbage collection. This combination of features ensures high update throughput and provides low-latency graph analytics. Based on experimental evaluation, in addition to not sacrificing the performance of read-heavy analytical workloads, and having competitive performance similar to state-of-the-art systems, GTX has high read-write transaction throughput. For write-heavy transactional workloads, GTX achieves up to 11x better transaction throughput than the best-performing state-of-the-art system.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Embedded heterogeneous systems-on-chip (SoCs) rely on domain-specific hardware accelerators to improve performance and energy efficiency. In particular, programmable multi-core accelerators feature a cluster of processing elements and tightly coupled scratchpad memories to balance performance, energy efficiency, and flexibility. In embedded systems running a general-purpose OS, accelerators access data via dedicated, physically addressed memory regions. This negatively impacts memory utilization and performance by requiring a copy from the virtual host address to the physical accelerator address space. Input-Output Memory Management Units (IOMMUs) overcome this limitation by allowing devices and hosts to use a shared virtual paged address space. However, resolving IO virtual addresses can be particularly costly on high-latency memory systems as it requires up to three sequential memory accesses on IOTLB miss. In this work, we present a quantitative evaluation of shared virtual addressing in RISC-V heterogeneous embedded systems. We integrate an IOMMU in an open-source heterogeneous RISC-V SoC consisting of a 64-bit host with a 32-bit accelerator cluster. We evaluated the system performance by emulating the design on FPGA and implementing compute kernels from the RajaPERF benchmark suite using heterogeneous OpenMP programming. We measure the transfers and computation time on the host and accelerators for systems with different DRAM access latencies. We first show that IO virtual address translation can account for 4.2% up to 17.6% of the accelerator's runtime for gemm (General Matrix Multiplication) at low and high memory bandwidth. Then, we show that in systems containing a last-level cache, this IO address translation cost falls to 0.4% and 0.7% under the same conditions, making shared virtual addressing and zero-copy offloading suitable for such RISC-V heterogeneous SoCs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless separator tokens (i.e., punctuations) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Motivated by reducing the computational and storage costs of LLMs, model compression and KV cache compression have attracted much attention from researchers. However, current methods predominantly emphasize maintaining the performance of compressed LLMs, as measured by perplexity or simple accuracy on tasks of common sense knowledge QA and basic arithmetic reasoning. In this blog, we present a brief review of recent advancements in LLMs related to retrieval-augmented generation, multi-step reasoning, external tools, and computational expressivity, all of which substantially enhance LLM performance. Then, we propose a lottery LLM hypothesis suggesting that for a given LLM and task, there exists a smaller lottery LLM capable of producing the same performance as the original LLM with the assistance of multi-step reasoning and external tools. Based on the review of current progress in LLMs, we discuss and summarize the essential capabilities that the lottery LLM and KV cache compression must possess, which are currently overlooked in existing methods.

However, as the conversation rounds continue, it is required to store a large amount of KV cache in GPU memory, which significantly affects the efficiency and even availability of the model serving systems. This paper analyzes dialogue data from real users and discovers that the LLM inference manifests a watershed layer, after which the distribution of round-level attention shows notable similarity. We propose Round Attention, a novel round-level attention mechanism that only recalls and computes the KV cache of the most relevant rounds. The experiments show that our method saves 55\% memory usage without compromising model performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Code generation is a latency-sensitive task that demands high timeliness, but the autoregressive decoding mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) leads to poor inference efficiency. Existing LLM inference acceleration methods mainly focus on standalone functions using only built-in components. Moreover, they treat code like natural language sequences, ignoring its unique syntax and semantic characteristics. As a result, the effectiveness of these approaches in code generation tasks remains limited and fails to align with real-world programming scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we propose CodeSwift, a simple yet highly efficient inference acceleration approach specifically designed for code generation, without comprising the quality of the output. CodeSwift constructs a multi-source datastore, providing access to both general and project-specific knowledge, facilitating the retrieval of high-quality draft sequences. Moreover, CodeSwift reduces retrieval cost by controlling retrieval timing, and enhances efficiency through parallel retrieval and a context- and LLM preference-aware cache. Experimental results show that CodeSwift can reach up to 2.53x and 2.54x speedup compared to autoregressive decoding in repository-level and standalone code generation tasks, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art inference acceleration approaches by up to 88%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To alleviate memory burden during inference of large language models (LLMs), numerous studies have focused on compressing the KV cache by exploring aspects such as attention sparsity. However, these techniques often require a pre-defined cache budget; as the optimal budget varies with different input lengths and task types, it limits their practical deployment accepting open-domain instructions. To address this limitation, we propose a new KV cache compression objective: to always ensure the full-cache performance regardless of specific inputs, while maximizing KV cache pruning as much as possible. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel KV cache compression method dubbed DBudgetKV, which features an attention-based metric to signal when the remaining KV cache is unlikely to match the full-cache performance, then halting the pruning process. Empirical evaluation spanning diverse context lengths, task types, and model sizes suggests that our method achieves lossless KV pruning effectively and robustly, exceeding 25% compression ratio on average. Furthermore, our method is easy to integrate within LLM inference, not only optimizing memory space, but also showing reduced inference time compared to existing methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In Large Language Model (LLM) inference, Key-Value (KV) caches (KV-caches) are essential for reducing time complexity. However, they result in a linear increase in GPU memory as the context length grows. While recent work explores KV-cache eviction and compression policies to reduce memory usage, they often consider uniform KV-caches across all attention heads, leading to suboptimal performance. We introduce BaKlaVa, a method to allocate optimal memory for individual KV-caches across the model by estimating the importance of each KV-cache. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that not all KV-caches are equally critical for LLM performance. Using a one-time profiling approach, BaKlaVa assigns optimal memory budgets to each KV-cache. We evaluated our method on LLaMA-3-8B, and Qwen2.5-7B models, achieving up to a 70\% compression ratio while keeping baseline performance and delivering up to an order-of-magnitude accuracy improvement at higher compression levels.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained traction as a powerful approach for enhancing language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, RAG introduces challenges such as retrieval latency, potential errors in document selection, and increased system complexity. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) featuring significantly extended context windows, this paper proposes an alternative paradigm, cache-augmented generation (CAG) that bypasses real-time retrieval. Our method involves preloading all relevant resources, especially when the documents or knowledge for retrieval are of a limited and manageable size, into the LLM's extended context and caching its runtime parameters. During inference, the model utilizes these preloaded parameters to answer queries without additional retrieval steps. Comparative analyses reveal that CAG eliminates retrieval latency and minimizes retrieval errors while maintaining context relevance. Performance evaluations across multiple benchmarks highlight scenarios where long-context LLMs either outperform or complement traditional RAG pipelines. These findings suggest that, for certain applications, particularly those with a constrained knowledge base, CAG provide a streamlined and efficient alternative to RAG, achieving comparable or superior results with reduced complexity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Coded caching is a promising technique to effectively reduce peak traffic by using local caches and the multicast gains generated by these local caches. We prefer to design a coded caching scheme with the subpacketization $F$ and transmission load $R$ as small as possible since these are the key metrics for evaluating the implementation complexity and transmission efficiency of the scheme, respectively. However, most of the existing coded caching schemes have large subpacketizations which grow exponentially with the number of users $K$, and there are a few schemes with linear subpacketizations which have large transmission loads. In this paper, we focus on studying the linear subpacketization, i.e., $K=F$, coded caching scheme with low transmission load. Specifically, we first introduce a new combinatorial structure called non-half-sum disjoint packing (NHSDP) which can be used to generate a coded caching scheme with $K=F$. Then a class of new schemes is obtained by constructing NHSDP. Theoretical and numerical comparisons show that (i) compared to the existing schemes with linear subpacketization (to the number of users), the proposed scheme achieves a lower load; (ii) compared to some existing schemes with polynomial subpacketization, the proposed scheme can also achieve a lower load in some cases; (iii) compared to some existing schemes with exponential subpacketization, the proposed scheme has loads close to those of these schemes in some cases. Moreover, the new concept of NHSDP is closely related to the classical combinatorial structures such as cyclic difference packing (CDP), non-three-term arithmetic progressions (NTAP), and perfect hash family (PHF). These connections indicate that NHSDP is an important combinatorial structure in the field of combinatorial design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Disaggregating memory from compute offers the opportunity to better utilize stranded memory in cloud data centers. It is important to cache data in the compute nodes and maintain cache coherence across multiple compute nodes. However, the limited computing power on disaggregated memory servers makes traditional cache coherence protocols suboptimal, particularly in the case of stranded memory. This paper introduces SELCC; a Shared-Exclusive Latch Cache Coherence protocol that maintains cache coherence without imposing any computational burden on the remote memory side. It aligns the state machine of the shared-exclusive latch protocol with the MSI protocol , thereby ensuring both atomicity of data access and cache coherence with sequential consistency. SELCC embeds cache-ownership metadata directly into the RDMA latch word, enabling efficient cache ownership management via RDMA atomic operations. SELCC can serve as an abstraction layer over disaggregated memory with APIs that resemble main-memory accesses. A concurrent B-tree and three transaction concurrency control algorithms are realized using SELCC's abstraction layer. Experimental results show that SELCC significantly outperforms Remote-Procedure-Call-based protocols for cache coherence under limited remote computing power. Applications on SELCC achieve comparable or superior performance over disaggregated memory compared to competitors.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We show that Large Language Model from Power Law Decoder Representations (PLDR-LLM) is a foundational model whose deductive outputs are invariant tensors up to a small perturbation. PLDR-LLM learns a singularity condition for the deductive outputs that enable the once-inferred energy-curvature tensor $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ to replace the deep neural network of power law graph attention (PLGA) generating the deductive outputs at inference. We demonstrate that a cache for $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ (G-cache) and KV-cache can be implemented in a straightforward manner to improve the inference time. The invariance and generalizable nature of deductive outputs is at a very high fidelity where deductive outputs have same RMSE and determinant values up to 15 decimal places after caching, and zero-shot benchmark scores remain unchanged. Ablation studies show that learned deductive outputs have distinct loss and accuracy characteristics from models pretrained with transferred, randomly initialized or identity tensors as a constant tensor operator and an LLM with scaled-dot product attention (SDPA) is a special case of PLDR-LLM where $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ is predefined as identity. The observed invariance characteristic introduces a novel asymmetry between training and inference phases with caching. We outline observed common characteristics of the deductive outputs for the learned singularity condition. We provide an implementation of a training and inference framework for PLDR-LLM with KV-cache and G-cache.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Tree of Thoughts (ToT) enhances Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning by structuring problem-solving as a spanning tree. However, recent methods focus on search accuracy while overlooking computational efficiency. The challenges of accelerating the ToT lie in the frequent switching of reasoning focus, and the redundant exploration of suboptimal solutions. To alleviate this dilemma, we propose Dynamic Parallel Tree Search (DPTS), a novel parallelism framework that aims to dynamically optimize the reasoning path in inference. It includes the Parallelism Streamline in the generation phase to build up a flexible and adaptive parallelism with arbitrary paths by fine-grained cache management and alignment. Meanwhile, the Search and Transition Mechanism filters potential candidates to dynamically maintain the reasoning focus on more possible solutions and have less redundancy. Experiments on Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3 with Math500 and GSM8K datasets show that DPTS significantly improves efficiency by 2-4x on average while maintaining or even surpassing existing reasoning algorithms in accuracy, making ToT-based reasoning more scalable and computationally efficient.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Lattice structures have been widely used in applications due to their superior mechanical properties. To fabricate such structures, a geometric processing step called triangulation is often employed to transform them into the STL format before sending them to 3D printers. Because lattice structures tend to have high geometric complexity, this step usually generates a large amount of triangles, a memory and compute-intensive task. This problem manifests itself clearly through large-scale lattice structures that have millions or billions of struts. To address this problem, this paper proposes to transform a lattice structure into an intermediate model called meta-mesh before undergoing real triangulation. Compared to triangular meshes, meta-meshes are very lightweight and much less compute-demanding. The meta-mesh can also work as a base mesh reusable for conveniently and efficiently triangulating lattice structures with arbitrary resolutions. A CPU+GPU asynchronous meta-meshing pipeline has been developed to efficiently generate meta-meshes from lattice structures. It shifts from the thread-centric GPU algorithm design paradigm commonly used in CAD to the recent warp-centric design paradigm to achieve high performance. This is achieved by a new data compression method, a GPU cache-aware data structure, and a workload-balanced scheduling method that can significantly reduce memory divergence and branch divergence. Experimenting with various billion-scale lattice structures, the proposed method is seen to be two orders of magnitude faster than previously achievable.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We describe KVLink, an approach for efficient key-value (KV) cache reuse in large language models (LLMs). In many LLM applications, different inputs can share overlapping context, such as the same retrieved document appearing in multiple queries. However, the LLMs still need to encode the entire context for each query, leading to redundant computation. In this paper, we propose a new strategy to eliminate such inefficiency, where the KV cache of each document is precomputed independently. During inference, the KV caches of retrieved documents are concatenated, allowing the model to reuse cached representations instead of recomputing them. To mitigate the performance degradation of LLMs when using KV caches computed independently for each document, KVLink introduces three key components: adjusting positional embeddings of the KV cache at inference to match the global position after concatenation, using trainable special tokens to restore self-attention across independently encoded documents, and applying mixed-data fine-tuning to enhance performance while preserving the model's original capabilities. Experiments across 7 datasets demonstrate that KVLink improves question answering accuracy by an average of 4% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, by leveraging precomputed KV caches, our approach reduces time-to-first-token by up to 90% compared to standard LLM inference, making it a scalable and efficient solution for context reuse.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A key limitation of autoregressive Transformers is the large memory needed at inference-time to cache all previous key-value (KV) embeddings. Prior works address this by compressing the KV cache, but often assume specific structural properties of the embeddings. This raises the following natural question: Can truly sublinear space utilization be achieved without such assumptions? In this work, we answer this question in the negative. Any algorithm for attention-based token generation must use $\Theta(nd)$ space, where $n$ is the number of tokens generated so far and $d = \Omega(\log n)$ is the dimension of the KV embeddings. Our proof involves a reduction from a classic communication complexity problem and uses a randomized construction that leverages properties of projections in the spirit of the Johnson-Linderstrauss lemma. For the low-dimensional regime $d = o(\log n)$, we show that any algorithm requires $\Omega(d\cdot e^d)$ space and prove, using tight bounds on covering numbers, that SubGen, proposed by Zandieh, Han, Mirrokni and Karbasi, matches this bound. Further, we investigate how sparsity assumptions enable token generation in truly sublinear space, presenting impossibility results and proposing a new KV cache compression algorithm for sliding window attention when the value cache outside the window is unmasked. Finally, we analyze token generation's time complexity, using an indistinguishability argument to prove that no non-adaptive algorithm can compute attention online in sublinear time for all tokens.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text indexing is a fundamental and well-studied problem. Classic solutions either replace the original text with a compressed representation, e.g., the FM-index and its variants, or keep it uncompressed but attach some redundancy - an index - to accelerate matching. The former solutions thus retain excellent compressed space, but areslow in practice. The latter approaches, like the suffix array, instead sacrifice space for speed.   We show that efficient text indexing can be achieved using just a small extra space on top of the original text, provided that the query patterns are sufficiently long. More specifically, we develop a new indexing paradigm in which a sketch of a query pattern is first matched against a sketch of the text. Once candidate matches are retrieved, they are verified using the original text. This paradigm is thus universal in the sense that it allows us to use any solution to index the sketched text, like a suffix array, FM-index, or r-index.   We explore both the theory and the practice of this universal framework. With an extensive experimental analysis, we show that, surprisingly, universal indexes can be constructed much faster than their unsketched counterparts and take a fraction of the space, as a direct consequence of (i) having a lower bound on the length of patterns and (ii) working in sketch space. Furthermore, these data structures have the potential of retaining or even improving query time, because matching against the sketched text is faster and verifying candidates can be theoretically done in constant time per occurrence (or, in practice, by short and cache-friendly scans of the text). Finally, we discuss some important applications of this novel indexing paradigm to computational biology. We hypothesize that such indexes will be particularly effective when the queries are sufficiently long, and so demonstrate applications in long-read mapping.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success on various aspects of human life. However, one of the major challenges in deploying these models is the substantial memory consumption required to store key-value pairs (KV), which imposes significant resource demands. Recent research has focused on KV cache budget allocation, with several approaches proposing head-level budget distribution by evaluating the importance of individual attention heads. These methods, however, assess the importance of heads independently, overlooking their cooperative contributions within the model, which may result in a deviation from their true impact on model performance. In light of this limitation, we propose CoKV, a novel method that models the cooperation between heads in model inference as a cooperative game. By evaluating the contribution of each head within the cooperative game, CoKV can allocate the cache budget more effectively. Extensive experiments show that CoKV achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LongBench benchmark using LLama-3-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> For the efficient inference of Large Language Models (LLMs), the effective compression of key-value (KV) cache is essential. Three main types of KV cache compression techniques, namely sparsity, channel compression, and quantization, have been identified. This study presents SVDq, a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) - based mixed precision quantization method for K cache. Initially, K cache is transformed into latent channels using SVD basis representations. Since the values in latent channels decay rapidly and become negligible after only a few latent channels, our method then incorporates importance-aware quantization and compression for latent channels. This enables the effective allocation of higher precision to more significant channels. Theoretically, we prove that SVDq results in quantization errors (x0.1 or even lower) that are much lower than those of per-channel key quantization in the original space. Our findings based on RULER and LongBench benchmarks demonstrate that SVDq can achieve an equivalent key cache precision as low as 1.25-bit. When combined with key sparsity, it can reach a key compression ratio of up to 410x for attention computation, all while maintaining comparable model performance. Notably, our method is nearly lossless for LongBench datasets. This indicates that SVDq enables high-precision low-bit quantization, providing a more efficient solution for KV cache compression in LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) applications face performance challenges due to their high computational demands and need for low-latency responses. Traditional approaches like on-device storage or reactive data fetching from the cloud often result in limited AR experiences or unacceptable lag. Edge caching, which caches AR objects closer to the user, provides a promising solution. However, existing edge caching approaches do not consider AR-specific features such as AR object sizes, user interactions, and physical location. This paper investigates how to further optimize edge caching by employing AR-aware prefetching techniques. We present SAAP, a Spatial Awareness and Association-based Prefetching policy specifically designed for MAR Caches. SAAP intelligently prioritizes the caching of virtual objects based on their association with other similar objects and the user's proximity to them. It also considers the recency of associations and uses a lazy fetching strategy to efficiently manage edge resources and maximize Quality of Experience (QoE).   Through extensive evaluation using both synthetic and real-world workloads, we demonstrate that SAAP significantly improves cache hit rates compared to standard caching algorithms, achieving gains ranging from 3\% to 40\% while reducing the need for on-demand data retrieval from the cloud. Further, we present an adaptive tuning algorithm that automatically tunes SAAP parameters to achieve optimal performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SAAP to substantially enhance the user experience in MAR applications by ensuring the timely availability of virtual objects.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in large-scale online services, enabling sophisticated applications. However, the computational overhead of generating key-value (KV) caches in the prefill stage presents a major bottleneck, particularly for long-context inputs. Prefix caching mitigates this issue by storing KV caches for reuse, reducing redundant computation. Despite its advantages, prefix caching suffers from high latency due to the limited I/O bandwidth of storage devices, constraining inference efficiency. To address this challenge, we introduce Cake, a novel KV cache loading system that optimally utilizes both computational and I/O resources in parallel. Cake employs a bidirectional scheduling strategy that dynamically balances KV cache computation and loading, ensuring efficient resource utilization. Additionally, Cake incorporates an adaptive scheduling mechanism that seamlessly integrates with non-prefix caching requests, improving system throughput and adapting to fluctuating resource availabilty. Through extensive evaluations across various hardware configurations, datasets, and storage conditions, Cake achieves on average 2.6x reduction in Time to First Token (TTFT) compared to compute-only and I/O-only methods. Our findings highlight Cake as an effective and practical solution for optimizing long-context LLM inference, bridging the gap between computation and I/O efficiency in large-scale AI deployments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces an information-aware quantization framework that adaptively compresses the key-value (KV) cache in large language models (LLMs). Although prior work has underscored the distinct roles of key and value cache during inference, our systematic analysis -- examining singular value distributions, spectral norms, and Frobenius norms -- reveals, for the first time, that key matrices consistently exhibit higher norm values and are more sensitive to quantization than value matrices. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis shows that matrices with higher spectral norms amplify quantization errors more significantly. Motivated by these insights, we propose a mixed-precision quantization strategy, KV-AdaQuant, which allocates more bit-width for keys and fewer for values since key matrices have higher norm values. With the same total KV bit budget, this approach effectively mitigates error propagation across transformer layers while achieving significant memory savings. Our extensive experiments on multiple LLMs (1B--70B) demonstrate that our mixed-precision quantization scheme maintains high model accuracy even under aggressive compression. For instance, using 4-bit for Key and 2-bit for Value achieves an accuracy of 75.2%, whereas reversing the assignment (2-bit for Key and 4-bit for Value) yields only 54.7% accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in processing long sequences, yet efficiently serving these long-context models remains challenging due to the quadratic computational complexity of attention in the prefilling stage and the large memory footprint of the KV cache in the decoding stage. To address these issues, we introduce LServe, an efficient system that accelerates long-sequence LLM serving via hybrid sparse attention. This method unifies different hardware-friendly, structured sparsity patterns for both prefilling and decoding attention into a single framework, where computations on less important tokens are skipped block-wise. LServe demonstrates the compatibility of static and dynamic sparsity in long-context LLM attention. This design enables multiplicative speedups by combining these optimizations. Specifically, we convert half of the attention heads to nearly free streaming heads in both the prefilling and decoding stages. Additionally, we find that only a constant number of KV pages is required to preserve long-context capabilities, irrespective of context length. We then design a hierarchical KV page selection policy that dynamically prunes KV pages based on query-centric similarity. On average, LServe accelerates LLM prefilling by up to 2.9x and decoding by 1.3-2.1x over vLLM, maintaining long-context accuracy. Code is released at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/omniserve.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) is an innovative architecture proposed by DeepSeek, designed to ensure efficient and economical inference by significantly compressing the Key-Value (KV) cache into a latent vector. Compared to MLA, standard LLMs employing Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and its variants such as Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) exhibit significant cost disadvantages. Enabling well-trained LLMs (e.g., Llama) to rapidly adapt to MLA without pre-training from scratch is both meaningful and challenging. This paper proposes the first data-efficient fine-tuning method for transitioning from MHA to MLA (MHA2MLA), which includes two key components: for partial-RoPE, we remove RoPE from dimensions of queries and keys that contribute less to the attention scores, for low-rank approximation, we introduce joint SVD approximations based on the pre-trained parameters of keys and values. These carefully designed strategies enable MHA2MLA to recover performance using only a small fraction (0.3% to 0.6%) of the data, significantly reducing inference costs while seamlessly integrating with compression techniques such as KV cache quantization. For example, the KV cache size of Llama2-7B is reduced by 92.19%, with only a 0.5% drop in LongBench performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficient real-world deployments of large language models (LLMs) rely on Key-Value (KV) caching for processing and generating long outputs, reducing the need for repetitive computation. For large contexts, Key-Value caches can take up tens of gigabytes of device memory, as they store vector representations for each token and layer. Recent work has shown that the cached vectors can be compressed through quantization, pruning or merging, but these techniques often compromise quality towards higher compression rates. In this work, we aim to improve Key & Value compression by exploiting two observations: 1) the inherent dependencies between keys and values across different layers, and 2) high-compression mechanisms for internal network states. We propose AQUA-KV, an adaptive quantization for Key-Value caches that relies on compact adapters to exploit existing dependencies between Keys and Values, and aims to "optimally" compress the information that cannot be predicted. AQUA-KV significantly improves compression rates, while maintaining high accuracy on state-of-the-art LLM families. On Llama 3.2 LLMs, we achieve near-lossless inference at 2-2.5 bits per value with under $1\%$ relative error in perplexity and LongBench scores. AQUA-KV is one-shot, simple, and efficient: it can be calibrated on a single GPU within 1-6 hours, even for 70B models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Rendering large-scale 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model faces significant challenges in achieving real-time, high-fidelity performance on consumer-grade devices. Fully realizing the potential of 3DGS in applications such as virtual reality (VR) requires addressing critical system-level challenges to support real-time, immersive experiences. We propose GS-Cache, an end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates 3DGS's advanced representation with a highly optimized rendering system. GS-Cache introduces a cache-centric pipeline to eliminate redundant computations, an efficiency-aware scheduler for elastic multi-GPU rendering, and optimized CUDA kernels to overcome computational bottlenecks. This synergy between 3DGS and system design enables GS-Cache to achieve up to 5.35x performance improvement, 35% latency reduction, and 42% lower GPU memory usage, supporting 2K binocular rendering at over 120 FPS with high visual quality. By bridging the gap between 3DGS's representation power and the demands of VR systems, GS-Cache establishes a scalable and efficient framework for real-time neural rendering in immersive environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a range of multimodal tasks. However, their inference efficiency is constrained by the large number of visual tokens processed during decoding. To address this challenge, we propose Per-Layer Per-Head Vision Token Pruning (PLPHP), a two-level fine-grained pruning method including Layer-Level Retention Rate Allocation and Head-Level Vision Token Pruning. Motivated by the Vision Token Re-attention phenomenon across decoder layers, we dynamically adjust token retention rates layer by layer. Layers that exhibit stronger attention to visual information preserve more vision tokens, while layers with lower vision attention are aggressively pruned. Furthermore, PLPHP applies pruning at the attention head level, enabling different heads within the same layer to independently retain critical context. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PLPHP delivers an 18% faster decoding speed and reduces the Key-Value Cache (KV Cache) size by over 50%, all at the cost of 0.46% average performance drop, while also achieving notable performance improvements in multi-image tasks. These results highlight the effectiveness of fine-grained token pruning and contribute to advancing the efficiency and scalability of LVLMs. Our source code will be made publicly available.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models (LLMs) process increasing context windows, the memory usage of KV cache has become a critical bottleneck during inference. The mainstream KV compression methods, including KV pruning and KV quantization, primarily focus on either token or precision dimension separately. However, these works leaving the trade-off between these two orthogonal dimensions largely under-explored. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the token-precision trade-off in KV cache compression.Experiments demonstrate that storing more tokens in the KV cache with lower precision,a strategy we term quantized pruning, can significantly enhance the long-context performance of LLMs. In-depth analysis of the token-precision trade-off across key aspects demonstrates that, quantized pruning achieves substantial improvements in retrieval-related tasks and consistently performs well across varying input lengths. Furthermore, quantized pruning demonstrates notable stability and effectiveness across different KV pruning methods, quantization strategies, and model scales. These findings offer valuable insights into optimizing KV cache compression through balanced token-precision trade-off strategies. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhzihao/QPruningKV.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present Neural Attention Search (NAtS), a framework that automatically evaluates the importance of each token within a sequence and determines if the corresponding token can be dropped after several steps. This approach can efficiently reduce the KV cache sizes required by transformer-based models during inference and thus reduce inference costs. In this paper, we design a search space that contains three token types: (i) Global Tokens will be preserved and queried by all the following tokens. (ii) Local Tokens survive until the next global token appears. (iii) Sliding Window Tokens have an impact on the inference of a fixed size of the next following tokens. Similar to the One-Shot Neural Architecture Search approach, this token-type information can be learned jointly with the architecture weights via a learnable attention mask. Experiments on both training a new transformer from scratch and fine-tuning existing large language models show that NAtS can efficiently reduce the KV cache size required for the models while maintaining the models' performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We report results of magnetotransport measurements on KV$_3$Sb$_5$ thin flakes under pressure. Our zero-field electrical resistance reveals an additional anomaly emerging under pressure ($p$), marking a previously unidentified phase boundary $T^{\rm \ast}$($p$). Together with the established $T_{\rm CDW}(p)$ and $T_c(p)$, denoting the charge-density-wave transition and a superconducting transition, respectively, the temperature-pressure phase diagram of KV$_3$Sb$_5$ features a rich interplay among multiple phases. The Hall coefficient evolves reasonably smoothly when crossing the $T^{\rm \ast}$ phase boundary compared with the variation when crossing $T_{\rm CDW}$, indicating the preservation of the pristine electronic structure. The mobility spectrum analysis provides further insights into distinguishing different phases. Finally, our high-pressure quantum oscillation studies up to 31 T combined with density functional theory calculations further demonstrate that the new phase does not reconstruct the Fermi surface, confirming that the translational symmetry of the pristine metallic state is preserved.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficiently handling long contexts is crucial for large language models (LLMs). While rotary position embeddings (RoPEs) enhance length generalization, effective length extrapolation remains challenging and often requires costly fine-tuning. In contrast, recent training-free approaches suffer from the attention sink phenomenon, leading to severe performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce ParallelComp, a novel training-free method for long-context extrapolation that extends LLMs' context length from 4K to 128K while maintaining high throughput and preserving perplexity, and integrates seamlessly with Flash Attention. Our analysis offers new insights into attention biases in parallel attention mechanisms and provides practical solutions to tackle these challenges. To mitigate the attention sink issue, we propose an attention calibration strategy that reduces biases, ensuring more stable long-range attention. Additionally, we introduce a chunk eviction strategy to efficiently manage ultra-long contexts on a single A100 80GB GPU. To further enhance efficiency, we propose a parallel KV cache eviction technique, which improves chunk throughput by 1.76x, thereby achieving a 23.50x acceleration in the prefilling stage with negligible performance loss due to attention calibration. Furthermore, ParallelComp achieves 91.17% of GPT-4's performance on long-context tasks using an 8B model trained on 8K-length context, outperforming powerful closed-source models such as Claude-2 and Kimi-Chat.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose using reinforcement learning to address the challenges of discovering microarchitectural vulnerabilities, such as Spectre and Meltdown, which exploit subtle interactions in modern processors. Traditional methods like random fuzzing fail to efficiently explore the vast instruction space and often miss vulnerabilities that manifest under specific conditions. To overcome this, we introduce an intelligent, feedback-driven approach using RL. Our RL agents interact with the processor, learning from real-time feedback to prioritize instruction sequences more likely to reveal vulnerabilities, significantly improving the efficiency of the discovery process.   We also demonstrate that RL systems adapt effectively to various microarchitectures, providing a scalable solution across processor generations. By automating the exploration process, we reduce the need for human intervention, enabling continuous learning that uncovers hidden vulnerabilities. Additionally, our approach detects subtle signals, such as timing anomalies or unusual cache behavior, that may indicate microarchitectural weaknesses. This proposal advances hardware security testing by introducing a more efficient, adaptive, and systematic framework for protecting modern processors.   When unleashed on Intel Skylake-X and Raptor Lake microarchitectures, our RL agent was indeed able to generate instruction sequences that cause significant observable byte leakages through transient execution without generating any $\mu$code assists, faults or interrupts. The newly identified leaky sequences stem from a variety of Intel instructions, e.g. including SERIALIZE, VERR/VERW, CLMUL, MMX-x87 transitions, LSL+RDSCP and LAR. These initial results give credence to the proposed approach.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Post-training quantization (PTQ) techniques applied to weights, activations, and the KV cache greatly reduce memory usage, latency, and power consumption of Large Language Models (LLMs), but may lead to large quantization errors when outliers are present. Rotating activation or weight matrices helps remove outliers and benefits quantization. In this work, we identify a collection of applicable rotation parameterizations that lead to identical outputs in full-precision Transformer architectures while enhancing quantization accuracy. In addition, we find that some random rotations lead to much better quantization than others, with an up to 13 points difference in downstream zero-shot reasoning performance. As a result, we propose SpinQuant, a novel approach that incorporates learned rotation matrices for optimal quantized network accuracy. With 4-bit quantization of weight, activation, and KV-cache, SpinQuant narrows the accuracy gap on zero-shot reasoning tasks with full precision to merely 2.9 points on the LLaMA-2 7B model, surpassing LLM-QAT by 19.1 points and SmoothQuant by 25.0 points. Furthermore, SpinQuant also outperforms concurrent work QuaRot, which applies random rotations to remove outliers. In particular, for LLaMA-3 8B models that are hard to quantize, SpinQuant reduces the gap to full precision by up to 45.1% relative to QuaRot.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have yielded impressive successes on many language tasks. However, efficient processing of long contexts using LLMs remains a significant challenge. We introduce \textbf{EpMAN} -- a method for processing long contexts in an \textit{episodic memory} module while \textit{holistically attending to} semantically relevant context chunks. The output of \textit{episodic attention} is then used to reweigh the decoder's self-attention to the stored KV cache of the context during training and generation. When an LLM decoder is trained using \textbf{EpMAN}, its performance on multiple challenging single-hop long-context recall and question-answering benchmarks is found to be stronger and more robust across the range from 16k to 256k tokens than baseline decoders trained with self-attention, and popular retrieval-augmented generation frameworks.

However, simply adopting an existing 4-level page table in NDP systems causes significant address translation overhead because (1) NDP applications generate a lot of address translations, and (2) the limited L1 cache in NDP systems cannot cover the accesses to page table entries (PTEs). We extensively analyze the 4-level page table design in the NDP scenario and observe that (1) the memory access to page table entries is highly irregular, thus cannot benefit from the L1 cache, and (2) the last two levels of page tables are nearly fully occupied. Based on our observations, we propose NDPage, an efficient page table design tailored for NDP systems. The key mechanisms of NDPage are (1) an L1 cache bypass mechanism for PTEs that not only accelerates the memory accesses of PTEs but also prevents the pollution of PTEs in the cache system, and (2) a flattened page table design that merges the last two levels of page tables, allowing the page table to enjoy the flexibility of a 4KB page while reducing the number of PTE accesses. We evaluate NDPage using a variety of data-intensive workloads. Our evaluation shows that in a single-core NDP system, NDPage improves the end-to-end performance over the state-of-the-art address translation mechanism of 14.3\%; in 4-core and 8-core NDP systems, NDPage enhances the performance of 9.8\% and 30.5\%, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based Large Language Models rely critically on KV cache to efficiently handle extended contexts during the decode phase. Yet, the size of the KV cache grows proportionally with the input length, burdening both memory bandwidth and capacity as decoding progresses. To address this challenge, we present RocketKV, a training-free KV cache compression strategy designed specifically to reduce both memory bandwidth and capacity demand of KV cache during the decode phase. RocketKV contains two consecutive stages. In the first stage, it performs coarse-grain KV cache eviction on the input sequence tokens with SnapKV++, a method improved upon SnapKV by introducing adaptive pooling size and full compatibility with grouped-query attention. In the second stage, it adopts a hybrid attention method to conduct fine-grain top-k sparse attention, approximating the attention scores by leveraging both head and sequence dimensional reductions. Combining these two stages, RocketKV achieves significant KV cache fetching bandwidth and storage savings while maintaining comparable accuracy to full KV cache attention. We show that RocketKV provides end-to-end speedup by up to 3$\times$ as well as peak memory reduction by up to 31% in the decode phase on an NVIDIA H100 GPU compared to the full KV cache baseline, while achieving negligible accuracy loss on a variety of long-context tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While Transformer models have achieved remarkable success in various domains, the effectiveness of information propagation through deep networks remains a critical challenge. Standard hidden state residuals often fail to adequately preserve initial token-level information in deeper layers. This paper introduces ResFormer, a novel architecture that enhances information flow by incorporating value residual connections in addition to hidden state residuals. And a variant is the SVFormer, where all layers share the first layer's value embedding. Comprehensive empirical evidence demonstrates ResFormer achieves equivalent validation loss with 13.3\% fewer model parameters and 15.4\% less training data compared to Transformer, while maintaining similar memory usage and computational cost. Besides, SVFormer reduces KV cache size by nearly half with only a small performance penalty and can be integrated with other KV-efficient methods, yielding further reductions in KV cache, with performance influenced by sequence length and cumulative learning rate.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep Neural Networks are increasingly leveraging sparsity to reduce the scaling up of model parameter size. However, reducing wall-clock time through sparsity and pruning remains challenging due to irregular memory access patterns, leading to frequent cache misses. In this paper, we present NPU Vector Runahead (NVR), a prefetching mechanism tailored for NPUs to address cache miss problems in sparse DNN workloads. Rather than optimising memory patterns with high overhead and poor portability, NVR adapts runahead execution to the unique architecture of NPUs. NVR provides a general micro-architectural solution for sparse DNN workloads without requiring compiler or algorithmic support, operating as a decoupled, speculative, lightweight hardware sub-thread alongside the NPU, with minimal hardware overhead (under 5%). NVR achieves an average 90% reduction in cache misses compared to SOTA prefetching in general-purpose processors, delivering 4x average speedup on sparse workloads versus NPUs without prefetching. Moreover, we investigate the advantages of incorporating a small cache (16KB) into the NPU combined with NVR. Our evaluation shows that expanding this modest cache delivers 5x higher performance benefits than increasing the L2 cache size by the same amount.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Last few years have seen unprecedented advances in capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). These advancements promise to benefit a vast array of application domains. However, due to their immense size, performing inference with LLMs is both costly and slow. Consequently, a plethora of recent work has proposed strategies to enhance inference efficiency, e.g., quantization, pruning, and caching. These acceleration strategies reduce the inference cost and latency, often by several factors, while maintaining much of the predictive performance measured via common benchmarks. In this work, we explore another critical aspect of LLM performance: demographic bias in model generations due to inference acceleration optimizations. Using a wide range of metrics, we probe bias in model outputs from a number of angles. Analysis of outputs before and after inference acceleration shows significant change in bias. Worryingly, these bias effects are complex and unpredictable. A combination of an acceleration strategy and bias type may show little bias change in one model but may lead to a large effect in another. Our results highlight a need for in-depth and case-by-case evaluation of model bias after it has been modified to accelerate inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion transformers have shown significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis at the expense of huge computation costs. To address this problem, feature caching methods have been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by caching the features in previous timesteps and reusing them in the following timesteps. However, previous caching methods ignore that different tokens exhibit different sensitivities to feature caching, and feature caching on some tokens may lead to 10$\times$ more destruction to the overall generation quality compared with other tokens. In this paper, we introduce token-wise feature caching, allowing us to adaptively select the most suitable tokens for caching, and further enable us to apply different caching ratios to neural layers in different types and depths. Extensive experiments on PixArt-$\alpha$, OpenSora, and DiT demonstrate our effectiveness in both image and video generation with no requirements for training. For instance, 2.36$\times$ and 1.93$\times$ acceleration are achieved on OpenSora and PixArt-$\alpha$ with almost no drop in generation quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Test-time compute scaling has emerged as a new axis along which to improve model accuracy, where additional computation is used at inference time to allow the model to think longer for more challenging problems. One promising approach for test-time compute scaling is search against a process reward model, where a model generates multiple potential candidates at each step of the search, and these partial trajectories are then scored by a separate reward model in order to guide the search process. The diversity of trajectories in the tree search process affects the accuracy of the search, since increasing diversity promotes more exploration. However, this diversity comes at a cost, as divergent trajectories have less KV sharing, which means they consume more memory and slow down the search process. Previous search methods either do not perform sufficient exploration, or else explore diverse trajectories but have high latency. We address this challenge by proposing Efficient Tree Search (ETS), which promotes KV sharing by pruning redundant trajectories while maintaining necessary diverse trajectories. ETS incorporates a linear programming cost model to promote KV cache sharing by penalizing the number of nodes retained, while incorporating a semantic coverage term into the cost model to ensure that we retain trajectories which are semantically different. We demonstrate how ETS can achieve 1.8$\times$ reduction in average KV cache size during the search process, leading to 1.4$\times$ increased throughput relative to prior state-of-the-art methods, with minimal accuracy degradation and without requiring any custom kernel implementation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have showcased exceptional performance in long-context tasks, while facing significant inference efficiency challenges with limited GPU memory. Existing solutions first proposed the sliding-window approach to accumulate a set of historical \textbf{key-value} (KV) pairs for reuse, then further improvements selectively retain its subsets at each step. However, due to the sparse attention distribution across a long context, it is hard to identify and recall relevant KV pairs, as the attention is distracted by massive candidate pairs. Additionally, we found it promising to select representative tokens as probe-Query in each sliding window to effectively represent the entire context, which is an approach overlooked by existing methods. Thus, we propose \textbf{ActQKV}, a training-free, \textbf{Act}ivation-aware approach that dynamically determines probe-\textbf{Q}uery and leverages it to retrieve the relevant \textbf{KV} pairs for inference. Specifically, ActQKV monitors a token-level indicator, Activation Bias, within each context window, enabling the proper construction of probe-Query for retrieval at pre-filling stage. To accurately recall the relevant KV pairs and minimize the irrelevant ones, we design a dynamic KV cut-off mechanism guided by information density across layers at the decoding stage. Experiments on the Long-Bench and $\infty$ Benchmarks demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance with competitive inference quality and resource efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> KV cache techniques in Transformer models aim to reduce redundant computations at the expense of substantially increased memory usage, making KV cache compression an important and popular research topic. Recently, state-of-the-art KV cache compression methods implement imbalanced, per-head allocation algorithms that dynamically adjust the KV cache budget for each attention head, achieving excellent performance in single-GPU scenarios. However, we observe that such imbalanced compression leads to significant load imbalance when deploying multi-GPU inference, as some GPUs become overburdened while others remain underutilized. In this paper, we propose FairKV, a method designed to ensure fair memory usage among attention heads in systems employing imbalanced KV cache compression. The core technique of FairKV is Fair-Copying, which replicates a small subset of memory-intensive attention heads across GPUs using data parallelism to mitigate load imbalance. Our experiments on popular models, including LLaMA 70b and Mistral 24b model, demonstrate that FairKV increases throughput by 1.66x compared to standard tensor parallelism inference. Our code will be released as open source upon acceptance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance but face deployment challenges due to their quadratic computational complexity, growing Key-Value cache requirements, and reliance on separate vision encoders. We propose mmMamba, a framework for developing linear-complexity native multimodal state space models through progressive distillation from existing MLLMs using moderate academic computational resources. Our approach enables the direct conversion of trained decoder-only MLLMs to linear-complexity architectures without requiring pre-trained RNN-based LLM or vision encoders. We propose an seeding strategy to carve Mamba from trained Transformer and a three-stage distillation recipe, which can effectively transfer the knowledge from Transformer to Mamba while preserving multimodal capabilities. Our method also supports flexible hybrid architectures that combine Transformer and Mamba layers for customizable efficiency-performance trade-offs. Distilled from the Transformer-based decoder-only HoVLE, mmMamba-linear achieves competitive performance against existing linear and quadratic-complexity VLMs, while mmMamba-hybrid further improves performance significantly, approaching HoVLE's capabilities. At 103K tokens, mmMamba-linear demonstrates 20.6$\times$ speedup and 75.8% GPU memory reduction compared to HoVLE, while mmMamba-hybrid achieves 13.5$\times$ speedup and 60.2% memory savings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A range of recent works addresses the problem of compression of sequence of tokens into a shorter sequence of real-valued vectors to be used as inputs instead of token embeddings or key-value cache. These approaches allow to reduce the amount of compute in existing language models. Despite relying on powerful models as encoders, the maximum attainable lossless compression ratio is typically not higher than x10. This fact is highly intriguing because, in theory, the maximum information capacity of large real-valued vectors is far beyond the presented rates even for 16-bit precision and a modest vector size. In this work, we explore the limits of compression by replacing the encoder with a per-sample optimization procedure. We show that vectors with compression ratios up to x1500 exist, which highlights two orders of magnitude gap between existing and practically attainable solutions. Furthermore, we empirically show that the compression limits are determined not by the length of the input but by the amount of uncertainty to be reduced, namely, the cross-entropy loss on this sequence without any conditioning. The obtained limits highlight the substantial gap between the theoretical capacity of input embeddings and their practical utilization, suggesting significant room for optimization in model design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are playing an increasingly pivotal role in modern communication networks,offering flexibility and enhanced coverage for a variety of applica-tions. However, UAV networks pose significant challenges due to their dynamic and distributed nature, particularly when dealing with tasks such as power allocation, channel assignment, caching,and task offloading. Traditional optimization techniques often struggle to handle the complexity and unpredictability of these environments, leading to suboptimal performance. This survey provides a comprehensive examination of how deep reinforcement learning (DRL) can be applied to solve these mathematical optimization problems in UAV communications and networking.Rather than simply introducing DRL methods, the focus is on demonstrating how these methods can be utilized to solve complex mathematical models of the underlying problems. We begin by reviewing the fundamental concepts of DRL, including value-based, policy-based, and actor-critic approaches. Then,we illustrate how DRL algorithms are applied to specific UAV network tasks by discussing from problem formulations to DRL implementation. By framing UAV communication challenges as optimization problems, this survey emphasizes the practical value of DRL in dynamic and uncertain environments. We also explore the strengths of DRL in handling large-scale network scenarios and the ability to continuously adapt to changes in the environment. In addition, future research directions are outlined, highlighting the potential for DRL to further enhance UAV communications and expand its applicability to more complex,multi-agent settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Long context large language models (LLMs) pose significant challenges for efficient serving due to the large memory footprint and high access overhead of KV cache. Retrieval-based KV cache reduction methods can mitigate these challenges, typically by offloading the complete KV cache to CPU and retrieving necessary tokens on demand during inference. However, these methods still suffer from unsatisfactory accuracy degradation and extra retrieval overhead. To address these limitations, this paper proposes A$^2$ATS, a novel retrieval-based KV cache reduction method. A$^2$ATS aims to obtain an accurate approximation of attention scores by applying the vector quantization technique to key states, thereby enabling efficient and precise retrieval of the top-K tokens. First, we propose Windowed Rotary Position Embedding, which decouples the positional dependency from query and key states after position embedding. Then, we propose query-aware vector quantization that optimizes the objective of attention score approximation directly. Finally, we design the heterogeneous inference architecture for KV cache offloading, enabling long context serving with larger batch sizes. Experimental results demonstrate that A$^2$ATS can achieve a lower performance degradation with similar or lower overhead compared to existing methods, thereby increasing long context serving throughput by up to $2.7 \times$.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Access to sensing data (SD) is crucial for vehicular networks to ensure safe and efficient transportation services. Given the vast volume of data involved, proactive caching required SD is a pivotal strategy for alleviating network congestion and improving data accessibility. Despite merits, existing studies predominantly address SD caching within a single slot. Therefore, these approaches lack scalability for scenarios involving multi-slots and are not well-suited for network operators who manage resources within a long-term cost budget. Moreover, the oversight of service capacity at caching nodes may result in substantial queuing delays for SD reception. To tackle these limitations, we jointly consider the problem of anchoring SD caching and allocating from an operator's perspective. A value model incorporating both temporal and spacial characteristics is given to estimate the significance of various caching decisions. Subsequently, a stochastic programming model is proposed to optimize the long-term system performance, which is converted into a series of online optimization problem by leveraging the Lyapunov method and linearized via introducing auxiliary variables. To expedite the solution, we provide a binary quantum particle swarm optimization based algorithm with quadratic time complexity. Numerical investigations demonstrate the superiority of proposed algorithms compared with other schemes in terms of energy consumption, response latency, and cache-hit ratio.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive performance in long context generation. Extending the context length has disproportionately shifted the memory footprint of LLMs during inference to the key-value cache (KV cache). In this paper, we propose HEADINFER, which offloads the KV cache to CPU RAM while avoiding the need to fully store the KV cache for any transformer layer on the GPU. HEADINFER employs a fine-grained, head-wise offloading strategy, maintaining only selective attention heads KV cache on the GPU while computing attention output dynamically. Through roofline analysis, we demonstrate that HEADINFER maintains computational efficiency while significantly reducing memory footprint. We evaluate HEADINFER on the Llama-3-8B model with a 1-million-token sequence, reducing the GPU memory footprint of the KV cache from 128 GB to 1 GB and the total GPU memory usage from 207 GB to 17 GB, achieving a 92% reduction compared to BF16 baseline inference. Notably, HEADINFER enables 4-million-token inference with an 8B model on a single consumer GPU with 24GB memory (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090) without approximation methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks, and their application in edge scenarios has attracted significant attention. However, sparse-activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, which are well suited for edge scenarios, have received relatively little attention due to their high memory demands. Offload-based methods have been proposed to address this challenge, but they face difficulties with expert prediction. Inaccurate expert predictions can result in prolonged inference delays. To promote the application of MoE models in edge scenarios, we propose Fate, an offloading system designed for MoE models to enable efficient inference in resource-constrained environments. The key insight behind Fate is that gate inputs from adjacent layers can be effectively used for expert prefetching, achieving high prediction accuracy without additional GPU overhead. Furthermore, Fate employs a shallow-favoring expert caching strategy that increases the expert hit rate to 99\%. Additionally, Fate integrates tailored quantization strategies for cache optimization and IO efficiency. Experimental results show that, compared to Load on Demand and Expert Activation Path-based method, Fate achieves up to 4.5x and 1.9x speedups in prefill speed and up to 4.1x and 2.2x speedups in decoding speed, respectively, while maintaining inference quality. Moreover, Fate's performance improvements are scalable across different memory budgets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficient KV cache management in LLMs is crucial for long-context tasks like RAG and summarization. Existing KV cache compression methods enforce a fixed pattern, neglecting task-specific characteristics and reducing the retention of essential information. However, we observe distinct activation patterns across layers in various tasks, highlighting the need for adaptive strategies tailored to each task's unique demands. Based on this insight, we propose DynamicKV, a method that dynamically optimizes token retention by adjusting the number of tokens retained at each layer to adapt to the specific task. DynamicKV establishes global and per-layer maximum KV cache budgets, temporarily retaining the maximum budget for the current layer, and periodically updating the KV cache sizes of all preceding layers during inference. Our method retains only 1.7% of the KV cache size while achieving ~85% of the Full KV cache performance on LongBench. Notably, even under extreme compression (0.9%), DynamicKV surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 11% in the Needle-in-a-Haystack test using Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2. The code will be released.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Long-context models are essential for many applications but face inefficiencies in loading large KV caches during decoding. Prior methods enforce fixed token budgets for sparse attention, assuming a set number of tokens can approximate full attention. However, these methods overlook variations in the importance of attention across heads, layers, and contexts. To address these limitations, we propose Tactic, a sparsity-adaptive and calibration-free sparse attention mechanism that dynamically selects tokens based on their cumulative attention scores rather than a fixed token budget. By setting a target fraction of total attention scores, Tactic ensures that token selection naturally adapts to variations in attention sparsity. To efficiently approximate this selection, Tactic leverages clustering-based sorting and distribution fitting, allowing it to accurately estimate token importance with minimal computational overhead. We show that Tactic outperforms existing sparse attention algorithms, achieving superior accuracy and up to 7.29x decode attention speedup. This improvement translates to an overall 1.58x end-to-end inference speedup, making Tactic a practical and effective solution for long-context LLM inference in accuracy-sensitive applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose Rotate, Clip, and Partition (RCP), a quantization-aware training (QAT) approach that first realizes extreme compression of LLMs with W2A4KV4(2-bit weight, 4-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache) configuration. RCP integrates recent rotation techniques with a novel non-uniform weight quantizer design, by quantitatively analyzing the impact of random rotation on 2-bit weight quantization. Our weight quantizer features Learnable Direct Partitioning (LDP), which introduces learnable parameters to directly learn non-uniform intervals jointly with LLM weights. We also present a specialized GPU kernel that supports GEMV on non-uniform W2A4. Experiments show that RCP can compress LLaMA-2-7B to W2A4KV4 with a loss of only 2.84 WikiText2 ppl and 5.29 times reduced memory footprint. Furthermore, RCP can quantize challenging mobile-targeted LLaMA-3.2 models and domain-specific WizardCoder-7B and MetaMath-7B with no critical problems such as convergence failure and repetition.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance for cross-modal understanding and generation, yet still suffer from severe inference costs. Recently, abundant works have been proposed to solve this problem with token pruning, which identifies the redundant tokens in MLLMs and then prunes them to reduce the computation and KV storage costs, leading to significant acceleration without training. While these methods claim efficiency gains, critical questions about their fundamental design and evaluation remain unanswered: Why do many existing approaches underperform even compared to naive random token selection? Are attention-based scoring sufficient for reliably identifying redundant tokens? Is language information really helpful during token pruning? What makes a good trade-off between token importance and duplication? Are current evaluation protocols comprehensive and unbiased? The ignorance of previous research on these problems hinders the long-term development of token pruning. In this paper, we answer these questions one by one, providing insights into the design of future token pruning methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The efficient processing of long context poses a serious challenge for large language models (LLMs). Recently, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising strategy for this problem, as it enables LLMs to make selective use of the long context for efficient computation. However, existing RAG approaches lag behind other long-context processing methods due to inherent limitations on inaccurate retrieval and fragmented contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce RetroLM, a novel RAG framework for long-context processing. Unlike traditional methods, RetroLM employs KV-level retrieval augmentation, where it partitions the LLM's KV cache into contiguous pages and retrieves the most crucial ones for efficient computation. This approach enhances robustness to retrieval inaccuracy, facilitates effective utilization of fragmented contexts, and saves the cost from repeated computation. Building on this framework, we further develop a specialized retriever for precise retrieval of critical pages and conduct unsupervised post-training to optimize the model's ability to leverage retrieved information. We conduct comprehensive evaluations with a variety of benchmarks, including LongBench, InfiniteBench, and RULER, where RetroLM significantly outperforms existing long-context LLMs and efficient long-context processing methods, particularly in tasks requiring intensive reasoning or extremely long-context comprehension.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Covid-19 pandemic brought unprecedented changes to business ownership in the UK which affects a generation of entrepreneurs and their employees. Nonetheless, the impact remains poorly understood. This is because research on capital accumulation has typically lacked high-quality, individualized, population-level data. We overcome these barriers to examine who benefits from economic crises through a computationally orientated lens of firm creation. Leveraging a comprehensive cache of administrative data on every UK firm and all nine million people running them, combined with probabilistic algorithms, we conduct individual-level analyses to understand who became Covid entrepreneurs. Using these techniques, we explore characteristics of entrepreneurs--such as age, gender, region, business experience, and industry--which potentially predict Covid entrepreneurship. By employing an automated time series model selection procedure to generate counterfactuals, we show that Covid entrepreneurs were typically aged 35-49 (40.4%), men (73.1%), and had previously held roles in existing firms (59.4%). For most industries, growth was disproportionately concentrated around London. It was therefore existing corporate elites who were most able to capitalize on the Covid crisis and not, as some hypothesized, young entrepreneurs who were setting up their first businesses. In this respect, the pandemic will likely impact future wealth inequalities. Our work offers methodological guidance for future policymakers during economic crises and highlights the long-term consequences for capital and wealth inequality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Flow diffusion models (FDMs) have recently shown potential in generation tasks due to the high generation quality. However, the current ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver for FDMs, e.g., the Euler solver, still suffers from slow generation since ODE solvers need many number function evaluations (NFE) to keep high-quality generation. In this paper, we propose a novel training-free flow-solver to reduce NFE while maintaining high-quality generation. The key insight for the flow-solver is to leverage the previous steps to reduce the NFE, where a cache is created to reuse these results from the previous steps. Specifically, the Taylor expansion is first used to approximate the ODE. To calculate the high-order derivatives of Taylor expansion, the flow-solver proposes to use the previous steps and a polynomial interpolation to approximate it, where the number of orders we could approximate equals the number of previous steps we cached. We also prove that the flow-solver has a more minor approximation error and faster generation speed. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ, LSUN-Bedroom, LSUN-Church, ImageNet, and real text-to-image generation prove the efficiency of the flow-solver. Specifically, the flow-solver improves the FID-30K from 13.79 to 6.75, from 46.64 to 19.49 with $\text{NFE}=10$ on CIFAR-10 and LSUN-Church, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are critical for a wide range of applications, but serving them efficiently becomes increasingly challenging as inputs become more complex. Context caching improves serving performance by exploiting inter-request dependency and reusing key-value (KV) cache across requests, thus improving time-to-first-token (TTFT). However, existing prefix-based context caching requires exact token prefix matches, limiting cache reuse in few-shot learning, multi-document QA, or retrieval-augmented generation, where prefixes may vary. In this paper, we present EPIC, an LLM serving system that introduces position-independent context caching (PIC), enabling modular KV cache reuse regardless of token chunk position (or prefix). EPIC features two key designs: AttnLink, which leverages static attention sparsity to minimize recomputation for accuracy recovery, and KVSplit, a customizable chunking method that preserves semantic coherence. Our experiments demonstrate that Epic delivers up to 8x improvements in TTFT and 7x throughput over existing systems, with negligible or no accuracy loss. By addressing the limitations of traditional caching approaches, Epic enables more scalable and efficient LLM inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities across various domains, with recent advancements in challenging reasoning tasks such as mathematics and programming. However, solving reasoning tasks often requires long decoding chains (of thoughts), which incur $O(N)$ time and memory consumption, where $N$ is the chain length. To mitigate $O(N)$ time and memory consumption, existing sparsity-based algorithms propose retaining only the most critical token's intermediate data (i.e., key-value cache) and discarding the rest. However, these existing algorithms struggle with the ``impossible trinity'' of accuracy, time, and memory. For example, the state-of-the-art algorithm, Quest, achieves high accuracy with $O(L)$ time but $O(N)$ memory ($L$ is the cache budget, $L \ll N$). To address this issue, in this paper, we identify a new attention pattern during the decode stage of reasoning tasks, where milestone tokens (analogous to lemmas in mathematical proofs) emerge, are utilized, and then become unimportant afterward. Based on this pattern, we propose a new algorithm named RaaS that identifies and retains milestone tokens only until they are no longer needed, achieving high accuracy with $O(L)$ time and $O(L)$ memory complexity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) excel across a variety of language tasks yet are constrained by limited input lengths and high computational costs. Existing approaches\textemdash such as relative positional encodings (e.g., RoPE, ALiBi) and sliding window mechanisms\textemdash partially alleviate these issues but often require additional training or suffer from performance degradation with longer inputs. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{\textit{CacheFocus}}, a method that enhances length normalization and reduces inference latency without any further training. Our approach leverages query-independent, offline caching to efficiently reuse a Context KV Cache Store. We address the amplification of abnormal token distributions problem by re-positioning cached keys and introducing Layer-Adaptive Cache Pruning to discard low-relevance caches during pre-filling. Additionally, our Adaptive Positional Allocation Strategy dynamically reassigns cache positions to maximize the use of the available positional encoding range. Experiments on the Natural Questions and TriviaQA datasets demonstrate that CacheFocus outperforms alternative methods even when inputs exceed the $4$K limit of the \texttt{LLaMA-2} model, emphasizing its practical effectiveness for long-context LLMs. Moreover, even with large maximum input length of \texttt{Qwen2}, the performance of CacheFocus shows that it maintains consistent performance even as the number of documents increases, effectively managing long-text generation without degradation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agent-based frameworks, the "Chain of Models" approach is widely used, where multiple specialized models work sequentially on distinct sub-tasks. This approach is effective but increases resource demands as each model must be deployed separately. Recent advancements attempt to address this by applying prompt tuning, which allows a shared base model to adapt to multiple tasks with minimal parameter changes. However, a key challenge remains: intermediate outputs, passed between models as plain text, require recomputation of hidden states (i.e., Key and Value (KV) states in Transformers) during inference. In this paper, we introduce FTHSS, a novel prompt-tuning method that enables models to share KV hidden states, eliminating redundant forward passes and reducing KV cache storage. By modifying input and attention masks during training, FTHSS allows models to effectively utilize KV hidden states from prior models in both single- and multi-round scenarios. Empirical results on four tasks show that FTHSS matches the performance of traditional model chains while improving inference efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transaction processing systems are the crux for modern data-center applications, yet current multi-node systems are slow due to network overheads. This paper advocates for Compute Express Link (CXL) as a network alternative, which enables low-latency and cache-coherent shared memory accesses. However, directly adopting standard CXL primitives leads to performance degradation due to the high cost of maintaining cross-node cache coherence. To address the CXL challenges, this paper introduces CtXnL, a software-hardware co-designed system that implements a novel hybrid coherence primitive tailored to the loosely coherent nature of transactional data. The core innovation of CtXnL is empowering transaction system developers with the ability to selectively achieve data coherence. Our evaluations on OLTP workloads demonstrate that CtXnL enhances performance, outperforming current network-based systems and achieves with up to 2.08x greater throughput than vanilla CXL memory sharing architectures across universal transaction processing policies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph neural networks (GNNs) are machine learning models specialized for graph data and widely used in many applications. To train GNNs on large graphs that exceed CPU memory, several systems store data on disk and conduct out-of-core processing. However, these systems suffer from either read amplification when reading node features that are usually smaller than a disk page or degraded model accuracy by treating the graph as disconnected partitions. To close this gap, we build a system called DiskGNN, which achieves high I/O efficiency and thus fast training without hurting model accuracy. The key technique used by DiskGNN is offline sampling, which helps decouple graph sampling from model computation. In particular, by conducting graph sampling beforehand, DiskGNN acquires the node features that will be accessed by model computation, and such information is utilized to pack the target node features contiguously on disk to avoid read amplification. Besides, \name{} also adopts designs including four-level feature store to fully utilize the memory hierarchy to cache node features and reduce disk access, batched packing to accelerate the feature packing process, and pipelined training to overlap disk access with other operations. We compare DiskGNN with Ginex and MariusGNN, which are state-of-the-art systems for out-of-core GNN training. The results show that DiskGNN can speed up the baselines by over 8x while matching their best model accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Simulating a single trajectory of a dynamical system under some state-dependent policy is a core bottleneck in policy optimization (PO) algorithms. The many inherently serial policy evaluations that must be performed in a single simulation constitute the bulk of this bottleneck. In applying PO to supply chain optimization (SCO) problems, simulating a single sample path corresponding to one month of a supply chain can take several hours. We present an iterative algorithm to accelerate policy simulation, dubbed Picard Iteration. This scheme carefully assigns policy evaluation tasks to independent processes. Within an iteration, any given process evaluates the policy only on its assigned tasks while assuming a certain "cached" evaluation for other tasks; the cache is updated at the end of the iteration. Implemented on GPUs, this scheme admits batched evaluation of the policy across a single trajectory. We prove that the structure afforded by many SCO problems allows convergence in a small number of iterations independent of the horizon. We demonstrate practical speedups of 400x on large-scale SCO problems even with a single GPU, and also demonstrate practical efficacy in other RL environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various applications, yet their computational overhead during deployment remains a critical challenge. While Key-Value (KV) caching improves inference efficiency by trading memory for computation, the growing memory footprint from storing extensive KV caches reduces throughput and limits long-term execution on devices with constrained GPU memory. Existing approaches primarily focus on dropping unimportant tokens to reduce the KV cache size, mitigating memory constraints at the cost of potential information loss. In contrast, we propose a simple yet effective visual quantization strategy that preserves all visual tokens while significantly reducing memory consumption. To achieve an extreme quantization ratio, i.e., 1-bit quantization, we propose group-specific quantization and quantile-based quantization approaches, motivated by the inherent patterns of the KV cache. Our method is plug-and-play, enabling seamless integration into various MLLMs to improve memory efficiency without architectural modifications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces memory overhead while maintaining computational efficiency and preserving multimodal performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The extremely high computational and storage demands of large language models have excluded most edge devices, which were widely used for efficient machine learning, from being viable options. A typical edge device usually only has 4GB of memory capacity and a bandwidth of less than 20GB/s, while a large language model quantized to 4-bit precision with 7B parameters already requires 3.5GB of capacity, and its decoding process is purely bandwidth-bound. In this paper, we aim to explore these limits by proposing a hardware accelerator for large language model (LLM) inference on the Zynq-based KV260 platform, equipped with 4GB of 64-bit 2400Mbps DDR4 memory. We successfully deploy a LLaMA2-7B model, achieving a decoding speed of around 5 token/s, utilizing 93.3% of the memory capacity and reaching 85% decoding speed of the theoretical memory bandwidth limit. To fully reserve the memory capacity for model weights and key-value cache, we develop the system in a bare-metal environment without an operating system. To fully reserve the bandwidth for model weight transfers, we implement a customized dataflow with an operator fusion pipeline and propose a data arrangement format that can maximize the data transaction efficiency. This research marks the first attempt to deploy a 7B level LLM on a standalone embedded field programmable gate array (FPGA) device. It provides key insights into efficient LLM inference on embedded FPGA devices and provides guidelines for future architecture design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion models (DMs) have become the leading choice for generative tasks across diverse domains. However, their reliance on multiple sequential forward passes significantly limits real-time performance. Previous acceleration methods have primarily focused on reducing the number of sampling steps or reusing intermediate results, failing to leverage variations across spatial regions within the image due to the constraints of convolutional U-Net structures. By harnessing the flexibility of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) in handling variable number of tokens, we introduce RAS, a novel, training-free sampling strategy that dynamically assigns different sampling ratios to regions within an image based on the focus of the DiT model. Our key observation is that during each sampling step, the model concentrates on semantically meaningful regions, and these areas of focus exhibit strong continuity across consecutive steps. Leveraging this insight, RAS updates only the regions currently in focus, while other regions are updated using cached noise from the previous step. The model's focus is determined based on the output from the preceding step, capitalizing on the temporal consistency we observed. We evaluate RAS on Stable Diffusion 3 and Lumina-Next-T2I, achieving speedups up to 2.36x and 2.51x, respectively, with minimal degradation in generation quality. Additionally, a user study reveals that RAS delivers comparable qualities under human evaluation while achieving a 1.6x speedup. Our approach makes a significant step towards more efficient diffusion transformers, enhancing their potential for real-time applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Phishing is a critical cyber threat, exploiting deceptive tactics to compromise victims and cause significant financial losses. While reference-based phishing detectors (RBPDs) have achieved notable advancements in detection accuracy, their real-world deployment is hindered by challenges such as high latency and inefficiency in URL analysis. To address these limitations, we present PhishIntel, an end-to-end phishing detection system for real-world deployment. PhishIntel intelligently determines whether a URL can be processed immediately or not, segmenting the detection process into two distinct tasks: a fast task that checks against local blacklists and result cache, and a slow task that conducts online blacklist verification, URL crawling, and webpage analysis using an RBPD. This fast-slow task system architecture ensures low response latency while retaining the robust detection capabilities of RBPDs for zero-day phishing threats. Furthermore, we develop two downstream applications based on PhishIntel: a phishing intelligence platform and a phishing email detection plugin for Microsoft Outlook, demonstrating its practical efficacy and utility.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work presents a framework for dynamic performance assessment of the higher layers in the hierarchical voltage regulation scheme, with case studies applied to specific areas of the Norwegian grid. Unlike the primary (PVR) level, the secondary (SVR) and tertiary (TVR) levels are not tuned to a single device at a time, handling instead several reactive power resources available within a control zone including generator units, static VAr compensators and others. Proper SVR-TVR coordination for realistic transmission systems is a challenging topic at the core of many ongoing discussions in voltage control literature. Special focus is placed on practical considerations from the system operator perspective, since this research is also aimed at simplifying daily control centre routines. Dynamic simulation results concern a 21-bus equivalent of a 132 kV network model that accurately represents a Norwegian grid subsystem. Case studies address daily grid operation with real-life load demand and wind power generation profiles, showing that the proposed strategy is effective not only to minimize total active power losses as much as possible within system-wide limitations, but also to maintain adequate voltage profiles and reactive power flows. Findings pertaining to this work showcase the benefits of applying hierarchical voltage regulation layers as an asset to day-to-day control center management of a realistic transmission network.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The growing memory and computational demands of large language models (LLMs) for generative inference present significant challenges for practical deployment. One promising solution to address these challenges is offloading-based batched inference, which leverages host memory and disk as an extended memory hierarchy for GPUs. While the approach cost-effectively enables LLM inference, its performance is limited by substantial I/O overhead, primarily due to the large key-value (KV) cache sizes, which increase with batch size and LLM context window length.   In this paper, we introduce INFerence-INFinity (INF^2), a framework that boosts generative inference throughput using computational storage devices (CSDs). The core of INF^2 is attention-near storage, which offloads memory-intensive self-attention operations to near-storage accelerators, significantly reducing traffic through the system interconnect. We also propose delayed KV cache writeback to hide storage write latency by delaying newly generated KV cache writes until the cache reaches sufficient size in system memory. Additionally, we introduce cooperative X-cache, a technique designed to further trade off the remaining memory capacity for storage bandwidth. Our methods effectively minimize idle time for computation, improving the overall throughput.   To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, \thiswork has been implemented on PyTorch and evaluated on a real system. Our experiments show that INF^2 achieves up to 3.46$\times$ throughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We will open-source INF^2 to facilitate broader adoption.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The pursuit of scaling up recommendation models confronts intrinsic tensions between expanding model capacity and preserving computational tractability. While prior studies have explored scaling laws for recommendation systems, their resource-intensive paradigms -- often requiring tens of thousands of A100 GPU hours -- remain impractical for most industrial applications. This work addresses a critical gap: achieving sustainable model scaling under strict computational budgets. We propose Climber, a resource-efficient recommendation framework comprising two synergistic components: the ASTRO model architecture for algorithmic innovation and the TURBO acceleration framework for engineering optimization. ASTRO (Adaptive Scalable Transformer for RecOmmendation) adopts two core innovations: (1) multi-scale sequence partitioning that reduces attention complexity from O(n^2d) to O(n^2d/Nb) via hierarchical blocks, enabling more efficient scaling with sequence length; (2) dynamic temperature modulation that adaptively adjusts attention scores for multimodal distributions arising from inherent multi-scenario and multi-behavior interactions. Complemented by TURBO (Two-stage Unified Ranking with Batched Output), a co-designed acceleration framework integrating gradient-aware feature compression and memory-efficient Key-Value caching, Climber achieves 5.15x throughput gains without performance degradation. Comprehensive offline experiments on multiple datasets validate that Climber exhibits a more ideal scaling curve. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly documented framework where controlled model scaling drives continuous online metric growth (12.19% overall lift) without prohibitive resource costs. Climber has been successfully deployed on Netease Cloud Music, one of China's largest music streaming platforms, serving tens of millions of users daily.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The DNS (Domain Name System) protocol has been in use since the early days of the Internet. Although DNS as a de facto networking protocol had no security considerations in its early years, there have been many security enhancements, such as DNSSec (Domain Name System Security Extensions), DoT (DNS over Transport Layer Security), DoH (DNS over HTTPS) and DoQ (DNS over QUIC). With all these security improvements, it is not yet clear what resource-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices should be used for robustness. In this paper, we investigate different DNS security approaches using an edge DNS resolver implemented as a Virtual Network Function (VNF) to replicate the impact of the protocol from an IoT perspective and compare their performances under different conditions. We present our results for cache-based and non-cached responses and evaluate the corresponding security benefits. Our results and framework can greatly help consumers, manufacturers, and the research community decide and implement their DNS protocols depending on the given dynamic network conditions and enable robust Internet access via DNS for different devices.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a critical technique for efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs). This work proposes NestQuant, a novel PTQ scheme for weights and activations that is based on self-similar nested lattices. Recent work have mathematically shown such quantizers to be information-theoretically optimal for low-precision matrix multiplication. We implement a practical low-complexity version of NestQuant based on Gosset lattice, making it a drop-in quantizer for any matrix multiplication step (e.g., in self-attention, MLP etc). For example, NestQuant quantizes weights, KV-cache, and activations of Llama-3-8B to 4 bits, achieving perplexity of 6.6 on wikitext2. This represents more than 55% reduction in perplexity gap with respect to unquantized model (perplexity of 6.14) compared to state-of-the-art Meta's SpinQuant (perplexity 7.3). Comparisons on various LLM evaluation benchmarks also show a reduction in performance degradation induced by quantization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern large language models (LLMs) often encounter communication bottlenecks on current hardware, rather than purely computational constraints. Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) tackles this challenge by using low-rank matrices in the key-value (KV) layers, thereby allowing compressed latent KV states to be cached. This approach significantly reduces the KV cache size relative to traditional multi-head attention, leading to faster inference. Moreover, MLA employs an up-projection matrix to increase expressiveness, trading additional computation for reduced communication overhead. Although MLA has demonstrated efficiency and effectiveness in Deepseek V2/V3/R1, many major model providers still rely on Group Query Attention (GQA) and have not announced any plans to adopt MLA. In this paper, we show that GQA can always be represented by MLA while maintaining the same KV cache overhead, but the converse does not hold. To encourage broader use of MLA, we introduce TransMLA, a post-training method that converts widely used GQA-based pre-trained models (e.g., LLaMA, Qwen, Mixtral) into MLA-based models. After conversion, the model can undergo additional training to boost expressiveness without increasing the KV cache size. Furthermore, we plan to develop MLA-specific inference acceleration techniques to preserve low latency in transformed models, thus enabling more efficient distillation of Deepseek R1.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite the high computational throughput of GPUs, limited memory capacity and bandwidth-limited CPU-GPU communication via PCIe links remain significant bottlenecks for accelerating large-scale data analytics workloads. This paper introduces Vortex, a GPU-accelerated framework designed for data analytics workloads that exceed GPU memory capacity. A key aspect of our framework is an optimized IO primitive that leverages all available PCIe links in multi-GPU systems for the IO demand of a single target GPU. It routes data through other GPUs to such target GPU that handles IO-intensive analytics tasks. This approach is advantageous when other GPUs are occupied with compute-bound workloads, such as popular AI applications that typically underutilize IO resources. We also introduce a novel programming model that separates GPU kernel development from IO scheduling, reducing programmer burden and enabling GPU code reuse. Additionally, we present the design of certain important query operators and discuss a late materialization technique based on GPU's zero-copy memory access. Without caching any data in GPU memory, Vortex improves the performance of the state-of-the-art GPU baseline, Proteus, by 5.7$\times$ on average and enhances price performance by 2.5$\times$ compared to a CPU-based DuckDB baseline.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Model (LLM) inference, where a trained model generates text one word at a time in response to user prompts, is a computationally intensive process requiring efficient scheduling to optimize latency and resource utilization. A key challenge in LLM inference is the management of the Key-Value (KV) cache, which reduces redundant computations but introduces memory constraints. In this work, we model LLM inference with KV cache constraints theoretically and propose novel batching and scheduling algorithms that minimize inference latency while effectively managing the KV cache's memory.   We analyze both semi-online and fully online scheduling models, and our results are threefold. First, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves exact optimality in terms of average latency in the semi-online prompt arrival model. Second, in the fully online case with a stochastic prompt arrival, we introduce an efficient online scheduling algorithm with constant regret. Third, we prove that no algorithm (deterministic or randomized) can achieve a constant competitive ratio in fully online adversarial settings. Our empirical evaluations on a public LLM inference dataset, using the Llama-70B model on A100 GPUs, show that our approach significantly outperforms benchmark algorithms used currently in practice, achieving lower latency while reducing energy consumption. Overall, our results offer a path toward more sustainable and cost-effective LLM deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Supervised fine-tuning is a standard method for adapting pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. Quantization has been recently studied as a post-training technique for efficient LLM deployment. To obtain quantized fine-tuned LLMs, conventional pipelines would first fine-tune the pre-trained models, followed by post-training quantization. This often yields suboptimal performance as it fails to leverage the synergy between fine-tuning and quantization. To effectively realize low-bit quantization of weights, activations, and KV caches in LLMs, we propose an algorithm named Rotated Straight-Through-Estimator (RoSTE), which combines quantization-aware supervised fine-tuning (QA-SFT) with an adaptive rotation strategy that identifies an effective rotation configuration to reduce activation outliers. We provide theoretical insights on RoSTE by analyzing its prediction error when applied to an overparameterized least square quantized training problem. Our findings reveal that the prediction error is directly proportional to the quantization error of the converged weights, which can be effectively managed through an optimized rotation configuration. Experiments on Pythia and Llama models of different sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of RoSTE. Compared to existing post-SFT quantization baselines, our method consistently achieves superior performances across various tasks and different LLM architectures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Disaggregated memory systems achieve resource utilization efficiency and system scalability by distributing computation and memory resources into distinct pools of nodes. RDMA is an attractive solution to support high-throughput communication between different disaggregated resource pools. However, existing RDMA solutions face a dilemma: one-sided RDMA completely bypasses computation at memory nodes, but its communication takes multiple round trips; two-sided RDMA achieves one-round-trip communication but requires non-trivial computation for index lookups at memory nodes, which violates the principle of disaggregated memory. This work presents Outback, a novel indexing solution for key-value stores with a one-round-trip RDMA-based network that does not incur computation-heavy tasks at memory nodes. Outback is the first to utilize dynamic minimal perfect hashing and separates its index into two components: one memory-efficient and compute-heavy component at compute nodes and the other memory-heavy and compute-efficient component at memory nodes. We implement a prototype of Outback and evaluate its performance in a public cloud. The experimental results show that Outback achieves higher throughput than both the state-of-the-art one-sided RDMA and two-sided RDMA-based in-memory KVS by 1.06-5.03x, due to the unique strength of applying a separated perfect hashing index.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In modern large language models (LLMs), handling very long context lengths presents significant challenges as it causes slower inference speeds and increased memory costs. Additionally, most existing pre-trained LLMs fail to generalize beyond their original training sequence lengths. To enable efficient and practical long-context utilization, we introduce InfiniteHiP, a novel, and practical LLM inference framework that accelerates processing by dynamically eliminating irrelevant context tokens through a modular hierarchical token pruning algorithm. Our method also allows generalization to longer sequences by selectively applying various RoPE adjustment methods according to the internal attention patterns within LLMs. Furthermore, we offload the key-value cache to host memory during inference, significantly reducing GPU memory pressure. As a result, InfiniteHiP enables the processing of up to 3 million tokens on a single L40s 48GB GPU -- 3x larger -- without any permanent loss of context information. Our framework achieves an 18.95x speedup in attention decoding for a 1 million token context without requiring additional training. We implement our method in the SGLang framework and demonstrate its effectiveness and practicality through extensive evaluations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sparse Attention is a technique that approximates standard attention computation with sub-quadratic complexity. This is achieved by selectively ignoring smaller entries in the attention matrix during the softmax function computation. Variations of this technique, such as pruning KV cache, sparsity-based fast attention, and Sparse Transformer, have been extensively utilized for efficient Large Language Models (LLMs) deployment. Despite its widespread use, a theoretical understanding of the conditions under which sparse attention performs on par with traditional attention remains elusive. This work aims to $\textbf{bridge this gap by examining the inherent sparsity of standard attention processes}$. Our theoretical framework reveals several brand-new key insights:   $\bullet$ Attention is $n^{C}$-sparse, implying that considering only the largest $\Omega(n^{C})$ entries out of all $n$ entries is sufficient for sparse attention to approximate the exact attention matrix with decreasing loss. Here, $n$ represents the input length and $C \in (0, 1)$ is a constant.   $\bullet$ Stable $o(\log(n))$-sparse attention, which approximates attention computation with $\log(n)$ or fewer entries, may not be feasible since the error will persist at a minimum of $O(1)$.   $\bullet$ An adaptive strategy ($\alpha \cdot n^C, \alpha \in \mathbb{R}$) for the window size of efficient attention methods rather than a fixed one is guaranteed to perform more accurately and efficiently in a task for inference on flexible context lengths.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Context-augmented generation (CAG) techniques, including RAG and ICL, require the efficient combination of multiple contexts to generate responses to user queries. Directly inputting these contexts as a sequence introduces a considerable computational burden by re-encoding the combined selection of contexts for every request. To address this, we explore the promising potential of parallel encoding to independently pre-compute and cache each context's KV states. This approach enables the direct loading of cached states during inference while accommodating more contexts through position reuse across contexts. However, due to misalignments in attention distribution, directly applying parallel encoding results in a significant performance drop. To enable effective and efficient CAG, we propose Adaptive Parallel Encoding ($\textbf{APE}$), which brings shared prefix, attention temperature, and scaling factor to align the distribution of parallel encoding with sequential encoding. Results on RAG and ICL tasks demonstrate that APE can preserve 98% and 93% sequential encoding performance using the same inputs while outperforming parallel encoding by 3.6% and 7.9%, respectively. It also scales to many-shot CAG, effectively encoding hundreds of contexts in parallel. Efficiency evaluation shows that APE can achieve an end-to-end 4.5$\times$ speedup by reducing 28$\times$ prefilling time for a 128K-length context.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The attention mechanism is essential for the impressive capabilities of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs). However, calculating attention is computationally intensive due to its quadratic dependency on the sequence length. We introduce a novel approach called Top-Theta Attention, or simply Top-$\theta$, which selectively prunes less essential attention elements by comparing them against carefully calibrated thresholds. This method greatly improves the efficiency of self-attention matrix multiplication while preserving model accuracy, reducing the number of required V cache rows by 3x during generative decoding and the number of attention elements by 10x during the prefill phase. Our method does not require model retraining; instead, it requires only a brief calibration phase to be resilient to distribution shifts, thus not requiring the thresholds for different datasets to be recalibrated. Unlike top-k attention, Top-$\theta$ eliminates full-vector dependency, making it suitable for tiling and scale-out and avoiding costly top-k search. A key innovation of our approach is the development of efficient numerical compensation techniques, which help preserve model accuracy even under aggressive pruning of attention scores.

Providing predictable performance guarantees requires a deep understanding of how applications contend for shared GPU resources such as block schedulers, compute units, L1/L2 caches, and memory bandwidth.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The wide deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to strong demands for optimizing their inference performance. Today's techniques serving this purpose primarily focus on reducing latency and improving throughput through algorithmic and hardware enhancements, while largely overlooking their privacy side effects, particularly in a multi-user environment. In our research, for the first time, we discovered a set of new timing side channels in LLM systems, arising from shared caches and GPU memory allocations, which can be exploited to infer both confidential system prompts and those issued by other users. These vulnerabilities echo security challenges observed in traditional computing systems, highlighting an urgent need to address potential information leakage in LLM serving infrastructures. In this paper, we report novel attack strategies designed to exploit such timing side channels inherent in LLM deployments, specifically targeting the Key-Value (KV) cache and semantic cache widely used to enhance LLM inference performance. Our approach leverages timing measurements and classification models to detect cache hits, allowing an adversary to infer private prompts with high accuracy. We also propose a token-by-token search algorithm to efficiently recover shared prompt prefixes in the caches, showing the feasibility of stealing system prompts and those produced by peer users. Our experimental studies on black-box testing of popular online LLM services demonstrate that such privacy risks are completely realistic, with significant consequences. Our findings underscore the need for robust mitigation to protect LLM systems against such emerging threats.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Disaggregating the prefill and decoding phases represents an effective new paradigm for generative inference of large language models (LLM), which eliminates prefill-decoding interference and optimizes resource allocation. However, it is still an open problem about how to deploy the disaggregated inference paradigm across a group of heterogeneous GPUs, which can be an economical alternative to deployment over homogeneous high-performance GPUs. Towards this end, we introduce HexGen-2, a distributed system for efficient and economical LLM serving on heterogeneous GPUs following the disaggregated paradigm. Built on top of HexGen, the core component of HexGen-2 is a scheduling algorithm that formalizes the allocation of disaggregated LLM inference computations and communications over heterogeneous GPUs and network connections as a constraint optimization problem. We leverage the graph partitioning and max-flow algorithms to co-optimize resource allocation, parallel strategies for distinct inference phases, and the efficiency of inter-phase key-value (KV) cache communications. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate HexGen-2, i.e., on OPT (30B) and Llama-2 (70B) models in various real-world settings, the results reveal that HexGen-2 delivers up to a 2.0 times and on average a 1.3 times improvement in serving throughput, reduces the average inference latency by 1.5 times compared with state-of-the-art systems given the same price budget, and achieves comparable inference performance with a 30% lower price budget.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Prompt caching in large language models (LLMs) results in data-dependent timing variations: cached prompts are processed faster than non-cached prompts. These timing differences introduce the risk of side-channel timing attacks. For example, if the cache is shared across users, an attacker could identify cached prompts from fast API response times to learn information about other users' prompts. Because prompt caching may cause privacy leakage, transparency around the caching policies of API providers is important. To this end, we develop and conduct statistical audits to detect prompt caching in real-world LLM API providers. We detect global cache sharing across users in seven API providers, including OpenAI, resulting in potential privacy leakage about users' prompts. Timing variations due to prompt caching can also result in leakage of information about model architecture. Namely, we find evidence that OpenAI's embedding model is a decoder-only Transformer, which was previously not publicly known.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) systems are increasingly being deployed across diverse industries and research domains. Developers and end-users interact with these systems through the use of prompting and prompt engineering. Although prompt engineering is a widely adopted and extensively researched area, it suffers from conflicting terminology and a fragmented ontological understanding of what constitutes an effective prompt due to its relatively recent emergence. We establish a structured understanding of prompt engineering by assembling a taxonomy of prompting techniques and analyzing their applications. We present a detailed vocabulary of 33 vocabulary terms, a taxonomy of 58 LLM prompting techniques, and 40 techniques for other modalities. Additionally, we provide best practices and guidelines for prompt engineering, including advice for prompting state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs such as ChatGPT. We further present a meta-analysis of the entire literature on natural language prefix-prompting. As a culmination of these efforts, this paper presents the most comprehensive survey on prompt engineering to date.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This study investigates the impact of localized updates to large language models (LLMs), specifically in the context of knowledge editing - a task aimed at incorporating or modifying specific facts without altering broader model capabilities. We first show that across different post-training interventions like continuous pre-training, full fine-tuning and LORA-based fine-tuning, the Frobenius norm of the updated matrices always increases. This increasing norm is especially detrimental for localized knowledge editing, where only a subset of matrices are updated in a model . We reveal a consistent phenomenon across various editing techniques, including fine-tuning, hypernetwork-based approaches, and locate-and-edit methods: the norm of the updated matrix invariably increases with successive updates. Such growth disrupts model balance, particularly when isolated matrices are updated while the rest of the model remains static, leading to potential instability and degradation of downstream performance. Upon deeper investigations of the intermediate activation vectors, we find that the norm of internal activations decreases and is accompanied by shifts in the subspaces occupied by these activations, which shows that these activation vectors now occupy completely different regions in the representation space compared to the unedited model. With our paper, we highlight the technical challenges with continuous and localized sequential knowledge editing and their implications for maintaining model stability and utility.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Paywalls, licenses and copyright rules often restrict the broad dissemination and reuse of scientific knowledge. We take the position that it is both legally and technically feasible to extract the scientific knowledge in scholarly texts. Current methods, like text embeddings, fail to reliably preserve factual content, and simple paraphrasing may not be legally sound. We urge the community to adopt a new idea: convert scholarly documents into Knowledge Units using LLMs. These units use structured data capturing entities, attributes and relationships without stylistic content. We provide evidence that Knowledge Units: (1) form a legally defensible framework for sharing knowledge from copyrighted research texts, based on legal analyses of German copyright law and U.S. Fair Use doctrine, and (2) preserve most (~95%) factual knowledge from original text, measured by MCQ performance on facts from the original copyrighted text across four research domains. Freeing scientific knowledge from copyright promises transformative benefits for scientific research and education by allowing language models to reuse important facts from copyrighted text. To support this, we share open-source tools for converting research documents into Knowledge Units. Overall, our work posits the feasibility of democratizing access to scientific knowledge while respecting copyright.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the recent remarkable advancement of large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing interest in utilizing them in the domains with highly sensitive data that lies outside their training data. For this purpose, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is particularly effective -- it assists LLMs by directly providing relevant information from the external knowledge sources. However, without extra privacy safeguards, RAG outputs risk leaking sensitive information from the external data source. In this work, we explore RAG under differential privacy (DP), a formal guarantee of data privacy. The main challenge with differentially private RAG is how to generate long accurate answers within a moderate privacy budget. We address this by proposing an algorithm that smartly spends privacy budget only for the tokens that require the sensitive information and uses the non-private LLM for other tokens. Our extensive empirical evaluations reveal that our algorithm outperforms the non-RAG baseline under a reasonable privacy budget of $\epsilon\approx 10$ across different models and datasets.

In this study, we examine how code serves as a structured medium for enhancing reasoning: it provides verifiable execution paths, enforces logical decomposition, and enables runtime validation. We also explore how improvements in reasoning have transformed code intelligence from basic completion to advanced capabilities, enabling models to address complex software engineering tasks through planning and debugging. Finally, we identify key challenges and propose future research directions to strengthen this synergy, ultimately improving LLM's performance in both areas.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in recommending everyday actions as personal AI assistants, while Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are being increasingly utilized to help users understand why a recommendation is given. Personal AI assistants today are often located on ultra-small devices such as smartwatches, which have limited screen space. The verbosity of LLM-generated explanations, however, makes it challenging to deliver glanceable LLM explanations on such ultra-small devices. To address this, we explored 1) spatially structuring an LLM's explanation text using defined contextual components during prompting and 2) presenting temporally adaptive explanations to users based on confidence levels. We conducted a user study to understand how these approaches impacted user experiences when interacting with LLM recommendations and explanations on ultra-small devices. The results showed that structured explanations reduced users' time to action and cognitive load when reading an explanation. Always-on structured explanations increased users' acceptance of AI recommendations. However, users were less satisfied with structured explanations compared to unstructured ones due to their lack of sufficient, readable details. Additionally, adaptively presenting structured explanations was less effective at improving user perceptions of the AI compared to the always-on structured explanations. Together with users' interview feedback, the results led to design implications to be mindful of when personalizing the content and timing of LLM explanations that are displayed on ultra-small devices.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Providing effective feedback for programming assignments in computer science education can be challenging: students solve problems by iteratively submitting code, executing it, and using limited feedback from the compiler or the auto-grader to debug. Analyzing student debugging behavior in this process may reveal important insights into their knowledge and inform better personalized support tools. In this work, we propose an encoder-decoder-based model that learns meaningful code-edit embeddings between consecutive student code submissions, to capture their debugging behavior. Our model leverages information on whether a student code submission passes each test case to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) to learn code editing representations. It enables personalized next-step code suggestions that maintain the student's coding style while improving test case correctness. Our model also enables us to analyze student code-editing patterns to uncover common student errors and debugging behaviors, using clustering techniques.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Machine learning programs, such as those performing inference, fine-tuning, and training of LLMs, are commonly delegated to untrusted compute providers. To provide correctness guarantees for the client, we propose adapting the cryptographic notion of refereed delegation to the machine learning setting. This approach enables a computationally limited client to delegate a program to multiple untrusted compute providers, with a guarantee of obtaining the correct result if at least one of them is honest. Refereed delegation of ML programs poses two technical hurdles: (1) an arbitration protocol to resolve disputes when compute providers disagree on the output, and (2) the ability to bitwise reproduce ML programs across different hardware setups, For (1), we design Verde, a dispute arbitration protocol that efficiently handles the large scale and graph-based computational model of modern ML programs. For (2), we build RepOps (Reproducible Operators), a library that eliminates hardware "non-determinism" by controlling the order of floating point operations performed on all hardware. Our implementation shows that refereed delegation achieves both strong guarantees for clients and practical overheads for compute providers.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive real-world utility, exemplifying artificial useful intelligence (AUI). However, their ability to reason adaptively and robustly -- the hallmarks of artificial general intelligence (AGI) -- remains fragile. While LLMs seemingly succeed in commonsense reasoning, programming, and mathematics, they struggle to generalize algorithmic understanding across novel contexts. Our experiments with algorithmic tasks in esoteric programming languages reveal that LLM's reasoning overfits to the training data and is limited in its transferability. We hypothesize that the core issue underlying such limited transferability is the coupling of reasoning and knowledge in LLMs.   To transition from AUI to AGI, we propose disentangling knowledge and reasoning through three key directions: (1) pretaining to reason using RL from scratch as an alternative to the widely used next-token prediction pretraining, (2) using a curriculum of synthetic tasks to ease the learning of a \textit{reasoning prior} for RL that can then be transferred to natural language tasks, and (3) learning more generalizable reasoning functions using a small context window to reduce exploiting spurious correlations between tokens. Such a reasoning system coupled with a trained retrieval system and a large external memory bank as a knowledge store can overcome several limitations of existing architectures at learning to reason in novel scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding domain-specific theorems often requires more than just text-based reasoning; effective communication through structured visual explanations is crucial for deeper comprehension. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance in text-based theorem reasoning, their ability to generate coherent and pedagogically meaningful visual explanations remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce TheoremExplainAgent, an agentic approach for generating long-form theorem explanation videos (over 5 minutes) using Manim animations. To systematically evaluate multimodal theorem explanations, we propose TheoremExplainBench, a benchmark covering 240 theorems across multiple STEM disciplines, along with 5 automated evaluation metrics. Our results reveal that agentic planning is essential for generating detailed long-form videos, and the o3-mini agent achieves a success rate of 93.8% and an overall score of 0.77. However, our quantitative and qualitative studies show that most of the videos produced exhibit minor issues with visual element layout. Furthermore, multimodal explanations expose deeper reasoning flaws that text-based explanations fail to reveal, highlighting the importance of multimodal explanations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Many combinatorial problems can be mapped to Ising machines, i.e., networks of coupled oscillators that settle to a minimum-energy ground state, from which the problem solution is inferred. This work proposes DROID, a novel event-driven method for simulating the evolution of a CMOS Ising machine to its ground state. The approach is accurate under general delay-phase relations that include the effects of the transistor nonlinearities and is computationally efficient. On a realistic-size all-to-all coupled ring oscillator array, DROID is nearly four orders of magnitude faster than a traditional HSPICE simulation in predicting the evolution of a coupled oscillator system and is demonstrated to attain a similar distribution of solutions as the hardware.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce the emPDF (Empirical Distribution Function), a novel dynamical modeling method that infers the gravitational potential from kinematic tracers with optimal statistical efficiency under the minimal assumption of steady state. emPDF determines the best-fit potential by maximizing the similarity between instantaneous kinematics and the time-averaged phase-space distribution function (DF), which is empirically constructed from observation upon the theoretical foundation of oPDF (Han et al. 2016). This approach eliminates the need for presumed functional forms of DFs or orbit libraries required by conventional DF- or orbit-based methods. emPDF stands out for its flexibility, efficiency, and capability in handling observational effects, making it preferable to the popular Jeans equation or other minimal assumption methods, especially for the Milky Way (MW) outer halo where tracers often have limited sample size and poor data quality. We apply emPDF to infer the MW mass profile using Gaia DR3 data of satellite galaxies and globular clusters, obtaining enclosed masses of $M(<r)=26\pm8, 46\pm8, 90\pm13$, and $149\pm40 \times 10^{10}M_\odot$ at r=30, 50, 100, and 200 kpc, respectively. These are consistent with the updated constraints from simulation-informed DF fitting (Li et al. 2020). While the simulation-informed DF offers superior precision owing to the additional information extracted from simulations, emPDF is independent of such supplementary knowledge and applicable to general tracer populations. emPDF is currently implemented for tracers with complete 6D kinematics within spherical potentials, but it can potentially be extended to address more general problems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown immense potential in enhancing various aspects of our daily lives, from conversational AI to search and AI assistants. However, their growing capabilities come at the cost of extremely large model sizes, making deployment on edge devices challenging due to memory and computational constraints. This paper introduces a novel approach to LLM weight pruning that directly optimizes for approximating the attention matrix, a core component of transformer architectures. Unlike existing methods that focus on linear approximations, our approach accounts for the non-linear nature of the Softmax attention mechanism. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of our Gradient Descent-based optimization method to a near-optimal pruning mask solution. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our non-linear pruning approach in maintaining model performance while significantly reducing computational costs, which is beyond the current state-of-the-art methods, i.e., SparseGPT and Wanda, by a large margin. This work establishes a new theoretical foundation for pruning algorithm design in LLMs, potentially paving the way for more efficient LLM inference on resource-constrained devices.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Training dense LLMs requires enormous amounts of data and centralized compute, which introduces fundamental bottlenecks and ever-growing costs for large models. Several studies aim to reduce this dependency on centralization by reducing the communication overhead of training dense models. Taking this idea of reducing communication overhead to a natural extreme, by training embarrassingly parallelizable ensembles of small independent experts, has been shown to outperform large dense models trained in traditional centralized settings. However, existing studies do not take into account underlying differences amongst data domains and treat them as monolithic, regardless of their underlying complexity, size, or distribution. In this paper, we explore the effects of introducing heterogeneity to these ensembles of domain expert models. Specifically, by allowing models within the ensemble to vary in size--as well as the number of training steps taken depending on the training data's domain--we study the effect heterogeneity has on these ensembles when evaluated against domains included in, and excluded from, the training set. We use the same compute budget to train heterogeneous ensembles and homogeneous baselines for comparison. We show that the heterogeneous ensembles achieve the lowest perplexity scores in $20$ out of the $21$ data domains used in the evaluation. Our code is available at https://github.com/gensyn-ai/hdee.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The ability to distinguish between correlation and causation of variables in molecular systems remains an interesting and open area of investigation. In this work, we probe causality in a molecular system using two independent computational methods that infer the causal direction through the language of information transfer. Specifically, we demonstrate that a molecular dynamics simulation involving a single Tryptophan in liquid water displays asymmetric information transfer between specific collective variables, such as solute and solvent coordinates. Analyzing a discrete Markov-state and Langevin dynamics on a 2D free energy surface, we show that the same kind of asymmetries can emerge even in extremely simple systems, undergoing equilibrium and time-reversible dynamics. We use these model systems to rationalize the unidirectional information transfer in the molecular system in terms of asymmetries in the underlying free energy landscape and/or relaxation dynamics of the relevant coordinates. Finally, we propose a computational experiment that allows one to decide if an asymmetric information transfer between two variables corresponds to a genuine causal link.

We introduce ARCON, a scheme that alternates between generating semantic and RGB tokens, allowing the LVM to explicitly learn high-level structural video information. We find high consistency in the RGB images and semantic maps generated without special design. Moreover, we employ an optical flow-based texture stitching method to enhance visual quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable improvements in reasoning and many existing benchmarks have been addressed by models such as o1 and o3 either fully or partially. However, a majority of these benchmarks emphasize deductive reasoning, including mathematical and coding tasks in which rules such as mathematical axioms or programming syntax are clearly defined, based on which LLMs can plan and apply these rules to arrive at a solution. In contrast, inductive reasoning, where one infers the underlying rules from observed data, remains less explored. Such inductive processes lie at the heart of scientific discovery, as they enable researchers to extract general principles from empirical observations. To assess whether LLMs possess this capacity, we introduce InductionBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the inductive reasoning ability of LLMs. Our experimental findings reveal that even the most advanced models available struggle to master the simplest complexity classes within the subregular hierarchy of functions, highlighting a notable deficiency in current LLMs' inductive reasoning capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Developing robotic intelligent systems that can adapt quickly to unseen wild situations is one of the critical challenges in pursuing autonomous robotics. Although some impressive progress has been made in walking stability and skill learning in the field of legged robots, their ability for fast adaptation is still inferior to that of animals in nature. Animals are born with a massive set of skills needed to survive, and can quickly acquire new ones, by composing fundamental skills with limited experience. Inspired by this, we propose a novel framework, named Robot Skill Graph (RSG) for organizing a massive set of fundamental skills of robots and dexterously reusing them for fast adaptation. Bearing a structure similar to the Knowledge Graph (KG), RSG is composed of massive dynamic behavioral skills instead of static knowledge in KG and enables discovering implicit relations that exist in between the learning context and acquired skills of robots, serving as a starting point for understanding subtle patterns existing in robots' skill learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RSG can provide reliable skill inference upon new tasks and environments, and enable quadruped robots to adapt to new scenarios and quickly learn new skills.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Instruction tuning has been widely adopted to ensure large language models (LLMs) follow user instructions effectively. The resulting instruction-following capabilities of LLMs heavily rely on the instruction datasets used for tuning. Recently, synthetic instruction datasets have emerged as an economically viable solution to provide LLMs diverse and high-quality instructions. However, existing approaches typically assume that larger or stronger models are stronger teachers for instruction tuning, and hence simply adopt these models as response generators to the synthetic instructions. In this paper, we challenge this commonly-adopted assumption. Our extensive experiments across five base models and twenty response generators reveal that larger and stronger models are not necessarily stronger teachers of smaller models. We refer to this phenomenon as the Larger Models' Paradox. We observe that existing metrics cannot precisely predict the effectiveness of response generators since they ignore the compatibility between teachers and base models being fine-tuned. We thus develop a novel metric, named as Compatibility-Adjusted Reward (CAR) to measure the effectiveness of response generators. Our experiments across five base models demonstrate that CAR outperforms almost all baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Unit tests (UTs) play an instrumental role in assessing code correctness as well as providing feedback to large language models (LLMs), motivating automated test generation. However, we uncover a trade-off between generating unit test inputs that reveal errors when given a faulty code and correctly predicting the unit test output without access to the gold solution. To address this trade-off, we propose UTGen, which teaches LLMs to generate unit test inputs that reveal errors along with their correct expected outputs based on task descriptions. Since model-generated tests can provide noisy signals (e.g., from incorrectly predicted outputs), we propose UTDebug that (i) scales UTGen via test-time compute to improve UT output prediction, and (ii) validates and backtracks edits based on multiple generated UTs to avoid overfitting, and helps LLMs debug effectively. We show that UTGen outperforms other LLM-based baselines by 7.59% based on a metric measuring the presence of both error-revealing UT inputs and correct UT outputs. When used with UTDebug, we find that feedback from UTGen's unit tests improves pass@1 accuracy of Qwen2.5 32B on HumanEvalFix and our own harder debugging split of MBPP+ by over 3.17% and 12.35% (respectively) over other LLM-based UT generation baselines. Lastly, we demonstrate that UTGen is a better judge for code correctness, outperforming a state-of-the-art trained 8B reward model by 4.43% on HumanEval+ with best-of-10 sampling using Qwen2.5 7B.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The performance emergence of large language models (LLMs) driven by data scaling laws makes the selection of pre-training data increasingly important. However, existing methods rely on limited heuristics and human intuition, lacking comprehensive and clear guidelines. To address this, we are inspired by ``reverse thinking'' -- prompting LLMs to self-identify which criteria benefit its performance. As its pre-training capabilities are related to perplexity (PPL), we derive 14 quality criteria from the causes of text perplexity anomalies and introduce 15 common application domains to support domain mixing. In this paper, we train a Data Manager (DataMan) to learn quality ratings and domain recognition from pointwise rating, and use it to annotate a 447B token pre-training corpus with 14 quality ratings and domain type. Our experiments validate our approach, using DataMan to select 30B tokens to train a 1.3B-parameter language model, demonstrating significant improvements in in-context learning (ICL), perplexity, and instruction-following ability over the state-of-the-art baseline. The best-performing model, based on the Overall Score l=5 surpasses a model trained with 50% more data using uniform sampling. We continue pre-training with high-rated, domain-specific data annotated by DataMan to enhance domain-specific ICL performance and thus verify DataMan's domain mixing ability. Our findings emphasize the importance of quality ranking, the complementary nature of quality criteria, and their low correlation with perplexity, analyzing misalignment between PPL and ICL performance. We also thoroughly analyzed our pre-training dataset, examining its composition, the distribution of quality ratings, and the original document sources.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, o1-like models have drawn significant attention, where these models produce the long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning steps to improve the reasoning abilities of existing Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, to understand the qualities of these long CoTs and measure the critique abilities of existing LLMs on these long CoTs, we introduce the DeltaBench, including the generated long CoTs from different o1-like models (e.g., QwQ, DeepSeek-R1) for different reasoning tasks (e.g., Math, Code, General Reasoning), to measure the ability to detect errors in long CoT reasoning. Based on DeltaBench, we first perform fine-grained analysis of the generated long CoTs to discover the effectiveness and efficiency of different o1-like models. Then, we conduct extensive evaluations of existing process reward models (PRMs) and critic models to detect the errors of each annotated process, which aims to investigate the boundaries and limitations of existing PRMs and critic models. Finally, we hope that DeltaBench could guide developers to better understand the long CoT reasoning abilities of their models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multi-task trade-offs in machine learning can be addressed via Pareto Front Learning (PFL) methods that parameterize the Pareto Front (PF) with a single model. PFL permits to select the desired operational point during inference, contrary to traditional Multi-Task Learning (MTL) that optimizes for a single trade-off decided prior to training. However, recent PFL methodologies suffer from limited scalability, slow convergence, and excessive memory requirements, while exhibiting inconsistent mappings from preference to objective space. We introduce PaLoRA, a novel parameter-efficient method that addresses these limitations in two ways. First, we augment any neural network architecture with task-specific low-rank adapters and continuously parameterize the PF in their convex hull. Our approach steers the original model and the adapters towards learning general and task-specific features, respectively. Second, we propose a deterministic sampling schedule of preference vectors that reinforces this division of labor, enabling faster convergence and strengthening the validity of the mapping from preference to objective space throughout training. Our experiments show that PaLoRA outperforms state-of-the-art MTL and PFL baselines across various datasets, scales to large networks, reducing the memory overhead $23.8-31.7$ times compared with competing PFL baselines in scene understanding benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present Deep Compression Autoencoder (DC-AE), a new family of autoencoder models for accelerating high-resolution diffusion models. Existing autoencoder models have demonstrated impressive results at a moderate spatial compression ratio (e.g., 8x), but fail to maintain satisfactory reconstruction accuracy for high spatial compression ratios (e.g., 64x). We address this challenge by introducing two key techniques: (1) Residual Autoencoding, where we design our models to learn residuals based on the space-to-channel transformed features to alleviate the optimization difficulty of high spatial-compression autoencoders; (2) Decoupled High-Resolution Adaptation, an efficient decoupled three-phases training strategy for mitigating the generalization penalty of high spatial-compression autoencoders. With these designs, we improve the autoencoder's spatial compression ratio up to 128 while maintaining the reconstruction quality. Applying our DC-AE to latent diffusion models, we achieve significant speedup without accuracy drop. For example, on ImageNet 512x512, our DC-AE provides 19.1x inference speedup and 17.9x training speedup on H100 GPU for UViT-H while achieving a better FID, compared with the widely used SD-VAE-f8 autoencoder.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Data from the ongoing \textit{Euclid} survey will map out billions of galaxies in the Universe, covering more than a third of the sky. This data will provide a wealth of information about the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe and will have a significant impact on cosmology in the coming years. In this paper, we introduce an emulator-based halo model approach to forward model the relationship between cosmological parameters and the projected galaxy-galaxy two-point correlation function (2PCF). Utilizing the large \textsc{AbacusSummit} simulation suite, we emulate the 2PCF by generating mock-galaxy catalogues within the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) framework. Our emulator is designed to predict the 2PCF over scales $0.1 \leq r / (h^{-1}\text{Mpc}) \leq 105$, from which we derive the projected correlation function, independent of redshift space distortions. We demonstrate that the emulator accurately predicts the projected correlation function over scales $0.5 \leq r_\perp/(h^{-1}\text{Mpc}) \leq 40$, given a set of cosmological and HOD parameters. This model is then employed in a parameter inference analysis, showcasing its ability to constrain cosmological parameters. Our findings indicate that while the projected correlation function places weak constraints on several cosmological parameters due to its intrinsic lack of information, additional clustering statistics are necessary to better probe the underlying cosmology. Despite the simplified covariance matrix used in the likelihood model, the posterior distributions of several cosmological parameters remain broad, underscoring the need for a more comprehensive approach.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces the counter-intuitive generalization results of overfitting pre-trained large language models (LLMs) on very small datasets. In the setting of open-ended text generation, it is well-documented that LLMs tend to generate repetitive and dull sequences, a phenomenon that is especially apparent when generating using greedy decoding. This issue persists even with state-of-the-art LLMs containing billions of parameters, trained via next-token prediction on large datasets. We find that by further fine-tuning these models to achieve a near-zero training loss on a small set of samples -- a process we refer to as hyperfitting -- the long-sequence generative capabilities are greatly enhanced. Greedy decoding with these Hyperfitted models even outperform Top-P sampling over long-sequences, both in terms of diversity and human preferences. This phenomenon extends to LLMs of various sizes, different domains, and even autoregressive image generation. We further find this phenomena to be distinctly different from that of Grokking and double descent. Surprisingly, our experiments indicate that hyperfitted models rarely fall into repeating sequences they were trained on, and even explicitly blocking these sequences results in high-quality output. All hyperfitted models produce extremely low-entropy predictions, often allocating nearly all probability to a single token.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantization and pruning are fundamental approaches for model compression, enabling efficient inference for language models. In a post-training setting, state-of-the-art quantization and pruning methods require calibration data, a small set of unlabeled examples. Conventionally, this is randomly sampled web text, aiming to reflect the model training data. However, this poses two key problems: (1) unrepresentative calibration examples can harm model performance, and (2) organizations increasingly avoid releasing model training data. In this paper, we propose self-calibration as a solution. Our approach requires no external data, instead leveraging the model itself to generate synthetic calibration data, with a view to better approximating the pre-training data distribution. We extensively compare the performance of self-calibration with several baselines, across a variety of models, compression methods, and tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing computational demands of transformer models in time series classification necessitate effective optimization strategies for energy-efficient deployment. This paper presents a systematic investigation of optimization techniques, focusing on structured pruning and quantization methods for transformer architectures. Through extensive experimentation on three distinct datasets (RefrigerationDevices, ElectricDevices, and PLAID), we quantitatively evaluate model performance and energy efficiency across different transformer configurations. Our experimental results demonstrate that static quantization reduces energy consumption by 29.14% while maintaining classification performance, and L1 pruning achieves a 63% improvement in inference speed with minimal accuracy degradation. These findings provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of optimization strategies for transformer-based time series classification, establishing a foundation for efficient model deployment in resource-constrained environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LLMs are not generally able to adjust the length of their outputs based on strict length requirements, a capability that would improve their usefulness in applications that require adherence to diverse user and system requirements. We present an approach to train LLMs to acquire this capability by augmenting existing data and applying existing fine-tuning techniques, which we compare based on the trained models' adherence to the length requirement and overall response quality relative to the baseline model. Our results demonstrate that these techniques can be successfully applied to train LLMs to adhere to length requirements, with the trained models generating texts which better align to the length requirements. Our results indicate that our method may change the response quality when using training data that was not generated by the baseline model. This allows simultaneous alignment to another training objective in certain scenarios, but is undesirable otherwise. Training on a dataset containing the model's own responses eliminates this issue.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Disentangling polysemantic neurons is at the core of many current approaches to interpretability of large language models. Here we attempt to study how disentanglement can be used to understand performance, particularly under weight sparsity, a leading post-training optimization technique. We suggest a novel measure for estimating neuronal entanglement: the Wasserstein distance of a neuron's output distribution to a Gaussian. Moreover, we show the existence of a small number of highly entangled "Wasserstein Neurons" in each linear layer of an LLM, characterized by their highly non-Gaussian output distributions, their role in mapping similar inputs to dissimilar outputs, and their significant impact on model accuracy. To study these phenomena, we propose a new experimental framework for disentangling polysemantic neurons. Our framework separates each layer's inputs to create a mixture of experts where each neuron's output is computed by a mixture of neurons of lower Wasserstein distance, each better at maintaining accuracy when sparsified without retraining. We provide strong evidence that this is because the mixture of sparse experts is effectively disentangling the input-output relationship of individual neurons, in particular the difficult Wasserstein neurons.

As digital content continues to grow rapidly and the demand for effective information retrieval increases, text summarization has become a focal point of research in recent years. This study offers a thorough evaluation of four leading pre-trained and open-source large language models: BART, FLAN-T5, LLaMA-3-8B, and Gemma-7B, across five diverse datasets CNN/DM, Gigaword, News Summary, XSum, and BBC News. The evaluation employs widely recognized automatic metrics, including ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, BERTScore, and METEOR, to assess the models' capabilities in generating coherent and informative summaries. The results reveal the comparative strengths and limitations of these models in processing various text types.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reward models (RMs) are crucial for the training and inference-time scaling up of large language models (LLMs). However, existing reward models primarily focus on human preferences, neglecting verifiable correctness signals which have shown strong potential in training LLMs. In this paper, we propose agentic reward modeling, a reward system that combines reward models with verifiable correctness signals from different aspects to provide reliable rewards. We empirically implement a reward agent, named RewardAgent, that combines human preference rewards with two verifiable signals: factuality and instruction following, to provide more reliable rewards. We conduct comprehensive experiments on existing reward model benchmarks and inference time best-of-n searches on real-world downstream tasks. RewardAgent significantly outperforms vanilla reward models, demonstrating its effectiveness. We further construct training preference pairs using RewardAgent and train an LLM with the DPO objective, achieving superior performance on various NLP benchmarks compared to conventional reward models. Our codes are publicly released to facilitate further research (https://github.com/THU-KEG/Agentic-Reward-Modeling).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are often deployed to perform constrained tasks, with narrow domains. For example, customer support bots can be built on top of LLMs, relying on their broad language understanding and capabilities to enhance performance. However, these LLMs are adversarially susceptible, potentially generating outputs outside the intended domain. To formalize, assess, and mitigate this risk, we introduce domain certification; a guarantee that accurately characterizes the out-of-domain behavior of language models. We then propose a simple yet effective approach, which we call VALID that provides adversarial bounds as a certificate. Finally, we evaluate our method across a diverse set of datasets, demonstrating that it yields meaningful certificates, which bound the probability of out-of-domain samples tightly with minimum penalty to refusal behavior.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present the first measurement of the missing energy due to nuclear effects in monoenergetic, muon neutrino charged-current interactions on carbon, originating from $K^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ \nu_\mu$ decay at rest ($E_{\nu_\mu}=235.5$ MeV), performed with the J-PARC Sterile Neutrino Search at the J-PARC Spallation Neutron Source liquid scintillator based experiment. Toward characterizing the neutrino interaction, ostensibly $\nu_\mu n \rightarrow \mu^- p$ or $\nu_\mu$$^{12}\mathrm{C}$ $\rightarrow \mu^-$$^{12}\mathrm{N}$, we define the missing energy as the energy transferred to the nucleus ($\omega$) minus the kinetic energy of the outgoing proton(s), $E_{m} \equiv\omega-\sum T_p$, and relate this to visible energy in the detector, $E_{m}=E_{\nu_\mu} (235.5 \mathrm{MeV})-m_\mu (105.7 \mathrm{MeV}) + [m_n-m_p (1.3 \mathrm{MeV})] - E_{\mathrm{vis}}$. The missing energy, which is naively expected to be zero in the absence of nuclear effects (e.g. nucleon separation energy, Fermi momenta, and final-state interactions), is uniquely sensitive to many aspects of the interaction, and has previously been inaccessible with neutrinos. The shape-only, differential cross section measurement reported, based on a $(77\pm3)$% pure double-coincidence kaon decay-at-rest signal (621 total events), provides detailed insight into neutrino-nucleus interactions, allowing even the nuclear orbital shell of the struck nucleon to be inferred. The measurement provides an important benchmark for models and event generators at hundreds of MeV neutrino energies, characterized by the difficult-to-model transition region between neutrino-nucleus and neutrino-nucleon scattering, and relevant for applications in nuclear physics, neutrino oscillation measurements,and Type-II supernova studies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Effective personalization of LLMs is critical for a broad range of user-interfacing applications such as virtual assistants and content curation. Inspired by the strong in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, we propose Few-Shot Preference Optimization (FSPO), which reframes reward modeling as a meta-learning problem. Under this framework, an LLM learns to quickly adapt to a user via a few labeled preferences from that user, constructing a personalized reward function for them. Additionally, since real-world preference data is scarce and challenging to collect at scale, we propose careful design choices to construct synthetic preference datasets for personalization, generating over 1M synthetic personalized preferences using publicly available LLMs. In particular, to successfully transfer from synthetic data to real users, we find it crucial for the data to exhibit both high diversity and coherent, self-consistent structure. We evaluate FSPO on personalized open-ended generation for up to 1,500 synthetic users across across three domains: movie reviews, pedagogical adaptation based on educational background, and general question answering, along with a controlled human study. Overall, FSPO achieves an 87% Alpaca Eval winrate on average in generating responses that are personalized to synthetic users and a 72% winrate with real human users in open-ended question answering.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) should undergo rigorous audits to identify potential risks, such as copyright and privacy infringements. Once these risks emerge, timely updates are crucial to remove undesirable responses, ensuring legal and safe model usage. It has spurred recent research into LLM unlearning, focusing on erasing targeted undesirable knowledge without compromising the integrity of other, non-targeted responses. Existing studies have introduced various unlearning objectives to pursue LLM unlearning without necessitating complete retraining. However, each of these objectives has unique properties, and no unified framework is currently available to comprehend them thoroughly. To fill the gap, we propose a toolkit of the gradient effect (G-effect), quantifying the impacts of unlearning objectives on model performance from a gradient perspective. A notable advantage is its broad ability to detail the unlearning impacts from various aspects across instances, updating steps, and LLM layers. Accordingly, the G-effect offers new insights into identifying drawbacks of existing unlearning objectives, further motivating us to explore a series of new solutions for their mitigation and improvements. Finally, we outline promising directions that merit further studies, aiming at contributing to the community to advance this important field.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models (LLMs) become more specialized, we envision a future where millions of expert LLMs exist, each trained on proprietary data and excelling in specific domains. In such a system, answering a query requires selecting a small subset of relevant models, querying them efficiently, and synthesizing their responses. This paper introduces a framework for agent-centric information access, where LLMs function as knowledge agents that are dynamically ranked and queried based on their demonstrated expertise. Unlike traditional document retrieval, this approach requires inferring expertise on the fly, rather than relying on static metadata or predefined model descriptions. This shift introduces several challenges, including efficient expert selection, cost-effective querying, response aggregation across multiple models, and robustness against adversarial manipulation. To address these issues, we propose a scalable evaluation framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation and clustering techniques to construct and assess thousands of specialized models, with the potential to scale toward millions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We consider enhancing large language models (LLMs) for complex planning tasks. While existing methods allow LLMs to explore intermediate steps to make plans, they either depend on unreliable self-verification or external verifiers to evaluate these steps, which demand significant data and computations. Here, we propose automated heuristics discovery (AutoHD), a novel approach that enables LLMs to explicitly generate heuristic functions to guide inference-time search, allowing accurate evaluation of intermediate states. These heuristic functions are further refined through a heuristic evolution process, improving their robustness and effectiveness. Our proposed method requires no additional model training or fine-tuning, and the explicit definition of heuristic functions generated by the LLMs provides interpretability and insights into the reasoning process. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate significant gains over multiple baselines, including nearly twice the accuracy on some datasets, establishing our approach as a reliable and interpretable solution for complex planning tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces the human-curated PandasPlotBench dataset, designed to evaluate language models' effectiveness as assistants in visual data exploration. Our benchmark focuses on generating code for visualizing tabular data - such as a Pandas DataFrame - based on natural language instructions, complementing current evaluation tools and expanding their scope. The dataset includes 175 unique tasks. Our experiments assess several leading Large Language Models (LLMs) across three visualization libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. We show that the shortening of tasks has a minimal effect on plotting capabilities, allowing for the user interface that accommodates concise user input without sacrificing functionality or accuracy. Another of our findings reveals that while LLMs perform well with popular libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, challenges persist with Plotly, highlighting areas for improvement. We hope that the modular design of our benchmark will broaden the current studies on generating visualizations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reward models (RMs) are a crucial component in the alignment of large language models' (LLMs) outputs with human values. RMs approximate human preferences over possible LLM responses to the same prompt by predicting and comparing reward scores. However, as they are typically modified versions of LLMs with scalar output heads, RMs are large black boxes whose predictions are not explainable. More transparent RMs would enable improved trust in the alignment of LLMs. In this work, we propose to use contrastive explanations to explain any binary response comparison made by an RM. Specifically, we generate a diverse set of new comparisons similar to the original one to characterise the RM's local behaviour. The perturbed responses forming the new comparisons are generated to explicitly modify manually specified high-level evaluation attributes, on which analyses of RM behaviour are grounded. In quantitative experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our method for finding high-quality contrastive explanations. We then showcase the qualitative usefulness of our method for investigating global sensitivity of RMs to each evaluation attribute, and demonstrate how representative examples can be automatically extracted to explain and compare behaviours of different RMs. We see our method as a flexible framework for RM explanation, providing a basis for more interpretable and trustworthy LLM alignment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-language models in pathology enable multimodal case retrieval and automated report generation. Many of the models developed so far, however, have been trained on pathology reports that include information which cannot be inferred from paired whole slide images (e.g., patient history), potentially leading to hallucinated sentences in generated reports. To this end, we investigate how the selection of information from pathology reports for vision-language modeling affects the quality of the multimodal representations and generated reports. More concretely, we compare a model trained on full reports against a model trained on preprocessed reports that only include sentences describing the cell and tissue appearances based on the H&E-stained slides. For the experiments, we built upon the BLIP-2 framework and used a cutaneous melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,433 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,636 corresponding pathology reports. Model performance was assessed using image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, as well as qualitative evaluation of the generated reports by an expert pathologist. Our results demonstrate that text preprocessing prevents hallucination in report generation. Despite the improvement in the quality of the generated reports, training the vision-language model on full reports showed better cross-modal retrieval performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Prompt engineering can significantly improve the performance of large language models (LLMs), with automated prompt optimization (APO) gaining significant attention due to the time-consuming and laborious nature of manual prompt design. However, much of the existing work in APO overlooks task-specific characteristics, resulting in prompts that lack domain specificity and are not well-suited for task-specific optimization. In this paper, we introduce TAPO, a multitask-aware prompt optimization framework composed of three key modules. First, a task-aware metric selection module is proposed to enhance task-specific prompt generation capabilities. Second, we present a multi-metrics evaluation module to jointly evaluate prompts from multiple perspectives. Third, an evolution-based optimization framework is introduced for automatic prompt refinement, which improves adaptability across various tasks. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and our code is publicly available.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains but remain susceptible to hallucinations and inconsistencies, limiting their reliability. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by grounding model responses in external knowledge sources. Existing RAG workflows often leverage a single vector database, which is impractical in the common setting where information is distributed across multiple repositories. We introduce RAGRoute, a novel mechanism for federated RAG search. RAGRoute dynamically selects relevant data sources at query time using a lightweight neural network classifier. By not querying every data source, this approach significantly reduces query overhead, improves retrieval efficiency, and minimizes the retrieval of irrelevant information. We evaluate RAGRoute using the MIRAGE and MMLU benchmarks and demonstrate its effectiveness in retrieving relevant documents while reducing the number of queries. RAGRoute reduces the total number of queries up to 77.5% and communication volume up to 76.2%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce ArtInsight, a novel AI-powered system to facilitate deeper engagement with child-created artwork in mixed visual-ability families. ArtInsight leverages large language models (LLMs) to craft a respectful and thorough initial description of a child's artwork, and provides: creative AI-generated descriptions for a vivid overview, audio recording to capture the child's own description of their artwork, and a set of AI-generated questions to facilitate discussion between blind or low-vision (BLV) family members and their children. Alongside ArtInsight, we also contribute a new rubric to score AI-generated descriptions of child-created artwork and an assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs. We evaluated ArtInsight with five groups of BLV family members and their children, and as a case study with one BLV child therapist. Our findings highlight a preference for ArtInsight's longer, artistically-tailored descriptions over those generated by existing BLV AI tools. Participants highlighted the creative description and audio recording components as most beneficial, with the former helping ``bring a picture to life'' and the latter centering the child's narrative to generate context-aware AI responses. Our findings reveal different ways that AI can be used to support art engagement, including before, during, and after interaction with the child artist, as well as expectations that BLV adults and their sighted children have about AI-powered tools.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mediation analysis for survival outcomes is challenging. Most existing methods quantify the treatment effect using the hazard ratio (HR) and attempt to decompose the HR into the direct effect of treatment plus an indirect, or mediated, effect. However, the HR is not expressible as an expectation, which complicates this decomposition, both in terms of estimation and interpretation. Here, we present an alternative approach which leverages pseudo-values to simplify estimation and inference. Pseudo-values take censoring into account during their construction, and once derived, can be modeled in the same way as any continuous outcome. Thus, pseudo-values enable mediation analysis for a survival outcome to fit seamlessly into standard mediation software (e.g. CMAverse in R). Pseudo-values are easy to calculate via a leave-one-observation-out procedure (i.e. jackknifing) and the calculation can be accelerated when the influence function of the estimator is known. Mediation analysis for causal effects defined by survival probabilities, restricted mean survival time, and cumulative incidence functions - in the presence of competing risks - can all be performed within this framework. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the method is unbiased across 324 scenarios/estimands and controls the type-I error at the nominal level under the null of no mediation. We illustrate the approach using data from the PARADIGMS clinical trial for the treatment of pediatric multiple sclerosis using fingolimod. In particular, we evaluate whether an imaging biomarker lies on the causal path between treatment and time-to-relapse, which aids in justifying this biomarker as a surrogate outcome. Our approach greatly simplifies mediation analysis for survival data and provides a decomposition of the total effect that is both intuitive and interpretable.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture reduces the training and inference cost significantly compared to a dense model of equivalent capacity. Upcycling is an approach that initializes and trains an MoE model using a pre-trained dense model. While upcycling leads to initial performance gains, the training progresses slower than when trained from scratch, leading to suboptimal performance in the long term. We propose Drop-Upcycling - a method that effectively addresses this problem. Drop-Upcycling combines two seemingly contradictory approaches: utilizing the knowledge of pre-trained dense models while statistically re-initializing some parts of the weights. This approach strategically promotes expert specialization, significantly enhancing the MoE model's efficiency in knowledge acquisition. Extensive large-scale experiments demonstrate that Drop-Upcycling significantly outperforms previous MoE construction methods in the long term, specifically when training on hundreds of billions of tokens or more. As a result, our MoE model with 5.9B active parameters achieves comparable performance to a 13B dense model in the same model family, while requiring approximately 1/4 of the training FLOPs. All experimental resources, including source code, training data, model checkpoints and logs, are publicly available to promote reproducibility and future research on MoE.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present Movie Gen, a cast of foundation models that generates high-quality, 1080p HD videos with different aspect ratios and synchronized audio. We also show additional capabilities such as precise instruction-based video editing and generation of personalized videos based on a user's image. Our models set a new state-of-the-art on multiple tasks: text-to-video synthesis, video personalization, video editing, video-to-audio generation, and text-to-audio generation. Our largest video generation model is a 30B parameter transformer trained with a maximum context length of 73K video tokens, corresponding to a generated video of 16 seconds at 16 frames-per-second. We show multiple technical innovations and simplifications on the architecture, latent spaces, training objectives and recipes, data curation, evaluation protocols, parallelization techniques, and inference optimizations that allow us to reap the benefits of scaling pre-training data, model size, and training compute for training large scale media generation models. We hope this paper helps the research community to accelerate progress and innovation in media generation models. All videos from this paper are available at https://go.fb.me/MovieGenResearchVideos.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Biophysical processes within living systems rely on encounters and interactions between molecules in complex environments such as cells. They are often described by anomalous diffusion transport. Recent advances in single-molecule microscopy and particle-tracking techniques have yielded an abundance of data in the form of videos and trajectories that contain critical information about these biologically significant processes. However, standard approaches for characterizing anomalous diffusion from these measurements often struggle in cases of practical interest, e.g. due to short, noisy trajectories. Fully exploiting this data therefore requires the development of advanced analysis methods -- a core goal at the heart of the recent international Anomalous Diffusion Challenges. Here, we introduce a novel machine-learning framework, U-net 3+ for Anomalous Diffusion analysis enhanced with Mixture Estimates (U-AnD-ME), that applies a U-Net 3+ based neural network alongside Gaussian mixture models to enable highly accurate characterisation of single-particle tracking data. In the 2024 Anomalous Diffusion Challenge, U-AnD-ME outperformed all other participating methods for the analysis of two-dimensional anomalous diffusion trajectories at both single-trajectory and ensemble levels. Using a large dataset inspired by the Challenge, we further characterize the performance of U-AnD-ME in segmenting trajectories and inferring anomalous diffusion properties.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We investigate whether the ultra high energy neutrino inferred by the recent KM3NeT observation could have originated from an evaporating black hole. Given the characteristics of black hole (BH) evaporation mechanism, any object capable of producing particles in the energy range of the detected event (around 100-800 PeV) must have a mass below 10^7 g. No known astrophysical mechanism can generate black holes of such low mass, leaving primordial black holes (PBHs)-potentially formed at the end of cosmic inflation-as the only viable candidates. Black holes with masses below 10^7 g have lifetimes shorter than 10^-5 seconds, meaning PBHs in this mass range should have fully evaporated by now. However, recent studies suggest that quantum effects, collectively referred to as the "memory burden", may slow down black hole evaporation, potentially extending the lifetimes of low-mass PBHs to timescales comparable to or exceeding the Hubble time. We systematically explore the parameter space of memory-burdened PBHs, assuming that they constitute a fraction of the dark matter (f-PBH) within current constraints, and identify viable regions that could explain the KM3-230213A event. We further predict the occurrence rate of similar events and find that KM3NeT's current configuration could test this scenario within a few years.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has heralded an inflection point that changed how society thinks about knowledge acquisition. While GAI cannot be fully trusted for decision-making, it may still provide valuable information that can be integrated into a decision pipeline. Rather than seeing the lack of certitude and inherent randomness of GAI as a problem, we view it as an opportunity. Indeed, variable answers to given prompts can be leveraged to construct a prior distribution which reflects assuredness of AI predictions. This prior distribution may be combined with tailored datasets for a fully Bayesian analysis with an AI-driven prior. In this paper, we explore such a possibility within a non-parametric Bayesian framework. The basic idea consists of assigning a Dirichlet process prior distribution on the data-generating distribution with AI generative model as its baseline. Hyper-parameters of the prior can be tuned out-of-sample to assess the informativeness of the AI prior. Posterior simulation is achieved by computing a suitably randomized functional on an augmented data that consists of observed (labeled) data as well as fake data whose labels have been imputed using AI. This strategy can be parallelized and rapidly produces iid samples from the posterior by optimization as opposed to sampling from conditionals. Our method enables (predictive) inference and uncertainty quantification leveraging AI predictions in a coherent probabilistic manner.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex reasoning scenarios. While preference optimization methods enhance reasoning performance through training, they often lack transparency in why one reasoning outcome is preferred over another. Verbal reflection techniques improve explainability but are limited in LLMs' critique and refinement capacity. To address these challenges, we introduce a contrastive reflection synthesis pipeline that enhances the accuracy and depth of LLM-generated reflections. We further propose a dual-model reasoning framework within a verbal reinforcement learning paradigm, decoupling inference-time self-reflection into specialized, trained models for reasoning critique and refinement. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms traditional preference optimization methods across all evaluation metrics. Our findings also show that "two heads are better than one", demonstrating that a collaborative Reasoner-Critic model achieves superior reasoning performance and transparency, compared to single-model approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Autonomous wire harness assembly requires robots to manipulate complex branched cables with high precision and reliability. A key challenge in automating this process is predicting how these flexible and branched structures behave under manipulation. Without accurate predictions, it is difficult for robots to reliably plan or execute assembly operations. While existing research has made progress in modeling single-threaded Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs), extending these approaches to Branched Deformable Linear Objects (BDLOs) presents fundamental challenges. The junction points in BDLOs create complex force interactions and strain propagation patterns that cannot be adequately captured by simply connecting multiple single-DLO models. To address these challenges, this paper presents Differentiable discrete branched Elastic rods for modeling Furcated DLOs in real-Time (DEFT), a novel framework that combines a differentiable physics-based model with a learning framework to: 1) accurately model BDLO dynamics, including dynamic propagation at junction points and grasping in the middle of a BDLO, 2) achieve efficient computation for real-time inference, and 3) enable planning to demonstrate dexterous BDLO manipulation. A comprehensive series of real-world experiments demonstrates DEFT's efficacy in terms of accuracy, computational speed, and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art alternatives.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We reanalyze the spectral lag data for GRB 160625B using frequentist inference in order to constrain the energy scale ($E_{QG}$) of Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV). For this purpose, we use profile likelihood to deal with the astrophysical nuisance parameters. This is in contrast to Bayesian inference implemented in previous works, where marginalization was carried out over the nuisance parameters. We show that with profile likelihood, we do not find a global minimum for $\chi^2$ as a function of $E_{QG}$ below the Planck scale for both linear and quadratic models of LIV, whereas bounded credible intervals were previously obtained using Bayesian inference. Therefore, we can set one-sided lower limits in a straightforward manner. We find that $E_{QG} \geq 2.55 \times 10^{16}$ GeV and $E_{QG} \geq 1.85 \times 10^7$ GeV at 95\% c.l., for linear and quadratic LIV, respectively. Therefore, this is the first proof-of-principles application of profile likelihood method to the analysis of GRB spectral lag data to constrain LIV.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The initiation of dose optimization has driven a paradigm shift in oncology clinical trials to determine the optimal biological dose (OBD). Early-phase trials with randomized doses can facilitate additional investigation of the identified OBD in targeted populations by incorporating safety, efficacy, and biomarker data. To support dose comparison in such settings, we propose to extend the utility score-based approach (U-MET) and introduce the clinical utility index-based approach (CUI-MET) to account for multiple endpoints and doses. The utility-based dose optimization approach for multiple-dose randomized trial designs accounting for multiple endpoints and doses (U-MET-m) extends the U-MET, using a utility score to account for multiple endpoints jointly (e.g., toxicity-efficacy trade-off), while the CUI-MET uses a utility index to do this marginally. U-MET-m and CUI-MET use Bayesian inference within a hypothesis framework to compare utility metrics across doses to identify the OBD. Here we describe simulation studies and present an example to compare the U-MET-m design, CUI-MET, and empirical design. The U-MET-m design and CUI-MET were shown to have satisfactory operating characteristics for selecting the OBD. Based on these findings, we recommend using the U-MET-m and CUI-MET designs as the primary dose comparison approach or as supportive evidence to select the OBD.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large-scale multilingual evaluations, such as MEGA, often include only a handful of African languages due to the scarcity of high-quality evaluation data and the limited discoverability of existing African datasets. This lack of representation hinders comprehensive LLM evaluation across a diverse range of languages and tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce AfroBench -- a multi-task benchmark for evaluating the performance of LLMs across 64 African languages, 15 tasks and 22 datasets. AfroBench consists of nine natural language understanding datasets, six text generation datasets, six knowledge and question answering tasks, and one mathematical reasoning task. We present results comparing the performance of prompting LLMs to fine-tuned baselines based on BERT and T5-style models. Our results suggest large gaps in performance between high-resource languages, such as English, and African languages across most tasks; but performance also varies based on the availability of monolingual data resources. Our findings confirm that performance on African languages continues to remain a hurdle for current LLMs, underscoring the need for additional efforts to close this gap.   https://mcgill-nlp.github.io/AfroBench/

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The success of the self-attention mechanism in classical machine learning models has inspired the development of quantum analogs aimed at reducing computational overhead. Self-attention integrates learnable query and key matrices to calculate attention scores between all pairs of tokens in a sequence. These scores are then multiplied by a learnable value matrix to obtain the output self-attention matrix, enabling the model to effectively capture long-range dependencies within the input sequence. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical self-attention mechanism as part of a transformer decoder, the architecture underlying large language models (LLMs). To demonstrate its utility in chemistry, we train this model on the QM9 dataset for conditional generation, using SMILES strings as input, each labeled with a set of physicochemical properties that serve as conditions during inference. Our theoretical analysis shows that the time complexity of the query-key dot product is reduced from $\mathcal{O}(n^2 d)$ in a classical model to $\mathcal{O}(n^2\log d)$ in our quantum model, where $n$ and $d$ represent the sequence length and embedding dimension, respectively. We perform simulations using NVIDIA's CUDA-Q platform, which is designed for efficient GPU scalability. This work provides a promising avenue for quantum-enhanced natural language processing (NLP).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The study explores whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit negation-induced forgetting (NIF), a cognitive phenomenon observed in humans where negating incorrect attributes of an object or event leads to diminished recall of this object or event compared to affirming correct attributes (Mayo et al., 2014; Zang et al., 2023). We adapted Zang et al. (2023) experimental framework to test this effect in ChatGPT-3.5, GPT-4o mini and Llama3-70b-instruct. Our results show that ChatGPT-3.5 exhibits NIF, with negated information being less likely to be recalled than affirmed information. GPT-4o-mini showed a marginally significant NIF effect, while LLaMA-3-70B did not exhibit NIF. The findings provide initial evidence of negation-induced forgetting in some LLMs, suggesting that similar cognitive biases may emerge in these models. This work is a preliminary step in understanding how memory-related phenomena manifest in LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively reduces hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) but can still produce inconsistent or unsupported content. Although LLM-as-a-Judge is widely used for RAG hallucination detection due to its implementation simplicity, it faces two main challenges: the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks and the lack of domain-optimized judge models. To bridge these gaps, we introduce \textbf{Bi'an}, a novel framework featuring a bilingual benchmark dataset and lightweight judge models. The dataset supports rigorous evaluation across multiple RAG scenarios, while the judge models are fine-tuned from compact open-source LLMs. Extensive experimental evaluations on Bi'anBench show our 14B model outperforms baseline models with over five times larger parameter scales and rivals state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs. We will release our data and models soon at https://github.com/OpenSPG/KAG.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A central aim in computational neuroscience is to relate the activity of large populations of neurons to an underlying dynamical system. Models of these neural dynamics should ideally be both interpretable and fit the observed data well. Low-rank recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit such interpretability by having tractable dynamics. However, it is unclear how to best fit low-rank RNNs to data consisting of noisy observations of an underlying stochastic system. Here, we propose to fit stochastic low-rank RNNs with variational sequential Monte Carlo methods. We validate our method on several datasets consisting of both continuous and spiking neural data, where we obtain lower dimensional latent dynamics than current state of the art methods. Additionally, for low-rank models with piecewise linear nonlinearities, we show how to efficiently identify all fixed points in polynomial rather than exponential cost in the number of units, making analysis of the inferred dynamics tractable for large RNNs. Our method both elucidates the dynamical systems underlying experimental recordings and provides a generative model whose trajectories match observed variability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Social media platforms frequently impose restrictive policies to moderate user content, prompting the emergence of creative evasion language strategies. This paper presents a multi-agent framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate the iterative evolution of language strategies under regulatory constraints. In this framework, participant agents, as social media users, continuously evolve their language expression, while supervisory agents emulate platform-level regulation by assessing policy violations. To achieve a more faithful simulation, we employ a dual design of language strategies (constraint and expression) to differentiate conflicting goals and utilize an LLM-driven GA (Genetic Algorithm) for the selection, mutation, and crossover of language strategies. The framework is evaluated using two distinct scenarios: an abstract password game and a realistic simulated illegal pet trade scenario. Experimental results demonstrate that as the number of dialogue rounds increases, both the number of uninterrupted dialogue turns and the accuracy of information transmission improve significantly. Furthermore, a user study with 40 participants validates the real-world relevance of the generated dialogues and strategies. Moreover, ablation studies validate the importance of the GA, emphasizing its contribution to long-term adaptability and improved overall results.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Trajectory inference seeks to recover the temporal dynamics of a population from snapshots of its (uncoupled) temporal marginals, i.e. where observed particles are not tracked over time. Prior works addressed this challenging problem under a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model with a gradient-driven drift in the observed space, introducing a minimum entropy estimator relative to the Wiener measure and a practical grid-free mean-field Langevin (MFL) algorithm using Schr\"odinger bridges. Motivated by the success of observable state space models in the traditional paired trajectory inference problem (e.g. target tracking), we extend the above framework to a class of latent SDEs in the form of observable state space models. In this setting, we use partial observations to infer trajectories in the latent space under a specified dynamics model (e.g. the constant velocity/acceleration models from target tracking). We introduce the PO-MFL algorithm to solve this latent trajectory inference problem and provide theoretical guarantees to the partially observed setting. Experiments validate the robustness of our method and the exponential convergence of the MFL dynamics, and demonstrate significant outperformance over the latent-free baseline in key scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in everyday applications, demanding robust general reasoning capabilities and diverse reasoning skillset. However, current LLM reasoning benchmarks predominantly focus on mathematical and coding abilities, leaving a gap in evaluating broader reasoning proficiencies. One particular exception is the BIG-Bench dataset, which has served as a crucial benchmark for evaluating the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs, thanks to its diverse set of challenging tasks that allowed for a comprehensive assessment of general reasoning across various skills within a unified framework. However, recent advances in LLMs have led to saturation on BIG-Bench, and its harder version BIG-Bench Hard (BBH). State-of-the-art models achieve near-perfect scores on many tasks in BBH, thus diminishing its utility. To address this limitation, we introduce BIG-Bench Extra Hard (BBEH), a new benchmark designed to push the boundaries of LLM reasoning evaluation. BBEH replaces each task in BBH with a novel task that probes a similar reasoning capability but exhibits significantly increased difficulty. We evaluate various models on BBEH and observe a (harmonic) average accuracy of 9.8\% for the best general-purpose model and 44.8\% for the best reasoning-specialized model, indicating substantial room for improvement and highlighting the ongoing challenge of achieving robust general reasoning in LLMs. We release BBEH publicly at: https://github.com/google-deepmind/bbeh.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable success in natural language processing (NLP). In practical scenarios like recommendations, as users increasingly seek personalized experiences, it becomes crucial to incorporate user interaction history into the context of LLMs to enhance personalization. However, from a practical utility perspective, user interactions' extensive length and noise present challenges when used directly as text prompts. A promising solution is to compress and distill interactions into compact embeddings, serving as soft prompts to assist LLMs in generating personalized responses. Although this approach brings efficiency, a critical concern emerges: Can user embeddings adequately capture valuable information and prompt LLMs? To address this concern, we propose \name, a benchmark designed to evaluate the effectiveness of user embeddings in prompting LLMs for personalization. We establish a fair and standardized evaluation process, encompassing pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluation stages. To thoroughly evaluate user embeddings, we design three dimensions of tasks: sequence understanding, action prediction, and interest perception. These evaluation tasks cover the industry's demands in traditional recommendation tasks, such as improving prediction accuracy, and its aspirations for LLM-based methods, such as accurately understanding user interests and enhancing the user experience. We conduct extensive experiments on various state-of-the-art methods for modeling user embeddings. Additionally, we reveal the scaling laws of leveraging user embeddings to prompt LLMs. The benchmark is available online.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Differential Diagnosis (DDx) is a fundamental yet complex aspect of clinical decision-making, in which physicians iteratively refine a ranked list of possible diseases based on symptoms, antecedents, and medical knowledge. While recent advances in large language models have shown promise in supporting DDx, existing approaches face key limitations, including single-dataset evaluations, isolated optimization of components, unrealistic assumptions about complete patient profiles, and single-attempt diagnosis. We introduce a Modular Explainable DDx Agent (MEDDxAgent) framework designed for interactive DDx, where diagnostic reasoning evolves through iterative learning, rather than assuming a complete patient profile is accessible. MEDDxAgent integrates three modular components: (1) an orchestrator (DDxDriver), (2) a history taking simulator, and (3) two specialized agents for knowledge retrieval and diagnosis strategy. To ensure robust evaluation, we introduce a comprehensive DDx benchmark covering respiratory, skin, and rare diseases. We analyze single-turn diagnostic approaches and demonstrate the importance of iterative refinement when patient profiles are not available at the outset. Our broad evaluation demonstrates that MEDDxAgent achieves over 10% accuracy improvements in interactive DDx across both large and small LLMs, while offering critical explainability into its diagnostic reasoning process.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The transformer architecture predominates across various models. As the heart of the transformer, attention has a computational complexity of O(N^2), compared to O(N) for linear transformations. When handling large sequence lengths, attention becomes the primary time-consuming component. Although quantization has proven to be an effective method for accelerating model inference, existing quantization methods primarily focus on optimizing the linear layer. In response, we first analyze the feasibility of quantization in attention detailedly. Following that, we propose SageAttention, a highly efficient and accurate quantization method for attention. The OPS (operations per second) of our approach outperforms FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 2.1 times and 2.7 times, respectively. SageAttention also achieves superior accuracy performance over FlashAttention3. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our approach incurs almost no end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models, including those for large language processing, image generation, and video generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining momentum in software development with prompt-driven programming enabling developers to create code from natural language (NL) instructions. However, studies have questioned their ability to produce secure code and, thereby, the quality of prompt-generated software. Alongside, various prompting techniques that carefully tailor prompts have emerged to elicit optimal responses from LLMs. Still, the interplay between such prompting strategies and secure code generation remains under-explored and calls for further investigations. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigate the impact of different prompting techniques on the security of code generated from NL instructions by LLMs. METHOD: First we perform a systematic literature review to identify the existing prompting techniques that can be used for code generation tasks. A subset of these techniques are evaluated on GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 models for secure code generation. For this, we used an existing dataset consisting of 150 NL security-relevant code-generation prompts. RESULTS: Our work (i) classifies potential prompting techniques for code generation (ii) adapts and evaluates a subset of the identified techniques for secure code generation tasks and (iii) observes a reduction in security weaknesses across the tested LLMs, especially after using an existing technique called Recursive Criticism and Improvement (RCI), contributing valuable insights to the ongoing discourse on LLM-generated code security.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), fully fine-tuning (FT) these models has become increasingly impractical due to the high computational demands. Additionally, FT can lead to catastrophic forgetting. As an alternative, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been proposed, which fine-tunes only a small subset of parameters, achieving similar performance to FT while significantly reducing resource requirements. However, since LoRA inherits FT's design, the issue of catastrophic forgetting remains.   To address these challenges, we propose SECURA: Sigmoid-Enhanced CUR Decomposition LoRA, a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) variant that mitigates catastrophic forgetting while improving fine-tuning performance. Our method introduces a new normalization technique, SigNorm, to enhance parameter retention and overall performance.   SECURA has been evaluated on a variety of tasks, including mathematical problem-solving (GSM8K), challenging question-answering (CNNDM), translation (NewsDE), and complex multiple-choice reasoning (LogiQA). Experimental results show that SECURA achieves an average fine-tuning improvement of 3.59% across four multiple-choice question (MCQ) tasks and a 2.51% improvement across five question-answering (QA) tasks on models such as Gemma2 2b, Qwen2 1.5b, Qwen 2 7b, Llama3 8b, and Llama3.1 8b, compared to DoRA. Moreover, SECURA demonstrates superior knowledge retention capabilities, maintaining more than 70% accuracy on basic LLM knowledge across 16 continual learning tests, outperforming Experience Replay (ER), Sequential Learning (SEQ), EWC, I-LoRA, and CUR-LoRA.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Embedding models play a crucial role in representing and retrieving information across various NLP applications. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have further enhanced the performance of embedding models. While these models are often benchmarked on general-purpose datasets, real-world applications demand domain-specific evaluation. In this work, we introduce the Finance Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (FinMTEB), a specialized counterpart to MTEB designed for the financial domain. FinMTEB comprises 64 financial domain-specific embedding datasets across 7 tasks that cover diverse textual types in both Chinese and English, such as financial news articles, corporate annual reports, ESG reports, regulatory filings, and earnings call transcripts. We also develop a finance-adapted model, Fin-E5, using a persona-based data synthetic method to cover diverse financial embedding tasks for training. Through extensive evaluation of 15 embedding models, including Fin-E5, we show three key findings: (1) performance on general-purpose benchmarks shows limited correlation with financial domain tasks; (2) domain-adapted models consistently outperform their general-purpose counterparts; and (3) surprisingly, a simple Bag-of-Words (BoW) approach outperforms sophisticated dense embeddings in financial Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks, underscoring current limitations in dense embedding techniques. Our work establishes a robust evaluation framework for financial NLP applications and provides crucial insights for developing domain-specific embedding models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Photoplethysmography (PPG)-based blood pressure (BP) estimation represents a promising alternative to cuff-based BP measurements. Recently, an increasing number of deep learning models have been proposed to infer BP from the raw PPG waveform. However, these models have been predominantly evaluated on in-distribution test sets, which immediately raises the question of the generalizability of these models to external datasets. To investigate this question, we trained five deep learning models on the recently released PulseDB dataset, provided in-distribution benchmarking results on this dataset, and then assessed out-of-distribution performance on several external datasets. The best model (XResNet1d101) achieved in-distribution MAEs of 9.4 and 6.0 mmHg for systolic and diastolic BP respectively on PulseDB (with subject-specific calibration), and 14.0 and 8.5 mmHg respectively without calibration. Equivalent MAEs on external test datasets without calibration ranged from 15.0 to 25.1 mmHg (SBP) and 7.0 to 10.4 mmHg (DBP). Our results indicate that the performance is strongly influenced by the differences in BP distributions between datasets. We investigated a simple way of improving performance through sample-based domain adaptation and put forward recommendations for training models with good generalization properties. With this work, we hope to educate more researchers for the importance and challenges of out-of-distribution generalization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), the demand for robust instruction-following capabilities in code generation tasks has grown significantly. Code generation not only facilitates faster prototyping and automated testing, but also augments developer efficiency through improved maintainability and reusability of code. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess the abilities of LLMs to adhere to task-oriented instructions within diverse code generation scenarios. CodeIF encompasses a broad range of tasks, including function synthesis, error debugging, algorithmic refactoring, and code explanation, thereby providing a comprehensive suite to evaluate model performance across varying complexity levels and programming domains. We conduct extensive experiments with LLMs, analyzing their strengths and limitations in meeting the demands of these tasks. The experimental results offer valuable insights into how well current models align with human instructions, as well as the extent to which they can generate consistent, maintainable, and contextually relevant code. Our findings not only underscore the critical role that instruction-following LLMs can play in modern software development, but also illuminate pathways for future research aimed at enhancing their adaptability, reliability, and overall effectiveness in automated code generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Test-time computing approaches, which leverage additional computational resources during inference, have been proven effective in enhancing large language model performance. This work introduces a novel, linearly scaling approach, TestNUC, that improves test-time predictions by leveraging the local consistency of neighboring unlabeled data-it classifies an input instance by considering not only the model's prediction on that instance but also on neighboring unlabeled instances. We evaluate TestNUC across eight diverse datasets, spanning intent classification, topic mining, domain discovery, and emotion detection, demonstrating its consistent superiority over baseline methods such as standard prompting and self-consistency. Furthermore, TestNUC can be seamlessly integrated with existing test-time computing approaches, substantially boosting their performance. Our analysis reveals that TestNUC scales effectively with increasing amounts of unlabeled data and performs robustly across different embedding models, making it practical for real-world applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Social categories and stereotypes are embedded in language and can introduce data bias into Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite safeguards, these biases often persist in model behavior, potentially leading to representational harm in outputs. While sociolinguistic research provides valuable insights into the formation of stereotypes, NLP approaches for stereotype detection rarely draw on this foundation and often lack objectivity, precision, and interpretability. To fill this gap, in this work we propose a new approach that detects and quantifies the linguistic indicators of stereotypes in a sentence. We derive linguistic indicators from the Social Category and Stereotype Communication (SCSC) framework which indicate strong social category formulation and stereotyping in language, and use them to build a categorization scheme. To automate this approach, we instruct different LLMs using in-context learning to apply the approach to a sentence, where the LLM examines the linguistic properties and provides a basis for a fine-grained assessment. Based on an empirical evaluation of the importance of different linguistic indicators, we learn a scoring function that measures the linguistic indicators of a stereotype. Our annotations of stereotyped sentences show that these indicators are present in these sentences and explain the strength of a stereotype. In terms of model performance, our results show that the models generally perform well in detecting and classifying linguistic indicators of category labels used to denote a category, but sometimes struggle to correctly evaluate the associated behaviors and characteristics. Using more few-shot examples within the prompts, significantly improves performance. Model performance increases with size, as Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and GPT-4 achieve comparable results that surpass those of Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct, GPT-4-mini and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Compared to width-wise pruning, depth-wise pruning can significantly accelerate inference in resource-constrained scenarios. Howerver, treating the entire Transformer layer as the minimum pruning unit may degrade model performance by indiscriminately discarding the entire information of the layer. This paper reveals the "Patch-like" feature relationship between layers in large language models by analyzing the correlation of the outputs of different layers in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Building on this observation, we proposes a sliding layer merging method that dynamically selects and fuses consecutive layers from top to bottom according to a pre-defined similarity threshold, thereby simplifying the model structure while maintaining its performance. Extensive experiments on LLMs with various architectures and different parameter scales show that our method outperforms existing pruning techniques in both zero-shot inference performance and retraining recovery quality after pruning. In particular, in the experiment with 35\% pruning on the Vicuna-7B model, our method achieved a 1.654\% improvement in average performance on zero-shot tasks compared to the existing method. Moreover, we further reveal the potential of combining depth pruning with width pruning to enhance the pruning effect.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is widely used to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, it typically assumes homogeneous preferences across users, overlooking diverse human values and minority viewpoints. Although personalized preference learning addresses this by tailoring separate preferences for individual users, the field lacks standardized methods to assess its effectiveness. We present a multi-faceted evaluation framework that measures not only performance but also fairness, unintended effects, and adaptability across varying levels of preference divergence. Through extensive experiments comparing eight personalization methods across three preference datasets, we demonstrate that performance differences between methods could reach 36% when users strongly disagree, and personalization can introduce up to 20% safety misalignment. These findings highlight the critical need for holistic evaluation approaches to advance the development of more effective and inclusive preference learning systems.

However, the evaluation scores revealed in this way provide a little hint as to the bottleneck of the code generation -- whether LLMs are struggling with their problem-solving capability or language-coding capability. To answer this question, we construct PseudoEval, a multilingual code generation benchmark that provides a solution written in pseudocode as input. By doing so, the bottleneck of code generation in various programming languages could be isolated and identified. Our study yields several interesting findings. For example, we identify that the bottleneck of LLMs in Python programming is problem-solving, while Rust is struggling relatively more in language-coding. Also, our study indicates that problem-solving capability may transfer across programming languages, while language-coding needs more language-specific effort, especially for undertrained programming languages. Finally, we release the pipeline of constructing PseudoEval to facilitate the extension to existing benchmarks. PseudoEval is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PseudocodeACL25-7B74.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> How to align large language models (LLMs) with user preferences from a static general dataset has been frequently studied. However, user preferences are usually personalized, changing, and diverse regarding culture, values, or time. This leads to the problem that the actual user preferences often do not coincide with those trained by the model developers in the practical use of LLMs. Since we cannot collect enough data and retrain for every demand, researching efficient real-time preference adaptation methods based on the backbone LLMs during test time is important. To this end, we introduce Amulet, a novel, training-free framework that formulates the decoding process of every token as a separate online learning problem with the guidance of simple user-provided prompts, thus enabling real-time optimization to satisfy users' personalized preferences. To reduce the computational cost brought by this optimization process for each token, we additionally provide a closed-form solution for each iteration step of the optimization process, thereby reducing the computational time cost to a negligible level. The detailed experimental results demonstrate that Amulet can achieve significant performance improvements in rich settings with combinations of different LLMs, datasets, and user preferences, while maintaining acceptable computational efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent studies have indicated that Large Language Models (LLMs) harbor an inherent understanding of truthfulness, yet often fail to consistently express it and generate false statements. This gap between "knowing" and "telling" poses a challenge for ensuring the truthfulness of generated content. Inspired by recent work on the practice of encoding human-interpretable concepts linearly within large language models, we treat truthfulness as a specially linearly encoded concept within LLMs, and introduce Adaptive Activation Steering (ACT), a tuning-free method that adaptively shifts LLM's activations in the "truthful" direction during inference. ACT addresses diverse categories of hallucinations by utilizing diverse truthfulness-related steering vectors and adjusting the steering intensity adaptively. Applied as an add-on across various models, ACT significantly improves truthfulness in LLaMA ($\uparrow$ 142%), LLaMA2 ($\uparrow$ 24%), Alpaca ($\uparrow$ 36%), Vicuna ($\uparrow$ 28%), LLaMA2-Chat ($\uparrow$ 19%), and LLaMA3($\uparrow$ 34%). Furthermore, we verify ACT's scalability across larger models (13B, 33B, 65B), underscoring the adaptability of ACT to large-scale language models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We study behavior change-based visual risk object identification (Visual-ROI), a critical framework designed to detect potential hazards for intelligent driving systems. Existing methods often show significant limitations in spatial accuracy and temporal consistency, stemming from an incomplete understanding of scene affordance. For example, these methods frequently misidentify vehicles that do not impact the ego vehicle as risk objects. Furthermore, existing behavior change-based methods are inefficient because they implement causal inference in the perspective image space. We propose a new framework with a Bird's Eye View (BEV) representation to overcome the above challenges. Specifically, we utilize potential fields as scene affordance, involving repulsive forces derived from road infrastructure and traffic participants, along with attractive forces sourced from target destinations. In this work, we compute potential fields by assigning different energy levels according to the semantic labels obtained from BEV semantic segmentation. We conduct thorough experiments and ablation studies, comparing the proposed method with various state-of-the-art algorithms on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our results show a notable increase in spatial and temporal consistency, with enhancements of 20.3% and 11.6% on the RiskBench dataset, respectively. Additionally, we can improve computational efficiency by 88%. We achieve improvements of 5.4% in spatial accuracy and 7.2% in temporal consistency on the nuScenes dataset.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) offer automated refactorings to aid programmers in developing and maintaining software. However, implementing sound automated refactorings is challenging, as refactorings may inadvertently introduce name-binding errors or cause references to resolve to incorrect declarations. To address these issues, previous work by Sch\"afer et al. proposed replacing concrete references with locked references to separate binding preservation from transformation. Locked references vacuously resolve to a specific declaration, and after transformation must be replaced with concrete references that also resolve to that declaration. Synthesizing these references requires a faithful inverse of the name lookup functions of the underlying language.   Manually implementing such inverse lookup functions is challenging due to the complex name-binding features in modern programming languages. Instead, we propose to automatically derive this function from type system specifications written in the Statix meta-DSL. To guide the synthesis of qualified references we use scope graphs, which represent the binding structure of a program, to infer their names and discover their syntactic structure.   We evaluate our approach by synthesizing concrete references for locked references in 2528 Java, 196 ChocoPy, and 49 Featherweight Generic Java test programs. Our approach yields a principled language-parametric method for synthesizing references.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Hyperparameter optimization is critical in modern machine learning, requiring expert knowledge, numerous trials, and high computational and human resources. Despite the advancements in Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), challenges in terms of trial efficiency, setup complexity, and interoperability still persist. To address these issues, we introduce a novel paradigm leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate hyperparameter optimization across diverse machine learning tasks, which is named AgentHPO (short for LLM Agent-based Hyperparameter Optimization). Specifically, AgentHPO processes the task information autonomously, conducts experiments with specific hyperparameters (HPs), and iteratively optimizes them based on historical trials. This human-like optimization process largely reduces the number of required trials, simplifies the setup process, and enhances interpretability and user trust, compared to traditional AutoML methods. Extensive empirical experiments conducted on 12 representative machine-learning tasks indicate that AgentHPO not only matches but also often surpasses the best human trials in terms of performance while simultaneously providing explainable results. Further analysis sheds light on the strategies employed by the LLM in optimizing these tasks, highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability in various scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Human cognition excels at transcending sensory input and forming latent representations that structure our understanding of the world. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce chain-of-thought reasoning, they lack a principled framework to capture latent structures and model uncertainty, especially in compositional reasoning tasks. We propose Verbalized Probabilistic Graphical Modeling (vPGM), a Bayesian prompting framework that guides LLMs to simulate key principles of Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) in natural language. Unlike many traditional probabilistic methods requiring substantial domain expertise or specialized training, vPGM bypasses expert-driven model design, making it well-suited for scenarios with limited assumptions or scarce data. We evaluated our model on several compositional reasoning tasks, both close-ended and open-ended. Our results indicate that the model effectively enhances confidence calibration and text generation quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce ColaCare, a framework that enhances Electronic Health Record (EHR) modeling through multi-agent collaboration driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach seamlessly integrates domain-specific expert models with LLMs to bridge the gap between structured EHR data and text-based reasoning. Inspired by the Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) approach used in clinical settings, ColaCare employs two types of agents: DoctorAgents and a MetaAgent, which collaboratively analyze patient data. Expert models process and generate predictions from numerical EHR data, while LLM agents produce reasoning references and decision-making reports within the MDT-driven collaborative consultation framework. The MetaAgent orchestrates the discussion, facilitating consultations and evidence-based debates among DoctorAgents, simulating diverse expertise in clinical decision-making. We additionally incorporate the Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy (MSD) medical guideline within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module for medical evidence support, addressing the challenge of knowledge currency. Extensive experiments conducted on three EHR datasets demonstrate ColaCare's superior performance in clinical mortality outcome and readmission prediction tasks, underscoring its potential to revolutionize clinical decision support systems and advance personalized precision medicine.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents a novel framework, called PLANTOR (PLanning with Natural language for Task-Oriented Robots), that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Prolog-based knowledge management and planning for multi-robot tasks. The system employs a two-phase generation of a robot-oriented knowledge base, ensuring reusability and compositional reasoning, as well as a three-step planning procedure that handles temporal dependencies, resource constraints, and parallel task execution via mixed-integer linear programming. The final plan is converted into a Behaviour Tree for direct use in ROS2. We tested the framework in multi-robot assembly tasks within a block world and an arch-building scenario. Results demonstrate that LLMs can produce accurate knowledge bases with modest human feedback, while Prolog guarantees formal correctness and explainability. This approach underscores the potential of LLM integration for advanced robotics tasks requiring flexible, scalable, and human-understandable planning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Decomposition is a fundamental skill in algorithmic programming, requiring learners to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts. However, current self-study methods, such as browsing reference solutions or using LLM assistants, often provide excessive or generic assistance that misaligns with learners' decomposition strategies, hindering independent problem-solving and critical thinking. To address this, we introduce Decomposition Box (DBox), an interactive LLM-based system that scaffolds and adapts to learners' personalized construction of a step tree through a "learner-LLM co-decomposition" approach, providing tailored support at an appropriate level. A within-subjects study (N=24) found that compared to the baseline, DBox significantly improved learning gains, cognitive engagement, and critical thinking. Learners also reported a stronger sense of achievement and found the assistance appropriate and helpful for learning. Additionally, we examined DBox's impact on cognitive load, identified usage patterns, and analyzed learners' strategies for managing system errors. We conclude with design implications for future AI-powered tools to better support algorithmic programming education.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Inferring viscoelasticity parameters is a key challenge that often leads to non-unique solutions when fitting rheological data. In this context, we propose a machine learning approach that utilizes Bayesian optimization for parameter inference during curve-fitting processes. To fit a viscoelastic model to rheological data, the Bayesian optimization maps the parameter values to a given error function. It then exploits the mapped space to identify parameter combinations that minimize the error. We compare the Bayesian optimization results to traditional fitting routines and demonstrate that our approach finds the fitting parameters in a less or similar number of iterations. Furthermore, it also creates a "white-box" and supervised framework for parameter estimation in linear viscoelasticity modeling.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, theoretical results and simulation evidence have shown Bayesian additive regression trees to be a highly-effective method for nonparametric regression. Motivated by cost-effectiveness analyses in health economics, where interest lies in jointly modelling the costs of healthcare treatments and the associated health-related quality of life experienced by a patient, we propose a multivariate extension of BART which is applicable in regression analyses with several dependent outcome variables. Our framework allows for continuous or binary outcomes and overcomes some key limitations of existing multivariate BART models by allowing each individual response to be associated with different ensembles of trees, while still handling dependencies between the outcomes. In the case of continuous outcomes, our model is essentially a nonparametric version of seemingly unrelated regression. Likewise, our proposal for binary outcomes is a nonparametric generalisation of the multivariate probit model. We give suggestions for easily interpretable prior distributions, which allow specification of both informative and uninformative priors. We provide detailed discussions of MCMC sampling methods to conduct posterior inference. Our methods are implemented in the R package "subart". We showcase their performance through extensive simulation experiments and an application to an empirical case study from health economics. By also accommodating propensity scores in a manner befitting a causal analysis, we find substantial evidence for a novel trauma care intervention's cost-effectiveness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have risen significantly in popularity and are increasingly being adopted across multiple applications. These LLMs are heavily aligned to resist engaging in illegal or unethical topics as a means to avoid contributing to responsible AI harms. However, a recent line of attacks, known as jailbreaks, seek to overcome this alignment. Intuitively, jailbreak attacks aim to narrow the gap between what the model can do and what it is willing to do. In this paper, we introduce a novel jailbreak attack called Crescendo. Unlike existing jailbreak methods, Crescendo is a simple multi-turn jailbreak that interacts with the model in a seemingly benign manner. It begins with a general prompt or question about the task at hand and then gradually escalates the dialogue by referencing the model's replies progressively leading to a successful jailbreak. We evaluate Crescendo on various public systems, including ChatGPT, Gemini Pro, Gemini-Ultra, LlaMA-2 70b and LlaMA-3 70b Chat, and Anthropic Chat. Our results demonstrate the strong efficacy of Crescendo, with it achieving high attack success rates across all evaluated models and tasks. Furthermore, we present Crescendomation, a tool that automates the Crescendo attack and demonstrate its efficacy against state-of-the-art models through our evaluations. Crescendomation surpasses other state-of-the-art jailbreaking techniques on the AdvBench subset dataset, achieving 29-61% higher performance on GPT-4 and 49-71% on Gemini-Pro. Finally, we also demonstrate Crescendo's ability to jailbreak multimodal models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to align their responses with objective facts, resulting in the issue of factual hallucinations, which can be difficult to detect and mislead users without relevant knowledge. While post-training techniques have been employed to mitigate the issue, existing methods usually suffer from poor generalization and trade-offs in different capabilities. In this paper, we propose to address it by directly augmenting LLM's fundamental ability to precisely leverage its existing memory--the knowledge acquired from pre-training data. We introduce self-memory alignment (SMA), which fine-tunes the model on self-generated responses to precise and simple factual questions through preference optimization. Furthermore, we construct FactualBench, a comprehensive and precise factual QA dataset containing 181k Chinese data spanning 21 domains, to facilitate both evaluation and training. Extensive experiments show that SMA significantly improves LLMs' overall performance, with consistent enhancement across various benchmarks concerning factuality, as well as helpfulness and comprehensive skills.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The integration of multimodal Electronic Health Records (EHR) data has significantly advanced clinical predictive capabilities. Existing models, which utilize clinical notes and multivariate time-series EHR data, often fall short of incorporating the necessary medical context for accurate clinical tasks, while previous approaches with knowledge graphs (KGs) primarily focus on structured knowledge extraction. In response, we propose EMERGE, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) driven framework to enhance multimodal EHR predictive modeling. We extract entities from both time-series data and clinical notes by prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) and align them with professional PrimeKG, ensuring consistency. In addition to triplet relationships, we incorporate entities' definitions and descriptions for richer semantics. The extracted knowledge is then used to generate task-relevant summaries of patients' health statuses. Finally, we fuse the summary with other modalities using an adaptive multimodal fusion network with cross-attention. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets' in-hospital mortality and 30-day readmission tasks demonstrate the superior performance of the EMERGE framework over baseline models. Comprehensive ablation studies and analysis highlight the efficacy of each designed module and robustness to data sparsity. EMERGE contributes to refining the utilization of multimodal EHR data in healthcare, bridging the gap with nuanced medical contexts essential for informed clinical predictions. We have publicly released the code at https://github.com/yhzhu99/EMERGE.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Inference of the reproduction number through time is of vital importance during an epidemic outbreak. Typically, epidemiologists tackle this using observed prevalence or incidence data. However, prevalence and incidence data alone is often noisy or partial. Models can also have identifiability issues with determining whether a large amount of a small epidemic or a small amount of a large epidemic has been observed. Sequencing data however is becoming more abundant, so approaches which can incorporate genetic data are an active area of research. We propose using particle MCMC methods to infer the time-varying reproduction number from a combination of prevalence data reported at a set of discrete times and a dated phylogeny reconstructed from sequences. We validate our approach on simulated epidemics with a variety of scenarios. We then apply the method to real data sets of HIV-1 in North Carolina, USA and tuberculosis in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The models and algorithms are implemented in an open source R package called EpiSky which is available at https://github.com/alicia-gill/EpiSky.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning for Large Language Models (LLMs), its performance often falls short of Full Fine-Tuning (Full FT). Current methods optimize LoRA by initializing with static singular value decomposition (SVD) subsets, leading to suboptimal leveraging of pre-trained knowledge. Another path for improving LoRA is incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. However, weight misalignment and complex gradient dynamics make it challenging to adopt SVD prior to the LoRA MoE architecture. To mitigate these issues, we propose \underline{G}reat L\underline{o}R\underline{A} Mixture-of-Exper\underline{t} (GOAT), a framework that (1) adaptively integrates relevant priors using an SVD-structured MoE, and (2) aligns optimization with full fine-tuned MoE by deriving a theoretical scaling factor. We demonstrate that proper scaling, without modifying the architecture or training algorithms, boosts LoRA MoE's efficiency and performance. Experiments across 25 datasets, including natural language understanding, commonsense reasoning, image classification, and natural language generation, demonstrate GOAT's state-of-the-art performance, closing the gap with Full FT.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As industrial products become abundant and sophisticated, visual industrial defect detection receives much attention, including two-dimensional and three-dimensional visual feature modeling. Traditional methods use statistical analysis, abnormal data synthesis modeling, and generation-based models to separate product defect features and complete defect detection. Recently, the emergence of foundation models has brought visual and textual semantic prior knowledge. Many methods are based on foundation models (FM) to improve the accuracy of detection, but at the same time, increase model complexity and slow down inference speed. Some FM-based methods have begun to explore lightweight modeling ways, which have gradually attracted attention and deserve to be systematically analyzed. In this paper, we conduct a systematic survey with comparisons and discussions of foundation model methods from different aspects and briefly review non-foundation model (NFM) methods recently published. Furthermore, we discuss the differences between FM and NFM methods from training objectives, model structure and scale, model performance, and potential directions for future exploration. Through comparison, we find FM methods are more suitable for few-shot and zero-shot learning, which are more in line with actual industrial application scenarios and worthy of in-depth research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks, yet their ability to generate long-form content remains poorly understood and evaluated. Our analysis reveals that current LLMs struggle with length requirements and information density in long-text generation, with performance deteriorating as text length increases. To quantitively locate such a performance degradation and provide further insights on model development, we present LongEval, a benchmark that evaluates long-text generation through both direct and plan-based generation paradigms, inspired by cognitive and linguistic writing models. The comprehensive experiments in this work reveal interesting findings such as that while model size correlates with generation ability, the small-scale model (e.g., LongWriter), well-trained on long texts, has comparable performance.

This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating how language - along with social dynamics - influences opinion evolution through LODAS, a Language-Driven Opinion Dynamics Model for Agent-Based Simulations. The model simulates debates around the "Ship of Theseus" paradox, in which agents with discrete opinions interact with each other and evolve their opinions by accepting, rejecting, or ignoring the arguments presented. We study three different scenarios: balanced, polarized, and unbalanced opinion distributions. Agreeableness and sycophancy emerge as two main characteristics of LLM agents, and consensus around the presented statement emerges almost in any setting. Moreover, such AI agents are often producers of fallacious arguments in the attempt of persuading their peers and - for their complacency - they are also highly influenced by arguments built on logical fallacies. These results highlight the potential of this framework not only for simulating social dynamics but also for exploring from another perspective biases and shortcomings of LLMs, which may impact their interactions with humans.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance across numerous tasks. However, these advancements have predominantly benefited "first-class" languages such as English and Chinese, leaving many other languages underrepresented. This imbalance, while limiting broader applications, generates a natural preference ranking between languages, offering an opportunity to bootstrap the multilingual capabilities of LLM in a self-improving manner. Thus, we propose $\textit{Language Imbalance Driven Rewarding}$, where the inherent imbalance between dominant and non-dominant languages within LLMs is leveraged as a reward signal. Iterative DPO training demonstrates that this approach not only enhances LLM performance in non-dominant languages but also improves the dominant language's capacity, thereby yielding an iterative reward signal. Fine-tuning Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct over two iterations of this approach results in continuous improvements in multilingual performance across instruction-following and arithmetic reasoning tasks, evidenced by an average improvement of 7.46% win rate on the X-AlpacaEval leaderboard and 13.9% accuracy on the MGSM benchmark. This work serves as an initial exploration, paving the way for multilingual self-improvement of LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/ZNLP/Language-Imbalance-Driven-Rewarding

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have substantially evolved Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) capabilities, enabling systems that not only automate tasks but also leverage near-human reasoning capabilities. To achieve this, LLM-based MASs need to be built around two critical principles: (i) a robust architecture that fully exploits LLM potential for specific tasks -- or related task sets -- and ($ii$) an effective methodology for equipping LLMs with the necessary capabilities to perform tasks and manage information efficiently. It goes without saying that a priori architectural designs can limit the scalability and domain adaptability of a given MAS.   To address these challenges, in this paper we introduce Nexus: a lightweight Python framework designed to easily build and manage LLM-based MASs. Nexus introduces the following innovations: (i) a flexible multi-supervisor hierarchy, (ii) a simplified workflow design, and (iii) easy installation and open-source flexibility: Nexus can be installed via pip and is distributed under a permissive open-source license, allowing users to freely modify and extend its capabilities.   Experimental results demonstrate that architectures built with Nexus exhibit state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains. In coding tasks, Nexus-driven MASs achieve a 99% pass rate on HumanEval and a flawless 100% on VerilogEval-Human, outperforming cutting-edge reasoning language models such as o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1. Moreover, these architectures display robust proficiency in complex reasoning and mathematical problem solving, achieving correct solutions for all randomly selected problems from the MATH dataset. In the realm of multi-objective optimization, Nexus-based architectures successfully address challenging timing closure tasks on designs from the VTR benchmark suite, while guaranteeing, on average, a power saving of nearly 30%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Endoscopic video-based tasks, such as visual navigation and surgical phase recognition, play a crucial role in minimally invasive surgeries by providing real-time assistance. While recent video foundation models have shown promise, their applications are hindered by (1) computational inefficiencies and (2) suboptimal performance caused by limited data for pre-training in endoscopy. To address these issues, we present EndoMamba, a foundation model designed for real-time inference while learning generalized spatiotemporal representations. First, to mitigate computational inefficiencies, we propose the EndoMamba backbone, optimized for real-time inference. Inspired by recent advancements in state space models, EndoMamba integrates Bidirectional Mamba blocks for spatial modeling within individual frames and vanilla Mamba blocks for past-to-present reasoning across the temporal domain. This design enables both strong spatiotemporal modeling and efficient inference in online video streams. Second, we propose a self-supervised hierarchical pre-training diagram to enhance EndoMamba's representation learning using endoscopic videos and incorporating general video domain knowledge. Specifically, our approach combines masked reconstruction with auxiliary supervision, leveraging low-level reconstruction to capture spatial-temporal structures and high-level alignment to transfer broader knowledge from a pretrained general-video domain foundation model. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks--classification, segmentation, surgical phase recognition, and localization--demonstrate that EndoMamba outperforms existing foundation models and task-specific methods while maintaining real-time inference speed. The source code will be released upon acceptance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) systems are increasingly being deployed across diverse industries and research domains. Developers and end-users interact with these systems through the use of prompting and prompt engineering. Although prompt engineering is a widely adopted and extensively researched area, it suffers from conflicting terminology and a fragmented ontological understanding of what constitutes an effective prompt due to its relatively recent emergence. We establish a structured understanding of prompt engineering by assembling a taxonomy of prompting techniques and analyzing their applications. We present a detailed vocabulary of 33 vocabulary terms, a taxonomy of 58 LLM prompting techniques, and 40 techniques for other modalities. Additionally, we provide best practices and guidelines for prompt engineering, including advice for prompting state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs such as ChatGPT. We further present a meta-analysis of the entire literature on natural language prefix-prompting. As a culmination of these efforts, this paper presents the most comprehensive survey on prompt engineering to date.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This study investigates the impact of localized updates to large language models (LLMs), specifically in the context of knowledge editing - a task aimed at incorporating or modifying specific facts without altering broader model capabilities. We first show that across different post-training interventions like continuous pre-training, full fine-tuning and LORA-based fine-tuning, the Frobenius norm of the updated matrices always increases. This increasing norm is especially detrimental for localized knowledge editing, where only a subset of matrices are updated in a model . We reveal a consistent phenomenon across various editing techniques, including fine-tuning, hypernetwork-based approaches, and locate-and-edit methods: the norm of the updated matrix invariably increases with successive updates. Such growth disrupts model balance, particularly when isolated matrices are updated while the rest of the model remains static, leading to potential instability and degradation of downstream performance. Upon deeper investigations of the intermediate activation vectors, we find that the norm of internal activations decreases and is accompanied by shifts in the subspaces occupied by these activations, which shows that these activation vectors now occupy completely different regions in the representation space compared to the unedited model. With our paper, we highlight the technical challenges with continuous and localized sequential knowledge editing and their implications for maintaining model stability and utility.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Paywalls, licenses and copyright rules often restrict the broad dissemination and reuse of scientific knowledge. We take the position that it is both legally and technically feasible to extract the scientific knowledge in scholarly texts. Current methods, like text embeddings, fail to reliably preserve factual content, and simple paraphrasing may not be legally sound. We urge the community to adopt a new idea: convert scholarly documents into Knowledge Units using LLMs. These units use structured data capturing entities, attributes and relationships without stylistic content. We provide evidence that Knowledge Units: (1) form a legally defensible framework for sharing knowledge from copyrighted research texts, based on legal analyses of German copyright law and U.S. Fair Use doctrine, and (2) preserve most (~95%) factual knowledge from original text, measured by MCQ performance on facts from the original copyrighted text across four research domains. Freeing scientific knowledge from copyright promises transformative benefits for scientific research and education by allowing language models to reuse important facts from copyrighted text. To support this, we share open-source tools for converting research documents into Knowledge Units. Overall, our work posits the feasibility of democratizing access to scientific knowledge while respecting copyright.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the recent remarkable advancement of large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing interest in utilizing them in the domains with highly sensitive data that lies outside their training data. For this purpose, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is particularly effective -- it assists LLMs by directly providing relevant information from the external knowledge sources. However, without extra privacy safeguards, RAG outputs risk leaking sensitive information from the external data source. In this work, we explore RAG under differential privacy (DP), a formal guarantee of data privacy. The main challenge with differentially private RAG is how to generate long accurate answers within a moderate privacy budget. We address this by proposing an algorithm that smartly spends privacy budget only for the tokens that require the sensitive information and uses the non-private LLM for other tokens. Our extensive empirical evaluations reveal that our algorithm outperforms the non-RAG baseline under a reasonable privacy budget of $\epsilon\approx 10$ across different models and datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In large language models (LLMs), code and reasoning reinforce each other: code offers an abstract, modular, and logic-driven structure that supports reasoning, while reasoning translates high-level goals into smaller, executable steps that drive more advanced code intelligence. In this study, we examine how code serves as a structured medium for enhancing reasoning: it provides verifiable execution paths, enforces logical decomposition, and enables runtime validation. We also explore how improvements in reasoning have transformed code intelligence from basic completion to advanced capabilities, enabling models to address complex software engineering tasks through planning and debugging. Finally, we identify key challenges and propose future research directions to strengthen this synergy, ultimately improving LLM's performance in both areas.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in recommending everyday actions as personal AI assistants, while Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are being increasingly utilized to help users understand why a recommendation is given. Personal AI assistants today are often located on ultra-small devices such as smartwatches, which have limited screen space. The verbosity of LLM-generated explanations, however, makes it challenging to deliver glanceable LLM explanations on such ultra-small devices. To address this, we explored 1) spatially structuring an LLM's explanation text using defined contextual components during prompting and 2) presenting temporally adaptive explanations to users based on confidence levels. We conducted a user study to understand how these approaches impacted user experiences when interacting with LLM recommendations and explanations on ultra-small devices. The results showed that structured explanations reduced users' time to action and cognitive load when reading an explanation. Always-on structured explanations increased users' acceptance of AI recommendations. However, users were less satisfied with structured explanations compared to unstructured ones due to their lack of sufficient, readable details. Additionally, adaptively presenting structured explanations was less effective at improving user perceptions of the AI compared to the always-on structured explanations. Together with users' interview feedback, the results led to design implications to be mindful of when personalizing the content and timing of LLM explanations that are displayed on ultra-small devices.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Providing effective feedback for programming assignments in computer science education can be challenging: students solve problems by iteratively submitting code, executing it, and using limited feedback from the compiler or the auto-grader to debug. Analyzing student debugging behavior in this process may reveal important insights into their knowledge and inform better personalized support tools. In this work, we propose an encoder-decoder-based model that learns meaningful code-edit embeddings between consecutive student code submissions, to capture their debugging behavior. Our model leverages information on whether a student code submission passes each test case to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) to learn code editing representations. It enables personalized next-step code suggestions that maintain the student's coding style while improving test case correctness. Our model also enables us to analyze student code-editing patterns to uncover common student errors and debugging behaviors, using clustering techniques. Experimental results on a real-world student code submission dataset demonstrate that our model excels at code reconstruction and personalized code suggestion while revealing interesting patterns in student debugging behavior.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Machine learning programs, such as those performing inference, fine-tuning, and training of LLMs, are commonly delegated to untrusted compute providers. To provide correctness guarantees for the client, we propose adapting the cryptographic notion of refereed delegation to the machine learning setting. This approach enables a computationally limited client to delegate a program to multiple untrusted compute providers, with a guarantee of obtaining the correct result if at least one of them is honest. Refereed delegation of ML programs poses two technical hurdles: (1) an arbitration protocol to resolve disputes when compute providers disagree on the output, and (2) the ability to bitwise reproduce ML programs across different hardware setups, For (1), we design Verde, a dispute arbitration protocol that efficiently handles the large scale and graph-based computational model of modern ML programs. For (2), we build RepOps (Reproducible Operators), a library that eliminates hardware "non-determinism" by controlling the order of floating point operations performed on all hardware. Our implementation shows that refereed delegation achieves both strong guarantees for clients and practical overheads for compute providers.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive real-world utility, exemplifying artificial useful intelligence (AUI). However, their ability to reason adaptively and robustly -- the hallmarks of artificial general intelligence (AGI) -- remains fragile. While LLMs seemingly succeed in commonsense reasoning, programming, and mathematics, they struggle to generalize algorithmic understanding across novel contexts. Our experiments with algorithmic tasks in esoteric programming languages reveal that LLM's reasoning overfits to the training data and is limited in its transferability. We hypothesize that the core issue underlying such limited transferability is the coupling of reasoning and knowledge in LLMs.   To transition from AUI to AGI, we propose disentangling knowledge and reasoning through three key directions: (1) pretaining to reason using RL from scratch as an alternative to the widely used next-token prediction pretraining, (2) using a curriculum of synthetic tasks to ease the learning of a \textit{reasoning prior} for RL that can then be transferred to natural language tasks, and (3) learning more generalizable reasoning functions using a small context window to reduce exploiting spurious correlations between tokens. Such a reasoning system coupled with a trained retrieval system and a large external memory bank as a knowledge store can overcome several limitations of existing architectures at learning to reason in novel scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding domain-specific theorems often requires more than just text-based reasoning; effective communication through structured visual explanations is crucial for deeper comprehension. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance in text-based theorem reasoning, their ability to generate coherent and pedagogically meaningful visual explanations remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce TheoremExplainAgent, an agentic approach for generating long-form theorem explanation videos (over 5 minutes) using Manim animations. To systematically evaluate multimodal theorem explanations, we propose TheoremExplainBench, a benchmark covering 240 theorems across multiple STEM disciplines, along with 5 automated evaluation metrics. Our results reveal that agentic planning is essential for generating detailed long-form videos, and the o3-mini agent achieves a success rate of 93.8% and an overall score of 0.77. However, our quantitative and qualitative studies show that most of the videos produced exhibit minor issues with visual element layout. Furthermore, multimodal explanations expose deeper reasoning flaws that text-based explanations fail to reveal, highlighting the importance of multimodal explanations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown immense potential in enhancing various aspects of our daily lives, from conversational AI to search and AI assistants. However, their growing capabilities come at the cost of extremely large model sizes, making deployment on edge devices challenging due to memory and computational constraints. This paper introduces a novel approach to LLM weight pruning that directly optimizes for approximating the attention matrix, a core component of transformer architectures. Unlike existing methods that focus on linear approximations, our approach accounts for the non-linear nature of the Softmax attention mechanism. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of our Gradient Descent-based optimization method to a near-optimal pruning mask solution. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our non-linear pruning approach in maintaining model performance while significantly reducing computational costs, which is beyond the current state-of-the-art methods, i.e., SparseGPT and Wanda, by a large margin. This work establishes a new theoretical foundation for pruning algorithm design in LLMs, potentially paving the way for more efficient LLM inference on resource-constrained devices.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Training dense LLMs requires enormous amounts of data and centralized compute, which introduces fundamental bottlenecks and ever-growing costs for large models. Several studies aim to reduce this dependency on centralization by reducing the communication overhead of training dense models. Taking this idea of reducing communication overhead to a natural extreme, by training embarrassingly parallelizable ensembles of small independent experts, has been shown to outperform large dense models trained in traditional centralized settings. However, existing studies do not take into account underlying differences amongst data domains and treat them as monolithic, regardless of their underlying complexity, size, or distribution. In this paper, we explore the effects of introducing heterogeneity to these ensembles of domain expert models. Specifically, by allowing models within the ensemble to vary in size--as well as the number of training steps taken depending on the training data's domain--we study the effect heterogeneity has on these ensembles when evaluated against domains included in, and excluded from, the training set. We use the same compute budget to train heterogeneous ensembles and homogeneous baselines for comparison. We show that the heterogeneous ensembles achieve the lowest perplexity scores in $20$ out of the $21$ data domains used in the evaluation. Our code is available at https://github.com/gensyn-ai/hdee.

We introduce ARCON, a scheme that alternates between generating semantic and RGB tokens, allowing the LVM to explicitly learn high-level structural video information. We find high consistency in the RGB images and semantic maps generated without special design. Moreover, we employ an optical flow-based texture stitching method to enhance visual quality. Experiments in autonomous driving scenarios show that our model can consistently generate long videos.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable improvements in reasoning and many existing benchmarks have been addressed by models such as o1 and o3 either fully or partially. However, a majority of these benchmarks emphasize deductive reasoning, including mathematical and coding tasks in which rules such as mathematical axioms or programming syntax are clearly defined, based on which LLMs can plan and apply these rules to arrive at a solution. In contrast, inductive reasoning, where one infers the underlying rules from observed data, remains less explored. Such inductive processes lie at the heart of scientific discovery, as they enable researchers to extract general principles from empirical observations. To assess whether LLMs possess this capacity, we introduce InductionBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the inductive reasoning ability of LLMs. Our experimental findings reveal that even the most advanced models available struggle to master the simplest complexity classes within the subregular hierarchy of functions, highlighting a notable deficiency in current LLMs' inductive reasoning capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Instruction tuning has been widely adopted to ensure large language models (LLMs) follow user instructions effectively. The resulting instruction-following capabilities of LLMs heavily rely on the instruction datasets used for tuning. Recently, synthetic instruction datasets have emerged as an economically viable solution to provide LLMs diverse and high-quality instructions. However, existing approaches typically assume that larger or stronger models are stronger teachers for instruction tuning, and hence simply adopt these models as response generators to the synthetic instructions. In this paper, we challenge this commonly-adopted assumption. Our extensive experiments across five base models and twenty response generators reveal that larger and stronger models are not necessarily stronger teachers of smaller models. We refer to this phenomenon as the Larger Models' Paradox. We observe that existing metrics cannot precisely predict the effectiveness of response generators since they ignore the compatibility between teachers and base models being fine-tuned. We thus develop a novel metric, named as Compatibility-Adjusted Reward (CAR) to measure the effectiveness of response generators. Our experiments across five base models demonstrate that CAR outperforms almost all baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Unit tests (UTs) play an instrumental role in assessing code correctness as well as providing feedback to large language models (LLMs), motivating automated test generation. However, we uncover a trade-off between generating unit test inputs that reveal errors when given a faulty code and correctly predicting the unit test output without access to the gold solution. To address this trade-off, we propose UTGen, which teaches LLMs to generate unit test inputs that reveal errors along with their correct expected outputs based on task descriptions. Since model-generated tests can provide noisy signals (e.g., from incorrectly predicted outputs), we propose UTDebug that (i) scales UTGen via test-time compute to improve UT output prediction, and (ii) validates and backtracks edits based on multiple generated UTs to avoid overfitting, and helps LLMs debug effectively. We show that UTGen outperforms other LLM-based baselines by 7.59% based on a metric measuring the presence of both error-revealing UT inputs and correct UT outputs. When used with UTDebug, we find that feedback from UTGen's unit tests improves pass@1 accuracy of Qwen2.5 32B on HumanEvalFix and our own harder debugging split of MBPP+ by over 3.17% and 12.35% (respectively) over other LLM-based UT generation baselines. Lastly, we demonstrate that UTGen is a better judge for code correctness, outperforming a state-of-the-art trained 8B reward model by 4.43% on HumanEval+ with best-of-10 sampling using Qwen2.5 7B.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The performance emergence of large language models (LLMs) driven by data scaling laws makes the selection of pre-training data increasingly important. However, existing methods rely on limited heuristics and human intuition, lacking comprehensive and clear guidelines. To address this, we are inspired by ``reverse thinking'' -- prompting LLMs to self-identify which criteria benefit its performance. As its pre-training capabilities are related to perplexity (PPL), we derive 14 quality criteria from the causes of text perplexity anomalies and introduce 15 common application domains to support domain mixing. In this paper, we train a Data Manager (DataMan) to learn quality ratings and domain recognition from pointwise rating, and use it to annotate a 447B token pre-training corpus with 14 quality ratings and domain type. Our experiments validate our approach, using DataMan to select 30B tokens to train a 1.3B-parameter language model, demonstrating significant improvements in in-context learning (ICL), perplexity, and instruction-following ability over the state-of-the-art baseline. The best-performing model, based on the Overall Score l=5 surpasses a model trained with 50% more data using uniform sampling. We continue pre-training with high-rated, domain-specific data annotated by DataMan to enhance domain-specific ICL performance and thus verify DataMan's domain mixing ability. Our findings emphasize the importance of quality ranking, the complementary nature of quality criteria, and their low correlation with perplexity, analyzing misalignment between PPL and ICL performance. We also thoroughly analyzed our pre-training dataset, examining its composition, the distribution of quality ratings, and the original document sources.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, o1-like models have drawn significant attention, where these models produce the long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning steps to improve the reasoning abilities of existing Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, to understand the qualities of these long CoTs and measure the critique abilities of existing LLMs on these long CoTs, we introduce the DeltaBench, including the generated long CoTs from different o1-like models (e.g., QwQ, DeepSeek-R1) for different reasoning tasks (e.g., Math, Code, General Reasoning), to measure the ability to detect errors in long CoT reasoning. Based on DeltaBench, we first perform fine-grained analysis of the generated long CoTs to discover the effectiveness and efficiency of different o1-like models. Then, we conduct extensive evaluations of existing process reward models (PRMs) and critic models to detect the errors of each annotated process, which aims to investigate the boundaries and limitations of existing PRMs and critic models. Finally, we hope that DeltaBench could guide developers to better understand the long CoT reasoning abilities of their models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces the counter-intuitive generalization results of overfitting pre-trained large language models (LLMs) on very small datasets. In the setting of open-ended text generation, it is well-documented that LLMs tend to generate repetitive and dull sequences, a phenomenon that is especially apparent when generating using greedy decoding. This issue persists even with state-of-the-art LLMs containing billions of parameters, trained via next-token prediction on large datasets. We find that by further fine-tuning these models to achieve a near-zero training loss on a small set of samples -- a process we refer to as hyperfitting -- the long-sequence generative capabilities are greatly enhanced. Greedy decoding with these Hyperfitted models even outperform Top-P sampling over long-sequences, both in terms of diversity and human preferences. This phenomenon extends to LLMs of various sizes, different domains, and even autoregressive image generation. We further find this phenomena to be distinctly different from that of Grokking and double descent. Surprisingly, our experiments indicate that hyperfitted models rarely fall into repeating sequences they were trained on, and even explicitly blocking these sequences results in high-quality output. All hyperfitted models produce extremely low-entropy predictions, often allocating nearly all probability to a single token.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing computational demands of transformer models in time series classification necessitate effective optimization strategies for energy-efficient deployment. This paper presents a systematic investigation of optimization techniques, focusing on structured pruning and quantization methods for transformer architectures. Through extensive experimentation on three distinct datasets (RefrigerationDevices, ElectricDevices, and PLAID), we quantitatively evaluate model performance and energy efficiency across different transformer configurations. Our experimental results demonstrate that static quantization reduces energy consumption by 29.14% while maintaining classification performance, and L1 pruning achieves a 63% improvement in inference speed with minimal accuracy degradation. These findings provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of optimization strategies for transformer-based time series classification, establishing a foundation for efficient model deployment in resource-constrained environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LLMs are not generally able to adjust the length of their outputs based on strict length requirements, a capability that would improve their usefulness in applications that require adherence to diverse user and system requirements. We present an approach to train LLMs to acquire this capability by augmenting existing data and applying existing fine-tuning techniques, which we compare based on the trained models' adherence to the length requirement and overall response quality relative to the baseline model. Our results demonstrate that these techniques can be successfully applied to train LLMs to adhere to length requirements, with the trained models generating texts which better align to the length requirements. Our results indicate that our method may change the response quality when using training data that was not generated by the baseline model. This allows simultaneous alignment to another training objective in certain scenarios, but is undesirable otherwise. Training on a dataset containing the model's own responses eliminates this issue.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Disentangling polysemantic neurons is at the core of many current approaches to interpretability of large language models. Here we attempt to study how disentanglement can be used to understand performance, particularly under weight sparsity, a leading post-training optimization technique. We suggest a novel measure for estimating neuronal entanglement: the Wasserstein distance of a neuron's output distribution to a Gaussian. Moreover, we show the existence of a small number of highly entangled "Wasserstein Neurons" in each linear layer of an LLM, characterized by their highly non-Gaussian output distributions, their role in mapping similar inputs to dissimilar outputs, and their significant impact on model accuracy. To study these phenomena, we propose a new experimental framework for disentangling polysemantic neurons. Our framework separates each layer's inputs to create a mixture of experts where each neuron's output is computed by a mixture of neurons of lower Wasserstein distance, each better at maintaining accuracy when sparsified without retraining. We provide strong evidence that this is because the mixture of sparse experts is effectively disentangling the input-output relationship of individual neurons, in particular the difficult Wasserstein neurons.

This study offers a thorough evaluation of four leading pre-trained and open-source large language models: BART, FLAN-T5, LLaMA-3-8B, and Gemma-7B, across five diverse datasets CNN/DM, Gigaword, News Summary, XSum, and BBC News. The evaluation employs widely recognized automatic metrics, including ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, BERTScore, and METEOR, to assess the models' capabilities in generating coherent and informative summaries.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reward models (RMs) are crucial for the training and inference-time scaling up of large language models (LLMs). However, existing reward models primarily focus on human preferences, neglecting verifiable correctness signals which have shown strong potential in training LLMs. In this paper, we propose agentic reward modeling, a reward system that combines reward models with verifiable correctness signals from different aspects to provide reliable rewards. We empirically implement a reward agent, named RewardAgent, that combines human preference rewards with two verifiable signals: factuality and instruction following, to provide more reliable rewards. We conduct comprehensive experiments on existing reward model benchmarks and inference time best-of-n searches on real-world downstream tasks. RewardAgent significantly outperforms vanilla reward models, demonstrating its effectiveness. We further construct training preference pairs using RewardAgent and train an LLM with the DPO objective, achieving superior performance on various NLP benchmarks compared to conventional reward models. Our codes are publicly released to facilitate further research (https://github.com/THU-KEG/Agentic-Reward-Modeling).

For example, customer support bots can be built on top of LLMs, relying on their broad language understanding and capabilities to enhance performance. However, these LLMs are adversarially susceptible, potentially generating outputs outside the intended domain. To formalize, assess, and mitigate this risk, we introduce domain certification; a guarantee that accurately characterizes the out-of-domain behavior of language models. We then propose a simple yet effective approach, which we call VALID that provides adversarial bounds as a certificate. Finally, we evaluate our method across a diverse set of datasets, demonstrating that it yields meaningful certificates, which bound the probability of out-of-domain samples tightly with minimum penalty to refusal behavior.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Effective personalization of LLMs is critical for a broad range of user-interfacing applications such as virtual assistants and content curation. Inspired by the strong in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, we propose Few-Shot Preference Optimization (FSPO), which reframes reward modeling as a meta-learning problem. Under this framework, an LLM learns to quickly adapt to a user via a few labeled preferences from that user, constructing a personalized reward function for them. Additionally, since real-world preference data is scarce and challenging to collect at scale, we propose careful design choices to construct synthetic preference datasets for personalization, generating over 1M synthetic personalized preferences using publicly available LLMs. In particular, to successfully transfer from synthetic data to real users, we find it crucial for the data to exhibit both high diversity and coherent, self-consistent structure. We evaluate FSPO on personalized open-ended generation for up to 1,500 synthetic users across across three domains: movie reviews, pedagogical adaptation based on educational background, and general question answering, along with a controlled human study. Overall, FSPO achieves an 87% Alpaca Eval winrate on average in generating responses that are personalized to synthetic users and a 72% winrate with real human users in open-ended question answering.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep and shallow embeddings of non-classical logics in classical higher-order logic have been explored, implemented, and used in various automated reasoning tools in recent years. This paper presents a recipe for the simultaneous deployment of different forms of deep and shallow embeddings in classical higher-order logic, enabling not only flexible interactive and automated theorem proving and counterexample finding at meta and object level, but also automated faithfulness proofs between the logic embeddings. The approach, which is fruitful for logic education, research and application, is deliberately illustrated here using simple propositional modal logic. However, the work presented is conceptual in nature and not limited to such a simple logic context.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) should undergo rigorous audits to identify potential risks, such as copyright and privacy infringements. Once these risks emerge, timely updates are crucial to remove undesirable responses, ensuring legal and safe model usage. It has spurred recent research into LLM unlearning, focusing on erasing targeted undesirable knowledge without compromising the integrity of other, non-targeted responses. Existing studies have introduced various unlearning objectives to pursue LLM unlearning without necessitating complete retraining. However, each of these objectives has unique properties, and no unified framework is currently available to comprehend them thoroughly. To fill the gap, we propose a toolkit of the gradient effect (G-effect), quantifying the impacts of unlearning objectives on model performance from a gradient perspective. A notable advantage is its broad ability to detail the unlearning impacts from various aspects across instances, updating steps, and LLM layers. Accordingly, the G-effect offers new insights into identifying drawbacks of existing unlearning objectives, further motivating us to explore a series of new solutions for their mitigation and improvements. Finally, we outline promising directions that merit further studies, aiming at contributing to the community to advance this important field.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models (LLMs) become more specialized, we envision a future where millions of expert LLMs exist, each trained on proprietary data and excelling in specific domains. In such a system, answering a query requires selecting a small subset of relevant models, querying them efficiently, and synthesizing their responses. This paper introduces a framework for agent-centric information access, where LLMs function as knowledge agents that are dynamically ranked and queried based on their demonstrated expertise. Unlike traditional document retrieval, this approach requires inferring expertise on the fly, rather than relying on static metadata or predefined model descriptions. This shift introduces several challenges, including efficient expert selection, cost-effective querying, response aggregation across multiple models, and robustness against adversarial manipulation. To address these issues, we propose a scalable evaluation framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation and clustering techniques to construct and assess thousands of specialized models, with the potential to scale toward millions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We consider enhancing large language models (LLMs) for complex planning tasks. While existing methods allow LLMs to explore intermediate steps to make plans, they either depend on unreliable self-verification or external verifiers to evaluate these steps, which demand significant data and computations. Here, we propose automated heuristics discovery (AutoHD), a novel approach that enables LLMs to explicitly generate heuristic functions to guide inference-time search, allowing accurate evaluation of intermediate states. These heuristic functions are further refined through a heuristic evolution process, improving their robustness and effectiveness. Our proposed method requires no additional model training or fine-tuning, and the explicit definition of heuristic functions generated by the LLMs provides interpretability and insights into the reasoning process. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate significant gains over multiple baselines, including nearly twice the accuracy on some datasets, establishing our approach as a reliable and interpretable solution for complex planning tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces the human-curated PandasPlotBench dataset, designed to evaluate language models' effectiveness as assistants in visual data exploration. Our benchmark focuses on generating code for visualizing tabular data - such as a Pandas DataFrame - based on natural language instructions, complementing current evaluation tools and expanding their scope. The dataset includes 175 unique tasks. Our experiments assess several leading Large Language Models (LLMs) across three visualization libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. We show that the shortening of tasks has a minimal effect on plotting capabilities, allowing for the user interface that accommodates concise user input without sacrificing functionality or accuracy. Another of our findings reveals that while LLMs perform well with popular libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, challenges persist with Plotly, highlighting areas for improvement. We hope that the modular design of our benchmark will broaden the current studies on generating visualizations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reward models (RMs) are a crucial component in the alignment of large language models' (LLMs) outputs with human values. RMs approximate human preferences over possible LLM responses to the same prompt by predicting and comparing reward scores. However, as they are typically modified versions of LLMs with scalar output heads, RMs are large black boxes whose predictions are not explainable. More transparent RMs would enable improved trust in the alignment of LLMs. In this work, we propose to use contrastive explanations to explain any binary response comparison made by an RM. Specifically, we generate a diverse set of new comparisons similar to the original one to characterise the RM's local behaviour. The perturbed responses forming the new comparisons are generated to explicitly modify manually specified high-level evaluation attributes, on which analyses of RM behaviour are grounded. In quantitative experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our method for finding high-quality contrastive explanations. We then showcase the qualitative usefulness of our method for investigating global sensitivity of RMs to each evaluation attribute, and demonstrate how representative examples can be automatically extracted to explain and compare behaviours of different RMs. We see our method as a flexible framework for RM explanation, providing a basis for more interpretable and trustworthy LLM alignment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Prompt engineering can significantly improve the performance of large language models (LLMs), with automated prompt optimization (APO) gaining significant attention due to the time-consuming and laborious nature of manual prompt design. However, much of the existing work in APO overlooks task-specific characteristics, resulting in prompts that lack domain specificity and are not well-suited for task-specific optimization. In this paper, we introduce TAPO, a multitask-aware prompt optimization framework composed of three key modules. First, a task-aware metric selection module is proposed to enhance task-specific prompt generation capabilities. Second, we present a multi-metrics evaluation module to jointly evaluate prompts from multiple perspectives. Third, an evolution-based optimization framework is introduced for automatic prompt refinement, which improves adaptability across various tasks. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and our code is publicly available.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains but remain susceptible to hallucinations and inconsistencies, limiting their reliability. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by grounding model responses in external knowledge sources. Existing RAG workflows often leverage a single vector database, which is impractical in the common setting where information is distributed across multiple repositories. We introduce RAGRoute, a novel mechanism for federated RAG search. RAGRoute dynamically selects relevant data sources at query time using a lightweight neural network classifier. By not querying every data source, this approach significantly reduces query overhead, improves retrieval efficiency, and minimizes the retrieval of irrelevant information. We evaluate RAGRoute using the MIRAGE and MMLU benchmarks and demonstrate its effectiveness in retrieving relevant documents while reducing the number of queries. RAGRoute reduces the total number of queries up to 77.5% and communication volume up to 76.2%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce ArtInsight, a novel AI-powered system to facilitate deeper engagement with child-created artwork in mixed visual-ability families. ArtInsight leverages large language models (LLMs) to craft a respectful and thorough initial description of a child's artwork, and provides: creative AI-generated descriptions for a vivid overview, audio recording to capture the child's own description of their artwork, and a set of AI-generated questions to facilitate discussion between blind or low-vision (BLV) family members and their children. Alongside ArtInsight, we also contribute a new rubric to score AI-generated descriptions of child-created artwork and an assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs. We evaluated ArtInsight with five groups of BLV family members and their children, and as a case study with one BLV child therapist. Our findings highlight a preference for ArtInsight's longer, artistically-tailored descriptions over those generated by existing BLV AI tools. Participants highlighted the creative description and audio recording components as most beneficial, with the former helping ``bring a picture to life'' and the latter centering the child's narrative to generate context-aware AI responses. Our findings reveal different ways that AI can be used to support art engagement, including before, during, and after interaction with the child artist, as well as expectations that BLV adults and their sighted children have about AI-powered tools.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Great Britain aims to meet growing electricity demand and achieve a fully decarbonised grid by 2035, targeting 70 GW of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity. However, grid constraints and connection delays hinder solar integration. To address these integration challenges, various connection reform processes and policies are being developed [1]. This study supports the connection reforms with a model that estimates regional PV capacity at the NUTS 3 level, explaining 89% of the variation in capacity, with a mean absolute error of 20 MW and a national mean absolute percentage error of 5.4%. Artificial surfaces and agricultural areas are identified as key factors in deployment. The model has three primary applications: disaggregating national PV capacity into regional capacity, benchmarking regional PV deployment between different regions, and forecasting future PV capacity distribution. These applications support grid operators in generation monitoring and strategic grid planning by identifying regions where capacity is likely to be concentrated. This can address grid connection delays, plan network expansions, and resolve land-use conflicts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex reasoning scenarios. While preference optimization methods enhance reasoning performance through training, they often lack transparency in why one reasoning outcome is preferred over another. Verbal reflection techniques improve explainability but are limited in LLMs' critique and refinement capacity. To address these challenges, we introduce a contrastive reflection synthesis pipeline that enhances the accuracy and depth of LLM-generated reflections. We further propose a dual-model reasoning framework within a verbal reinforcement learning paradigm, decoupling inference-time self-reflection into specialized, trained models for reasoning critique and refinement. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms traditional preference optimization methods across all evaluation metrics. Our findings also show that "two heads are better than one", demonstrating that a collaborative Reasoner-Critic model achieves superior reasoning performance and transparency, compared to single-model approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Developing clinically useful cell-level analysis tools in digital pathology remains challenging due to limitations in dataset granularity, inconsistent annotations, high computational demands, and difficulties integrating new technologies into workflows. To address these issues, we propose a solution that enhances data quality, model performance, and usability by creating a lightweight, extensible cell segmentation and classification model. First, we update data labels through cross-relabeling to refine annotations of PanNuke and MoNuSAC, producing a unified dataset with seven distinct cell types. Second, we leverage the H-Optimus foundation model as a fixed encoder to improve feature representation for simultaneous segmentation and classification tasks. Third, to address foundation models' computational demands, we distill knowledge to reduce model size and complexity while maintaining comparable performance. Finally, we integrate the distilled model into QuPath, a widely used open-source digital pathology platform. Results demonstrate improved segmentation and classification performance using the H-Optimus-based model compared to a CNN-based model. Specifically, average $R^2$ improved from 0.575 to 0.871, and average $PQ$ score improved from 0.450 to 0.492, indicating better alignment with actual cell counts and enhanced segmentation quality. The distilled model maintains comparable performance while reducing parameter count by a factor of 48. By reducing computational complexity and integrating into workflows, this approach may significantly impact diagnostics, reduce pathologist workload, and improve outcomes. Although the method shows promise, extensive validation is necessary prior to clinical deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large-scale multilingual evaluations, such as MEGA, often include only a handful of African languages due to the scarcity of high-quality evaluation data and the limited discoverability of existing African datasets. This lack of representation hinders comprehensive LLM evaluation across a diverse range of languages and tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce AfroBench -- a multi-task benchmark for evaluating the performance of LLMs across 64 African languages, 15 tasks and 22 datasets. AfroBench consists of nine natural language understanding datasets, six text generation datasets, six knowledge and question answering tasks, and one mathematical reasoning task. We present results comparing the performance of prompting LLMs to fine-tuned baselines based on BERT and T5-style models. Our results suggest large gaps in performance between high-resource languages, such as English, and African languages across most tasks; but performance also varies based on the availability of monolingual data resources. Our findings confirm that performance on African languages continues to remain a hurdle for current LLMs, underscoring the need for additional efforts to close this gap.   https://mcgill-nlp.github.io/AfroBench/

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The success of the self-attention mechanism in classical machine learning models has inspired the development of quantum analogs aimed at reducing computational overhead. Self-attention integrates learnable query and key matrices to calculate attention scores between all pairs of tokens in a sequence. These scores are then multiplied by a learnable value matrix to obtain the output self-attention matrix, enabling the model to effectively capture long-range dependencies within the input sequence. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical self-attention mechanism as part of a transformer decoder, the architecture underlying large language models (LLMs). To demonstrate its utility in chemistry, we train this model on the QM9 dataset for conditional generation, using SMILES strings as input, each labeled with a set of physicochemical properties that serve as conditions during inference. Our theoretical analysis shows that the time complexity of the query-key dot product is reduced from $\mathcal{O}(n^2 d)$ in a classical model to $\mathcal{O}(n^2\log d)$ in our quantum model, where $n$ and $d$ represent the sequence length and embedding dimension, respectively. We perform simulations using NVIDIA's CUDA-Q platform, which is designed for efficient GPU scalability. This work provides a promising avenue for quantum-enhanced natural language processing (NLP).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The study explores whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit negation-induced forgetting (NIF), a cognitive phenomenon observed in humans where negating incorrect attributes of an object or event leads to diminished recall of this object or event compared to affirming correct attributes (Mayo et al., 2014; Zang et al., 2023). We adapted Zang et al. (2023) experimental framework to test this effect in ChatGPT-3.5, GPT-4o mini and Llama3-70b-instruct. Our results show that ChatGPT-3.5 exhibits NIF, with negated information being less likely to be recalled than affirmed information. GPT-4o-mini showed a marginally significant NIF effect, while LLaMA-3-70B did not exhibit NIF. The findings provide initial evidence of negation-induced forgetting in some LLMs, suggesting that similar cognitive biases may emerge in these models. This work is a preliminary step in understanding how memory-related phenomena manifest in LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively reduces hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) but can still produce inconsistent or unsupported content. Although LLM-as-a-Judge is widely used for RAG hallucination detection due to its implementation simplicity, it faces two main challenges: the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks and the lack of domain-optimized judge models. To bridge these gaps, we introduce \textbf{Bi'an}, a novel framework featuring a bilingual benchmark dataset and lightweight judge models. The dataset supports rigorous evaluation across multiple RAG scenarios, while the judge models are fine-tuned from compact open-source LLMs. Extensive experimental evaluations on Bi'anBench show our 14B model outperforms baseline models with over five times larger parameter scales and rivals state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs. We will release our data and models soon at https://github.com/OpenSPG/KAG.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Social media platforms frequently impose restrictive policies to moderate user content, prompting the emergence of creative evasion language strategies. This paper presents a multi-agent framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate the iterative evolution of language strategies under regulatory constraints. In this framework, participant agents, as social media users, continuously evolve their language expression, while supervisory agents emulate platform-level regulation by assessing policy violations. To achieve a more faithful simulation, we employ a dual design of language strategies (constraint and expression) to differentiate conflicting goals and utilize an LLM-driven GA (Genetic Algorithm) for the selection, mutation, and crossover of language strategies. The framework is evaluated using two distinct scenarios: an abstract password game and a realistic simulated illegal pet trade scenario. Experimental results demonstrate that as the number of dialogue rounds increases, both the number of uninterrupted dialogue turns and the accuracy of information transmission improve significantly. Furthermore, a user study with 40 participants validates the real-world relevance of the generated dialogues and strategies. Moreover, ablation studies validate the importance of the GA, emphasizing its contribution to long-term adaptability and improved overall results.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in everyday applications, demanding robust general reasoning capabilities and diverse reasoning skillset. However, current LLM reasoning benchmarks predominantly focus on mathematical and coding abilities, leaving a gap in evaluating broader reasoning proficiencies. One particular exception is the BIG-Bench dataset, which has served as a crucial benchmark for evaluating the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs, thanks to its diverse set of challenging tasks that allowed for a comprehensive assessment of general reasoning across various skills within a unified framework. However, recent advances in LLMs have led to saturation on BIG-Bench, and its harder version BIG-Bench Hard (BBH). State-of-the-art models achieve near-perfect scores on many tasks in BBH, thus diminishing its utility. To address this limitation, we introduce BIG-Bench Extra Hard (BBEH), a new benchmark designed to push the boundaries of LLM reasoning evaluation. BBEH replaces each task in BBH with a novel task that probes a similar reasoning capability but exhibits significantly increased difficulty. We evaluate various models on BBEH and observe a (harmonic) average accuracy of 9.8\% for the best general-purpose model and 44.8\% for the best reasoning-specialized model, indicating substantial room for improvement and highlighting the ongoing challenge of achieving robust general reasoning in LLMs. We release BBEH publicly at: https://github.com/google-deepmind/bbeh.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable success in natural language processing (NLP). In practical scenarios like recommendations, as users increasingly seek personalized experiences, it becomes crucial to incorporate user interaction history into the context of LLMs to enhance personalization. However, from a practical utility perspective, user interactions' extensive length and noise present challenges when used directly as text prompts. A promising solution is to compress and distill interactions into compact embeddings, serving as soft prompts to assist LLMs in generating personalized responses. Although this approach brings efficiency, a critical concern emerges: Can user embeddings adequately capture valuable information and prompt LLMs? To address this concern, we propose \name, a benchmark designed to evaluate the effectiveness of user embeddings in prompting LLMs for personalization. We establish a fair and standardized evaluation process, encompassing pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluation stages. To thoroughly evaluate user embeddings, we design three dimensions of tasks: sequence understanding, action prediction, and interest perception. These evaluation tasks cover the industry's demands in traditional recommendation tasks, such as improving prediction accuracy, and its aspirations for LLM-based methods, such as accurately understanding user interests and enhancing the user experience. We conduct extensive experiments on various state-of-the-art methods for modeling user embeddings. Additionally, we reveal the scaling laws of leveraging user embeddings to prompt LLMs. The benchmark is available online.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Differential Diagnosis (DDx) is a fundamental yet complex aspect of clinical decision-making, in which physicians iteratively refine a ranked list of possible diseases based on symptoms, antecedents, and medical knowledge. While recent advances in large language models have shown promise in supporting DDx, existing approaches face key limitations, including single-dataset evaluations, isolated optimization of components, unrealistic assumptions about complete patient profiles, and single-attempt diagnosis. We introduce a Modular Explainable DDx Agent (MEDDxAgent) framework designed for interactive DDx, where diagnostic reasoning evolves through iterative learning, rather than assuming a complete patient profile is accessible. MEDDxAgent integrates three modular components: (1) an orchestrator (DDxDriver), (2) a history taking simulator, and (3) two specialized agents for knowledge retrieval and diagnosis strategy. To ensure robust evaluation, we introduce a comprehensive DDx benchmark covering respiratory, skin, and rare diseases. We analyze single-turn diagnostic approaches and demonstrate the importance of iterative refinement when patient profiles are not available at the outset. Our broad evaluation demonstrates that MEDDxAgent achieves over 10% accuracy improvements in interactive DDx across both large and small LLMs, while offering critical explainability into its diagnostic reasoning process.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining momentum in software development with prompt-driven programming enabling developers to create code from natural language (NL) instructions. However, studies have questioned their ability to produce secure code and, thereby, the quality of prompt-generated software. Alongside, various prompting techniques that carefully tailor prompts have emerged to elicit optimal responses from LLMs. Still, the interplay between such prompting strategies and secure code generation remains under-explored and calls for further investigations. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigate the impact of different prompting techniques on the security of code generated from NL instructions by LLMs. METHOD: First we perform a systematic literature review to identify the existing prompting techniques that can be used for code generation tasks. A subset of these techniques are evaluated on GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 models for secure code generation. For this, we used an existing dataset consisting of 150 NL security-relevant code-generation prompts. RESULTS: Our work (i) classifies potential prompting techniques for code generation (ii) adapts and evaluates a subset of the identified techniques for secure code generation tasks and (iii) observes a reduction in security weaknesses across the tested LLMs, especially after using an existing technique called Recursive Criticism and Improvement (RCI), contributing valuable insights to the ongoing discourse on LLM-generated code security.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), fully fine-tuning (FT) these models has become increasingly impractical due to the high computational demands. Additionally, FT can lead to catastrophic forgetting. As an alternative, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been proposed, which fine-tunes only a small subset of parameters, achieving similar performance to FT while significantly reducing resource requirements. However, since LoRA inherits FT's design, the issue of catastrophic forgetting remains.   To address these challenges, we propose SECURA: Sigmoid-Enhanced CUR Decomposition LoRA, a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) variant that mitigates catastrophic forgetting while improving fine-tuning performance. Our method introduces a new normalization technique, SigNorm, to enhance parameter retention and overall performance.   SECURA has been evaluated on a variety of tasks, including mathematical problem-solving (GSM8K), challenging question-answering (CNNDM), translation (NewsDE), and complex multiple-choice reasoning (LogiQA). Experimental results show that SECURA achieves an average fine-tuning improvement of 3.59% across four multiple-choice question (MCQ) tasks and a 2.51% improvement across five question-answering (QA) tasks on models such as Gemma2 2b, Qwen2 1.5b, Qwen 2 7b, Llama3 8b, and Llama3.1 8b, compared to DoRA. Moreover, SECURA demonstrates superior knowledge retention capabilities, maintaining more than 70% accuracy on basic LLM knowledge across 16 continual learning tests, outperforming Experience Replay (ER), Sequential Learning (SEQ), EWC, I-LoRA, and CUR-LoRA.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Urban gardening is widely recognized for its numerous health and environmental benefits. However, the lack of suitable garden spaces, demanding daily schedules and limited gardening expertise present major roadblocks for citizens looking to engage in urban gardening. While prior research has explored smart home solutions to support urban gardeners, these approaches currently do not fully address these practical barriers. In this paper, we present PlantPal, a system that enables the cultivation of garden spaces irrespective of one's location, expertise level, or time constraints. PlantPal enables the shared operation of a precision agriculture robot (PAR) that is equipped with garden tools and a multi-camera system. Insights from a 3-week deployment (N=18) indicate that PlantPal facilitated the integration of gardening tasks into daily routines, fostered a sense of connection with one's field, and provided an engaging experience despite the remote setting. We contribute design considerations for future robot-assisted urban gardening concepts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Embedding models play a crucial role in representing and retrieving information across various NLP applications. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have further enhanced the performance of embedding models. While these models are often benchmarked on general-purpose datasets, real-world applications demand domain-specific evaluation. In this work, we introduce the Finance Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (FinMTEB), a specialized counterpart to MTEB designed for the financial domain. FinMTEB comprises 64 financial domain-specific embedding datasets across 7 tasks that cover diverse textual types in both Chinese and English, such as financial news articles, corporate annual reports, ESG reports, regulatory filings, and earnings call transcripts. We also develop a finance-adapted model, Fin-E5, using a persona-based data synthetic method to cover diverse financial embedding tasks for training. Through extensive evaluation of 15 embedding models, including Fin-E5, we show three key findings: (1) performance on general-purpose benchmarks shows limited correlation with financial domain tasks; (2) domain-adapted models consistently outperform their general-purpose counterparts; and (3) surprisingly, a simple Bag-of-Words (BoW) approach outperforms sophisticated dense embeddings in financial Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks, underscoring current limitations in dense embedding techniques. Our work establishes a robust evaluation framework for financial NLP applications and provides crucial insights for developing domain-specific embedding models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), the demand for robust instruction-following capabilities in code generation tasks has grown significantly. Code generation not only facilitates faster prototyping and automated testing, but also augments developer efficiency through improved maintainability and reusability of code. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess the abilities of LLMs to adhere to task-oriented instructions within diverse code generation scenarios. CodeIF encompasses a broad range of tasks, including function synthesis, error debugging, algorithmic refactoring, and code explanation, thereby providing a comprehensive suite to evaluate model performance across varying complexity levels and programming domains. We conduct extensive experiments with LLMs, analyzing their strengths and limitations in meeting the demands of these tasks. The experimental results offer valuable insights into how well current models align with human instructions, as well as the extent to which they can generate consistent, maintainable, and contextually relevant code. Our findings not only underscore the critical role that instruction-following LLMs can play in modern software development, but also illuminate pathways for future research aimed at enhancing their adaptability, reliability, and overall effectiveness in automated code generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Social categories and stereotypes are embedded in language and can introduce data bias into Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite safeguards, these biases often persist in model behavior, potentially leading to representational harm in outputs. While sociolinguistic research provides valuable insights into the formation of stereotypes, NLP approaches for stereotype detection rarely draw on this foundation and often lack objectivity, precision, and interpretability. To fill this gap, in this work we propose a new approach that detects and quantifies the linguistic indicators of stereotypes in a sentence. We derive linguistic indicators from the Social Category and Stereotype Communication (SCSC) framework which indicate strong social category formulation and stereotyping in language, and use them to build a categorization scheme. To automate this approach, we instruct different LLMs using in-context learning to apply the approach to a sentence, where the LLM examines the linguistic properties and provides a basis for a fine-grained assessment. Based on an empirical evaluation of the importance of different linguistic indicators, we learn a scoring function that measures the linguistic indicators of a stereotype. Our annotations of stereotyped sentences show that these indicators are present in these sentences and explain the strength of a stereotype. In terms of model performance, our results show that the models generally perform well in detecting and classifying linguistic indicators of category labels used to denote a category, but sometimes struggle to correctly evaluate the associated behaviors and characteristics. Using more few-shot examples within the prompts, significantly improves performance. Model performance increases with size, as Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and GPT-4 achieve comparable results that surpass those of Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct, GPT-4-mini and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Compared to width-wise pruning, depth-wise pruning can significantly accelerate inference in resource-constrained scenarios. Howerver, treating the entire Transformer layer as the minimum pruning unit may degrade model performance by indiscriminately discarding the entire information of the layer. This paper reveals the "Patch-like" feature relationship between layers in large language models by analyzing the correlation of the outputs of different layers in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Building on this observation, we proposes a sliding layer merging method that dynamically selects and fuses consecutive layers from top to bottom according to a pre-defined similarity threshold, thereby simplifying the model structure while maintaining its performance. Extensive experiments on LLMs with various architectures and different parameter scales show that our method outperforms existing pruning techniques in both zero-shot inference performance and retraining recovery quality after pruning. In particular, in the experiment with 35\% pruning on the Vicuna-7B model, our method achieved a 1.654\% improvement in average performance on zero-shot tasks compared to the existing method. Moreover, we further reveal the potential of combining depth pruning with width pruning to enhance the pruning effect.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is widely used to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, it typically assumes homogeneous preferences across users, overlooking diverse human values and minority viewpoints. Although personalized preference learning addresses this by tailoring separate preferences for individual users, the field lacks standardized methods to assess its effectiveness. We present a multi-faceted evaluation framework that measures not only performance but also fairness, unintended effects, and adaptability across varying levels of preference divergence. Through extensive experiments comparing eight personalization methods across three preference datasets, we demonstrate that performance differences between methods could reach 36% when users strongly disagree, and personalization can introduce up to 20% safety misalignment. These findings highlight the critical need for holistic evaluation approaches to advance the development of more effective and inclusive preference learning systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Existing code generation benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) such as HumanEval and MBPP are designed to study LLMs' end-to-end performance, where the benchmarks feed a problem description in natural language as input and examine the generated code in specific programming languages. However, the evaluation scores revealed in this way provide a little hint as to the bottleneck of the code generation -- whether LLMs are struggling with their problem-solving capability or language-coding capability. To answer this question, we construct PseudoEval, a multilingual code generation benchmark that provides a solution written in pseudocode as input. By doing so, the bottleneck of code generation in various programming languages could be isolated and identified. Our study yields several interesting findings. For example, we identify that the bottleneck of LLMs in Python programming is problem-solving, while Rust is struggling relatively more in language-coding. Also, our study indicates that problem-solving capability may transfer across programming languages, while language-coding needs more language-specific effort, especially for undertrained programming languages. Finally, we release the pipeline of constructing PseudoEval to facilitate the extension to existing benchmarks. PseudoEval is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PseudocodeACL25-7B74.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> How to align large language models (LLMs) with user preferences from a static general dataset has been frequently studied. However, user preferences are usually personalized, changing, and diverse regarding culture, values, or time. This leads to the problem that the actual user preferences often do not coincide with those trained by the model developers in the practical use of LLMs. Since we cannot collect enough data and retrain for every demand, researching efficient real-time preference adaptation methods based on the backbone LLMs during test time is important. To this end, we introduce Amulet, a novel, training-free framework that formulates the decoding process of every token as a separate online learning problem with the guidance of simple user-provided prompts, thus enabling real-time optimization to satisfy users' personalized preferences. To reduce the computational cost brought by this optimization process for each token, we additionally provide a closed-form solution for each iteration step of the optimization process, thereby reducing the computational time cost to a negligible level. The detailed experimental results demonstrate that Amulet can achieve significant performance improvements in rich settings with combinations of different LLMs, datasets, and user preferences, while maintaining acceptable computational efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent studies have indicated that Large Language Models (LLMs) harbor an inherent understanding of truthfulness, yet often fail to consistently express it and generate false statements. This gap between "knowing" and "telling" poses a challenge for ensuring the truthfulness of generated content. Inspired by recent work on the practice of encoding human-interpretable concepts linearly within large language models, we treat truthfulness as a specially linearly encoded concept within LLMs, and introduce Adaptive Activation Steering (ACT), a tuning-free method that adaptively shifts LLM's activations in the "truthful" direction during inference. ACT addresses diverse categories of hallucinations by utilizing diverse truthfulness-related steering vectors and adjusting the steering intensity adaptively. Applied as an add-on across various models, ACT significantly improves truthfulness in LLaMA ($\uparrow$ 142%), LLaMA2 ($\uparrow$ 24%), Alpaca ($\uparrow$ 36%), Vicuna ($\uparrow$ 28%), LLaMA2-Chat ($\uparrow$ 19%), and LLaMA3($\uparrow$ 34%). Furthermore, we verify ACT's scalability across larger models (13B, 33B, 65B), underscoring the adaptability of ACT to large-scale language models. Our code is available at https://github.com/tianlwang/ACT.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Hyperparameter optimization is critical in modern machine learning, requiring expert knowledge, numerous trials, and high computational and human resources. Despite the advancements in Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), challenges in terms of trial efficiency, setup complexity, and interoperability still persist. To address these issues, we introduce a novel paradigm leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate hyperparameter optimization across diverse machine learning tasks, which is named AgentHPO (short for LLM Agent-based Hyperparameter Optimization). Specifically, AgentHPO processes the task information autonomously, conducts experiments with specific hyperparameters (HPs), and iteratively optimizes them based on historical trials. This human-like optimization process largely reduces the number of required trials, simplifies the setup process, and enhances interpretability and user trust, compared to traditional AutoML methods. Extensive empirical experiments conducted on 12 representative machine-learning tasks indicate that AgentHPO not only matches but also often surpasses the best human trials in terms of performance while simultaneously providing explainable results. Further analysis sheds light on the strategies employed by the LLM in optimizing these tasks, highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability in various scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Human cognition excels at transcending sensory input and forming latent representations that structure our understanding of the world. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce chain-of-thought reasoning, they lack a principled framework to capture latent structures and model uncertainty, especially in compositional reasoning tasks. We propose Verbalized Probabilistic Graphical Modeling (vPGM), a Bayesian prompting framework that guides LLMs to simulate key principles of Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) in natural language. Unlike many traditional probabilistic methods requiring substantial domain expertise or specialized training, vPGM bypasses expert-driven model design, making it well-suited for scenarios with limited assumptions or scarce data. We evaluated our model on several compositional reasoning tasks, both close-ended and open-ended. Our results indicate that the model effectively enhances confidence calibration and text generation quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce ColaCare, a framework that enhances Electronic Health Record (EHR) modeling through multi-agent collaboration driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach seamlessly integrates domain-specific expert models with LLMs to bridge the gap between structured EHR data and text-based reasoning. Inspired by the Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) approach used in clinical settings, ColaCare employs two types of agents: DoctorAgents and a MetaAgent, which collaboratively analyze patient data. Expert models process and generate predictions from numerical EHR data, while LLM agents produce reasoning references and decision-making reports within the MDT-driven collaborative consultation framework. The MetaAgent orchestrates the discussion, facilitating consultations and evidence-based debates among DoctorAgents, simulating diverse expertise in clinical decision-making. We additionally incorporate the Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy (MSD) medical guideline within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module for medical evidence support, addressing the challenge of knowledge currency. Extensive experiments conducted on three EHR datasets demonstrate ColaCare's superior performance in clinical mortality outcome and readmission prediction tasks, underscoring its potential to revolutionize clinical decision support systems and advance personalized precision medicine.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents a novel framework, called PLANTOR (PLanning with Natural language for Task-Oriented Robots), that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Prolog-based knowledge management and planning for multi-robot tasks. The system employs a two-phase generation of a robot-oriented knowledge base, ensuring reusability and compositional reasoning, as well as a three-step planning procedure that handles temporal dependencies, resource constraints, and parallel task execution via mixed-integer linear programming. The final plan is converted into a Behaviour Tree for direct use in ROS2. We tested the framework in multi-robot assembly tasks within a block world and an arch-building scenario. Results demonstrate that LLMs can produce accurate knowledge bases with modest human feedback, while Prolog guarantees formal correctness and explainability. This approach underscores the potential of LLM integration for advanced robotics tasks requiring flexible, scalable, and human-understandable planning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Decomposition is a fundamental skill in algorithmic programming, requiring learners to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts. However, current self-study methods, such as browsing reference solutions or using LLM assistants, often provide excessive or generic assistance that misaligns with learners' decomposition strategies, hindering independent problem-solving and critical thinking. To address this, we introduce Decomposition Box (DBox), an interactive LLM-based system that scaffolds and adapts to learners' personalized construction of a step tree through a "learner-LLM co-decomposition" approach, providing tailored support at an appropriate level. A within-subjects study (N=24) found that compared to the baseline, DBox significantly improved learning gains, cognitive engagement, and critical thinking. Learners also reported a stronger sense of achievement and found the assistance appropriate and helpful for learning. Additionally, we examined DBox's impact on cognitive load, identified usage patterns, and analyzed learners' strategies for managing system errors. We conclude with design implications for future AI-powered tools to better support algorithmic programming education.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have risen significantly in popularity and are increasingly being adopted across multiple applications. These LLMs are heavily aligned to resist engaging in illegal or unethical topics as a means to avoid contributing to responsible AI harms. However, a recent line of attacks, known as jailbreaks, seek to overcome this alignment. Intuitively, jailbreak attacks aim to narrow the gap between what the model can do and what it is willing to do. In this paper, we introduce a novel jailbreak attack called Crescendo. Unlike existing jailbreak methods, Crescendo is a simple multi-turn jailbreak that interacts with the model in a seemingly benign manner. It begins with a general prompt or question about the task at hand and then gradually escalates the dialogue by referencing the model's replies progressively leading to a successful jailbreak. We evaluate Crescendo on various public systems, including ChatGPT, Gemini Pro, Gemini-Ultra, LlaMA-2 70b and LlaMA-3 70b Chat, and Anthropic Chat. Our results demonstrate the strong efficacy of Crescendo, with it achieving high attack success rates across all evaluated models and tasks. Furthermore, we present Crescendomation, a tool that automates the Crescendo attack and demonstrate its efficacy against state-of-the-art models through our evaluations. Crescendomation surpasses other state-of-the-art jailbreaking techniques on the AdvBench subset dataset, achieving 29-61% higher performance on GPT-4 and 49-71% on Gemini-Pro. Finally, we also demonstrate Crescendo's ability to jailbreak multimodal models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The emergence of 6G-enabled Internet of Vehicles (IoV) promises to revolutionize mobility and connectivity, integrating vehicles into a mobile Internet of Things (IoT)-oriented wireless sensor network (WSN). Meanwhile, 5G technologies and mobile edge computing further support this vision by facilitating real-time connectivity and empowering massive access to the Internet. Within this context, IoT-oriented WSNs play a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems, offering affordable alternatives for traffic monitoring and management. Efficient sensor selection thus represents a critical concern while deploying WSNs on urban networks. In this paper, we provide an overview of such a notably hard problem. The contribution is twofold: (i) surveying state-of-the-art model-based techniques for efficient sensor selection in traffic flow monitoring, emphasizing challenges of sensor placement, and (ii) advocating for {the development of} data-driven methodologies to enhance sensor deployment efficacy and traffic modeling accuracy. Further considerations underscore the importance of data-driven approaches for adaptive transportation systems aligned with the IoV paradigm.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to align their responses with objective facts, resulting in the issue of factual hallucinations, which can be difficult to detect and mislead users without relevant knowledge. While post-training techniques have been employed to mitigate the issue, existing methods usually suffer from poor generalization and trade-offs in different capabilities. In this paper, we propose to address it by directly augmenting LLM's fundamental ability to precisely leverage its existing memory--the knowledge acquired from pre-training data. We introduce self-memory alignment (SMA), which fine-tunes the model on self-generated responses to precise and simple factual questions through preference optimization. Furthermore, we construct FactualBench, a comprehensive and precise factual QA dataset containing 181k Chinese data spanning 21 domains, to facilitate both evaluation and training. Extensive experiments show that SMA significantly improves LLMs' overall performance, with consistent enhancement across various benchmarks concerning factuality, as well as helpfulness and comprehensive skills.

In response, we propose EMERGE, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) driven framework to enhance multimodal EHR predictive modeling. We extract entities from both time-series data and clinical notes by prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) and align them with professional PrimeKG, ensuring consistency. In addition to triplet relationships, we incorporate entities' definitions and descriptions for richer semantics. The extracted knowledge is then used to generate task-relevant summaries of patients' health statuses. Finally, we fuse the summary with other modalities using an adaptive multimodal fusion network with cross-attention. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets' in-hospital mortality and 30-day readmission tasks demonstrate the superior performance of the EMERGE framework over baseline models. Comprehensive ablation studies and analysis highlight the efficacy of each designed module and robustness to data sparsity. EMERGE contributes to refining the utilization of multimodal EHR data in healthcare, bridging the gap with nuanced medical contexts essential for informed clinical predictions. We have publicly released the code at https://github.com/yhzhu99/EMERGE.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning for Large Language Models (LLMs), its performance often falls short of Full Fine-Tuning (Full FT). Current methods optimize LoRA by initializing with static singular value decomposition (SVD) subsets, leading to suboptimal leveraging of pre-trained knowledge. Another path for improving LoRA is incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. However, weight misalignment and complex gradient dynamics make it challenging to adopt SVD prior to the LoRA MoE architecture. To mitigate these issues, we propose \underline{G}reat L\underline{o}R\underline{A} Mixture-of-Exper\underline{t} (GOAT), a framework that (1) adaptively integrates relevant priors using an SVD-structured MoE, and (2) aligns optimization with full fine-tuned MoE by deriving a theoretical scaling factor. We demonstrate that proper scaling, without modifying the architecture or training algorithms, boosts LoRA MoE's efficiency and performance. Experiments across 25 datasets, including natural language understanding, commonsense reasoning, image classification, and natural language generation, demonstrate GOAT's state-of-the-art performance, closing the gap with Full FT.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks, yet their ability to generate long-form content remains poorly understood and evaluated. Our analysis reveals that current LLMs struggle with length requirements and information density in long-text generation, with performance deteriorating as text length increases. To quantitively locate such a performance degradation and provide further insights on model development, we present LongEval, a benchmark that evaluates long-text generation through both direct and plan-based generation paradigms, inspired by cognitive and linguistic writing models. The comprehensive experiments in this work reveal interesting findings such as that while model size correlates with generation ability, the small-scale model (e.g., LongWriter), well-trained on long texts, has comparable performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding how opinions evolve is crucial for addressing issues such as polarization, radicalization, and consensus in social systems. While much research has focused on identifying factors influencing opinion change, the role of language and argumentative fallacies remains underexplored. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating how language - along with social dynamics - influences opinion evolution through LODAS, a Language-Driven Opinion Dynamics Model for Agent-Based Simulations. The model simulates debates around the "Ship of Theseus" paradox, in which agents with discrete opinions interact with each other and evolve their opinions by accepting, rejecting, or ignoring the arguments presented. We study three different scenarios: balanced, polarized, and unbalanced opinion distributions. Agreeableness and sycophancy emerge as two main characteristics of LLM agents, and consensus around the presented statement emerges almost in any setting. Moreover, such AI agents are often producers of fallacious arguments in the attempt of persuading their peers and - for their complacency - they are also highly influenced by arguments built on logical fallacies. These results highlight the potential of this framework not only for simulating social dynamics but also for exploring from another perspective biases and shortcomings of LLMs, which may impact their interactions with humans.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance across numerous tasks. However, these advancements have predominantly benefited "first-class" languages such as English and Chinese, leaving many other languages underrepresented. This imbalance, while limiting broader applications, generates a natural preference ranking between languages, offering an opportunity to bootstrap the multilingual capabilities of LLM in a self-improving manner. Thus, we propose $\textit{Language Imbalance Driven Rewarding}$, where the inherent imbalance between dominant and non-dominant languages within LLMs is leveraged as a reward signal. Iterative DPO training demonstrates that this approach not only enhances LLM performance in non-dominant languages but also improves the dominant language's capacity, thereby yielding an iterative reward signal. Fine-tuning Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct over two iterations of this approach results in continuous improvements in multilingual performance across instruction-following and arithmetic reasoning tasks, evidenced by an average improvement of 7.46% win rate on the X-AlpacaEval leaderboard and 13.9% accuracy on the MGSM benchmark. This work serves as an initial exploration, paving the way for multilingual self-improvement of LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/ZNLP/Language-Imbalance-Driven-Rewarding

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have substantially evolved Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) capabilities, enabling systems that not only automate tasks but also leverage near-human reasoning capabilities. To achieve this, LLM-based MASs need to be built around two critical principles: (i) a robust architecture that fully exploits LLM potential for specific tasks -- or related task sets -- and ($ii$) an effective methodology for equipping LLMs with the necessary capabilities to perform tasks and manage information efficiently. It goes without saying that a priori architectural designs can limit the scalability and domain adaptability of a given MAS.   To address these challenges, in this paper we introduce Nexus: a lightweight Python framework designed to easily build and manage LLM-based MASs. Nexus introduces the following innovations: (i) a flexible multi-supervisor hierarchy, (ii) a simplified workflow design, and (iii) easy installation and open-source flexibility: Nexus can be installed via pip and is distributed under a permissive open-source license, allowing users to freely modify and extend its capabilities.   Experimental results demonstrate that architectures built with Nexus exhibit state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains. In coding tasks, Nexus-driven MASs achieve a 99% pass rate on HumanEval and a flawless 100% on VerilogEval-Human, outperforming cutting-edge reasoning language models such as o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1. Moreover, these architectures display robust proficiency in complex reasoning and mathematical problem solving, achieving correct solutions for all randomly selected problems from the MATH dataset. In the realm of multi-objective optimization, Nexus-based architectures successfully address challenging timing closure tasks on designs from the VTR benchmark suite, while guaranteeing, on average, a power saving of nearly 30%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Dense large language models(LLMs) face critical efficiency bottlenecks as they rigidly activate all parameters regardless of input complexity. While existing sparsity methods(static pruning or dynamic activation) address this partially, they either lack adaptivity to contextual or model structural demands or incur prohibitive computational overhead. Inspired by human brain's dual-process mechanisms - predictive coding (N400) for backbone sparsity and structural reanalysis (P600) for complex context - we propose CLADA, a \textit{\textbf{C}ognitive-\textbf{L}oad-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{A}ctivation} framework that synergizes statistical sparsity with semantic adaptability. Our key insight is that LLM activations exhibit two complementary patterns: 1) \textit{Global statistical sparsity} driven by sequence-level prefix information, and 2) \textit{Local semantic adaptability} modulated by cognitive load metrics(e.g., surprisal and entropy). CLADA employs a hierarchical thresholding strategy: a baseline from offline error-controlled optimization ensures 40\%+ sparsity, dynamically adjusted by real-time cognitive signals. Evaluations across six mainstream LLMs and nine benchmarks demonstrate that CLADA achieves \textbf{~20\% average speedup with <2\% accuracy drop}, outperforming Griffin (5\%+ degradation) and TT (negligible speedup). Crucially, we establish the first formal connection between neurolinguistic event-related potential (ERP) components and LLM efficiency mechanisms through multi-level regression analysis ($R^2=0.17$ for sparsity-adaptation synergy). Requiring no retraining or architectural changes, CLADA offers a deployable solution for resource-aware LLM inference while advancing biologically-inspired AI design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation from natural language prompts, revolutionizing software development workflows. As we advance towards agent-based development paradigms, these models form the cornerstone of next-generation software development lifecycles. However, current benchmarks for evaluating multilingual code generation capabilities are predominantly English-centric, limiting their applicability across the global developer community. To address this limitation, we present IndicEval-XL, a comprehensive benchmark for code generation that incorporates 6 major Indic languages, collectively spoken by approximately 14\% of the world's population. Our benchmark bridges these languages with 12 programming languages, creating a robust evaluation framework. This work is particularly significant given India's representation of one-eighth of the global population and the crucial role Indic languages play in Indian society. IndicEval-XL represents a significant step toward expanding the linguistic diversity in code generation systems and evaluation frameworks. By developing resources that support multiple languages, we aim to make AI-powered development tools more inclusive and accessible to developers of various linguistic backgrounds. To facilitate further research and development in this direction, we make our dataset and evaluation benchmark publicly available at https://github.com/telekom/IndicEval-XL

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Speculative sampling is a promising approach to accelerate the decoding stage for Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent advancements that leverage target LLM's contextual information, such as hidden states and KV cache, have shown significant practical improvements. However, these approaches suffer from inconsistent context between training and decoding. We also observe another discrepancy between the training and decoding objectives in existing speculative sampling methods. In this work, we propose a solution named HArmonized Speculative Sampling (HASS) that learns harmonized representations to address these issues. HASS accelerates the decoding stage without adding inference overhead through harmonized objective distillation and harmonized context alignment. Experiments on four LLaMA models demonstrate that HASS achieves 2.81x-4.05x wall-clock time speedup ratio averaging across three datasets, surpassing EAGLE-2 by 8%-20%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Consensual Assessment Technique (CAT) evaluates creativity through holistic expert judgments. We investigate the use of two advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), Claude-3-Opus and GPT-4o, to evaluate poetry by a methodology inspired by the CAT. Using a dataset of 90 poems, we found that these LLMs can surpass the results achieved by non-expert human judges at matching a ground truth based on publication venue, particularly when assessing smaller subsets of poems. Claude-3-Opus exhibited slightly superior performance than GPT-4o. We show that LLMs are viable tools for accurately assessing poetry, paving the way for their broader application into other creative domains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), the quality of training data has become crucial. Among the various types of training data, mathematical data plays a key role in enabling LLMs to acquire strong reasoning abilities. While high-quality open-source data is important, it is often insufficient for pre-training, necessitating the addition of synthetic math problems. However, synthetic math questions and answers can introduce inaccuracies, which may degrade both the training data and web data. Therefore, an effective method for cleaning synthetic math data is essential. In this paper, we propose the MathClean benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of math data cleaning models. The MathClean benchmark consists of 2,000 correct questions and 2,000 erroneous questions with additional 2,000 correct and erroneous answers sourced from augmented data based on GSM8K and MATH. Moreover, we also annotate error types for each question or answer, since it can assess whether models can correctly identify the error categories for future improvements. Finally, we present comprehensive evaluations using state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Our results demonstrate that even strong models like GPT-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 perform poorly on this benchmark, highlighting the utility of MathClean.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the field of autoregressive (AR) image generation, models based on the 'next-token prediction' paradigm of LLMs have shown comparable performance to diffusion models by reducing inductive biases. However, directly applying LLMs to complex image generation can struggle with reconstructing the structure and details of the image, impacting the accuracy and stability of generation. Additionally, the 'next-token prediction' paradigm in the AR model does not align with the contextual scanning and logical reasoning processes involved in human visual perception, limiting effective image generation. Chain-of-Thought (CoT), as a key reasoning capability of LLMs, utilizes reasoning prompts to guide the model, improving reasoning performance on complex natural language process (NLP) tasks, enhancing accuracy and stability of generation, and helping the model maintain contextual coherence and logical consistency, similar to human reasoning. Inspired by CoT from the field of NLP, we propose autoregressive Image Generation with Thoughtful Reasoning (IGTR) to enhance autoregressive image generation. IGTR adds reasoning prompts without modifying the model structure or raster generation order. Specifically, we design specialized image-related reasoning prompts for AR image generation to simulate the human reasoning process, which enhances contextual reasoning by allowing the model to first perceive overall distribution information before generating the image, and improve generation stability by increasing the inference steps. Compared to the AR method without prompts, our method shows outstanding performance and achieves an approximate improvement of 20%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While fusing heterogeneous open-source LLMs with varying architectures and sizes can potentially integrate the strengths of different models, existing fusion methods face significant challenges, such as vocabulary alignment and merging distribution matrices. These procedures are not only complex but also prone to introducing noise and errors. In this paper, we propose an implicit fusion method, Weighted-Reward Preference Optimization (WRPO), which leverages preference optimization between the source LLMs and the target LLM to transfer their capabilities effectively. WRPO eliminates the need for vocabulary alignment and matrix fusion and can be efficiently scaled to accommodate various LLMs. To address distributional deviations between the source and target LLMs, WRPO introduces a progressive adaptation strategy that gradually shifts reliance on preferred examples from the target LLM to the source LLMs. Extensive experiments on the MT-Bench, AlpacaEval-2, and Arena-Hard benchmarks demonstrate that WRPO consistently outperforms existing knowledge fusion methods and various fine-tuning baselines. When applied to LLaMA3-8B-Instruct as the target model, WRPO achieves a length-controlled win rate of 55.9% against GPT-4-Preview-1106 on AlpacaEval-2 and a win rate of 46.2% against GPT-4-0314 on Arena-Hard.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Although Aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained to refuse harmful requests, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Unfortunately, existing methods often focus on surface-level patterns, overlooking the deeper attack essences. As a result, defenses fail when attack prompts change, even though the underlying "attack essence" remains the same. To address this issue, we introduce EDDF, an \textbf{E}ssence-\textbf{D}riven \textbf{D}efense \textbf{F}ramework Against Jailbreak Attacks in LLMs. EDDF is a plug-and-play input-filtering method and operates in two stages: 1) offline essence database construction, and 2) online adversarial query detection. The key idea behind EDDF is to extract the "attack essence" from a diverse set of known attack instances and store it in an offline vector database. Experimental results demonstrate that EDDF significantly outperforms existing methods by reducing the Attack Success Rate by at least 20\%, underscoring its superior robustness against jailbreak attacks.

In this work, we introduce two complementary data sources, one generated by large language models (LLMs) to describe the stages of fungal growth and another comprising a diverse set of synthetic fungi images. These datasets are designed to enhance CLIPs zero-shot classification capabilities for fungi-related tasks. To ensure effective alignment between text and image data, we project them into CLIPs shared representation space, focusing on different fungal growth stages. We generate text using LLaMA3.2 to bridge modality gaps and synthetically create fungi images. Furthermore, we investigate knowledge transfer by comparing text outputs from different LLM techniques to refine classification across growth stages.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) empowers agents to associate time-sequenced visual observations with corresponding instructions to make sequential decisions. However, generalization remains a persistent challenge, particularly when dealing with visually diverse scenes or transitioning from simulated environments to real-world deployment. In this paper, we address the mismatch between human-centric instructions and quadruped robots with a low-height field of view, proposing a Ground-level Viewpoint Navigation (GVNav) approach to mitigate this issue. This work represents the first attempt to highlight the generalization gap in VLN across varying heights of visual observation in realistic robot deployments. Our approach leverages weighted historical observations as enriched spatiotemporal contexts for instruction following, effectively managing feature collisions within cells by assigning appropriate weights to identical features across different viewpoints. This enables low-height robots to overcome challenges such as visual obstructions and perceptual mismatches. Additionally, we transfer the connectivity graph from the HM3D and Gibson datasets as an extra resource to enhance spatial priors and a more comprehensive representation of real-world scenarios, leading to improved performance and generalizability of the waypoint predictor in real-world environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Ground-level Viewpoint Navigation (GVnav) approach significantly improves performance in both simulated environments and real-world deployments with quadruped robots.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have wide applications in the field of natural language processing(NLP), such as GPT-4 and Llama. However, with the exponential growth of model parameter sizes, LLMs bring significant resource overheads. Low-bit quantization, as a key technique, reduces memory usage and computational demands by decreasing the bit-width of model parameters, activations, and gradients. Previous quantization methods for LLMs have largely employed Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT). PTQ does not require any retraining of the original model, while QAT involves optimizing precision during training to achieve the best quantization parameters. The BitNet team proposed a radically different approach, where quantization is performed from the start of model training, utilizing low-precision binary weights during the training process. This approach has led to the emergence of many binary quantization techniques for large language models. This paper provides a comprehensive review of these binary quantization techniques. Specifically, we will introduce binary quantization techniques in deep neural networks and further explore their application to LLMs, reviewing their various contributions, implementations, and applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformers consist of diverse building blocks, such as embedding layers, normalization layers, self-attention mechanisms, and point-wise feedforward networks. Thus, understanding the differences and interactions among these blocks is important. In this paper, we uncover a clear Sharpness Disparity across these blocks, which emerges early in training and intriguingly persists throughout the training process. Motivated by this finding, we propose Blockwise Learning Rate (LR), a strategy that tailors the LR to each block's sharpness, accelerating large language model (LLM) pre-training. By integrating Blockwise LR into AdamW, we consistently achieve lower terminal loss and nearly $2\times$ speedup compared to vanilla AdamW. We demonstrate this acceleration across GPT-2 and LLaMA, with model sizes ranging from 0.12B to 1.1B and datasets of OpenWebText and MiniPile. Finally, we incorporate Blockwise LR into Adam-mini (Zhang et al., 2024), a recently proposed memory-efficient variant of Adam, achieving a combined $2\times$ speedup and $2\times$ memory saving. These results underscore the potential of exploiting the sharpness disparity to improve LLM training.

Some novel protocols given in this study enable reliable end-to-end quantum entanglement over Ethernet, ensuring the adaptability needed for implementing a stable quantum internet. Detailed time-delay analyses confirm that our protocols offer superior performance compared to existing methods, with total time delay kept within the decoherence threshold of qubits.

While existing methods excel at single-document comprehension, they often struggle with cross-document aggregation, particularly when resolving entity-dense questions like "What is the distribution of ACM Fellows among various fields of study?", which require integrating entity-centric insights from heterogeneous sources (e.g., Wikipedia pages). To address this gap, we introduce MEBench, a novel multi-document, multi-entity benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs' capacity to retrieve, consolidate, and reason over fragmented information. Our benchmark comprises 4,780 questions which are systematically categorized into three primary categories, further divided into eight distinct types, ensuring broad coverage of real-world multi-entity reasoning scenarios. Our experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Llama-3) and RAG pipelines reveal critical limitations: even advanced models achieve only 59% accuracy on MEBench. Our benchmark emphasizes the importance of completeness and factual precision of information extraction in MEQA tasks, using Entity-Attributed F1 (EA-F1) metric for granular evaluation of entity-level correctness and attribution validity. MEBench not only highlights systemic weaknesses in current LLM frameworks but also provides a foundation for advancing robust, entity-aware QA architectures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Biomedical ontologies, which comprehensively define concepts and relations for biomedical entities, are crucial for structuring and formalizing domain-specific information representations. Biomedical code mapping identifies similarity or equivalence between concepts from different ontologies. Obtaining high-quality mapping usually relies on automatic generation of unrefined mapping with ontology domain fine-tuned language models (LMs), followed by manual selections or corrections by coding experts who have extensive domain expertise and familiarity with ontology schemas. The LMs usually provide unrefined code mapping suggestions as a list of candidates without reasoning or supporting evidence, hence coding experts still need to verify each suggested candidate against ontology sources to pick the best matches. This is also a recurring task as ontology sources are updated regularly to incorporate new research findings. Consequently, the need of regular LM retraining and manual refinement make code mapping time-consuming and labour intensive. In this work, we created OntologyRAG, an ontology-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method that leverages the inductive biases from ontological knowledge graphs for in-context-learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs). Our solution grounds LLMs to knowledge graphs with unrefined mappings between ontologies and processes questions by generating an interpretable set of results that include prediction rational with mapping proximity assessment. Our solution doesn't require re-training LMs, as all ontology updates could be reflected by updating the knowledge graphs with a standard process. Evaluation results on a self-curated gold dataset show promises of using our method to enable coding experts to achieve better and faster code mapping. The code is available at https://github.com/iqvianlp/ontologyRAG.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance their capabilities as AI assistants by integrating external tools, allowing them to access a wider range of information. While recent LLMs are typically fine-tuned with tool usage examples during supervised fine-tuning (SFT), questions remain about their ability to develop robust tool-usage skills and can effectively generalize to unseen queries and tools. In this work, we present GenTool, a novel training framework that prepares LLMs for diverse generalization challenges in tool utilization. Our approach addresses two fundamental dimensions critical for real-world applications: Zero-to-One Generalization, enabling the model to address queries initially lacking a suitable tool by adopting and utilizing one when it becomes available, and Weak-to-Strong Generalization, allowing models to leverage enhanced versions of existing tools to solve queries. To achieve this, we develop synthetic training data simulating these two dimensions of tool usage and introduce a two-stage fine-tuning approach: optimizing tool ranking, then refining tool selection. Through extensive experiments across four generalization scenarios, we demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the tool-usage capabilities of LLMs ranging from 1B to 8B parameters, achieving performance that surpasses GPT-4o. Furthermore, our analysis also provides valuable insights into the challenges LLMs encounter in tool generalization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in decision-making and reasoning, particularly when integrated with various tools to effectively solve complex problems. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' tool usage face several limitations: (1) limited evaluation scenarios, often lacking assessments in real multi-turn dialogue contexts; (2) narrow evaluation dimensions, with insufficient detailed assessments of how LLMs use tools; and (3) reliance on LLMs or real API executions for evaluation, which introduces significant overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce ACEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing tool usage in LLMs. ACEBench categorizes data into three primary types based on evaluation methodology: Normal, Special, and Agent. "Normal" evaluates tool usage in basic scenarios; "Special" evaluates tool usage in situations with ambiguous or incomplete instructions; "Agent" evaluates tool usage through multi-agent interactions to simulate real-world, multi-turn dialogues. We conducted extensive experiments using ACEBench, analyzing various LLMs in-depth and providing a more granular examination of error causes across different data types.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Tool learning has emerged as a promising direction by extending Large Language Models' (LLMs) capabilities with external tools. Existing tool learning studies primarily focus on the general-purpose tool-use capability, which addresses explicit user requirements in instructions. However, they overlook the importance of personalized tool-use capability, leading to an inability to handle implicit user preferences. To address the limitation, we first formulate the task of personalized tool learning, which integrates user's interaction history towards personalized tool usage. To fill the gap of missing benchmarks, we construct PEToolBench, featuring diverse user preferences reflected in interaction history under three distinct personalized settings, and encompassing a wide range of tool-use scenarios. Moreover, we propose a framework PEToolLLaMA to adapt LLMs to the personalized tool learning task, which is trained through supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Extensive experiments on PEToolBench demonstrate the superiority of PEToolLLaMA over existing LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce Hibiki, a decoder-only model for simultaneous speech translation. Hibiki leverages a multistream language model to synchronously process source and target speech, and jointly produces text and audio tokens to perform speech-to-text and speech-to-speech translation. We furthermore address the fundamental challenge of simultaneous interpretation, which unlike its consecutive counterpart, where one waits for the end of the source utterance to start translating, adapts its flow to accumulate just enough context to produce a correct translation in real-time, chunk by chunk. To do so, we introduce a weakly-supervised method that leverages the perplexity of an off-the-shelf text translation system to identify optimal delays on a per-word basis and create aligned synthetic data. After supervised training, Hibiki performs adaptive, simultaneous speech translation with vanilla temperature sampling. On a French-English simultaneous speech translation task, Hibiki demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in translation quality, speaker fidelity and naturalness. Moreover, the simplicity of its inference process makes it compatible with batched translation and even real-time on-device deployment. We provide examples as well as models and inference code.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> User simulators are crucial for replicating human interactions with dialogue systems, supporting both collaborative training and automatic evaluation, especially for large language models (LLMs). However, existing simulators often rely solely on text utterances, missing implicit user traits such as personality, speaking style, and goals. In contrast, persona-based methods lack generalizability, as they depend on predefined profiles of famous individuals or archetypes. To address these challenges, we propose User Simulator with implicit Profiles (USP), a framework that infers implicit user profiles from human-machine conversations and uses them to generate more personalized and realistic dialogues. We first develop an LLM-driven extractor with a comprehensive profile schema. Then, we refine the simulation through conditional supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with cycle consistency, optimizing it at both the utterance and conversation levels. Finally, we adopt a diverse profile sampler to capture the distribution of real-world user profiles. Experimental results demonstrate that USP outperforms strong baselines in terms of authenticity and diversity while achieving comparable performance in consistency. Furthermore, dynamic multi-turn evaluations based on USP strongly align with mainstream benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Evaluating the graph comprehension and reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging and often incomplete. Existing benchmarks focus primarily on pure graph understanding, lacking a comprehensive evaluation across all graph types and detailed capability definitions. This paper presents GraCoRe, a benchmark for systematically assessing LLMs' graph comprehension and reasoning. GraCoRe uses a three-tier hierarchical taxonomy to categorize and test models on pure graph and heterogeneous graphs, subdividing capabilities into 10 distinct areas tested through 19 tasks. Our benchmark includes 11 datasets with 5,140 graphs of varying complexity. We evaluate four closed-source and eight open-source LLMs, conducting thorough analyses from both ability and task perspectives. Key findings reveal that OpenAI o1 model has amazing comprehension and reasoning capabilities, semantic enrichment enhances reasoning performance, node ordering impacts task success, and the ability to process longer texts does not necessarily improve graph comprehension or reasoning.GraCoRe is open-sourced at https://github.com/ZIKEYUAN/GraCoRe

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems (T-CPS) enhance safety and mobility by integrating cyber and physical transportation systems. A key component of T-CPS is the Digital Twin (DT), a virtual representation that enables simulation, analysis, and optimization through real-time data exchange and communication. Although existing studies have explored DTs for vehicles, communications, pedestrians, and traffic, real-world validations and implementations of DTs that encompass infrastructure, vehicles, signals, communications, and more remain limited due to several challenges. These include accessing real-world connected infrastructure, integrating heterogeneous, multi-sourced data, ensuring real-time data processing, and synchronizing the digital and physical systems. To address these challenges, this study develops a traffic DT based on a real-world connected vehicle corridor. Leveraging the Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) infrastructure in the corridor, along with communication, computing, and simulation technologies, the proposed DT accurately replicates physical vehicle behaviors, signal timing, communications, and traffic patterns within the virtual environment. Building upon the previous data pipeline, the digital system ensures robust synchronization with the physical environment. Moreover, the DT's scalable and redundant architecture enhances data integrity, making it capable of supporting future large-scale C-V2X deployments. Furthermore, its ability to provide feedback to the physical system is demonstrated through applications such as signal timing adjustments, vehicle advisory messages, and incident notifications. The proposed DT is a vital tool in T-CPS, enabling real-time traffic monitoring, prediction, and optimization to enhance the reliability and safety of transportation systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing scientific research, yet its growing integration into laboratory environments presents critical safety challenges. While large language models (LLMs) increasingly assist in tasks ranging from procedural guidance to autonomous experiment orchestration, an "illusion of understanding" may lead researchers to overestimate their reliability. Such overreliance is especially hazardous in high-stakes laboratory settings, where failures in hazard identification or risk assessment can result in severe accidents. To address these concerns, we propose the Laboratory Safety Benchmark (LabSafety Bench), a comprehensive framework that evaluates LLMs and vision language models (VLMs) on their ability to identify potential hazards, assess risks, and predict the consequences of unsafe actions in lab environments. LabSafety Bench comprises 765 multiple-choice questions aligned with US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) protocols, along with 520 realistic laboratory scenarios featuring dual evaluation tasks: the Hazards Identification Test and the Consequence Identification Test, with 4090 open-ended questions in total. Evaluations across eight proprietary models, seven open-weight LLMs, and four VLMs reveal that, despite advanced performance on structured assessments, no model achieves the safety threshold required for reliable operation. None scored above 75% on the Hazards Identification Test. Moreover, while proprietary models tend to excel in multiple-choice evaluations, their performance in open-ended, real-world scenario responses is comparable to that of open-source models. These findings underscore the urgent need for specialized evaluation frameworks to ensure the safe and responsible deployment of AI in laboratory settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Knowledge editing aims to update outdated or incorrect knowledge in large language models (LLMs). However, current knowledge editing methods have limited scalability for lifelong editing. This study explores the fundamental reason why knowledge editing fails in lifelong editing. We begin with the closed-form solution derived from linear associative memory, which underpins state-of-the-art knowledge editing methods. We extend the solution from single editing to lifelong editing, and through rigorous mathematical derivation, identify an interference term in the final solution, suggesting that editing knowledge may impact irrelevant knowledge. Further analysis of the interference term reveals a close relationship with superposition between knowledge representations. When knowledge superposition does not exist in language models, the interference term vanishes, allowing for lossless knowledge editing. Experiments across numerous language models reveal that knowledge superposition is universal, exhibiting high kurtosis, zero mean, and heavy-tailed distributions with clear scaling laws. Ultimately, by combining theory and experiments, we demonstrate that knowledge superposition is the fundamental reason for the failure of lifelong editing. Moreover, this is the first study to investigate knowledge editing from the perspective of superposition and provides a comprehensive observation of superposition across numerous real-world language models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We evaluated the viability of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to trigger and personalize content in Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) in digital health. As an interaction pattern representative of context-aware computing, JITAIs are being explored for their potential to support sustainable behavior change, adapting interventions to an individual's current context and needs. Challenging traditional JITAI implementation models, which face severe scalability and flexibility limitations, we tested GPT-4 for suggesting JITAIs in the use case of heart-healthy activity in cardiac rehabilitation. Using three personas representing patients affected by CVD with varying severeness and five context sets per persona, we generated 450 JITAI decisions and messages. These were systematically evaluated against those created by 10 laypersons (LayPs) and 10 healthcare professionals (HCPs). GPT-4-generated JITAIs surpassed human-generated intervention suggestions, outperforming both LayPs and HCPs across all metrics (i.e., appropriateness, engagement, effectiveness, and professionalism). These results highlight the potential of LLMs to enhance JITAI implementations in personalized health interventions, demonstrating how generative AI could revolutionize context-aware computing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) aim to predict whether a data sample belongs to the model's training set or not. Although prior research has extensively explored MIAs in Large Language Models (LLMs), they typically require accessing to complete output logits (\ie, \textit{logits-based attacks}), which are usually not available in practice. In this paper, we study the vulnerability of pre-trained LLMs to MIAs in the \textit{label-only setting}, where the adversary can only access generated tokens (text). We first reveal that existing label-only MIAs have minor effects in attacking pre-trained LLMs, although they are highly effective in inferring fine-tuning datasets used for personalized LLMs. We find that their failure stems from two main reasons, including better generalization and overly coarse perturbation. Specifically, due to the extensive pre-training corpora and exposing each sample only a few times, LLMs exhibit minimal robustness differences between members and non-members. This makes token-level perturbations too coarse to capture such differences.   To alleviate these problems, we propose \textbf{PETAL}: a label-only membership inference attack based on \textbf{PE}r-\textbf{T}oken sem\textbf{A}ntic simi\textbf{L}arity. Specifically, PETAL leverages token-level semantic similarity to approximate output probabilities and subsequently calculate the perplexity. It finally exposes membership based on the common assumption that members are `better' memorized and have smaller perplexity. We conduct extensive experiments on the WikiMIA benchmark and the more challenging MIMIR benchmark. Empirically, our PETAL performs better than the extensions of existing label-only attacks against personalized LLMs and even on par with other advanced logit-based attacks across all metrics on five prevalent open-source LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Evaluating the pedagogical capabilities of AI-based tutoring models is critical for making guided progress in the field. Yet, we lack a reliable, easy-to-use, and simple-to-run evaluation that reflects the pedagogical abilities of models. To fill this gap, we present MathTutorBench, an open-source benchmark for holistic tutoring model evaluation. MathTutorBench contains a collection of datasets and metrics that broadly cover tutor abilities as defined by learning sciences research in dialog-based teaching. To score the pedagogical quality of open-ended teacher responses, we train a reward model and show it can discriminate expert from novice teacher responses with high accuracy. We evaluate a wide set of closed- and open-weight models on MathTutorBench and find that subject expertise, indicated by solving ability, does not immediately translate to good teaching. Rather, pedagogy and subject expertise appear to form a trade-off that is navigated by the degree of tutoring specialization of the model. Furthermore, tutoring appears to become more challenging in longer dialogs, where simpler questioning strategies begin to fail. We release the benchmark, code, and leaderboard openly to enable rapid benchmarking of future models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive safety evaluations. In particular, the enhanced Chinese language proficiency of LLMs, combined with the unique characteristics and complexity of Chinese expressions, has driven the emergence of Chinese-specific benchmarks for safety assessment. However, these benchmarks generally fall short in effectively exposing LLM safety vulnerabilities. To address the gap, we introduce JailBench, the first comprehensive Chinese benchmark for evaluating deep-seated vulnerabilities in LLMs, featuring a refined hierarchical safety taxonomy tailored to the Chinese context. To improve generation efficiency, we employ a novel Automatic Jailbreak Prompt Engineer (AJPE) framework for JailBench construction, which incorporates jailbreak techniques to enhance assessing effectiveness and leverages LLMs to automatically scale up the dataset through context-learning. The proposed JailBench is extensively evaluated over 13 mainstream LLMs and achieves the highest attack success rate against ChatGPT compared to existing Chinese benchmarks, underscoring its efficacy in identifying latent vulnerabilities in LLMs, as well as illustrating the substantial room for improvement in the security and trustworthiness of LLMs within the Chinese context. Our benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/STAIR-BUPT/JailBench.
