                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) use the key-value (KV) cache to significantly accelerate inference by storing the key and value embeddings of past tokens. However, this cache consumes significant GPU memory. In this work, we introduce HashEvict, an algorithm that uses locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to compress the KV cache. HashEvict quickly locates tokens in the cache that are cosine dissimilar to the current query token. This is achieved by computing the Hamming distance between binarized Gaussian projections of the current token query and cached token keys, with a projection length much smaller than the embedding dimension. We maintain a lightweight binary structure in GPU memory to facilitate these calculations. Unlike existing compression strategies that compute attention to determine token retention, HashEvict makes these decisions pre-attention, thereby reducing computational costs. Additionally, HashEvict is dynamic - at every decoding step, the key and value of the current token replace the embeddings of a token expected to produce the lowest attention score. We demonstrate that HashEvict can compress the KV cache by 30%-70% while maintaining high performance across reasoning, multiple-choice, long-context retrieval and summarization tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The current Domain Name System (DNS), as a core infrastructure of the internet, exhibits several shortcomings: its centralized architecture leads to censorship risks and single points of failure, making domain name resolution vulnerable to attacks. The lack of encryption in the resolution process exposes it to DNS hijacking and cache poisoning attacks. Additionally, the high operational costs limit participation and innovation among small to medium-sized users. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Decentralized Domain Name Service (DDNS) based on blockchain (Phicoin) and distributed storage (IPFS). By leveraging the immutability of blockchain and the content verification of IPFS, the system achieves decentralized storage and distribution of domain name records, eliminating the centralized dependencies of traditional DNS. With a block time of 15 seconds, the system supports rapid broadcasting of domain name updates, significantly improving resolution efficiency. The DDNS aims to serve as a complement or backup to the existing DNS system, providing a pollution-resistant, censorship-resistant, high-performance, and low-cost domain name resolution solution, offering a new technical path for the security and stability of the internet.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Techniques enabling large language models (LLMs) to "think more" by generating and attending to intermediate reasoning steps have shown promise in solving complex problems. However, the standard approaches generate sequences of discrete tokens immediately before responding, and so they can incur significant latency costs and be challenging to optimize. In this work, we demonstrate that a frozen LLM can be augmented with an offline coprocessor that operates on the model's key-value (kv) cache. This coprocessor augments the cache with a set of latent embeddings designed to improve the fidelity of subsequent decoding. We train this coprocessor using the language modeling loss from the decoder on standard pretraining data, while keeping the decoder itself frozen. This approach enables the model to learn, in an end-to-end differentiable fashion, how to distill additional computation into its kv-cache. Because the decoder remains unchanged, the coprocessor can operate offline and asynchronously, and the language model can function normally if the coprocessor is unavailable or if a given cache is deemed not to require extra computation. We show experimentally that when a cache is augmented, the decoder achieves lower perplexity on numerous subsequent tokens. Furthermore, even without any task-specific training, our experiments demonstrate that cache augmentation consistently reduces perplexity and improves performance across a range of reasoning-intensive tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Space weather impact assessment is constrained by the lack of available asset information to undertake modeling of Geomagnetically Induced Currents (GICs) in Extra High Voltage electricity infrastructure networks. The U.S. National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan identifies underutilized data as a central issue for improving risk assessment, motivating this research. Accurate GIC prediction is generally not possible without information on the electrical circuit, therefore we define a reproducible method based on open-source data, which enables risk analysts to collect their own substation component data. This process converts OpenStreetMap (OSM) substation locations to high-resolution, component-level mapping of electricity transmission assets by utilizing an innovative web-browser platform to facilitate component annotation. As a case study example, we convert an initial 1,313 high-voltage (>115 kV) substations to 52,273 substation components via Google Earth APIs utilizing low-altitude, satellite, and Streetview imagery. We find that a total of 41,642 substation components (79.6%) connect to the highest substation voltage levels (>345 kV) and are possibly susceptible to GIC, with a total of 7,949 transformers identified. Compared to the initial OSM baseline, we provide new detailed insights on voltage levels, line capacities, and substation configurations. Two validation workshops were undertaken to align the method and data with GIC assessment needs. The approach ensures consistency and rapid scalability, enabling users to quickly count components via a flexible web-browser application.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid development of the aviation Internet of Things (IoT) has positioned in-flight connectivity (IFC) as one of its critical applications. Space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN) are essential for ensuring the performance of IFC by enabling seamless and reliable connectivity. However, most existing research treats satellites merely as transparent forwarding nodes and overlooks their potential caching capabilities to enhance IFC data rates. In this article, we explore an IFC-oriented SAGIN where satellites and ground stations (GSs) work together to transmit content to airborne passengers, thereby facilitating airborne communication. By categorizing files into cached (instantly accessible via satellites) and non-cached files (available only through GSs), this article pioneers the integration of multiple inter-satellite links (ISLs) into the IFC framework, thus innovating the content delivery process for both types of files. To minimize the average delay of content delivery, we formulate the corresponding optimization problems: 1) For cached files, we propose an exact penalty-based method to determine the satellite association scheme. 2) For non-cached files, we present an efficient algorithm based on alternating optimization to jointly optimize satellite association and GS bandwidth allocation. Our proposed framework is low in complexity, paving the way for high-speed Internet connectivity for aviation passengers. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed IFC framework for SAGIN.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in solving various natural language processing tasks and are now widely offered as services. LLM services enable users to accomplish tasks without requiring specialized knowledge, simply by paying service providers. However, numerous providers offer various LLM services with variations in pricing, latency, and performance. These factors are also affected by different invocation methods, such as the choice of context and the use of cache, which lead to unpredictable and uncontrollable service cost and quality. Consequently, utilizing various LLM services invocation methods to construct an effective (cost-saving, low-latency and high-performance) invocation strategy that best meets task demands becomes a pressing challenge. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of methods help LLM services to be invoked efficiently. Technically, we define the problem of constructing an effective LLM services invocation strategy, and based on this, propose a unified LLM service invocation framework. The framework classifies existing methods into four categories: input abstraction, semantic cache, solution design, and output enhancement, which can be used separately or jointly during the invocation life cycle. We discuss the methods in each category and compare them to provide valuable guidance for researchers. Finally, we emphasize the open challenges in this domain and shed light on future research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Learned lossless image compression has achieved significant advancements in recent years. However, existing methods often rely on training amortized generative models on massive datasets, resulting in sub-optimal probability distribution estimation for specific testing images during encoding process. To address this challenge, we explore the connection between the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle and Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL), leading to the development of a novel content-adaptive approach for learned lossless image compression, dubbed CALLIC. Specifically, we first propose a content-aware autoregressive self-attention mechanism by leveraging convolutional gating operations, termed Masked Gated ConvFormer (MGCF), and pretrain MGCF on training dataset. Cache then Crop Inference (CCI) is proposed to accelerate the coding process. During encoding, we decompose pre-trained layers, including depth-wise convolutions, using low-rank matrices and then adapt the incremental weights on testing image by Rate-guided Progressive Fine-Tuning (RPFT). RPFT fine-tunes with gradually increasing patches that are sorted in descending order by estimated entropy, optimizing learning process and reducing adaptation time. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that CALLIC sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for learned lossless image compression.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Model autoscaling is the key mechanism to achieve serverless model-as-a-service, but it faces a fundamental trade-off between scaling speed and storage/memory usage to cache parameters, and cannot meet frequent scaling requirements across multiple hosts. The key problem is that data plane performance is slow, and scaled instances remain stopped while parameters are loading. We first show that data plane can be made fast with no/O(1) caching by loading parameters through the compute network between GPUs because: (1) its speed is comparable host cache and is underutilized; (2) scaling multiple instances requires no or O(1) caching with network-optimized multicast. Second, autoscaling can be made live by breaking the scaling abstraction from a coarse-grained instance-level to a fine-grained layer-level. This allows us to offload the layer computation from the overloaded serving instances to the scaled instance with cooperative execution, thus handles cases even when the compute network is not sufficiently fast. Our system BLITZSCALE reduces the serving tail latencies by up to 86% without caching, and we achieve comparable performance (or even better) to an optimal setup where all the parameters are cached at all the host for autoscaling.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Content creators often use music to enhance their videos, from soundtracks in movies to background music in video blogs and social media content. However, identifying the best music for a video can be a difficult and time-consuming task. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for automatically retrieving a matching music clip for a given video, and vice versa. Our approach leverages annotated music labels, as well as the inherent artistic correspondence between visual and music elements. Distinct from previous cross-modal music retrieval works, our method combines both self-supervised and supervised training objectives. We use self-supervised and label-supervised contrastive learning to train a joint embedding space between music and video. We show the effectiveness of our approach by using music genre labels for the supervised training component, and our framework can be generalized to other music annotations (e.g., emotion, instrument, etc.). Furthermore, our method enables fine-grained control over how much the retrieval process focuses on self-supervised vs. label information at inference time. We evaluate the learned embeddings through a variety of video-to-music and music-to-video retrieval tasks. Our experiments show that the proposed approach successfully combines self-supervised and supervised objectives and is effective for controllable music-video retrieval.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Virtual-to-physical address translation is a critical performance bottleneck in paging-based virtual memory systems. The Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) accelerates address translation by caching frequently accessed mappings, but TLB misses lead to costly page walks. Hardware and software techniques address this challenge. Hardware approaches enhance TLB reach through system-level support, while software optimizations include TLB prefetching, replacement policies, superpages, and page size adjustments. Prefetching Page Table Entries (PTEs) for future accesses reduces bottlenecks but may incur overhead from incorrect predictions. Integrating an Agile TLB Prefetcher (ATP) with SBFP optimizes performance by leveraging page table locality and dynamically identifying essential free PTEs during page walks. Predictive replacement policies further improve TLB performance. Traditional LRU replacement is limited to near-instant references, while advanced policies like SRRIP, GHRP, SHiP, SDBP, and CHiRP enhance performance by targeting specific inefficiencies. CHiRP, tailored for L2 TLBs, surpasses other policies by leveraging control flow history to detect dead blocks, utilizing L2 TLB entries for learning instead of sampling. These integrated techniques collectively address key challenges in virtual memory management.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Few-shot defect multi-classification (FSDMC) is an emerging trend in quality control within industrial manufacturing. However, current FSDMC research often lacks generalizability due to its focus on specific datasets. Additionally, defect classification heavily relies on contextual information within images, and existing methods fall short of effectively extracting this information. To address these challenges, we propose a general FSDMC framework called MVREC, which offers two primary advantages: (1) MVREC extracts general features for defect instances by incorporating the pre-trained AlphaCLIP model. (2) It utilizes a region-context framework to enhance defect features by leveraging mask region input and multi-view context augmentation. Furthermore, Few-shot Zip-Adapter(-F) classifiers within the model are introduced to cache the visual features of the support set and perform few-shot classification. We also introduce MVTec-FS, a new FSDMC benchmark based on MVTec AD, which includes 1228 defect images with instance-level mask annotations and 46 defect types. Extensive experiments conducted on MVTec-FS and four additional datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in general defect classification and its ability to incorporate contextual information to improve classification performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language model (LLM) serving has transformed from stateless to stateful systems, utilizing techniques like context caching and disaggregated inference. These optimizations extend the lifespan and domain of the KV cache, necessitating a new architectural approach. We present MemServe, a unified system that integrates both inter-request and intra-request optimizations. MemServe introduces MemPool, an elastic memory pool managing distributed memory and KV caches across serving instances. Using MemPool APIs, MemServe combines context caching with disaggregated inference for the first time, supported by a global scheduler that enhances cache reuse through a global prompt tree-based locality-aware policy. Tests show that MemServe significantly improves job completion time and time-to-first-time.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The fundamental caching problem in networks asks to find an allocation of contents to a network of caches with the aim of maximizing the cache hit rate. Despite the problem's importance to a variety of research areas -- including not only content delivery, but also edge intelligence and inference -- and the extensive body of work on empirical aspects of caching, very little is known about the exact boundaries of tractability for the problem beyond its general NP-hardness. We close this gap by performing a comprehensive complexity-theoretic analysis of the problem through the lens of the parameterized complexity paradigm, which is designed to provide more precise statements regarding algorithmic tractability than classical complexity. Our results include algorithmic lower and upper bounds which together establish the conditions under which the caching problem becomes tractable.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This technical report presents Yi-Lightning, our latest flagship large language model (LLM). It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall on Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in specialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts. Yi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, featuring advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with optimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses comprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for multi-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling. Furthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a four-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training, post-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing infrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment and inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further evaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates competitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable disparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic human preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of conventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent and powerful AI systems for practical applications. Yi-Lightning is now available through our developer platform at https://platform.lingyiwanwu.com.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in applications such as chatbots, code editors, and conversational agents. A key feature of LLMs is their ability to engage in multi-turn interactions with humans or external tools, enabling a wide range of tasks. Each new request in a multi-turn interaction depends on the intermediate state, specifically the key-value (K,V) caches, from previous requests in the ongoing interaction. Existing serving engines either recompute the K,V caches or offload them to main memory. Profiling reveals that recomputation can result in over 99% of processed tokens being redundant. On the other hand, offloading K,V caches from GPU memory makes inference serving stateful, leading to load imbalances across the cluster. To address these challenges, we developed SYMPHONY. SYMPHONY leverages the observation that multi-turn work loads provide additional hints that allow K,V caches to be migrated off the critical serving path. By utilizing these hints, SYMPHONY dynamically migrates K,V caches to enable finegrained scheduling of inference requests. Our experiments demonstrate that SYMPHONY can handle over 8x the number of requests compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with a similar latency profile.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Important memory-bound kernels, such as linear algebra, convolutions, and stencils, rely on SIMD instructions as well as optimizations targeting improved vectorized data traversal and data re-use to attain satisfactory performance. On on temporary CPU architectures, the hardware prefetcher is of key importance for efficient utilization of the memory hierarchy. In this paper, we demonstrate that transforming a memory access pattern consisting of a single stride to one that concurrently accesses multiple strides, can boost the utilization of the hardware prefetcher, and in turn improves the performance of memory-bound kernels significantly. Using a set of micro-benchmarks, we establish that accessing memory in a multi-strided manner enables more cache lines to be concurrently brought into the cache, resulting in improved cache hit ratios and higher effective memory bandwidth without the introduction of costly software prefetch instructions. Subsequently, we show that multi-strided variants of a collection of six memory-bound dense compute kernels outperform state-of-the-art counterparts on three different micro-architectures. More specifically, for kernels among which Matrix Vector Multiplication, Convolution Stencil and kernels from PolyBench, we achieve significant speedups of up to 12.55x over Polly, 2.99x over MKL, 1.98x over OpenBLAS, 1.08x over Halide and 1.87x over OpenCV. The code transformation to take advantage of multi-strided memory access is a natural extension of the loop unroll and loop interchange techniques, allowing this method to be incorporated into compiler pipelines in the future.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Model counting is a fundamental task that involves determining the number of satisfying assignments to a logical formula, typically in conjunctive normal form (CNF). While CNF model counting has received extensive attention over recent decades, interest in Pseudo-Boolean (PB) model counting is just emerging partly due to the greater flexibility of PB formulas. As such, we observed feature gaps in existing PB counters such as a lack of support for projected and incremental settings, which could hinder adoption. In this work, our main contribution is the introduction of the PB model counter PBCount2, the first exact PB model counter with support for projected and incremental model counting. Our counter, PBCount2, uses our Least Occurrence Weighted Min Degree (LOW-MD) computation ordering heuristic to support projected model counting and a cache mechanism to enable incremental model counting. In our evaluations, PBCount2 completed at least 1.40x the number of benchmarks of competing methods for projected model counting and at least 1.18x of competing methods in incremental model counting.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained traction as a powerful approach for enhancing language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, RAG introduces challenges such as retrieval latency, potential errors in document selection, and increased system complexity. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) featuring significantly extended context windows, this paper proposes an alternative paradigm, cache-augmented generation (CAG) that bypasses real-time retrieval. Our method involves preloading all relevant resources, especially when the documents or knowledge for retrieval are of a limited and manageable size, into the LLM's extended context and caching its runtime parameters. During inference, the model utilizes these preloaded parameters to answer queries without additional retrieval steps. Comparative analyses reveal that CAG eliminates retrieval latency and minimizes retrieval errors while maintaining context relevance. Performance evaluations across multiple benchmarks highlight scenarios where long-context LLMs either outperform or complement traditional RAG pipelines. These findings suggest that, for certain applications, particularly those with a constrained knowledge base, CAG provide a streamlined and efficient alternative to RAG, achieving comparable or superior results with reduced complexity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in complex workflows, where different LLMs and fine-tuned variants collaboratively address complex tasks. However, these systems face significant inefficiencies due to redundant context processing of the shared context. We propose DroidSpeak, a framework that optimizes context sharing between fine-tuned LLMs derived from the same foundational model. DroidSpeak identifies critical layers in the KV cache and selectively recomputes them, enabling effective reuse of intermediate data while maintaining high accuracy.   Our approach balances computational efficiency and task fidelity, significantly reducing inference latency and throughput bottlenecks. Experiments on diverse datasets and model pairs demonstrate that DroidSpeak achieves up to 3x higher throughputs and 2.6x faster prefill times with negligible accuracy loss compared to full recomputation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern processors implement a decoupled front-end in the form of Fetch Directed Instruction Prefetching (FDIP) to avoid front-end stalls. FDIP is driven by the Branch Prediction Unit (BPU), relying on the BPU's accuracy and branch target tracking structures to speculatively fetch instructions into the Instruction Cache (L1I). As data center applications become more complex, their code footprints also grow, resulting in an increase in Branch Target Buffer (BTB) misses. FDIP can alleviate L1I cache misses, but when it encounters a BTB miss, the BPU may not identify the current instruction as a branch to FDIP. This can prevent FDIP from prefetching or cause it to speculate down the wrong path, further polluting the L1I cache. We observe that the vast majority, 75%, of BTB-missing, unidentified branches are actually present in instruction cache lines that FDIP has previously fetched but, these missing branches have not yet been decoded and inserted into the BTB. This is because the instruction line is decoded from an entry point (which is the target of the previous taken branch) till an exit point (the taken branch). Branch instructions present in the ignored portion of the cache line we call them "Shadow Branches". Here we present Skeia, a novel shadow branch decoding technique that identifies and decodes unused bytes in cache lines fetched by FDIP, inserting them into a Shadow Branch Buffer (SBB). The SBB is accessed in parallel with the BTB, allowing FDIP to speculate despite a BTB miss. With a minimal storage state of 12.25KB, Skeia delivers a geomean speedup of ~5.7% over an 8K-entry BTB (78KB) and ~2% versus adding an equal amount of state to the BTB across 16 front-end bound applications. Since many branches stored in the SBB are unique compared to those in a similarly sized BTB, we consistently observe greater performance gains with Skeia across all examined sizes until saturation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficient KV cache management in LLMs is crucial for long-context tasks like RAG and summarization. Existing KV cache compression methods enforce a fixed pattern, neglecting task-specific characteristics and reducing the retention of essential information. However, we observe distinct activation patterns across layers in various tasks, highlighting the need for adaptive strategies tailored to each task's unique demands. Based on this insight, we propose DynamicKV, a method that dynamically optimizes token retention by adjusting the number of tokens retained at each layer to adapt to the specific task. DynamicKV establishes global and per-layer maximum KV cache budgets, temporarily retaining the maximum budget for the current layer, and periodically updating the KV cache sizes of all preceding layers during inference. Our method retains only 1.7% of the KV cache size while achieving ~85% of the Full KV cache performance on LongBench. Notably, even under extreme compression (0.9%), DynamicKV surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 11% in the Needle-in-a-Haystack test using Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2. The code will be released.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion transformers have shown significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis at the expense of huge computation costs. To address this problem, feature caching methods have been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by caching the features in previous timesteps and reusing them in the following timesteps. However, previous caching methods ignore that different tokens exhibit different sensitivities to feature caching, and feature caching on some tokens may lead to 10$\times$ more destruction to the overall generation quality compared with other tokens. In this paper, we introduce token-wise feature caching, allowing us to adaptively select the most suitable tokens for caching, and further enable us to apply different caching ratios to neural layers in different types and depths. Extensive experiments on PixArt-$\alpha$, OpenSora, and DiT demonstrate our effectiveness in both image and video generation with no requirements for training. For instance, 2.36$\times$ and 1.93$\times$ acceleration are achieved on OpenSora and PixArt-$\alpha$ with almost no drop in generation quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Machine learning (ML) systems that guarantee security and privacy often rely on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) as a cornerstone technique, enabling computations on encrypted data without exposing sensitive information. However, a critical limitation of FHE is its computational inefficiency, making it impractical for large-scale applications. In this work, we propose \textit{Nemesis}, a framework that accelerates FHE-based systems without compromising accuracy or security. The design of Nemesis is inspired by Rache (SIGMOD'23), which introduced a caching mechanism for encrypted integers and scalars. Nemesis extends this idea with more advanced caching techniques and mathematical tools, enabling efficient operations over multi-slot FHE schemes and overcoming Rache's limitations to support general plaintext structures. We formally prove the security of Nemesis under standard cryptographic assumptions and evaluate its performance extensively on widely used datasets, including MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10. Experimental results show that Nemesis significantly reduces the computational overhead of FHE-based ML systems, paving the way for broader adoption of privacy-preserving technologies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Post-training quantization (PTQ) of large language models (LLMs) holds the promise in reducing the prohibitive computational cost at inference time. Quantization of all weight, activation and key-value (KV) cache tensors to 4-bit without significantly degrading generalizability is challenging, due to the high quantization error caused by extreme outliers in activations. To tackle this problem, we propose ResQ, a PTQ method that pushes further the state-of-the-art. By means of principal component analysis (PCA), it identifies a low-rank subspace (in practice 1/8 of the hidden dimension) in which activation variances are highest, and keep the coefficients within this subspace in high precision, e.g. 8-bit, while quantizing the rest to 4-bit. Within each subspace, invariant random rotation is applied to further suppress outliers. We show that this is a provably optimal mixed precision quantization scheme that minimizes error. With the Llama families of models, we demonstrate that ResQ outperforms recent uniform and mixed precision PTQ methods on a variety of benchmarks, achieving up to 33% lower perplexity on Wikitext than the next best method SpinQuant, and a 2.4x speedup over 16-bit baseline.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Concurrent computation and communication (C3) is a pervasive paradigm in ML and other domains, making its performance optimization crucial. In this paper, we carefully characterize C3 in ML on GPUs, which are most widely deployed for ML training and inference. We observe that while C3 leads to performance uplifts, the uplifts are far lower than ideal speedups (serial computation and communication versus maximum of computation or communication; all times from isolated executions). C3 on average achieves only 21% of ideal speedup, this is due to known challenges of compute and memory interference between concurrent GPU kernels (that is, sharing of GPU's compute units, caches and HBM).   To attain better performance for C3, first, we evaluate dual strategies of schedule prioritization and careful resource partitioning of compute units on GPUs to push performance attained with C3 (on average 42% of ideal speedup). We also provide heuristics that can guide a runtime while employing these strategies. To further enhance C3 performance, we propose to mitigate C3 interference by offloading communication tasks to the GPU's DMA engines. To this end, we build Concurrent Communication CoLlectives (ConCCL) proof-of-concepts that harness DMA engines for communication. We show how ConCCL considerably closes the gap between realized and ideal speedup for C3 (on average 72% of ideal speedup is realized, up to 1.67x speedup). Overall, our work makes a strong case for GPU DMA engine advancements to better support C3 on GPUs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) with long context windows have gained significant attention. However, the KV cache, stored to avoid re-computation, becomes a bottleneck. Various dynamic sparse or TopK-based attention approximation methods have been proposed to leverage the common insight that attention is sparse. In this paper, we first show that TopK attention itself suffers from quality degradation in certain downstream tasks because attention is not always as sparse as expected. Rather than selecting the keys and values with the highest attention scores, sampling with theoretical guarantees can provide a better estimation for attention output. To make the sampling-based approximation practical in LLM generation, we propose MagicPIG, a heterogeneous system based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). MagicPIG significantly reduces the workload of attention computation while preserving high accuracy for diverse tasks. MagicPIG stores the LSH hash tables and runs the attention computation on the CPU, which allows it to serve longer contexts and larger batch sizes with high approximation accuracy. MagicPIG can improve decoding throughput by up to $5\times$ across various GPU hardware and achieve 54ms decoding latency on a single RTX 4090 for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model with a context of 96k tokens.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Continual Federated Learning (CFL) allows distributed devices to collaboratively learn novel concepts from continuously shifting training data while avoiding knowledge forgetting of previously seen tasks. To tackle this challenge, most current CFL approaches rely on extensive rehearsal of previous data. Despite effectiveness, rehearsal comes at a cost to memory, and it may also violate data privacy. Considering these, we seek to apply regularization techniques to CFL by considering their cost-efficient properties that do not require sample caching or rehearsal. Specifically, we first apply traditional regularization techniques to CFL and observe that existing regularization techniques, especially synaptic intelligence, can achieve promising results under homogeneous data distribution but fail when the data is heterogeneous. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective regularization algorithm for CFL named FedSSI, which tailors the synaptic intelligence for the CFL with heterogeneous data settings. FedSSI can not only reduce computational overhead without rehearsal but also address the data heterogeneity issue. Extensive experiments show that FedSSI achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

However, a notable discrepancy persists between the sparse collaborative semantics typically found in recommendation systems and the dense token representations within LLMs. In our study, we propose a novel framework that harmoniously merges traditional recommendation models with the prowess of LLMs. We initiate this integration by transforming ItemIDs into sequences that align semantically with the LLMs space, through the proposed Alignment Tokenization module. Additionally, we design a series of specialized supervised learning tasks aimed at aligning collaborative signals with the subtleties of natural language semantics. To ensure practical applicability, we optimize online inference by pre-caching the top-K results for each user, reducing latency and improving effciency. Extensive experimental evidence indicates that our model markedly improves recall metrics and displays remarkable scalability of recommendation systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video large language models (VLLMs) have significantly advanced recently in processing complex video content, yet their inference efficiency remains constrained because of the high computational cost stemming from the thousands of visual tokens generated from the video inputs. We empirically observe that, unlike single image inputs, VLLMs typically attend visual tokens from different frames at different decoding iterations, making a one-shot pruning strategy prone to removing important tokens by mistake. Motivated by this, we present DyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token representation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play temporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging redundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune spatially redundant tokens selectively. It ensures high-quality inference by dynamically retaining the critical tokens at each decoding step. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DyCoke can outperform the prior SoTA counterparts, achieving 1.5X inference speedup, 1.4X memory reduction against the baseline VLLM, while still improving the performance, with no training.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Key-Value (KV) cache has become a bottleneck of LLMs for long-context generation. Despite the numerous efforts in this area, the optimization for the decoding phase is generally ignored. However, we believe such optimization is crucial, especially for long-output generation tasks based on the following two observations: (i) Excessive compression during the prefill phase, which requires specific full context impairs the comprehension of the reasoning task; (ii) Deviation of heavy hitters occurs in the reasoning tasks with long outputs. Therefore, SCOPE, a simple yet efficient framework that separately performs KV cache optimization during the prefill and decoding phases, is introduced. Specifically, the KV cache during the prefill phase is preserved to maintain the essential information, while a novel strategy based on sliding is proposed to select essential heavy hitters for the decoding phase. Memory usage and memory transfer are further optimized using adaptive and discontinuous strategies. Extensive experiments on LongGenBench show the effectiveness and generalization of SCOPE and its compatibility as a plug-in to other prefill-only KV compression methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The efficiency of large vision-language models (LVLMs) is constrained by the computational bottleneck of the attention mechanism during the prefill phase and the memory bottleneck of fetching the key-value (KV) cache in the decoding phase, particularly in scenarios involving high-resolution images or videos. Visual content often exhibits substantial redundancy, resulting in highly sparse attention maps within LVLMs. This sparsity can be leveraged to accelerate attention computation or compress the KV cache through various approaches. However, most studies focus on addressing only one of these bottlenecks and do not adequately support dynamic adjustment of sparsity concerning distinct layers or tasks. In this paper, we present ZipVL, an efficient inference framework designed for LVLMs through a dynamic ratio allocation strategy of important tokens. This ratio is adaptively determined based on the layer-specific distribution of attention scores, rather than fixed hyper-parameters, thereby improving efficiency for less complex tasks while maintaining high performance for more challenging ones. Then we select important tokens based on their normalized attention scores and perform sparse attention mechanism solely on those important tokens, reducing the latency in the prefill phase. Tokens deemed less important will be discarded to reduce KV cache size, alleviating the memory bottleneck in the decoding phase. Our experiments demonstrate that ZipVL can accelerate the prefill phase by 2.3$\times$ and improve decoding throughput by 2.8$\times$, with a minimal accuracy reduction of only 0.5\% on VQAv2 benchmark over LLaVA-Next-13B model, effectively enhancing the generation efficiency of LVLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding sensor data can be challenging for non-experts because of the complexity and unique semantic meanings of sensor modalities. This calls for intuitive and effective methods to present sensor information. However, creating intuitive sensor data visualizations presents three key challenges: the variability of sensor readings, gaps in domain comprehension, and the dynamic nature of sensor data. To address these issues, we develop Vivar, a novel AR system that integrates multi-modal sensor data and presents 3D volumetric content for visualization. In particular, we introduce a cross-modal embedding approach that maps sensor data into a pre-trained visual embedding space through barycentric interpolation. This allows for accurate and continuous integration of multi-modal sensor information. Vivar also incorporates sensor-aware AR scene generation using foundation models and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) without requiring domain expertise. In addition, Vivar leverages latent reuse and caching strategies to accelerate 2D and AR content generation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our system achieves 11$\times$ latency reduction without compromising quality. A user study involving over 485 participants, including domain experts, demonstrates Vivar's effectiveness in accuracy, consistency, and real-world applicability, paving the way for more intuitive sensor data visualization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Processing long contexts poses a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to their inherent context-window limitations and the computational burden of extensive key-value (KV) activations, which severely impact efficiency. For information-seeking tasks, full context perception is often unnecessary, as a query's information needs can dynamically range from localized details to a global perspective, depending on its complexity. However, existing methods struggle to adapt effectively to these dynamic information needs.   In the paper, we propose a method for processing long-context information-seeking tasks via query-guided Activation Refilling (ACRE). ACRE constructs a Bi-layer KV Cache for long contexts, where the layer-1 (L1) cache compactly captures global information, and the layer-2 (L2) cache provides detailed and localized information. ACRE establishes a proxying relationship between the two caches, allowing the input query to attend to the L1 cache and dynamically refill it with relevant entries from the L2 cache. This mechanism integrates global understanding with query-specific local details, thus improving answer decoding. Experiments on a variety of long-context information-seeking datasets demonstrate ACRE's effectiveness, achieving improvements in both performance and efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e., separators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in vision understanding, reasoning, and interaction. However, the inference computation and memory increase progressively with the generation of output tokens during decoding, directly affecting the efficacy of MLLMs. Existing methods attempt to reduce the vision context redundancy to achieve efficient MLLMs. Unfortunately, the efficiency benefits of the vision context reduction in the prefill stage gradually diminish during the decoding stage. To address this problem, we proposed a dynamic vision-language context sparsification framework Dynamic-LLaVA, which dynamically reduces the redundancy of vision context in the prefill stage and decreases the memory and computation overhead of the generated language context during decoding. Dynamic-LLaVA designs a tailored sparsification inference scheme for different inference modes, i.e., prefill, decoding with and without KV cache, to achieve efficient inference of MLLMs. In practice, Dynamic-LLaVA can reduce computation consumption by $\sim$75\% in the prefill stage. Meanwhile, throughout the entire generation process of MLLMs, Dynamic-LLaVA reduces the $\sim$50\% computation consumption under decoding without KV cache, while saving $\sim$50\% GPU memory overhead when decoding with KV cache, due to the vision-language context sparsification. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that Dynamic-LLaVA achieves efficient inference for MLLMs with negligible understanding and generation ability degradation or even performance gains compared to the full-context inference baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Policies have become widely used in Imitation Learning, offering several appealing properties, such as generating multimodal and discontinuous behavior. As models are becoming larger to capture more complex capabilities, their computational demands increase, as shown by recent scaling laws. Therefore, continuing with the current architectures will present a computational roadblock. To address this gap, we propose Mixture-of-Denoising Experts (MoDE) as a novel policy for Imitation Learning. MoDE surpasses current state-of-the-art Transformer-based Diffusion Policies while enabling parameter-efficient scaling through sparse experts and noise-conditioned routing, reducing both active parameters by 40% and inference costs by 90% via expert caching. Our architecture combines this efficient scaling with noise-conditioned self-attention mechanism, enabling more effective denoising across different noise levels. MoDE achieves state-of-the-art performance on 134 tasks in four established imitation learning benchmarks (CALVIN and LIBERO). Notably, by pretraining MoDE on diverse robotics data, we achieve 4.01 on CALVIN ABC and 0.95 on LIBERO-90. It surpasses both CNN-based and Transformer Diffusion Policies by an average of 57% across 4 benchmarks, while using 90% fewer FLOPs and fewer active parameters compared to default Diffusion Transformer architectures. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablations on MoDE's components, providing insights for designing efficient and scalable Transformer architectures for Diffusion Policies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Instance segmentation algorithms in remote sensing are typically based on conventional methods, limiting their application to seen scenarios and closed-set predictions. In this work, we propose a novel task called zero-shot remote sensing instance segmentation, aimed at identifying aerial objects that are absent from training data. Challenges arise when classifying aerial categories with high inter-class similarity and intra-class variance. Besides, the domain gap between vision-language models' pretraining datasets and remote sensing datasets hinders the zero-shot capabilities of the pretrained model when it is directly applied to remote sensing images. To address these challenges, we propose a $\textbf{Z}$ero-Sh$\textbf{o}$t $\textbf{R}$emote Sensing $\textbf{I}$nstance Segmentation framework, dubbed $\textbf{ZoRI}$. Our approach features a discrimination-enhanced classifier that uses refined textual embeddings to increase the awareness of class disparities. Instead of direct fine-tuning, we propose a knowledge-maintained adaptation strategy that decouples semantic-related information to preserve the pretrained vision-language alignment while adjusting features to capture remote sensing domain-specific visual cues. Additionally, we introduce a prior-injected prediction with cache bank of aerial visual prototypes to supplement the semantic richness of text embeddings and seamlessly integrate aerial representations, adapting to the remote sensing domain. We establish new experimental protocols and benchmarks, and extensive experiments convincingly demonstrate that ZoRI achieves the state-of-art performance on the zero-shot remote sensing instance segmentation task.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models (LLMs) process increasing context windows, the memory usage of KV cache has become a critical bottleneck during inference. The mainstream KV compression methods, including KV pruning and KV quantization, primarily focus on either token or precision dimension and seldom explore the efficiency of their combination. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the token-precision trade-off in KV cache compression. Experiments demonstrate that storing more tokens in the KV cache with lower precision, i.e., quantized pruning, can significantly enhance the long-context performance of LLMs. Furthermore, in-depth analysis regarding token-precision trade-off from a series of key aspects exhibit that, quantized pruning achieves substantial improvements in retrieval-related tasks and consistently performs well across varying input lengths. Moreover, quantized pruning demonstrates notable stability across different KV pruning methods, quantization strategies, and model scales. These findings provide valuable insights into the token-precision trade-off in KV cache compression. We plan to release our code in the near future.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Auto-regressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across different domains such as vision and language processing. However, due to sequential processing through a stack of transformer layers, autoregressive decoding faces significant computation/latency challenges, particularly in resource-constrained environments like mobile and edge devices. Existing approaches in literature that aim to improve latency via skipping layers have two distinct flavors - 1) Early exit, and 2) Input-agnostic heuristics where tokens exit at pre-determined layers irrespective of input sequence. Both the above strategies have limitations - the former cannot be applied to handle KV Caching necessary for speed-ups in modern framework and the latter does not capture the variation in layer importance across tasks or more generally, across input sequences. To address both limitations, we propose FiRST, an algorithm that reduces inference latency by using layer-specific routers to select a subset of transformer layers adaptively for each input sequence - the prompt (during the prefill stage) decides which layers will be skipped during decoding. FiRST preserves compatibility with KV caching enabling faster inference while being quality-aware. FiRST is model-agnostic and can be easily enabled on any pre-trained LLM. Our approach reveals that input adaptivity is critical - indeed, different task-specific middle layers play a crucial role in evolving hidden representations depending on tasks. Extensive experiments show that FiRST significantly reduces latency while outperforming other layer selection strategies in quality metics. It retains competitive performance to base model (without layer skipping) and in some cases, even improves upon it. FiRST is thus a promising and efficient solution for LLM deployment in low-resource environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language model (LLM) inference demands significant amount of computation and memory, especially in the key attention mechanism. While techniques, such as quantization and acceleration algorithms, like FlashAttention, have improved efficiency of the overall inference, they address different aspects of the problem: quantization focuses on weight-activation operations, while FlashAttention improves execution but requires high-precision formats. Recent Key-value (KV) cache quantization reduces memory bandwidth but still needs floating-point dequantization for attention operation.   We present TurboAttention, a comprehensive approach to enable quantized execution of attention that simultaneously addresses both memory and computational efficiency. Our solution introduces two key innovations: FlashQ, a headwise attention quantization technique that enables both compression of KV cache and quantized execution of activation-activation multiplication, and Sparsity-based Softmax Approximation (SAS), which eliminates the need for dequantization to FP32 during exponentiation operation in attention. Experimental results demonstrate that TurboAttention achieves 1.2-1.8x speedup in attention, reduces the KV cache size by over 4.4x, and enables up to 2.37x maximum throughput over the FP16 baseline while outperforming state-of-the-art quantization and compression techniques across various datasets and models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Proactive caching is essential for minimizing latency and improving Quality of Experience (QoE) in multi-server edge networks. Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning (FDRL) is a promising approach for developing cache policies tailored to dynamic content requests. However, FDRL faces challenges such as an expanding caching action space due to increased content numbers and difficulty in adapting global information to heterogeneous edge environments. In this paper, we propose a Personalized Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for Caching, called PF-DRL-Ca, with the aim to maximize system utility while satisfying caching capability constraints. To manage the expanding action space, we employ a new DRL algorithm, Multi-head Deep Q-Network (MH-DQN), which reshapes the action output layers of DQN into a multi-head structure where each head generates a sub-dimensional action. We next integrate the proposed MH-DQN into a personalized federated training framework, employing a layer-wise approach for training to derive a personalized model that can adapt to heterogeneous environments while exploiting the global information to accelerate learning convergence. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MH-DQN over traditional DRL algorithms on a single server, as well as the advantages of the personal federated training architecture compared to other frameworks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The recent advances in LLMs bring a strong demand for efficient system support to improve overall serving efficiency. As LLM inference scales towards multiple GPUs and even multiple compute nodes, various coordination patterns, such as prefill-decode disaggregation and context migration, arise in serving systems. Most inference services today expose a coarse-grained request-level API with a pre-configured coordination strategy, limiting the ability to customize and dynamically reconfigure the coordination. In this paper, we propose LLM microserving, a multi-level architecture for structuring and programming LLM inference services. We introduces simple yet effective microserving APIs to support fine-grained sub-request level actions. A programmable router transforms user requests into sub-request calls, enabling the dynamic reconfiguration of serving patterns. To support diverse execution patterns, we develop a unified KV cache interface that handles various KV compute, transfer, and reuse scenarios. Our evaluation shows that LLM microserving can be reconfigured to support multiple disaggregation orchestration strategies in a few lines of Python code while maintaining state-of-the-art performance for LLM inference tasks. Additionally, it allows us to explore new strategy variants that reduce up to 47% of job completion time compared to the existing strategies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Transformers have emerged as the preeminent models for a wide array of generative tasks, demonstrating superior performance and efficacy across various applications. The promising results come at the cost of slow inference, as each denoising step requires running the whole transformer model with a large amount of parameters. In this paper, we show that performing the full computation of the model at each diffusion step is unnecessary, as some computations can be skipped by lazily reusing the results of previous steps. Furthermore, we show that the lower bound of similarity between outputs at consecutive steps is notably high, and this similarity can be linearly approximated using the inputs. To verify our demonstrations, we propose the \textbf{LazyDiT}, a lazy learning framework that efficiently leverages cached results from earlier steps to skip redundant computations. Specifically, we incorporate lazy learning layers into the model, effectively trained to maximize laziness, enabling dynamic skipping of redundant computations. Experimental results show that LazyDiT outperforms the DDIM sampler across multiple diffusion transformer models at various resolutions. Furthermore, we implement our method on mobile devices, achieving better performance than DDIM with similar latency.

In this paper, based on the View Selection Problem, we propose a unified view on these problems. We identify the root causes of the complexity of these selection problems and provide a detailed analysis of techniques to cope with them. Our survey provides a modern classification of selection algorithms known in the literature, including the latest ones based on Machine Learning. We provide a ground for the reuse of the selection techniques between different optimization scenarios and highlight challenges and promising directions in the field.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The emergence of long-context text applications utilizing large language models (LLMs) has presented significant scalability challenges, particularly in memory footprint. The linear growth of the Key-Value (KV) cache responsible for storing attention keys and values to minimize redundant computations can lead to substantial increases in memory consumption, potentially causing models to fail to serve with limited memory resources. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Cache Sparse Representation (CSR), which converts the KV cache by transforming the dense Key-Value cache tensor into sparse indexes and weights, offering a more memory-efficient representation during LLM inference. Furthermore, we introduce NeuralDict, a novel neural network-based method for automatically generating the dictionary used in our sparse representation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CSR achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization algorithms while maintaining robust functionality in memory-constrained environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated significant potential for generating high-fidelity videos but are computationally intensive. Existing acceleration methods include distillation, which requires costly retraining, and feature caching, which is highly sensitive to network architecture. Recent token reduction methods are training-free and architecture-agnostic, offering greater flexibility and wider applicability. However, they enforce the same sequence length across different components, constraining their acceleration potential. We observe that intra-sequence redundancy in video DiTs varies across features, blocks, and denoising timesteps. Building on this observation, we propose Asymmetric Reduction and Restoration (AsymRnR), a training-free approach to accelerate video DiTs. It offers a flexible and adaptive strategy that reduces the number of tokens based on their redundancy to enhance both acceleration and generation quality. We further propose matching cache to facilitate faster processing. Integrated into state-of-the-art video DiTs, AsymRnR achieves a superior speedup without compromising the quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the continuous improvement of device imaging resolution, the popularity of Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) images is increasing. Unfortunately, existing methods for fusing multi-exposure images in dynamic scenes are designed for low-resolution images, which makes them inefficient for generating high-quality UHD images on a resource-constrained device. To alleviate the limitations of extremely long-sequence inputs, inspired by the Large Language Model (LLM) for processing infinitely long texts, we propose a novel learning paradigm to achieve UHD multi-exposure dynamic scene image fusion on a single consumer-grade GPU, named Infinite Pixel Learning (IPL). The design of our approach comes from three key components: The first step is to slice the input sequences to relieve the pressure generated by the model processing the data stream; Second, we develop an attention cache technique, which is similar to KV cache for infinite data stream processing; Finally, we design a method for attention cache compression to alleviate the storage burden of the cache on the device. In addition, we provide a new UHD benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. Extensive experimental results show that our method maintains high-quality visual performance while fusing UHD dynamic multi-exposure images in real-time (>40fps) on a single consumer-grade GPU.

However, such caches are fundamentally unable to improve performance for workloads requiring pointer traversals across linked data structures. We argue for accelerating these pointer traversals closer to disaggregated memory in a manner that preserves expressiveness for supporting various linked structures, ensures energy efficiency and performance, and supports distributed execution. We design PULSE, a distributed pointer-traversal framework for rack-scale disaggregated memory to meet all the above requirements. Our evaluation of PULSE shows that it enables low-latency, high-throughput, and energy-efficient execution for a wide range of pointer traversal workloads on disaggregated memory that fare poorly with caching alone.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Streaming coarse-grained reconfgurable array (CGRA) is a promising architecture for data/computing-intensive applications because of its fexibility, high throughput and efcient memory system. However,when accelerating sparse CNNs, the irregular input data demands inside sparse CNNs would cause excessive caching operations (COPs) and multi-cycle internal dependencies (MCIDs) between operations, declining the throughput of the streaming CGRA. We propose a mapping method for sparse CNNs onto streaming CGRA, SparseMap, which incorporates an efcient I/O data management along with operation scheduling and binding, to reduce the COPs and MCIDs, thereby ensuring the optimal throughput of streaming CGRA.The experimental results show SparseMap reduces 92.5% COPs and 46.0 % MCIDs while achieves the same or even smaller initiation interval (II) compared to previous works.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> An evolving solution to address hallucination and enhance accuracy in large language models (LLMs) is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which involves augmenting LLMs with information retrieved from an external knowledge source, such as the web. This paper profiles several RAG execution pipelines and demystifies the complex interplay between their retrieval and generation phases. We demonstrate that while exact retrieval schemes are expensive, they can reduce inference time compared to approximate retrieval variants because an exact retrieval model can send a smaller but more accurate list of documents to the generative model while maintaining the same end-to-end accuracy. This observation motivates the acceleration of the exact nearest neighbor search for RAG.   In this work, we design Intelligent Knowledge Store (IKS), a type-2 CXL device that implements a scale-out near-memory acceleration architecture with a novel cache-coherent interface between the host CPU and near-memory accelerators. IKS offers 13.4-27.9x faster exact nearest neighbor search over a 512GB vector database compared with executing the search on Intel Sapphire Rapids CPUs. This higher search performance translates to 1.7-26.3x lower end-to-end inference time for representative RAG applications. IKS is inherently a memory expander; its internal DRAM can be disaggregated and used for other applications running on the server to prevent DRAM, which is the most expensive component in today's servers, from being stranded.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The implementation of 5G and the future deployment of 6G necessitate the utilization of optical networks that possess substantial capacity and exhibit minimal latency. The dynamic arrival and departure of connection requests in optical networks result in particular central links experiencing more traffic and congestion than non-central links. The occurrence of congested links leads to service blocking despite the availability of resources within the network, restricting the efficient utilization of network resources. The available algorithms in the literature that aim to balance load among network links offer a trade-off between blocking performance and algorithmic complexity, thus increasing service provisioning time. This work proposes a dynamic routing-based congestion-aware routing, modulation, core, and spectrum assignment (RMCSA) algorithm for space division multiplexing elastic optical networks (SDM-EONs). The algorithm finds alternative candidate paths based on real-time link occupancy metrics to minimize blocking due to link congestion under dynamic traffic scenarios. As a result, the algorithm reduces the formation of congestion hotspots in the network owing to link-betweenness centrality. We have performed extensive simulations using two realistic network topologies to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with relevant RMCSA algorithms available in the literature. The simulation results verify the superior performance of our proposed algorithm compared to the benchmark Yen's K-shortest paths and K-Disjoint shortest paths RMCSA algorithms in connection blocking ratio and spectrum utilization efficiency. To expedite the route-finding process, we present a novel caching strategy that allows the proposed algorithm to demonstrate a much-reduced service delay time compared to the recently developed adaptive link weight-based load-balancing RMCSA algorithm.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Long-context LLMs have enabled numerous downstream applications but also introduced significant challenges related to computational and memory efficiency. To address these challenges, optimizations for long-context inference have been developed, centered around the KV cache. However, existing benchmarks often evaluate in single-request, neglecting the full lifecycle of the KV cache in real-world use. This oversight is particularly critical, as KV cache reuse has become widely adopted in LLMs inference frameworks, such as vLLM and SGLang, as well as by LLM providers, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Anthropic. To address this gap, we introduce SCBench(SharedContextBench), a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating long-context methods from a KV cachecentric perspective: 1) KV cache generation, 2) KV cache compression, 3) KV cache retrieval, 4) KV cache loading. Specifically, SCBench uses test examples with shared context, ranging 12 tasks with two shared context modes, covering four categories of long-context capabilities: string retrieval, semantic retrieval, global information, and multi-task. With it, we provide an extensive KV cache-centric analysis of eight categories long-context solutions, including Gated Linear RNNs, Mamba-Attention hybrids, and efficient methods such as sparse attention, KV cache dropping, quantization, retrieval, loading, and prompt compression. The evaluation is conducted on 8 long-context LLMs. Our findings show that sub-O(n) memory methods suffer in multi-turn scenarios, while sparse encoding with O(n) memory and sub-O(n^2) pre-filling computation perform robustly. Dynamic sparsity yields more expressive KV caches than static patterns, and layer-level sparsity in hybrid architectures reduces memory usage with strong performance. Additionally, we identify attention distribution shift issues in long-generation scenarios. https://aka.ms/SCBench.

For the vision component, we incorporate a dynamic tiling vision encoding strategy designed for processing high-resolution images with different aspect ratios. For the language component, we leverage DeepSeekMoE models with the Multi-head Latent Attention mechanism, which compresses Key-Value cache into latent vectors, to enable efficient inference and high throughput. Trained on an improved vision-language dataset, DeepSeek-VL2 demonstrates superior capabilities across various tasks, including but not limited to visual question answering, optical character recognition, document/table/chart understanding, and visual grounding. Our model series is composed of three variants: DeepSeek-VL2-Tiny, DeepSeek-VL2-Small and DeepSeek-VL2, with 1.0B, 2.8B and 4.5B activated parameters respectively. DeepSeek-VL2 achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance with similar or fewer activated parameters compared to existing open-source dense and MoE-based models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> OASIS-UROS continues the previously published Open Acquisition System for IEPE Sensors (OASIS). While still building on the ESP32 microcontroller, this version improves the overall performance by switching to an SD card caching system and upgrading the analog-digital converter to an AD7606C-18, which has a higher resolution, provides eight channels, oversampling, and software-adjustable voltage ranges. Also improved is the IEPE front-end and power supply, as well as the firmware of the acquisition system, which can now achieve a sample rate of up to 36 kHz while sampling all eight channels. This paper documents the hardware and software of OASIS-UROS and provides all materials required to reproduce the open acquisition system. Lastly, the system was validated against commercial hardware and software in an experimental modal analysis context. This showed that the system performs close to the commercial one in some aspects with respect to the utilized test case. While OASIS-UROS cannot match the full performance of the commercial system, the developed system can be a viable alternative for students, people in academia, or smaller companies that have a constrained budget or require complete insight as well as adaptability of the hardware and software.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose EVOlutionary Selector (EVOS), an efficient training paradigm for accelerating Implicit Neural Representation (INR). Unlike conventional INR training that feeds all samples through the neural network in each iteration, our approach restricts training to strategically selected points, reducing computational overhead by eliminating redundant forward passes. Specifically, we treat each sample as an individual in an evolutionary process, where only those fittest ones survive and merit inclusion in training, adaptively evolving with the neural network dynamics. While this is conceptually similar to Evolutionary Algorithms, their distinct objectives (selection for acceleration vs. iterative solution optimization) require a fundamental redefinition of evolutionary mechanisms for our context. In response, we design sparse fitness evaluation, frequency-guided crossover, and augmented unbiased mutation to comprise EVOS. These components respectively guide sample selection with reduced computational cost, enhance performance through frequency-domain balance, and mitigate selection bias from cached evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves approximately 48%-66% reduction in training time while ensuring superior convergence without additional cost, establishing state-of-the-art acceleration among recent sampling-based strategies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Oblivious RAM (ORAM) is a well-researched primitive to hide the memory access pattern of a RAM computation; it has a variety of applications in trusted computing, outsourced storage, and multiparty computation. In this paper, we study the so-called offline ORAM in which the sequence of memory access locations to be hidden is known in advance. Apart from their theoretical significance, offline ORAMs can be used to construct efficient oblivious algorithms.   We obtain the first optimal offline ORAM with perfect security from oblivious priority queues via time-forward processing. For this, we present a simple construction of an oblivious priority queue with perfect security. Our construction achieves an asymptotically optimal (amortized) runtime of $\Theta(\log N)$ per operation for a capacity of $N$ elements and is of independent interest.   Building on our construction, we additionally present efficient external-memory instantiations of our oblivious, perfectly-secure construction: For the cache-aware setting, we match the optimal I/O complexity of $\Theta(\frac{1}{B} \log \frac{N}{M})$ per operation (amortized), and for the cache-oblivious setting we achieve a near-optimal I/O complexity of $O(\frac{1}{B} \log \frac{N}{M} \log\log_M N)$ per operation (amortized).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deploying local AI models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), to edge devices can substantially enhance devices' independent capabilities, alleviate the server's burden, and lower the response time. Owing to these tremendous potentials, many big tech companies have released several lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) to bridge this gap. However, we still have huge motivations to deploy more powerful (LLMs) AI models on edge devices and enhance their smartness level. Unlike the conventional approaches for AI model compression, we investigate activation sparsity. The activation sparsity method is orthogonal and combinable with existing techniques to maximize compression rate while maintaining great accuracy. LLMs' Feed-Forward Network (FFN) components, which typically comprise a large proportion of parameters (around 3/2), ensure that our FFN optimizations would have a better chance of achieving effective compression. Moreover, our findings are beneficial to general LLMs and are not restricted to ReLU-based models. This work systematically investigates the tradeoff between enforcing activation sparsity and perplexity (accuracy) on state-of-the-art LLMs. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that we can obtain around 50% of main memory and computing reductions for critical FFN components with negligible accuracy degradation. This extra 50% sparsity does not naturally exist in the current LLMs, which require tuning LLMs' activation outputs by injecting zero-enforcing thresholds. To obtain the benefits of activation sparsity, we provide a guideline for the system architect for LLM prediction and prefetching. The success prediction allows the system to prefetch the necessary weights while omitting the inactive ones and their successors, therefore lowering cache and memory pollution and reducing LLM execution time on resource-constrained edge devices.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a powerful system of distributed caching servers that aims to accelerate content delivery, like high-definition video, IoT applications, and ultra-low-latency services, efficiently and with fast velocity. This has become of paramount importance in the post-pandemic era. Challenges arise when exponential content volume growth and scalability across different geographic locations are required. This paper investigates data-driven evaluations of CDN algorithms in dynamic server selection for latency reduction, bandwidth throttling for efficient resource management, real-time Round Trip Time analysis for adaptive routing, and programmatic network delay simulation to emulate various conditions. Key performance metrics, such as round-trip time (RTT) and CPU usage, are carefully analyzed to evaluate scalability and algorithmic efficiency through two experimental setups: a constrained edge-like local system and a scalable FABRIC testbed. The statistical validation of RTT trends, alongside CPU utilization, is presented in the results. The optimization process reveals significant trade-offs between scalability and resource consumption, providing actionable insights for effectively deploying and enhancing CDN algorithms in edge and distributed computing environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we investigate whether current state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are effective as AI tutors and whether they demonstrate pedagogical abilities necessary for good AI tutoring in educational dialogues. Previous efforts towards evaluation have been limited to subjective protocols and benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified evaluation taxonomy with eight pedagogical dimensions based on key learning sciences principles, which is designed to assess the pedagogical value of LLM-powered AI tutor responses grounded in student mistakes or confusion in the mathematical domain. We release MRBench -- a new evaluation benchmark containing 192 conversations and 1,596 responses from seven state-of-the-art LLM-based and human tutors, providing gold annotations for eight pedagogical dimensions. We assess reliability of the popular Prometheus2 LLM as an evaluator and analyze each tutor's pedagogical abilities, highlighting which LLMs are good tutors and which ones are more suitable as question-answering systems. We believe that the presented taxonomy, benchmark, and human-annotated labels will streamline the evaluation process and help track the progress in AI tutors' development.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As a core component in modern data centers, key-value cache provides high-throughput and low-latency services for high-speed data processing. The effectiveness of a key-value cache relies on its ability of accommodating the needed data. However, expanding the cache capacity is often more difficult than commonly expected because of many practical constraints, such as server costs, cooling issues, rack space, and even human resource expenses. A potential solution is compression, which virtually extends the cache capacity by condensing data in cache. In practice, this seemingly simple idea has not gained much traction in key-value cache system design, due to several critical issues: the compression-unfriendly index structure, severe read/write amplification, wasteful decompression operations, and heavy computing cost. This paper presents a hybrid DRAM-SSD cache design to realize a systematic integration of data compression in key-value cache. By treating compression as an essential component, we have redesigned the indexing structure, data management, and leveraged the emerging computational SSD hardware for collaborative optimizations. We have developed a prototype, called ZipCache. Our experimental results show that ZipCache can achieve up to 72.4% higher throughput and 42.4% lower latency, while reducing the write amplification by up to 26.2 times.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm that enables intelligent agents to collaboratively train Machine Learning (ML) models in a distributed manner, eliminating the need for sharing their local data. The recent work (arXiv:2106.02969) introduces a family of Federated Newton Learn (FedNL) algorithms, marking a significant step towards applying second-order methods to FL and large-scale optimization. However, the reference FedNL prototype exhibits three serious practical drawbacks: (i) It requires 4.8 hours to launch a single experiment in a sever-grade workstation; (ii) The prototype only simulates multi-node setting; (iii) Prototype integration into resource-constrained applications is challenging. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we present a self-contained implementation of FedNL, FedNL-LS, FedNL-PP for single-node and multi-node settings. Our work resolves the aforementioned issues and reduces the wall clock time by x1000. With this FedNL outperforms alternatives for training logistic regression in a single-node -- CVXPY (arXiv:1603.00943), and in a multi-node -- Apache Spark (arXiv:1505.06807), Ray/Scikit-Learn (arXiv:1712.05889). Finally, we propose two practical-orientated compressors for FedNL - adaptive TopLEK and cache-aware RandSeqK, which fulfill the theory of FedNL.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) on smartphones enable real-time AI assistance and privacy-preserving, offline operation. However, resource constraints of smartphones limit current deployments to small language models (SLMs), significantly compromising their capabilities. This paper introduces PowerInfer-2, a smartphone-based framework that enables fast inference for LLMs exceeding the memory capacity. The key insight is decomposing matrix operations into neuron clusters as the basic processing unit, which enables flexible scheduling and efficient I/O-computation pipelining. PowerInfer-2 leverages this neuron-cluster-based design in both computation and storage. For computation, neuron clusters with dense activations are processed on NPU, while sparse clusters use CPU. The storage engine provides a fine-grained pipeline mechanism that coordinates cluster-level computation and I/O operations, enhanced by a segmented neuron cache to reduce I/O activities. PowerInfer-2 achieves up to a 27.8x speed increase compared to state-of-the-art frameworks. PowerInfer-2 is the first system to serve a 47B LLM on a smartphone, achieving 11.68 tokens/s. Notably, these performance improvements preserve model quality with negligible accuracy degradation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a practical approach to scale up parameters for the Transformer model to achieve better generalization while maintaining a sub-linear increase in computation overhead. Current MoE models are mainly built with expert parallelism on distributed devices. However, it usually depends on homogeneous devices to deploy and suffers from heavy communication overhead and computation redundancy. In this paper, we explore developing a \texttt{H}eterogeneous-aware \texttt{EX}pert \texttt{A}llocation framework, \textbf{\texttt{HEXA-MoE}}, with significantly enhanced computing efficiency. It contains two components: ($1$) \textit{Expert-Specific Operators}. We replace the typical general matrix multiplication or grouped matrix multiplication interfaces with our operators, which allows the computing to be performed in an in-place manner with \textbf{ZERO} redundancy. ($2$) \textit{Adaptive Data- and Model-Centric Configurations} for different workload scales. Specifically, we introduce a pipeline-shared cache on each device to tackle the heavy memory consumption in the existing data-centric MoE library. Comprehensive experiments on the Swin-MoE benchmark consistently reveal the effectiveness of our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} framework, i.e., reducing $10\%\sim48\%$ memory consumption and achieving $0.5\sim4.3\times$ speed up compared to current state-of-the-art MoE libraries. Furthermore, we examine our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} with heterogeneous devices for both data- and model-centric settings. Promising results show that employing optimal parallel configuration with \texttt{HEXA-MoE} on heterogeneous devices can substantially minimize overall latency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Phishing is a critical cyber threat, exploiting deceptive tactics to compromise victims and cause significant financial losses. While reference-based phishing detectors (RBPDs) achieve high precision by analyzing brand-domain consistency, their real-world deployment is hindered by challenges such as high latency and inefficiency in URL analysis. To address these limitations, we present PhishIntel, an end-to-end phishing detection system for real-world deployment. PhishIntel intelligently determines whether a URL can be processed immediately or not, segmenting the detection process into two distinct tasks: a fast task that checks against local blacklists and result cache, and a slow task that conducts online blacklist verification, URL crawling, and webpage analysis using an RBPD. This fast-slow task system architecture ensures low response latency while retaining the robust detection capabilities of RBPDs for zero-day phishing threats. Furthermore, we develop two downstream applications based on PhishIntel: a phishing intelligence platform and a phishing email detection plugin for Microsoft Outlook, demonstrating its practical efficacy and utility.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language models (LLMs) have become a research hotspot. To accelerate the inference of LLMs, storing computed caches in memory has become the standard technique. However, as the inference length increases, growing KV caches might lead to out-of-memory issues. Many existing methods address this issue through KV cache compression, primarily by preserving key tokens throughout all layers to reduce information loss. Most of them allocate a uniform budget size for each layer to retain. However, we observe that the minimum budget sizes needed to retain essential information vary across layers and models based on the perspectives of attention and hidden state output. Building on this observation, this paper proposes a simple yet effective KV cache compression method that leverages layer uncertainty to allocate budget size for each layer. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce memory usage of the KV caches to only $\sim$20\% when compared to Full KV inference while achieving nearly lossless performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep learning kernels exhibit predictable memory accesses and compute patterns, making GPUs' parallel architecture well-suited for their execution. Software and runtime systems for GPUs are optimized to better utilize the stream multiprocessors, on-chip cache, and off-chip high-bandwidth memory. As deep learning models and GPUs evolve, access to newer GPUs is often limited, raising questions about the performance of new model architectures on existing GPUs, existing models on new GPUs, and new model architectures on new GPUs. To address these questions, we introduce NeuSight, a framework to predict the performance of various deep learning models, for both training and inference, on unseen GPUs without requiring actual execution. The framework leverages both GPU hardware behavior and software library optimizations to estimate end-to-end performance. Previous work uses regression models that capture linear trends or multilayer perceptrons to predict the overall latency of deep learning kernels on GPUs. These approaches suffer from higher error percentages when forecasting performance on unseen models and new GPUs. Instead, NeuSight decomposes the prediction problem into smaller problems, bounding the prediction through fundamental performance laws. NeuSight decomposes a single deep learning kernel prediction into smaller working sets called tiles, which are executed independently on the GPU. Tile-granularity predictions are determined using a machine learning approach and aggregated to estimate end-to-end latency. NeuSight outperforms prior work across various deep learning workloads and the latest GPUs. It reduces the percentage error from 121.4% and 30.8% to 2.3% in predicting the latency of GPT3 model for training and inference on H100, compared to state-of-the-art prior work, where both GPT3 and H100 were not used to train the framework.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce Lexico, a novel KV cache compression method that leverages sparse coding with a universal dictionary. Our key finding is that key-value cache in modern LLMs can be accurately approximated using sparse linear combination from a small, input-agnostic dictionary of ~4k atoms, enabling efficient compression across different input prompts, tasks and models. Using orthogonal matching pursuit for sparse approximation, Lexico achieves flexible compression ratios through direct sparsity control. On GSM8K, across multiple model families (Mistral, Llama 3, Qwen2.5), Lexico maintains 90-95% of the original performance while using only 15-25% of the full KV-cache memory, outperforming both quantization and token eviction methods. Notably, Lexico remains effective in low memory regimes where 2-bit quantization fails, achieving up to 1.7x better compression on LongBench and GSM8K while maintaining high accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the demand for higher quality and faster processing of long contexts across various applications is growing. KV cache is widely adopted as it stores previously generated key and value tokens, effectively reducing redundant computations during inference. However, as memory overhead becomes a significant concern, efficient compression of KV cache has gained increasing attention. Most existing methods perform compression from two perspectives: identifying important tokens and designing compression strategies. However, these approaches often produce biased distributions of important tokens due to the influence of accumulated attention scores or positional encoding. Furthermore, they overlook the sparsity and redundancy across different heads, which leads to difficulties in preserving the most effective information at the head level. To this end, we propose EMS to overcome these limitations, while achieving better KV cache compression under extreme compression ratios. Specifically, we introduce a Global-Local score that combines accumulated attention scores from both global and local KV tokens to better identify the token importance. For the compression strategy, we design an adaptive and unified Evict-then-Merge framework that accounts for the sparsity and redundancy of KV tokens across different heads. Additionally, we implement the head-wise parallel compression through a zero-class mechanism to enhance efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate our SOTA performance even under extreme compression ratios. EMS consistently achieves the lowest perplexity, improves scores by over 1.28 points across four LLMs on LongBench under a 256 cache budget, and preserves 95% retrieval accuracy with a cache budget less than 2% of the context length in the Needle-in-a-Haystack task.

Unlike existing works, OrbitCache does not cache hot items in the switch memory. Instead, we make hot items revisit the switch data plane continuously by exploiting packet recirculation. Our approach keeps cached key-value pairs in the switch data plane while freeing them from item size limitations caused by hardware constraints. We implement an OrbitCache prototype on an Intel Tofino switch. Our experimental results show that OrbitCache can balance highly skewed workloads and is robust to various system conditions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite the efficiency of prompt learning in transferring vision-language models (VLMs) to downstream tasks, existing methods mainly learn the prompts in a coarse-grained manner where the learned prompt vectors are shared across all categories. Consequently, the tailored prompts often fail to discern class-specific visual concepts, thereby hindering the transferred performance for classes that share similar or complex visual attributes. Recent advances mitigate this challenge by leveraging external knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) to furnish class descriptions, yet incurring notable inference costs. In this paper, we introduce TextRefiner, a plug-and-play method to refine the text prompts of existing methods by leveraging the internal knowledge of VLMs. Particularly, TextRefiner builds a novel local cache module to encapsulate fine-grained visual concepts derivedfrom local tokens within the image branch. By aggregating and aligning the cached visual descriptions with the original output of the text branch, TextRefiner can efficiently refine and enrich the learned prompts from existing methods without relying on any external expertise. For example, it improves the performance of CoOp from 71.66 % to 76.94 % on 11 benchmarks, surpassing CoCoOp which introduces instance-wise features for text prompts. Equipped with TextRefiner, PromptKD achieves state-of-the-art performance and is efficient in inference. Our code is relesed at https://github.com/xjjxmu/TextRefiner

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in code completion tasks, where they assist developers by predicting and generating new code in real-time. However, existing LLM-based code completion systems primarily rely on the immediate context of the file being edited, often missing valuable repository-level information, user behaviour and edit history that could improve suggestion accuracy. Additionally, challenges such as efficiently retrieving relevant code snippets from large repositories, incorporating user behavior, and balancing accuracy with low-latency requirements in production environments remain unresolved. In this paper, we propose ContextModule, a framework designed to enhance LLM-based code completion by retrieving and integrating three types of contextual information from the repository: user behavior-based code, similar code snippets, and critical symbol definitions. By capturing user interactions across files and leveraging repository-wide static analysis, ContextModule improves the relevance and precision of generated code. We implement performance optimizations, such as index caching, to ensure the system meets the latency constraints of real-world coding environments. Experimental results and industrial practise demonstrate that ContextModule significantly improves code completion accuracy and user acceptance rates.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have propelled the field of computer vision, particularly in the zero-shot learning setting. Despite their promise, the effectiveness of these models often diminishes due to domain shifts in test environments. To address this, we introduce the Test-Time Prototype Shifting (TPS) framework, a pioneering approach designed to adapt VLMs to test datasets using unlabeled test inputs. Our method is based on the notion of modulating per-class prototypes in the shared embedding space. By pre-computing and caching prototypes generated with the pre-trained text encoder, TPS not only facilitates optimization-free prototype reuse for subsequent predictions but also enables seamless integration with current advancements in prompt engineering. At test-time, TPS dynamically learns shift vectors for each prototype based solely on the given test sample, effectively bridging the domain gap and enhancing classification accuracy. A notable aspect of our framework is its significantly reduced memory and computational demands when compared to conventional text-prompt tuning methods. Extensive evaluations across 15 image classification datasets involving natural distribution shifts and cross-dataset generalization, as well as in context-dependent visual reasoning, demonstrate TPS's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results while reducing resource requirements.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current video diffusion models achieve impressive generation quality but struggle in interactive applications due to bidirectional attention dependencies. The generation of a single frame requires the model to process the entire sequence, including the future. We address this limitation by adapting a pretrained bidirectional diffusion transformer to a causal transformer that generates frames on-the-fly. To further reduce latency, we extend distribution matching distillation (DMD) to videos, distilling 50-step diffusion model into a 4-step generator. To enable stable and high-quality distillation, we introduce a student initialization scheme based on teacher's ODE trajectories, as well as an asymmetric distillation strategy that supervises a causal student model with a bidirectional teacher. This approach effectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive generation, allowing long-duration video synthesis despite training on short clips. Our model supports fast streaming generation of high quality videos at 9.4 FPS on a single GPU thanks to KV caching. Our approach also enables streaming video-to-video translation, image-to-video, and dynamic prompting in a zero-shot manner. We will release the code based on an open-source model in the future.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While Transformers and other sequence-parallelizable neural network architectures seem like the current state of the art in sequence modeling, they specifically lack state-tracking capabilities. These are important for time-series tasks and logical reasoning. Traditional RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs, as well as modern variants like sLSTM do have these capabilities at the cost of strictly sequential processing. While this is often seen as a strong limitation, we show how fast these networks can get with our hardware-optimization FlashRNN in Triton and CUDA, optimizing kernels to the register level on modern GPUs. We extend traditional RNNs with a parallelization variant that processes multiple RNNs of smaller hidden state in parallel, similar to the head-wise processing in Transformers. To enable flexibility on different GPU variants, we introduce a new optimization framework for hardware-internal cache sizes, memory and compute handling. It models the hardware in a setting using polyhedral-like constraints, including the notion of divisibility. This speeds up the solution process in our ConstrINT library for general integer constraint satisfaction problems (integer CSPs). We show that our kernels can achieve 50x speed-ups over a vanilla PyTorch implementation and allow 40x larger hidden sizes compared to our Triton implementation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The recent surge of interest in comprehensive multimodal models has necessitated the unification of diverse modalities. However, the unification suffers from disparate methodologies. Continuous visual generation necessitates the full-sequence diffusion-based approach, despite its divergence from the autoregressive modeling in the text domain. We posit that autoregressive modeling, i.e., predicting the future based on past deterministic experience, remains crucial in developing both a visual generation model and a potential unified multimodal model. In this paper, we explore an interpolation between the autoregressive modeling and full-parameters diffusion to model visual information. At its core, we present ACDiT, an Autoregressive blockwise Conditional Diffusion Transformer, where the block size of diffusion, i.e., the size of autoregressive units, can be flexibly adjusted to interpolate between token-wise autoregression and full-sequence diffusion. ACDiT is easy to implement, as simple as creating a Skip-Causal Attention Mask (SCAM) during training. During inference, the process iterates between diffusion denoising and autoregressive decoding that can make full use of KV-Cache. We verify the effectiveness of ACDiT on image and video generation tasks. We also demonstrate that benefitted from autoregressive modeling, ACDiT can be seamlessly used in visual understanding tasks despite being trained on the diffusion objective. The analysis of the trade-off between autoregressive modeling and diffusion demonstrates the potential of ACDiT to be used in long-horizon visual generation tasks. These strengths make it promising as the backbone of future unified models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Long video understanding poses a significant challenge for current Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Notably, the MLLMs are constrained by their limited context lengths and the substantial costs while processing long videos. Although several existing methods attempt to reduce visual tokens, their strategies encounter severe bottleneck, restricting MLLMs' ability to perceive fine-grained visual details. In this work, we propose Video-XL, a novel approach that leverages MLLMs' inherent key-value (KV) sparsification capacity to condense the visual input. Specifically, we introduce a new special token, the Visual Summarization Token (VST), for each interval of the video, which summarizes the visual information within the interval as its associated KV. The VST module is trained by instruction fine-tuning, where two optimizing strategies are offered. 1.Curriculum learning, where VST learns to make small (easy) and large compression (hard) progressively. 2. Composite data curation, which integrates single-image, multi-image, and synthetic data to overcome the scarcity of long-video instruction data. The compression quality is further improved by dynamic compression, which customizes compression granularity based on the information density of different video intervals. Video-XL's effectiveness is verified from three aspects. First, it achieves a superior long-video understanding capability, outperforming state-of-the-art models of comparable sizes across multiple popular benchmarks. Second, it effectively preserves video information, with minimal compression loss even at 16x compression ratio. Third, it realizes outstanding cost-effectiveness, enabling high-quality processing of thousands of frames on a single A100 GPU.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT, have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling nuanced understanding and generation of human-like text across a wide range of applications. However, the high computational and financial costs associated with frequent API calls to these models present a substantial bottleneck, especially for applications like customer service chatbots that handle repetitive queries. In this paper, we introduce GPT Semantic Cache, a method that leverages semantic caching of query embeddings in in-memory storage (Redis). By storing embeddings of user queries, our approach efficiently identifies semantically similar questions, allowing for the retrieval of pre-generated responses without redundant API calls to the LLM. This technique achieves a notable reduction in operational costs while significantly enhancing response times, making it a robust solution for optimizing LLM-powered applications. Our experiments demonstrate that GPT Semantic Cache reduces API calls by up to 68.8% across various query categories, with cache hit rates ranging from 61.6% to 68.8%. Additionally, the system achieves high accuracy, with positive hit rates exceeding 97%, confirming the reliability of cached responses. This technique not only reduces operational costs, but also improves response times, enhancing the efficiency of LLM-powered applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Caching content at the edge network is a popular and effective technique widely deployed to alleviate the burden of network backhaul, shorten service delay and improve service quality. However, there has been some controversy over privacy violations in caching content at the edge network. On the one hand, the multi-access open edge network provides an ideal entrance or interface for external attackers to obtain private data from edge caches by extracting sensitive information. On the other hand, privacy can be infringed on by curious edge caching providers through caching trace analysis targeting the achievement of better caching performance or higher profits. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of privacy issues in edge caching networks is vital and indispensable for creating a privacy-preserving caching service at the edge network. In this article, we are among the first to fill this gap by examining privacy-preserving techniques for caching content at the edge network. Firstly, we provide an introduction to the background of privacy-preserving edge caching (PPEC). Next, we summarize the key privacy issues and present a taxonomy for caching at the edge network from the perspective of private information. Additionally, we conduct a retrospective review of the state-of-the-art countermeasures against privacy leakage from content caching at the edge network. Finally, we conclude the survey and envision challenges for future research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently the generative Large Language Model (LLM) has achieved remarkable success in numerous applications. Notably its inference generates output tokens one-by-one, leading to many redundant computations. The widely-used KV-Cache framework makes a compromise between time and space complexities. However, caching data generates the increasingly growing memory demand, that can quickly exhaust the limited memory capacity of the modern accelerator like GPUs, particularly in long-context inference tasks. Existing studies reduce memory consumption by evicting some of cached data that have less important impact on inference accuracy. But the benefit in practice is far from ideal due to the static cache allocation across different LLM network layers. This paper observes that the layer-specific cached data have very different impacts on accuracy. We quantify this difference, and give experimental and theoretical validation. We accordingly make a formal analysis and shows that customizing the cache size for each layer in a personalized manner can yield a significant memory reduction, while still providing comparable accuracy. We simulate the cache allocation as a combinatorial optimization problem and give a global optimal solution. In particular, we devise a mini- and sampling-based inference over a lightweight variant of the LLM model, so as to quickly capture the difference and then feed it into the personalized algorithms. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposals can reduce KV cache memory consumption by 61.6% on average, improve computational efficiency by 2.1x and then increase the throughput by up to 5.5x.

The reflectivity anisotropy signal contains oscillations at the fundamental frequency of the resonant infrared-active phonon mode as well as its second, third, and fourth harmonics. The effect is ascribed to coherent anharmonic phonons resonantly excited by the strong terahertz field. Pump terahertz pulses also induce an almost instantaneous Kerr effect and a long-lived optical anisotropy of the crystal with a characteristic decay time of $\gtrsim$ 100 ps. We consider lattice distortion and phonon-assisted side valley population as possible origins of this metastable state.

The focus has been on compressing the KV cache after the input prompt has been processed for faster token generation. In settings with limited GPU memory, and when the input context is longer than the generation length, we show that by also compressing the KV cache during the input processing phase, larger batch sizes can be used resulting in significantly higher throughput while still maintaining the original model's accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters demonstrate impressive performance. However, the widely used Multi-Head Attention (MHA) in LLMs incurs substantial computational and memory costs during inference. While some efforts have optimized attention mechanisms by pruning heads or sharing parameters among heads, these methods often lead to performance degradation or necessitate substantial continued pre-training costs to restore performance. Based on the analysis of attention redundancy, we design a Decoupled-Head Attention (DHA) mechanism. DHA adaptively configures group sharing for key heads and value heads across various layers, achieving a better balance between performance and efficiency. Inspired by the observation of clustering similar heads, we propose to progressively transform the MHA checkpoint into the DHA model through linear fusion of similar head parameters step by step, retaining the parametric knowledge of the MHA checkpoint. We construct DHA models by transforming various scales of MHA checkpoints given target head budgets. Our experiments show that DHA remarkably requires a mere 0.25\% of the original model's pre-training budgets to achieve 97.6\% of performance while saving 75\% of KV cache. Compared to Group-Query Attention (GQA), DHA achieves a 5$\times$ training acceleration, a maximum of 13.93\% performance improvement under 0.01\% pre-training budget, and 4\% relative improvement under 0.05\% pre-training budget.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have rapidly gained popularity for their strong generation and reasoning capabilities given diverse multimodal inputs. However, these models incur significant computational and memory overhead during inference, which greatly hinders the efficient deployment in practical scenarios. The extensive key-value (KV) cache, necessitated by the lengthy input and output sequences, notably contributes to the high inference cost. Based on this, recent works have investigated ways to reduce the KV cache size for higher efficiency. Although effective, they generally overlook the distinct importance distributions of KV vectors across layers and maintain the same cache size for each layer during the next token prediction. This results in the significant contextual information loss for certain layers, leading to notable performance decline. To address this, we present PrefixKV. It reframes the challenge of determining KV cache sizes for all layers into the task of searching for the optimal global prefix configuration. With an adaptive layer-wise KV retention recipe based on binary search, the maximum contextual information can thus be preserved in each layer, facilitating the generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with others. It exhibits superior inference efficiency and generation quality trade-offs, showing promising potential for practical applications. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/THU-MIG/PrefixKV}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Latency is a major concern for web rendering engines like those in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. These engines reduce latency by using an incremental layout algorithm to redraw the page when the user interacts with it. In such an algorithm, elements that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty; only the dirty elements need be processed to draw the next frame, dramatically reducing latency. However, the standard incremental layout algorithm must search the page for dirty elements, accessing a number of auxiliary elements in the process. These auxiliary elements add cache misses and stalled cycles, and are responsible for a sizable fraction of all layout latency. We introduce a new, faster incremental layout algorithm called Spineless Traversal. Spineless Traversal uses a more computationally demanding priority queue algorithm to avoid the need to access auxiliary nodes and thus reduces cache traffic and stalls. This leads to dramatic speedups on the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, or animations. Moreover, thanks to numerous low-level optimizations, we are able to make Spineless Traversal competitive across the whole spectrum of incremental layout workloads. As a result, across 2216 benchmarks, Spineless Traversal is faster on 78.2% of the benchmark, with a mean speedup of 3.23x concentrated in the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, and animations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A microscopic model of a heterostructure with a quantum well (QW) is proposed to study the exciton behavior in an external electric field. The effect of an electric field ranging from 0 to 6 kV/cm applied to the GaAs/AlGaAs QW structure in the growth direction is studied for several QWs of various widths up to 100 nm. The three-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation (SE) of exciton is numerically solved using the finite difference method. Wave functions and energies for several states of the heavy-hole and light-hole excitons are calculated. Dependencies of the exciton state energy, the binding energy, the radiative broadening, and the static dipole moment on the applied electric fields are determined. The threshold of exciton dissociation for the 100-nm QW is also determined. In addition, we found the electric-field-induced shift of the center of mass of the heavy-hole and light-hole exciton in the QWs. Finally, we have modeled reflection spectra of heterostructures with the GaAs/AlGaAs QWs in the electric field using the calculated energies and radiative broadenings of excitons.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Shared-memory system-on-chips (SM-SoC) are ubiquitously employed by a wide-range of mobile computing platforms, including edge/IoT devices, autonomous systems and smartphones. In SM-SoCs, system-wide shared physical memory enables a convenient and financially-feasible way to make data accessible by dozens of processing units (PUs), such as CPU cores and domain specific accelerators. In this study, we investigate vulnerabilities that stem from the shared use of physical memory in such systems. Due to the diverse computational characteristics of the PUs they embed, SM-SoCs often do not employ a shared last level cache (LLC). While the literature proposes covert channel attacks for shared memory systems, high-throughput communication is currently possible by either relying on an LLC or privileged/physical access to the shared memory subsystem.   In this study, we introduce a new memory-contention based covert communication attack, MC3, which specifically targets the shared system memory in mobile SoCs. Different from existing attacks, our approach achieves high throughput communication between applications running on CPU and GPU without the need for an LLC or elevated access to the system. We extensively explore the effectiveness of our methodology by demonstrating the trade-off between the channel transmission rate and the robustness of the communication. We demonstrate the utility of MC3 on NVIDIA Orin AGX, Orin NX, and Orin Nano up to a transmit rate of 6.4 kbps with less than 1% error rate.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text-to-image (T2I) generation using diffusion models has become a blockbuster service in today's AI cloud. A production T2I service typically involves a serving workflow where a base diffusion model is augmented with various "add-on" modules, notably ControlNet and LoRA, to enhance image generation control. Compared to serving the base model alone, these add-on modules introduce significant loading and computational overhead, resulting in increased latency. In this paper, we present SwiftDiffusion, a system that efficiently serves a T2I workflow through a holistic approach. SwiftDiffusion decouples ControNet from the base model and deploys it as a separate, independently scaled service on dedicated GPUs, enabling ControlNet caching, parallelization, and sharing. To mitigate the high loading overhead of LoRA serving, SwiftDiffusion employs a bounded asynchronous LoRA loading (BAL) technique, allowing LoRA loading to overlap with the initial base model execution by up to k steps without compromising image quality. Furthermore, SwiftDiffusion optimizes base model execution with a novel latent parallelism technique. Collectively, these designs enable SwiftDiffusion to outperform the state-of-the-art T2I serving systems, achieving up to 7.8x latency reduction and 1.6x throughput improvement in serving SDXL models on H800 GPUs, without sacrificing image quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The quadratic computational complexity of the attention mechanism in current Large Language Models (LLMs) renders inference with long contexts prohibitively expensive. To address this challenge, various approaches aim to retain critical portions of the context to optimally approximate Full Attention (FA) through Key-Value (KV) compression or Sparse Attention (SA), enabling the processing of virtually unlimited text lengths in a streaming manner. However, these methods struggle to achieve performance levels comparable to FA, particularly in retrieval tasks. In this paper, our analysis of attention head patterns reveals that LLMs' attention distributions show strong local correlations, naturally reflecting a chunking mechanism for input context. We propose Ltri-LLM framework, which divides KVs into spans, stores them in an offline index, and retrieves the relevant KVs into memory for various queries. Experimental results on popular long text benchmarks show that Ltri-LLM can achieve performance close to FA while maintaining efficient, streaming-based inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces a novel one-hop sub-query result cache for processing graph read transactions, gR-Txs, in a graph database system. The one-hop navigation is from a vertex using either its in-coming or out-going edges with selection predicates that filter edges and vertices. Its cache entry identifies a unique one-hop sub-query (key) and its result set consisting of immutable vertex ids (value). When processing a gR-Tx, the query processor identifies its sequence of individual one-hop sub-queries and looks up their results in the cache. A cache hit fetches less data from the storage manager and eliminates the requirement to process the one-hop sub-query. A cache miss populates the cache asynchronously and in a transactional manner, maintaining the separation of read and write paths of our transactional storage manager. A graph read and write transaction, gRW-Tx, identifies the impacted cache entries and either deletes or updates them. Our implementation of the cache is inside the graph query processing engine and transparent to a user application. We evaluate the cache using our eCommerce production workload and with rules that re-write graph queries to maximize the performance enhancements observed with the cache. Obtained results show the cache enhances 95th and 99th percentile of query response times by at least 2x and 1.63x, respectively. When combined with query re-writing, the enhancements are at least 2.33x and 4.48x, respectively. An interesting result is the significant performance enhancement observed by the indirect beneficiaries of the cache, gRW-Txs and gR-Txs that do not reference one-hop sub-queries. The cache frees system resources to expedite their processing significantly.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> KV cache pruning has emerged as a promising technique for reducing memory and computation costs in long-context auto-regressive generation. Existing methods for vision-language models (VLMs) typically rely on self-attention scores from large language models (LLMs) to identify and prune irrelevant tokens. However, these approaches overlook the inherent distributional discrepancies between modalities, often leading to inaccurate token importance estimation and the over-pruning of critical visual tokens. To address this, we propose decomposing attention scores into intra-modality attention (within the same modality) and inter-modality attention (across modalities), enabling more precise KV cache pruning by independently managing these distinct attention types. Additionally, we introduce an n-softmax function to counteract distribution shifts caused by pruning, preserving the original smoothness of attention scores and ensuring stable performance. Our final training-free method, \textbf{C}ross-\textbf{S}elf \textbf{P}runing (CSP), achieves competitive performance compared to models with full KV caches while significantly outperforming previous pruning methods. Extensive evaluations on MileBench, a benchmark encompassing 29 multimodal datasets, demonstrate CSP's effectiveness, achieving up to a 41\% performance improvement on challenging tasks like conversational embodied dialogue while reducing the KV cache budget by 13.6\%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce an efficient Two-Level Monte Carlo (subset of Multi-Level Monte Carlo, MLMC) estimator for real-time rendering of scenes with global illumination. Using MLMC we split the shading integral into two parts: the radiance cache integral and the residual error integral that compensates for the bias of the first one. For the first part, we developed the Neural Incident Radiance Cache (NIRC) leveraging the power of fully-fused tiny neural networks as a building block, which is trained on the fly. The cache is designed to provide a fast and reasonable approximation of the incident radiance: an evaluation takes 2-25x less compute time than a path tracing sample. This enables us to estimate the radiance cache integral with a high number of samples and by this achieve faster convergence. For the residual error integral, we compute the difference between the NIRC predictions and the unbiased path tracing simulation. Our method makes no assumptions about the geometry, materials, or lighting of a scene and has only few intuitive hyper-parameters. We provide a comprehensive comparative analysis in different experimental scenarios. Since the algorithm is trained in an on-line fashion, it demonstrates significant noise level reduction even for dynamic scenes and can easily be combined with other importance sampling schemes and noise reduction techniques.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite the remarkable performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, the substantial training and inference costs impede their advancement. The majority of computation stems from the overwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer decoder. In this paper, we propose to build efficient MLLMs by leveraging the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each transformer decoder layer selects essential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant ones. However, integrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the challenges of training and inference stability as well as limited training data, we adapt the MoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight normalization (TanhNorm) and symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we observe that vision tokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layer and thus design a progressive ratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the token retention ratio layer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This crucial design fully unleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the efficiency and performance of our models. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments with two baseline models across 14 benchmarks. Our model, p-MoD, matches or even surpasses the performance of the baseline models, with only 55.6% TFLOPs and 53.8% KV cache storage during inference, and 77.7% GPU hours during training.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LLM inference for popular enterprise use cases, such as summarization, RAG, and code-generation, typically observes orders of magnitude longer prompt lengths than generation lengths. This characteristic leads to high cost of prefill and increased response latency. In this paper, we present SwiftKV, a novel model transformation and distillation procedure specifically designed to reduce the time and cost of processing prompt tokens while preserving high quality of generated tokens. SwiftKV combines three key mechanisms: i) SingleInputKV, which prefills later layers' KV cache using a much earlier layer's output, allowing prompt tokens to skip much of the model computation, ii) AcrossKV, which merges the KV caches of neighboring layers to reduce the memory footprint and support larger batch size for higher throughput, and iii) a knowledge-preserving distillation procedure that can adapt existing LLMs for SwiftKV with minimal accuracy impact and low compute and data requirement. For Llama-3.1-8B and 70B, SwiftKV reduces the compute requirement of prefill by 50% and the memory requirement of the KV cache by 62.5% while incurring minimum quality degradation across a wide range of tasks. In the end-to-end inference serving using an optimized vLLM implementation, SwiftKV realizes up to 2x higher aggregate throughput and 60% lower time per output token. It can achieve a staggering 560 TFlops/GPU of normalized inference throughput, which translates to 16K tokens/s for Llama-3.1-70B in 16-bit precision on 4x H100 GPUs.

It is generally believed that the important foundation of its ICL capability is the induction heads mechanism, which requires at least two layers attention. In order to more efficiently implement the ability of the model's induction, we revisit the induction heads mechanism and proposed a KV shifting attention. We theoretically prove that the KV shifting attention reducing the model's requirements for the depth and width of the induction heads mechanism. Our experimental results demonstrate that KV shifting attention is beneficial to learning induction heads and language modeling, which lead to better performance or faster convergence from toy models to the pre-training models with more than 10 B parameters.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Training and serving long-context large language models (LLMs) incurs substantial overhead. To address this, two critical steps are often required: a pretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length extension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural modifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper argues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction architecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but also achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed LongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during length extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention patterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink (initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are well-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their GPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just theoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to have direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention layers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency and long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data is sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.   We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its effectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts, LongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%, compared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV cache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding speedup.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Many real-world workloads present a challenging set of requirements: point operations requiring high throughput, working sets much larger than main memory, and natural skew in key access patterns for both reads and writes. We find that modern key-value designs are either optimized for memory-efficiency, sacrificing high-performance (LSM-tree designs), or achieve high-performance, saturating modern NVMe SSD bandwidth, at the cost of substantial memory resources or high disk wear (CPU-optimized designs). Unfortunately these designs are not able to handle meet the challenging demands of such larger-than-memory, skewed workloads.   To this end, we present F2, a new key-value store that bridges this gap by combining the strengths of both approaches. F2 adopts a tiered, record-oriented architecture inspired by LSM-trees to effectively separate hot from cold records, while incorporating concurrent latch-free mechanisms from CPU-optimized engines to maximize performance on modern NVMe SSDs. To realize this design, we tackle key challenges and introduce several innovations, including new latch-free algorithms for multi-threaded log compaction and user operations (e.g., RMWs), as well as new components: a two-level hash index to reduce indexing overhead for cold records and a read-cache for serving read-hot data.   Detailed experimental results show that F2 matches or outperforms existing solutions, achieving on average better throughput on memory-constrained environments compared to state-of-the-art systems like RocksDB (11.75x), SplinterDB (4.52x), KVell (10.56x), LeanStore (2.04x), and FASTER (2.38x). F2 also maintains its high performance across varying workload skewness levels and memory budgets, while achieving low disk write amplification.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Hybrid models that combine the language modeling capabilities of Attention layers with the efficiency of Recurrent layers (e.g., State Space Models) have gained traction in practically supporting long contexts in Large Language Model serving. Yet, the unique properties of these models complicate the usage of complementary efficiency optimizations such as prefix caching that skip redundant computations across requests. Most notably, their use of in-place state updates for recurrent layers precludes rolling back cache entries for partial sequence overlaps, and instead mandates only exact-match cache hits; the effect is a deluge of (large) cache entries per sequence, most of which yield minimal reuse opportunities. We present Marconi, the first system that supports efficient prefix caching with Hybrid LLMs. Key to Marconi are its novel admission and eviction policies that more judiciously assess potential cache entries based not only on recency, but also on (1) forecasts of their reuse likelihood across a taxonomy of different hit scenarios, and (2) the compute savings that hits deliver relative to memory footprints. Across diverse workloads and Hybrid models, Marconi achieves up to 34.4$\times$ higher token hit rates (71.1% or 617 ms lower TTFT) compared to state-of-the-art prefix caching systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) experiments provide detailed insights into material microstructures, enabling high-resolution imaging as well as crystallographic analysis through advanced techniques like Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD). However, the interaction of the high-energy electron beam with the material can lead to localized heating, which may significantly impact specimen integrity, especially in applications requiring prolonged beam exposure, for instance when mapping the crystal structure using EBSD. This study examines electron-beam-induced heating effects on a model metal sample (iron), directly measuring the locally deposited electron beam energy with a MEMS-based heating device and validating these measurements through simulations, including Monte Carlo and Finite Element methods. The analysis focuses on the effects of various experimental parameters such as acceleration voltage (from 5 to 30 kV), beam current (from 0.17 nA to 22 nA), dwell time (from 1$\mu$s to 1ms) and sample tilt (0{\deg} to 70{\deg}). The findings reveal that local sample temperatures can increase by up to 70 {\deg}C during EBSD experiments, primarily affected by the choice in beam current and acceleration voltage, with beam current having the most significant impact.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We consider the generative modeling of speech over multiple minutes, a requirement for long-form multimedia generation and audio-native voice assistants. However, current spoken language models struggle to generate plausible speech past tens of seconds, from high temporal resolution of speech tokens causing loss of coherence, to architectural issues with long-sequence training or extrapolation, to memory costs at inference time. With these considerations we propose SpeechSSM, the first speech language model to learn from and sample long-form spoken audio (e.g., 16 minutes of read or extemporaneous speech) in a single decoding session without text intermediates, based on recent advances in linear-time sequence modeling. Furthermore, to address growing challenges in spoken language evaluation, especially in this new long-form setting, we propose: new embedding-based and LLM-judged metrics; quality measurements over length and time; and a new benchmark for long-form speech processing and generation, LibriSpeech-Long.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the rapidly evolving landscape of GameFi, a fusion of gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi), there exists a critical need to enhance player engagement and economic interaction within gaming ecosystems. Our GameFi ecosystem aims to fundamentally transform this landscape by integrating advanced embodied AI agents into GameFi platforms. These AI agents, developed using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude AI, are capable of proactive, adaptive, and contextually rich interactions with players. By going beyond traditional scripted responses, these agents become integral participants in the game's narrative and economic systems, directly influencing player strategies and in-game economies. We address the limitations of current GameFi platforms, which often lack immersive AI interactions and mechanisms for community engagement or creator monetization. Through the deep integration of AI agents with blockchain technology, we establish a consensus-driven, decentralized GameFi ecosystem. This ecosystem empowers creators to monetize their contributions and fosters democratic collaboration among players and creators. Furthermore, by embedding DeFi mechanisms into the gaming experience, we enhance economic participation and provide new opportunities for financial interactions within the game. Our approach enhances player immersion and retention and advances the GameFi ecosystem by bridging traditional gaming with Web3 technologies. By integrating sophisticated AI and DeFi elements, we contribute to the development of more engaging, economically robust, and community-centric gaming environments. This project represents a significant advancement in the state-of-the-art in GameFi, offering insights and methodologies that can be applied throughout the gaming industry.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) produce high-quality, photo-realistic images, however, the latency incurred by multiple costly inference iterations can restrict their applicability. We introduce LatentCRF, a continuous Conditional Random Field (CRF) model, implemented as a neural network layer, that models the spatial and semantic relationships among the latent vectors in the LDM. By replacing some of the computationally-intensive LDM inference iterations with our lightweight LatentCRF, we achieve a superior balance between quality, speed and diversity. We increase inference efficiency by 33% with no loss in image quality or diversity compared to the full LDM. LatentCRF is an easy add-on, which does not require modifying the LDM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are compact representations of all public knowledge of our physical environment and animal and human behaviors. The application of LLMs to robotics may offer a path to highly capable robots that perform well across most human tasks with limited or even zero tuning. Aside from increasingly sophisticated reasoning and task planning, networks of (suitably designed) LLMs offer ease of upgrading capabilities and allow humans to directly observe the robot's thinking. Here we explore the advantages, limitations, and particularities of using LLMs to control physical robots. The basic system consists of four LLMs communicating via a human language data bus implemented via web sockets and ROS2 message passing. Surprisingly, rich robot behaviors and good performance across different tasks could be achieved despite the robot's data fusion cycle running at only 1Hz and the central data bus running at the extremely limited rates of the human brain, of around 40 bits/s. The use of natural language for inter-LLM communication allowed the robot's reasoning and decision making to be directly observed by humans and made it trivial to bias the system's behavior with sets of rules written in plain English. These rules were immutably written into Ethereum, a global, public, and censorship resistant Turing-complete computer. We suggest that by using natural language as the data bus among interacting AIs, and immutable public ledgers to store behavior constraints, it is possible to build robots that combine unexpectedly rich performance, upgradability, and durable alignment with humans.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Tokenization is a necessary component within the current architecture of many language models, including the transformer-based large language models (LLMs) of Generative AI, yet its impact on the model's cognition is often overlooked. We argue that LLMs demonstrate that the Distributional Hypothesis (DH) is sufficient for reasonably human-like language performance, and that the emergence of human-meaningful linguistic units among tokens motivates linguistically-informed interventions in existing, linguistically-agnostic tokenization techniques, particularly with respect to their roles as (1) semantic primitives and as (2) vehicles for conveying salient distributional patterns from human language to the model. We explore tokenizations from a BPE tokenizer; extant model vocabularies obtained from Hugging Face and tiktoken; and the information in exemplar token vectors as they move through the layers of a RoBERTa (large) model. Besides creating sub-optimal semantic building blocks and obscuring the model's access to the necessary distributional patterns, we describe how tokenization pretraining can be a backdoor for bias and other unwanted content, which current alignment practices may not remediate. Additionally, we relay evidence that the tokenization algorithm's objective function impacts the LLM's cognition, despite being meaningfully insulated from the main system intelligence.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Metastable states appear as long-lived intermediate states in various natural transport phenomena which are governed by energy landscapes. Moreover, they dominate a system's evolution in deciding the selective outcome or shedding light on the preferred mechanism on how a system explores the energy landscape. It is thus crucial to develop techniques to quantify these metastabilities hence uncovering key details of the energy landscape. Here, we propose a powerful method by leveraging a many-body Arrhenius law that detects the metastabilites in an escape problem, involving interacting particles with excluded volume confined to a complex energy landscape. Observing transport in colloidal systems or translocation of macromolecules through biological pores can be an ideal test bed to verify our results.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, an increasing number of AI-driven programming assistants powered by code LLMs have been integrated into various real-world software development environments, significantly boosting developer productivity. However, existing code generation benchmarks primarily focus on general-purpose scenarios, leaving the code generation performance of LLMs for specific application domains largely unknown. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark, MultiCodeBench, to fill this gap. MultiCodeBench comprises 2,400 programming tasks, covering 12 popular software development domains and 15 programming languages. Specifically, we perform in-depth research to identify these 12 application domains. Given that each domain may involve multiple technical frameworks, and that different frameworks present distinct challenges in the coding process, we categorize the commonly used frameworks and platforms within each domain. We then sample programming problems from GitHub repositories related to these subdomains. To ensure the quality of the tasks and mitigate data leakage issues, we invite annotators to rewrite the docstrings for each task in MultiCodeBench. Additionally, we build a static analysis-based dependency parsing tool to extract the dependencies in the ground truth for each task, enabling deeper performance analysis. Through extensive experiments on MultiCodeBench with eleven representative mainstream LLMs, we reveal the code generation performance of the LLMs across different application domains, providing practical insights for developers in downstream fields when selecting LLMs. Furthermore, we analyze the reasons behind the models' failures in completing software application development tasks, offering guidance for model developers to enhance domain-specific code generation capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Malware authors often employ code obfuscations to make their malware harder to detect. Existing tools for generating obfuscated code often require access to the original source code (e.g., C++ or Java), and adding new obfuscations is a non-trivial, labor-intensive process. In this study, we ask the following question: Can Large Language Models (LLMs) potentially generate a new obfuscated assembly code? If so, this poses a risk to anti-virus engines and potentially increases the flexibility of attackers to create new obfuscation patterns. We answer this in the affirmative by developing the MetamorphASM benchmark comprising MetamorphASM Dataset (MAD) along with three code obfuscation techniques: dead code, register substitution, and control flow change. The MetamorphASM systematically evaluates the ability of LLMs to generate and analyze obfuscated code using MAD, which contains 328,200 obfuscated assembly code samples. We release this dataset and analyze the success rate of various LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5/4, GPT-4o-mini, Starcoder, CodeGemma, CodeLlama, CodeT5, and LLaMA 3.1) in generating obfuscated assembly code. The evaluation was performed using established information-theoretic metrics and manual human review to ensure correctness and provide the foundation for researchers to study and develop remediations to this risk.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The problem of evaluating the effectiveness of a treatment or policy commonly appears in causal inference applications under network interference. In this paper, we suggest the new method of high-dimensional network causal inference (HNCI) that provides both valid confidence interval on the average direct treatment effect on the treated (ADET) and valid confidence set for the neighborhood size for interference effect. We exploit the model setting in Belloni et al. (2022) and allow certain type of heterogeneity in node interference neighborhood sizes. We propose a linear regression formulation of potential outcomes, where the regression coefficients correspond to the underlying true interference function values of nodes and exhibit a latent homogeneous structure. Such a formulation allows us to leverage existing literature from linear regression and homogeneity pursuit to conduct valid statistical inferences with theoretical guarantees. The resulting confidence intervals for the ADET are formally justified through asymptotic normalities with estimable variances. We further provide the confidence set for the neighborhood size with theoretical guarantees exploiting the repro samples approach. The practical utilities of the newly suggested methods are demonstrated through simulation and real data examples.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite recent advancements in speech processing, zero-resource speech translation (ST) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) remain challenging problems. In this work, we propose to leverage a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) to perform ST and ASR in languages for which the model has never seen paired audio-text data. We achieve this by using a pre-trained multilingual speech encoder, a multilingual LLM, and a lightweight adaptation module that maps the audio representations to the token embedding space of the LLM. We perform several experiments both in ST and ASR to understand how to best train the model and what data has the most impact on performance in previously unseen languages. In ST, our best model is capable to achieve BLEU scores over 23 in CoVoST2 for two previously unseen languages, while in ASR, we achieve WERs of up to 28.2\%. We finally show that the performance of our system is bounded by the ability of the LLM to output text in the desired language.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Fine-grained sentiment analysis (FSA) aims to extract and summarize user opinions from vast opinionated text. Recent studies demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) possess exceptional sentiment understanding capabilities. However, directly deploying LLMs for FSA applications incurs high inference costs. Therefore, this paper investigates the distillation of fine-grained sentiment understanding from LLMs into small language models (SLMs). We prompt LLMs to examine and interpret the sentiments of given reviews and then utilize the generated content to pretrain SLMs. Additionally, we develop a comprehensive FSA benchmark to evaluate both SLMs and LLMs. Extensive experiments on this benchmark reveal that: (1) distillation significantly enhances the performance of SLMs in FSA tasks, achieving a 6.00\% improvement in $F_1$-score, and the distilled model can outperform Llama-2-7b with only 220M parameters; (2) distillation equips SLMs with excellent zero-shot sentiment classification capabilities, enabling them to match or even exceed their teacher models. These results suggest that distillation from LLMs is a highly promising direction for FSA. We will release our code, data, and pretrained model weights at \url{https://github.com/HITSZ-HLT/FSA-Distillation}.

Combining a dynamic leaderboard with an interactive LLM arena, Libra-Leaderboard encourages the joint optimization of capability and safety. Unlike traditional approaches that average performance and safety metrics, Libra-Leaderboard uses a distance-to-optimal-score method to calculate the overall rankings. This approach incentivizes models to achieve a balance rather than excelling in one dimension at the expense of some other ones. In the first release, Libra-Leaderboard evaluates 26 mainstream LLMs from 14 leading organizations, identifying critical safety challenges even in state-of-the-art models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reasoning is critical for large language models (LLMs) to excel in a wide range of tasks. While methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhance LLM performance by decomposing problems into intermediate steps, they also incur significant overhead in token usage, leading to increased costs. We find that the reasoning process of current LLMs is unnecessarily lengthy and it can be compressed by including a reasonable token budget in the prompt, but the choice of token budget plays a crucial role in the actual compression effectiveness. We then propose a token-budget-aware LLM reasoning framework, which dynamically estimates token budgets for different problems based on reasoning complexity and uses the estimated token budgets to guide the reasoning process. Experiments show that our method effectively reduces token costs in CoT reasoning with only a slight performance reduction, offering a practical solution to balance efficiency and accuracy in LLM reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Forecasting is a task that is difficult to evaluate: the ground truth can only be known in the future. Recent work showing LLM forecasters rapidly approaching human-level performance begs the question: how can we benchmark and evaluate these forecasters instantaneously? Following the consistency check framework, we measure the performance of forecasters in terms of the consistency of their predictions on different logically-related questions. We propose a new, general consistency metric based on arbitrage: for example, if a forecasting AI illogically predicts that both the Democratic and Republican parties have 60% probability of winning the 2024 US presidential election, an arbitrageur can trade against the forecaster's predictions and make a profit. We build an automated evaluation system that generates a set of base questions, instantiates consistency checks from these questions, elicits the predictions of the forecaster, and measures the consistency of the predictions. We then build a standard, proper-scoring-rule forecasting benchmark, and show that our (instantaneous) consistency metrics correlate with LLM forecasters' ground truth Brier scores (which are only known in the future). We also release a consistency benchmark that resolves in 2028, providing a long-term evaluation tool for forecasting.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in statistical learning theory have revealed profound connections between mutual information (MI) bounds, PAC-Bayesian theory, and Bayesian nonparametrics. This work introduces a novel mutual information bound for statistical models. The derived bound has wide-ranging applications in statistical inference. It yields improved contraction rates for fractional posteriors in Bayesian nonparametrics. It can also be used to study a wide range of estimation methods, such as variational inference or Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). By bridging these diverse areas, this work advances our understanding of the fundamental limits of statistical inference and the role of information in learning from data. We hope that these results will not only clarify connections between statistical inference and information theory but also help to develop a new toolbox to study a wide range of estimators.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), a sequence labeling task, has attracted increasing attention in multilingual contexts. While previous research has focused largely on fine-tuning or training models specifically for ABSA, we evaluate large language models (LLMs) under zero-shot conditions to explore their potential to tackle this challenge with minimal task-specific adaptation. We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of a series of LLMs on multilingual ABSA tasks, investigating various prompting strategies, including vanilla zero-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), self-improvement, self-debate, and self-consistency, across nine different models. Results indicate that while LLMs show promise in handling multilingual ABSA, they generally fall short of fine-tuned, task-specific models. Notably, simpler zero-shot prompts often outperform more complex strategies, especially in high-resource languages like English. These findings underscore the need for further refinement of LLM-based approaches to effectively address ABSA task across diverse languages.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet struggle with hallucination and outdated knowledge when tasked with complex knowledge reasoning, resulting in factually incorrect outputs. Previous studies have attempted to mitigate it by retrieving factual knowledge from large-scale knowledge graphs (KGs) to assist LLMs in logical reasoning and prediction of answers. However, this kind of approach often introduces noise and irrelevant data, especially in situations with extensive context from multiple knowledge aspects. In this way, LLM attention can be potentially mislead from question and relevant information. In our study, we introduce an Adaptive Multi-Aspect Retrieval-augmented over KGs (Amar) framework. This method retrieves knowledge including entities, relations, and subgraphs, and converts each piece of retrieved text into prompt embeddings. The Amar framework comprises two key sub-components: 1) a self-alignment module that aligns commonalities among entities, relations, and subgraphs to enhance retrieved text, thereby reducing noise interference; 2) a relevance gating module that employs a soft gate to learn the relevance score between question and multi-aspect retrieved data, to determine which information should be used to enhance LLMs' output, or even filtered altogether. Our method has achieved state-of-the-art performance on two common datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, showing a 1.9\% improvement in accuracy over its best competitor and a 6.6\% improvement in logical form generation over a method that directly uses retrieved text as context prompts. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Amar in improving the reasoning of LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Known as low energy consumption networks, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained a lot of attention within the past decades. While SNNs are increasing competitive with artificial neural networks (ANNs) for vision tasks, they are rarely used for long sequence tasks, despite their intrinsic temporal dynamics. In this work, we develop spiking state space models (SpikingSSMs) for long sequence learning by leveraging on the sequence learning abilities of state space models (SSMs). Inspired by dendritic neuron structure, we hierarchically integrate neuronal dynamics with the original SSM block, meanwhile realizing sparse synaptic computation. Furthermore, to solve the conflict of event-driven neuronal dynamics with parallel computing, we propose a light-weight surrogate dynamic network which accurately predicts the after-reset membrane potential and compatible to learnable thresholds, enabling orders of acceleration in training speed compared with conventional iterative methods. On the long range arena benchmark task, SpikingSSM achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art SSMs meanwhile realizing on average 90\% of network sparsity. On language modeling, our network significantly surpasses existing spiking large language models (spikingLLMs) on the WikiText-103 dataset with only a third of the model size, demonstrating its potential as backbone architecture for low computation cost LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Code review is a widespread practice to improve software quality and transfer knowledge. It is often seen as time-consuming due to the need for manual effort and potential delays. Several AI-assisted tools, such as Qodo, GitHub Copilot, and Coderabbit, provide automated reviews using large language models (LLMs). The effects of such tools in the industry are yet to be examined.   This study examines the impact of LLM-based automated code review tools in an industrial setting. The study was conducted within a software development environment that adopted an AI-assisted review tool (based on open-source Qodo PR Agent). Around 238 practitioners across ten projects had access to the tool. We focused on three projects with 4,335 pull requests, 1,568 of which underwent automated reviews. Data collection comprised three sources: (1) a quantitative analysis of pull request data, including comment labels indicating whether developers acted on the automated comments, (2) surveys sent to developers regarding their experience with reviews on individual pull requests, and (3) a broader survey of 22 practitioners capturing their general opinions on automated reviews.   73.8% of automated comments were resolved. However, the average pull request closure duration increased from five hours 52 minutes to eight hours 20 minutes, with varying trends across projects. Most practitioners reported a minor improvement in code quality due to automated reviews.   The LLM-based tool proved useful in software development, enhancing bug detection, increasing awareness of code quality, and promoting best practices. However, it also led to longer pull request closure times and introduced drawbacks like faulty reviews, unnecessary corrections, and irrelevant comments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Effective pre-training of large language models (LLMs) has been challenging due to the immense resource demands and the complexity of the technical processes involved. This paper presents a detailed technical report on YuLan-Mini, a highly capable base model with 2.42B parameters that achieves top-tier performance among models of similar parameter scale. Our pre-training approach focuses on enhancing training efficacy through three key technical contributions: an elaborate data pipeline combines data cleaning with data schedule strategies, a robust optimization method to mitigate training instability, and an effective annealing approach that incorporates targeted data selection and long context training. Remarkably, YuLan-Mini, trained on 1.08T tokens, achieves performance comparable to industry-leading models that require significantly more data. To facilitate reproduction, we release the full details of the data composition for each training phase. Project details can be accessed at the following link: https://github.com/RUC-GSAI/YuLan-Mini.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) shows promising potential for autonomous driving decision-making. However, DRL demands extensive computational resources to achieve a qualified policy in complex driving scenarios due to its low learning efficiency. Moreover, leveraging expert guidance from human to enhance DRL performance incurs prohibitively high labor costs, which limits its practical application. In this study, we propose a novel large language model (LLM) guided deep reinforcement learning (LGDRL) framework for addressing the decision-making problem of autonomous vehicles. Within this framework, an LLM-based driving expert is integrated into the DRL to provide intelligent guidance for the learning process of DRL. Subsequently, in order to efficiently utilize the guidance of the LLM expert to enhance the performance of DRL decision-making policies, the learning and interaction process of DRL is enhanced through an innovative expert policy constrained algorithm and a novel LLM-intervened interaction mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves superior driving performance with a 90\% task success rate but also significantly improves the learning efficiency and expert guidance utilization efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baseline algorithms. Moreover, the proposed method enables the DRL agent to maintain consistent and reliable performance in the absence of LLM expert guidance.

Our investigation serves as a case study leveraging specially designed datasets and experimental-scale LLMs to lay the groundwork for understanding these behaviors. Specifically, we aim to first enable LLMs to exhibit both memorization and generalization by training with the designed dataset, then (a) examine whether LLMs exhibit neuron-level spatial differentiation for memorization and generalization, (b) predict these behaviors using model internal representations, and (c) steer the behaviors through inference-time interventions. Our findings reveal that neuron-wise differentiation of memorization and generalization is observable in LLMs, and targeted interventions can successfully direct their behavior.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Inferential models (IMs) offer provably reliable, data-driven, possibilistic statistical inference. But despite IMs' theoretical and foundational advantages, efficient computation is often a challenge. This paper presents a simple and powerful numerical strategy for approximating the IM's possibility contour, or at least its $\alpha$-cut for a specified $\alpha \in (0,1)$. Our proposal starts with the specification a parametric family that, in a certain sense, approximately covers the credal set associated with the IM's possibility measure. Then the parameters of that parametric family are tuned in such a way that the family's $100(1-\alpha)\%$ credible set roughly matches the IM contour's $\alpha$-cut. This is reminiscent of the variational approximations now widely used in Bayesian statistics, hence the name variational-like IM approximation.

We introduce Contextual Backpropagation Loops (CBLs) as an iterative mechanism that incorporates top-down feedback to refine intermediate representations, thereby improving accuracy and robustness. This repeated process mirrors how humans continuously re-interpret sensory information in daily life-by checking and re-checking our perceptions using contextual cues. Our results suggest that CBLs can offer a straightforward yet powerful way to incorporate such contextual reasoning in modern deep learning architectures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Smart contracts are the fundamental components of blockchain technology. They are programs to determine cryptocurrency transactions, and are irreversible once deployed, making it crucial for cryptocurrency investors to understand the cryptocurrency transaction behaviors of smart contracts comprehensively. However, it is a challenging (if not impossible) task for investors, as they do not necessarily have a programming background to check the complex source code. Even for investors with certain programming skills, inferring all the potential behaviors from the code alone is still difficult, since the actual behaviors can be different when different investors are involved. To address this challenge, we propose PrettiSmart, a novel visualization approach via execution simulation to achieve intuitive and reliable visual interpretation of smart contracts. Specifically, we develop a simulator to comprehensively capture most of the possible real-world smart contract behaviors, involving multiple investors and various smart contract functions. Then, we present PrettiSmart to intuitively visualize the simulation results of a smart contract, which consists of two modules: The Simulation Overview Module is a barcode-based design, providing a visual summary for each simulation, and the Simulation Detail Module is an augmented sequential design to display the cryptocurrency transaction details in each simulation, such as function call sequences, cryptocurrency flows, and state variable changes. It can allow investors to intuitively inspect and understand how a smart contract will work. We evaluate PrettiSmart through two case studies and in-depth user interviews with 12 investors. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of PrettiSmart in facilitating an easy interpretation of smart contracts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced natural language processing (NLP) applications. Nevertheless, these models often inherit biases from their training data. Despite the availability of various datasets for bias detection, most are limited to one or two NLP tasks (typically classification or evaluation) and lack comprehensive evaluations across a broader range of NLP tasks. To address this gap, we introduce the Bias Evaluations Across Domains BEADs dataset, designed to support a wide array of NLP tasks, including text classification, token classification, bias quantification, and benign language generation. A key focus of this paper is the gold label dataset that is annotated by GPT4 for scalabilty and verified by experts to ensure high reliability. BEADs provides data for both fine-tuning, including classification and language generation tasks, and for evaluating LLMs. Our findings indicate that BEADs effectively identifies numerous biases when fine-tuned on this dataset. It also reduces biases when used for fine-tuning language generation task, while preserving language quality. The results also reveal some prevalent demographic biases in LLMs when BEADs is used for evaluation in demographic task. We provide the BEADs dataset for detecting biases in various domains, and this dataset is readily usable for responsible AI development and application.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced code completion capabilities, giving rise to a new generation of LLM-based Code Completion Tools (LCCTs). Unlike general-purpose LLMs, these tools possess unique workflows, integrating multiple information sources as input and prioritizing code suggestions over natural language interaction, which introduces distinct security challenges. Additionally, LCCTs often rely on proprietary code datasets for training, raising concerns about the potential exposure of sensitive data. This paper exploits these distinct characteristics of LCCTs to develop targeted attack methodologies on two critical security risks: jailbreaking and training data extraction attacks. Our experimental results expose significant vulnerabilities within LCCTs, including a 99.4% success rate in jailbreaking attacks on GitHub Copilot and a 46.3% success rate on Amazon Q. Furthermore, We successfully extracted sensitive user data from GitHub Copilot, including 54 real email addresses and 314 physical addresses associated with GitHub usernames. Our study also demonstrates that these code-based attack methods are effective against general-purpose LLMs, such as the GPT series, highlighting a broader security misalignment in the handling of code by modern LLMs. These findings underscore critical security challenges associated with LCCTs and suggest essential directions for strengthening their security frameworks. The example code and attack samples from our research are provided at https://github.com/Sensente/Security-Attacks-on-LCCTs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Significant advances have been made in developing general-purpose embodied AI in environments like Minecraft through the adoption of LLM-augmented hierarchical approaches. While these approaches, which combine high-level planners with low-level controllers, show promise, low-level controllers frequently become performance bottlenecks due to repeated failures. In this paper, we argue that the primary cause of failure in many low-level controllers is the absence of an episodic memory system. To address this, we introduce MrSteve (Memory Recall Steve-1), a novel low-level controller equipped with Place Event Memory (PEM), a form of episodic memory that captures what, where, and when information from episodes. This directly addresses the main limitation of the popular low-level controller, Steve-1. Unlike previous models that rely on short-term memory, PEM organizes spatial and event-based data, enabling efficient recall and navigation in long-horizon tasks. Additionally, we propose an Exploration Strategy and a Memory-Augmented Task Solving Framework, allowing agents to alternate between exploration and task-solving based on recalled events. Our approach significantly improves task-solving and exploration efficiency compared to existing methods. We will release our code and demos on the project page: https://sites.google.com/view/mr-steve.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As the development of large language models (LLMs) rapidly advances, securing these models effectively without compromising their utility has become a pivotal area of research. However, current defense strategies against jailbreak attacks (i.e., efforts to bypass security protocols) often suffer from limited adaptability, restricted general capability, and high cost. To address these challenges, we introduce SafeAligner, a methodology implemented at the decoding stage to fortify defenses against jailbreak attacks. We begin by developing two specialized models: the Sentinel Model, which is trained to foster safety, and the Intruder Model, designed to generate riskier responses. SafeAligner leverages the disparity in security levels between the responses from these models to differentiate between harmful and beneficial tokens, effectively guiding the safety alignment by altering the output token distribution of the target model. Extensive experiments show that SafeAligner can increase the likelihood of beneficial tokens, while reducing the occurrence of harmful ones, thereby ensuring secure alignment with minimal loss to generality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A 3D scene graph represents a compact scene model, storing information about the objects and the semantic relationships between them, making its use promising for robotic tasks. When interacting with a user, an embodied intelligent agent should be capable of responding to various queries about the scene formulated in natural language. Large Language Models (LLMs) are beneficial solutions for user-robot interaction due to their natural language understanding and reasoning abilities. Recent methods for creating learnable representations of 3D scenes have demonstrated the potential to improve the quality of LLMs responses by adapting to the 3D world. However, the existing methods do not explicitly utilize information about the semantic relationships between objects, limiting themselves to information about their coordinates. In this work, we propose a method 3DGraphLLM for constructing a learnable representation of a 3D scene graph. The learnable representation is used as input for LLMs to perform 3D vision-language tasks. In our experiments on popular ScanRefer, RIORefer, Multi3DRefer, ScanQA, Sqa3D, and Scan2cap datasets, we demonstrate the advantage of this approach over baseline methods that do not use information about the semantic relationships between objects. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/CognitiveAISystems/3DGraphLLM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The core of the Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) task is to predict and complete the missing relations or nodes in a KG. Common KGC tasks are mostly about inferring unknown elements with one or two elements being known in a triple. In comparison, the Triple Set Prediction (TSP) task is a more realistic knowledge graph completion task. It aims to predict all elements of unknown triples based on the information from known triples. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited significant advancements in language comprehension, demonstrating considerable potential for KGC tasks. However, the potential of LLM on the TSP task has not yet to be investigated. Thus in this paper we proposed a new framework to explore the strengths and limitations of LLM in the TSP task. Specifically, the framework consists of LLM-based rule mining and LLM-based triple set prediction. The relation list of KG embedded within rich semantic information is first leveraged to prompt LLM in the generation of rules. This process is both efficient and independent of statistical information, making it easier to mine effective and realistic rules. For each subgraph, the specified rule is applied in conjunction with the relevant triples within that subgraph to guide the LLM in predicting the missing triples. Subsequently, the predictions from all subgraphs are consolidated to derive the complete set of predicted triples on KG. Finally, the method is evaluated on the relatively complete CFamily dataset. The experimental results indicate that when LLMs are required to adhere to a large amount of factual knowledge to predict missing triples, significant hallucinations occurs, leading to a noticeable decline in performance. To further explore the causes of this phenomenon, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis supported by a detailed case study.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> International enterprises, organizations, or hospitals collect large amounts of multi-modal data stored in databases, text documents, images, and videos. While there has been recent progress in the separate fields of multi-modal data exploration as well as in database systems that automatically translate natural language questions to database query languages, the research challenge of querying database systems combined with other unstructured modalities such as images in natural language is widely unexplored.   In this paper, we propose XMODE - a system that enables explainable, multi-modal data exploration in natural language. Our approach is based on the following research contributions: (1) Our system is inspired by a real-world use case that enables users to explore multi-modal information systems. (2) XMODE leverages a LLM-based agentic AI framework to decompose a natural language question into subtasks such as text-to-SQL generation and image analysis. (3) Experimental results on multi-modal datasets over relational data and images demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art multi-modal exploration systems, excelling not only in accuracy but also in various performance metrics such as query latency, API costs, planning efficiency, and explanation quality, thanks to the more effective utilization of the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Nowadays, AI researchers become more and more interested in fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM, whose size has grown to up to over 100B parameters, for their downstream tasks. One approach to fine-tune such huge models is to aggregate device memory from many GPUs. However, this approach introduces prohibitive costs for most data scientists with a limited budget for high-end GPU servers. In this paper, we focus on LLM fine-tuning on a single consumer-grade GPU in a commodity server with limited main memory capacity, which is accessible to most AI researchers. In such a scenario, existing offloading-based methods fail to fine-tune an LLM efficiently due to a lack of holistic intra-server tensor movement management. To this end, we present LoHan, a low-cost, high-performance deep learning training framework that enables efficient 100B-scale model fine-tuning on a commodity server with a consumer-grade GPU and limited main memory capacity. The key idea is to add holistic offloading traffic as an optimization dimension for 1)active gradient offloading, and 2)holistic traffic-aware activation swapping mechanism. The experimental results show that 1)LoHan is the first to fine-tune a 175B model on an RTX 4090 and 256 GB main memory, 2)LoHan achieves 2.32x throughput than the state-of-the-art baselines when fine-tuning a small 13B model, and 3)LoHan enables a cheap low-end consumer GPU to have higher cost-effectiveness than a DGX-A100 cluster when fine-tuning a 175B model.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Spear-phishing attacks present a significant security challenge, with large language models (LLMs) escalating the threat by generating convincing emails and facilitating target reconnaissance. To address this, we propose a detection approach based on a novel document vectorization method that utilizes an ensemble of LLMs to create representation vectors. By prompting LLMs to reason and respond to human-crafted questions, we quantify the presence of common persuasion principles in the email's content, producing prompted contextual document vectors for a downstream supervised machine learning model. We evaluate our method using a unique dataset generated by a proprietary system that automates target reconnaissance and spear-phishing email creation. Our method achieves a 91\% F1 score in identifying LLM-generated spear-phishing emails, with the training set comprising only traditional phishing and benign emails. Key contributions include a novel document vectorization method utilizing LLM reasoning, a publicly available dataset of high-quality spear-phishing emails, and the demonstrated effectiveness of our method in detecting such emails. This methodology can be utilized for various document classification tasks, particularly in adversarial problem domains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As social changes accelerate, the incidence of psychosomatic disorders has significantly increased, becoming a major challenge in global health issues. This necessitates an innovative knowledge system and analytical methods to aid in diagnosis and treatment. Here, we establish the ontology model and entity types, using the BERT model and LoRA-tuned LLM for named entity recognition, constructing the knowledge graph with 9668 triples. Next, by analyzing the network distances between disease, symptom, and drug modules, it was found that closer network distances among diseases can predict greater similarities in their clinical manifestations, treatment approaches, and psychological mechanisms, and closer distances between symptoms indicate that they are more likely to co-occur. Lastly, by comparing the proximity d and proximity z score, it was shown that symptom-disease pairs in primary diagnostic relationships have a stronger association and are of higher referential value than those in diagnostic relationships. The research results revealed the potential connections between diseases, co-occurring symptoms, and similarities in treatment strategies, providing new perspectives for the diagnosis and treatment of psychosomatic disorders and valuable information for future mental health research and practice.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current conversational recommendation systems focus predominantly on text. However, real-world recommendation settings are generally multimodal, causing a significant gap between existing research and practical applications. To address this issue, we propose Muse, the first multimodal conversational recommendation dataset. Muse comprises 83,148 utterances from 7,000 conversations centered around the Clothing domain. Each conversation contains comprehensive multimodal interactions, rich elements, and natural dialogues. Data in Muse are automatically synthesized by a multi-agent framework powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). It innovatively derives user profiles from real-world scenarios rather than depending on manual design and history data for better scalability, and then it fulfills conversation simulation and optimization. Both human and LLM evaluations demonstrate the high quality of conversations in Muse. Additionally, fine-tuning experiments on three MLLMs demonstrate Muse's learnable patterns for recommendations and responses, confirming its value for multimodal conversational recommendation. Our dataset and codes are available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Muse-0086}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in linguistic tasks but struggle with mathematical reasoning, particularly in non English languages like Hindi. This research aims to enhance the mathematical reasoning skills of smaller, resource efficient open-source LLMs in both Hindi and English. We evaluate models like OpenHathi 7B, LLaMA-2 7B, WizardMath 7B, Mistral 7B, LLeMMa 7B, MAmmoTH 7B, Gemini Pro, and GPT-4 using zero-shot, few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) methods, and supervised fine-tuning. Our approach incorporates curriculum learning, progressively training models on increasingly difficult problems, a novel Decomposition Strategy to simplify complex arithmetic operations, and a Structured Solution Design that divides solutions into phases. Our experiments result in notable performance enhancements. WizardMath 7B exceeds Gemini's accuracy on English datasets by +6% and matches Gemini's performance on Hindi datasets. Adopting a bilingual approach that combines English and Hindi samples achieves results comparable to individual language models, demonstrating the capability to learn mathematical reasoning in both languages. This research highlights the potential for improving mathematical reasoning in open-source LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) use the key-value (KV) cache to significantly accelerate inference by storing the key and value embeddings of past tokens. However, this cache consumes significant GPU memory. In this work, we introduce HashEvict, an algorithm that uses locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to compress the KV cache. HashEvict quickly locates tokens in the cache that are cosine dissimilar to the current query token. This is achieved by computing the Hamming distance between binarized Gaussian projections of the current token query and cached token keys, with a projection length much smaller than the embedding dimension. We maintain a lightweight binary structure in GPU memory to facilitate these calculations. Unlike existing compression strategies that compute attention to determine token retention, HashEvict makes these decisions pre-attention, thereby reducing computational costs. Additionally, HashEvict is dynamic - at every decoding step, the key and value of the current token replace the embeddings of a token expected to produce the lowest attention score. We demonstrate that HashEvict can compress the KV cache by 30%-70% while maintaining high performance across reasoning, multiple-choice, long-context retrieval and summarization tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, with frameworks like Chatbot Arena providing pioneering platforms for evaluating these models. By facilitating millions of pairwise comparisons based on human judgments, Chatbot Arena has become a cornerstone in LLM evaluation, offering rich datasets for ranking models in open-ended conversational tasks. Building upon this foundation, we propose a statistical framework that incorporates key advancements to address specific challenges in pairwise comparison analysis. First, we introduce a factored tie model that enhances the ability to handle ties -- an integral aspect of human-judged comparisons -- significantly improving the model's fit to observed data. Second, we extend the framework to model covariance between competitors, enabling deeper insights into performance relationships and facilitating intuitive groupings into performance tiers. Third, we resolve optimization challenges arising from parameter non-uniqueness by introducing novel constraints, ensuring stable and interpretable parameter estimation. Through rigorous evaluation and extensive experimentation, our framework demonstrates substantial improvements over existing methods in modeling pairwise comparison data. To support reproducibility and practical adoption, we release leaderbot, an open-source Python package implementing our models and analyses.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have emerged as the de facto approach for high-fidelity image synthesis, operating diffusion processes on continuous VAE latent, which significantly differ from the text generation methods employed by Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce a novel generative framework, the Recurrent Diffusion Probabilistic Model (RDPM), which enhances the diffusion process through a recurrent token prediction mechanism, thereby pioneering the field of Discrete Diffusion. By progressively introducing Gaussian noise into the latent representations of images and encoding them into vector-quantized tokens in a recurrent manner, RDPM facilitates a unique diffusion process on discrete-value domains. This process iteratively predicts the token codes for subsequent timesteps, transforming the initial standard Gaussian noise into the source data distribution, aligning with GPT-style models in terms of the loss function. RDPM demonstrates superior performance while benefiting from the speed advantage of requiring only a few inference steps. This model not only leverages the diffusion process to ensure high-quality generation but also converts continuous signals into a series of high-fidelity discrete tokens, thereby maintaining a unified optimization strategy with other discrete tokens, such as text. We anticipate that this work will contribute to the development of a unified model for multimodal generation, specifically by integrating continuous signal domains such as images, videos, and audio with text. We will release the code and model weights to the open-source community.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> AI agents are systems capable of perceiving their environment, autonomously planning and executing tasks. Recent advancements in LLM have introduced a transformative paradigm for AI agents, enabling them to interact with external resources and tools through prompts. In such agents, the workflow integrates developer-written code, which manages framework construction and logic control, with LLM-generated natural language that enhances dynamic decision-making and interaction. However, discrepancies between developer-implemented logic and the dynamically generated content of LLMs in terms of behavior and expected outcomes can lead to defects, such as tool invocation failures and task execution errors. These issues introduce specific risks, leading to various defects in LLM-based AI Agents, such as service interruptions. Despite the importance of these issues, there is a lack of systematic work that focuses on analyzing LLM-based AI Agents to uncover defects in their code. In this paper, we present the first study focused on identifying and detecting defects in LLM Agents. We collected and analyzed 6,854 relevant posts from StackOverflow to define 8 types of agent defects. For each type, we provided detailed descriptions with an example. Then, we designed a static analysis tool, named Agentable, to detect the defects. Agentable leverages Code Property Graphs and LLMs to analyze Agent workflows by efficiently identifying specific code patterns and analyzing natural language descriptions. To evaluate Agentable, we constructed two datasets: AgentSet, consists of 84 real-world Agents, and AgentTest, which contains 78 Agents specifically designed to include various types of defects. Our results show that Agentable achieved an overall accuracy of 88.79% and a recall rate of 91.03%. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the 889 defects of the AgentSet, highlighting the prevalence of these defects.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The field of machine translation has achieved significant advancements, yet domain-specific terminology translation, particularly in AI, remains challenging. We introduced GIST, a large-scale multilingual AI terminology dataset containing 5K terms extracted from top AI conference papers spanning 2000 to 2023. The terms were translated into Arabic, Chinese, French, Japanese, and Russian using a hybrid framework that combines LLMs for extraction with human expertise for translation. The dataset's quality was benchmarked against existing resources, demonstrating superior translation accuracy through crowdsourced evaluation. GIST was integrated into translation workflows using post-translation refinement methods that required no retraining, where LLM prompting consistently improved BLEU and COMET scores. A web demonstration on the ACL Anthology platform highlights its practical application, showcasing improved accessibility for non-English speakers. This work aims to address critical gaps in AI terminology resources and fosters global inclusivity and collaboration in AI research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph anomaly detection (GAD), which aims to identify abnormal nodes that differ from the majority within a graph, has garnered significant attention. However, current GAD methods necessitate training specific to each dataset, resulting in high training costs, substantial data requirements, and limited generalizability when being applied to new datasets and domains. To address these limitations, this paper proposes ARC, a generalist GAD approach that enables a ``one-for-all'' GAD model to detect anomalies across various graph datasets on-the-fly. Equipped with in-context learning, ARC can directly extract dataset-specific patterns from the target dataset using few-shot normal samples at the inference stage, without the need for retraining or fine-tuning on the target dataset. ARC comprises three components that are well-crafted for capturing universal graph anomaly patterns: 1) smoothness-based feature Alignment module that unifies the features of different datasets into a common and anomaly-sensitive space; 2) ego-neighbor Residual graph encoder that learns abnormality-related node embeddings; and 3) cross-attentive in-Context anomaly scoring module that predicts node abnormality by leveraging few-shot normal samples. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets from various domains demonstrate the superior anomaly detection performance, efficiency, and generalizability of ARC.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Solving complex mathematical problems via system-2 reasoning is a natural human skill, yet it remains a significant challenge for current large language models (LLMs). We identify the scarcity of deliberate multi-step reasoning data as a primary limiting factor. To this end, we introduce Enriched Instruction Tuning (EIT), a method that enriches existing human-annotated mathematical datasets by synergizing human and AI feedback to create fine-grained reasoning trajectories. These datasets are then used to fine-tune open-source LLMs, enhancing their mathematical reasoning abilities without reliance on any symbolic verification program. Concretely, EIT is composed of two critical steps: Enriching with Reasoning Plan (ERP) and Enriching with Reasoning Step (ERS). The former generates a high-level plan that breaks down complex instructions into a sequence of simpler objectives, while ERS fills in reasoning contexts often overlooked by human annotators, creating a smoother reasoning trajectory for LLM fine-tuning. Unlike existing CoT prompting methods that generate reasoning chains only depending on LLM's internal knowledge, our method leverages human-annotated initial answers as ``meta-knowledge'' to help LLMs generate more detailed and precise reasoning processes, leading to a more trustworthy LLM expert for complex mathematical problems. In experiments, EIT achieves an accuracy of 84.1% on GSM8K and 32.5% on MATH, surpassing state-of-the-art fine-tuning and prompting methods, and even matching the performance of tool-augmented methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA). However existing methods still have challenges: the inability to use external tools autonomously, and the inability to work in teams. Humans tend to know whether they need to use external tools when they encounter a new question, e.g., they tend to be able to give a direct answer to a familiar question, whereas they tend to use tools such as search engines when they encounter an unfamiliar question. In addition, humans also tend to collaborate and discuss with others to get better answers. Inspired by this, we propose the multi-agent voting framework. We design three LLM-based agents that simulate different levels of staff in a team, and assign the available tools according to the levels. Each agent provides the corresponding answer, and finally all the answers provided by the agents are voted to get the final answer. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA show that our approach outperforms other baselines by 2.2 and 1.0, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Conversational question answering (ConvQA) is a convenient means of searching over RDF knowledge graphs (KGs), where a prevalent approach is to translate natural language questions to SPARQL queries. However, SPARQL has certain shortcomings: (i) it is brittle for complex intents and conversational questions, and (ii) it is not suitable for more abstract needs. Instead, we propose a novel two-pronged system where we fuse: (i) SQL-query results over a database automatically derived from the KG, and (ii) text-search results over verbalizations of KG facts. Our pipeline supports iterative retrieval: when the results of any branch are found to be unsatisfactory, the system can automatically opt for further rounds. We put everything together in a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) setup, where an LLM generates a coherent response from accumulated search results. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed system over several baselines on a knowledge graph of BMW automobiles.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multivariate extreme value distributions are a common choice for modelling multivariate extremes. In high dimensions, however, the construction of flexible and parsimonious models is challenging. We propose to combine bivariate max-stable distributions into a Markov random field with respect to a tree. Although in general not max-stable itself, this Markov tree is attracted by a multivariate max-stable distribution. The latter serves as a tree-based approximation to an unknown max-stable distribution with the given bivariate distributions as margins. Given data, we learn an appropriate tree structure by Prim's algorithm with estimated pairwise upper tail dependence coefficients as edge weights. The distributions of pairs of connected variables can be fitted in various ways. The resulting tree-structured max-stable distribution allows for inference on rare event probabilities, as illustrated on river discharge data from the upper Danube basin.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) synergizes the retrieval of pertinent data with the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring that the generated output is not only contextually relevant but also accurate and current. We introduce XRAG, an open-source, modular codebase that facilitates exhaustive evaluation of the performance of foundational components of advanced RAG modules. These components are systematically categorized into four core phases: pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval, and generation. We systematically analyse them across reconfigured datasets, providing a comprehensive benchmark for their effectiveness. As the complexity of RAG systems continues to escalate, we underscore the critical need to identify potential failure points in RAG systems. We formulate a suite of experimental methodologies and diagnostic testing protocols to dissect the failure points inherent in RAG engineering. Subsequently, we proffer bespoke solutions aimed at bolstering the overall performance of these modules. Our work thoroughly evaluates the performance of advanced core components in RAG systems, providing insights into optimizations for prevalent failure points.

We consider both early and late binary formation mechanisms, and perform Bayesian parameter inference, investigating different prior distributions of the model parameters. From the non-detection of the GWB, we provide constraints on the fraction of primordial black holes contributing to the present dark matter energy density.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their power comes with significant security considerations. While extensive research has been conducted on the safety of LLMs in chat mode, the security implications of their function calling feature have been largely overlooked. This paper uncovers a critical vulnerability in the function calling process of LLMs, introducing a novel "jailbreak function" attack method that exploits alignment discrepancies, user coercion, and the absence of rigorous safety filters. Our empirical study, conducted on six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-pro, reveals an alarming average success rate of over 90\% for this attack. We provide a comprehensive analysis of why function calls are susceptible to such attacks and propose defensive strategies, including the use of defensive prompts. Our findings highlight the urgent need for enhanced security measures in the function calling capabilities of LLMs, contributing to the field of AI safety by identifying a previously unexplored risk, designing an effective attack method, and suggesting practical defensive measures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-language models (VLMs) have revolutionized machine learning by leveraging large pre-trained models to tackle various downstream tasks. Despite improvements in label, training, and data efficiency, many state-of-the-art VLMs still require task-specific hyperparameter tuning and fail to fully exploit test samples. To overcome these challenges, we propose a graph-based approach for label-efficient adaptation and inference. Our method dynamically constructs a graph over text prompts, few-shot examples, and test samples, using label propagation for inference without task-specific tuning. Unlike existing zero-shot label propagation techniques, our approach requires no additional unlabeled support set and effectively leverages the test sample manifold through dynamic graph expansion. We further introduce a context-aware feature re-weighting mechanism to improve task adaptation accuracy. Additionally, our method supports efficient graph expansion, enabling real-time inductive inference. Extensive evaluations on downstream tasks, such as fine-grained categorization and out-of-distribution generalization, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As the scale of vision models continues to grow, Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has emerged as a parameter-efficient transfer learning technique, noted for its superior performance compared to full fine-tuning. However, indiscriminately applying prompts to every layer without considering their inherent correlations, can cause significant disturbances, leading to suboptimal transferability. Additionally, VPT disrupts the original self-attention structure, affecting the aggregation of visual features, and lacks a mechanism for explicitly mining discriminative visual features, which are crucial for classification. To address these issues, we propose a Semantic Hierarchical Prompt (SHIP) fine-tuning strategy. We adaptively construct semantic hierarchies and use semantic-independent and semantic-shared prompts to learn hierarchical representations. We also integrate attribute prompts and a prompt matching loss to enhance feature discrimination and employ decoupled attention for robustness and reduced inference costs. SHIP significantly improves performance, achieving a 4.9% gain in accuracy over VPT with a ViT-B/16 backbone on VTAB-1k tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/haoweiz23/SHIP.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), enhancing their performance has become a research hotspot. This paper presents a novel multi-prompt ensemble decoding approach designed to bolster the generation quality of LLMs by leveraging the aggregation of outcomes from multiple prompts. Given a unique input $X$, we submit $n$ variations of prompts with $X$ to LLMs in batch mode to decode and derive probability distributions. For each token prediction, we calculate the ensemble probability by averaging the $n$ probability distributions within the batch, utilizing this aggregated probability to generate the token. This technique is dubbed Inner-Batch Ensemble. To facilitate efficient batch inference, we implement a Left-Padding strategy to maintain uniform input lengths across the n prompts. Through extensive experimentation on diverse NLP tasks, including machine translation, code generation, and text simplification, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method in enhancing LLM performance. The results show substantial improvements in BLEU scores, pass@$k$ rates, and LENS metrics over conventional methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We aim to optimize the binary detection of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) based on emphysema presence in the lung with convolutional neural networks (CNN) by exploring manually adjusted versus automated window-setting optimization (WSO) on computed tomography (CT) images. 7,194 CT images (3,597 with COPD; 3,597 healthy controls) from 78 subjects were selected retrospectively (10.2018-12.2021) and preprocessed. For each image, intensity values were manually clipped to the emphysema window setting and a baseline 'full-range' window setting. Class-balanced train, validation, and test sets contained 3,392, 1,114, and 2,688 images. The network backbone was optimized by comparing various CNN architectures. Furthermore, automated WSO was implemented by adding a customized layer to the model. The image-level area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (AUC) [lower, upper limit 95% confidence] was utilized to compare model variations. Repeated inference (n=7) on the test set showed that the DenseNet was the most efficient backbone and achieved a mean AUC of 0.80 [0.76, 0.85] without WSO. Comparably, with input images manually adjusted to the emphysema window, the DenseNet model predicted COPD with a mean AUC of 0.86 [0.82, 0.89]. By adding a customized WSO layer to the DenseNet, an optimal window in the proximity of the emphysema window setting was learned automatically, and a mean AUC of 0.82 [0.78, 0.86] was achieved. Detection of COPD with DenseNet models was improved by WSO of CT data to the emphysema window setting range.

This paper presents an in-depth review of cutting-edge LLM-/VLM-based methods in 2024, focusing on four key aspects: (i) enhancing interpretability through semantic insights and textual explanations, making visual anomalies more understandable; (ii) capturing intricate temporal relationships to detect and localize dynamic anomalies across video frames; (iii) enabling few-shot and zero-shot detection to minimize reliance on large, annotated datasets; and (iv) addressing open-world and class-agnostic anomalies by using semantic understanding and motion features for spatiotemporal coherence. We highlight their potential to redefine the landscape of VAD. Additionally, we explore the synergy between visual and textual modalities offered by LLMs and VLMs, highlighting their combined strengths and proposing future directions to fully exploit the potential in enhancing video anomaly detection.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The growing ubiquity of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in several real-world services triggers severe concerns about their security. A RAG system improves the generative capabilities of a Large Language Models (LLM) by a retrieval mechanism which operates on a private knowledge base, whose unintended exposure could lead to severe consequences, including breaches of private and sensitive information. This paper presents a black-box attack to force a RAG system to leak its private knowledge base which, differently from existing approaches, is adaptive and automatic. A relevance-based mechanism and an attacker-side open-source LLM favor the generation of effective queries to leak most of the (hidden) knowledge base. Extensive experimentation proves the quality of the proposed algorithm in different RAG pipelines and domains, comparing to very recent related approaches, which turn out to be either not fully black-box, not adaptive, or not based on open-source models. The findings from our study remark the urgent need for more robust privacy safeguards in the design and deployment of RAG systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for easily adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to various tasks. However, our understanding of how ICL works remains limited. We explore a simple model of ICL in a controlled setup with synthetic training data to investigate ICL of univariate linear functions. We experiment with a range of GPT-2-like transformer models trained from scratch. Our findings challenge the prevailing narrative that transformers adopt algorithmic approaches like linear regression to learn a linear function in-context. These models fail to generalize beyond their training distribution, highlighting fundamental limitations in their capacity to infer abstract task structures. Our experiments lead us to propose a mathematically precise hypothesis of what the model might be learning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Code review is a vital but demanding aspect of software development, generating significant interest in automating review comments. Traditional evaluation methods for these comments, primarily based on text similarity, face two major challenges: inconsistent reliability of human-authored comments in open-source projects and the weak correlation of text similarity with objectives like enhancing code quality and detecting defects.   This study empirically analyzes benchmark comments using a novel set of criteria informed by prior research and developer interviews. We then similarly revisit the evaluation of existing methodologies. Our evaluation framework, DeepCRCEval, integrates human evaluators and Large Language Models (LLMs) for a comprehensive reassessment of current techniques based on the criteria set. Besides, we also introduce an innovative and efficient baseline, LLM-Reviewer, leveraging the few-shot learning capabilities of LLMs for a target-oriented comparison.   Our research highlights the limitations of text similarity metrics, finding that less than 10% of benchmark comments are high quality for automation. In contrast, DeepCRCEval effectively distinguishes between high and low-quality comments, proving to be a more reliable evaluation mechanism. Incorporating LLM evaluators into DeepCRCEval significantly boosts efficiency, reducing time and cost by 88.78% and 90.32%, respectively. Furthermore, LLM-Reviewer demonstrates significant potential of focusing task real targets in comment generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The role of reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing the reasoning of large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly significant. Despite the success of RL in many scenarios, there are still many challenges in improving the reasoning of LLMs. One challenge is the sparse reward, which makes optimization difficult for RL and necessitates a large amount of data samples. Another challenge stems from the inherent instability of RL, particularly when using Actor-Critic (AC) methods to derive optimal policies, which often leads to unstable training processes. To address these issues, we introduce Direct Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO), an novel step-level offline RL algorithm. Unlike standard alignment that rely solely outcome rewards to optimize policies (such as DPO), DAPO employs a critic function to predict the reasoning accuracy at each step, thereby generating dense signals to refine the generation strategy. Additionally, the Actor and Critic components in DAPO are trained independently, avoiding the co-training instability observed in standard AC algorithms like PPO. We train DAPO on mathematical and code query datasets and then evaluate its performance on multiple benchmarks. Our results show that DAPO can effectively enhance the mathematical and code capabilities on both SFT models and RL models, demonstrating the effectiveness of DAPO.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the first edition of the Academic Essay Authenticity Challenge, organized as part of the GenAI Content Detection shared tasks collocated with COLING 2025. This challenge focuses on detecting machine-generated vs. human-authored essays for academic purposes. The task is defined as follows: "Given an essay, identify whether it is generated by a machine or authored by a human.'' The challenge involves two languages: English and Arabic. During the evaluation phase, 25 teams submitted systems for English and 21 teams for Arabic, reflecting substantial interest in the task. Finally, seven teams submitted system description papers. The majority of submissions utilized fine-tuned transformer-based models, with one team employing Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Llama 2 and Llama 3. This paper outlines the task formulation, details the dataset construction process, and explains the evaluation framework. Additionally, we present a summary of the approaches adopted by participating teams. Nearly all submitted systems outperformed the n-gram-based baseline, with the top-performing systems achieving F1 scores exceeding 0.98 for both languages, indicating significant progress in the detection of machine-generated text.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we explore the relevance of large language models (LLMs) for annotating references to Roman and Greek mythological entities in modern and contemporary French literature. We present an annotation scheme and demonstrate that recent LLMs can be directly applied to follow this scheme effectively, although not without occasionally making significant analytical errors. Additionally, we show that LLMs (and, more specifically, ChatGPT) are capable of offering interpretative insights into the use of mythological references by literary authors. However, we also find that LLMs struggle to accurately identify relevant passages in novels (when used as an information retrieval engine), often hallucinating and generating fabricated examples-an issue that raises significant ethical concerns. Nonetheless, when used carefully, LLMs remain valuable tools for performing annotations with high accuracy, especially for tasks that would be difficult to annotate comprehensively on a large scale through manual methods alone.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a crucial ability, especially in complex decision-making tasks. One significant task to show LLMs' reasoning capability is code time complexity prediction, which involves various intricate factors such as the input range of variables and conditional loops. Current benchmarks fall short of providing a rigorous assessment due to limited data, language constraints, and insufficient labeling. They do not consider time complexity based on input representation and merely evaluate whether predictions fall into the same class, lacking a measure of how close incorrect predictions are to the correct ones. To address these dependencies, we introduce CodeComplex, the first robust and extensive dataset designed to evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities in predicting code time complexity. CodeComplex comprises 4,900 Java codes and an equivalent number of Python codes, overcoming language and labeling constraints, carefully annotated with complexity labels based on input characteristics by a panel of algorithmic experts. Additionally, we propose specialized evaluation metrics for the reasoning of complexity prediction tasks, offering a more precise and reliable assessment of LLMs' reasoning capabilities. We release our dataset (https://github.com/sybaik1/CodeComplex-Data) and baseline models (https://github.com/sybaik1/CodeComplex-Models) publicly to encourage the relevant (NLP, SE, and PL) communities to utilize and participate in this research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Code vulnerability detection (CVD) is essential for addressing and preventing system security issues, playing a crucial role in ensuring software security. Previous learning-based vulnerability detection methods rely on either fine-tuning medium-size sequence models or training smaller neural networks from scratch. Recent advancements in large pre-trained language models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities in various code intelligence tasks including code understanding and generation. However, the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting code vulnerabilities is largely under-explored. This work aims to investigate the gap by fine-tuning LLMs for the CVD task, involving four widely-used open-source LLMs. We also implement other five previous graph-based or medium-size sequence models for comparison. Experiments are conducted on five commonly-used CVD datasets, including both the part of short samples and long samples. In addition, we conduct quantitative experiments to investigate the class imbalance issue and the model's performance on samples of different lengths, which are rarely studied in previous works. To better facilitate communities, we open-source all codes and resources of this study in https://github.com/SakiRinn/LLM4CVD and https://huggingface.co/datasets/xuefen/VulResource.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Wearable Augmented Reality (AR) technologies are gaining recognition for their potential to transform surgical navigation systems. As these technologies evolve, selecting the right interaction method to control the system becomes crucial. Our work introduces a voice-controlled user interface (VCUI) for surgical AR assistance systems (ARAS), designed for pancreatic surgery, that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs). Employing a mixed-method research approach, we assessed the usability of our LLM-based design in both simulated surgical tasks and during pancreatic surgeries, comparing its performance against conventional VCUI for surgical ARAS using speech commands. Our findings demonstrated the usability of our proposed LLM-based VCUI, yielding a significantly lower task completion time and cognitive workload compared to speech commands. Additionally, qualitative insights from interviews with surgeons aligned with the quantitative data, revealing a strong preference for the LLM-based VCUI. Surgeons emphasized its intuitiveness and highlighted the potential of LLM-based VCUI in expediting decision-making in surgical environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Singing voice synthesis (SVS) system is expected to generate high-fidelity singing voice from given music scores (lyrics, duration and pitch). Recently, diffusion models have performed well in this field. However, sacrificing inference speed to exchange with high-quality sample generation limits its application scenarios. In order to obtain high quality synthetic singing voice more efficiently, we propose a singing voice synthesis method based on the consistency model, ConSinger, to achieve high-fidelity singing voice synthesis with minimal steps. The model is trained by applying consistency constraint and the generation quality is greatly improved at the expense of a small amount of inference speed. Our experiments show that ConSinger is highly competitive with the baseline model in terms of generation speed and quality. Audio samples are available at https://keylxiao.github.io/consinger.

Traditional methods for investigating the urban thermal environment and corresponding human thermal comfort level are often resource intensive, inefficient, and limited in scope. To address these challenges, we (1) introduce a new concept named thermal affordance, which formalizes the integrated inherent capacity of a streetscape to influence human thermal comfort based on its visual and physical features; and (2) an efficient method to evaluate it (visual assessment of thermal affordance -- VATA), which combines street view imagery (SVI), online and in-field surveys, and statistical learning algorithms. VATA extracts five categories of image features from SVI data and establishes 19 visual-perceptual indicators for streetscape visual assessment. Using a multi-task neural network and elastic net regression, we model their chained relationship to predict and comprehend thermal affordance for Singapore. VATA predictions are validated with field-investigated OTC data, providing a cost-effective, scalable, and transferable method to assess the thermal comfort potential of urban streetscape. Moreover, we demonstrate its utility by generating a geospatially explicit mapping of thermal affordance, outlining a model update workflow for long-term urban-scale analysis, and implementing a two-stage prediction and inference approach (IF-VPI-VATA) to guide future streetscape improvements. This framework can inform streetscape design to support sustainable, liveable, and resilient urban environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as state-of-the-art methods to learn from graph-structured data for recommendation. However, most existing GNN-based recommendation methods focus on the optimization of model structures and learning strategies based on pre-defined graphs, neglecting the importance of the graph construction stage. Earlier works for graph construction usually rely on speciffic rules or crowdsourcing, which are either too simplistic or too labor-intensive. Recent works start to utilize large language models (LLMs) to automate the graph construction, in view of their abundant open-world knowledge and remarkable reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, they generally suffer from two limitations: (1) invisibility of global view (e.g., overlooking contextual information) and (2) construction inefficiency. To this end, we introduce AutoGraph, an automatic graph construction framework based on LLMs for recommendation. Specifically, we first use LLMs to infer the user preference and item knowledge, which is encoded as semantic vectors. Next, we employ vector quantization to extract the latent factors from the semantic vectors. The latent factors are then incorporated as extra nodes to link the user/item nodes, resulting in a graph with in-depth global-view semantics. We further design metapath-based message aggregation to effectively aggregate the semantic and collaborative information. The framework is model-agnostic and compatible with different backbone models. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy and efffciency of AutoGraph compared to existing baseline methods. We have deployed AutoGraph in Huawei advertising platform, and gain a 2.69% improvement on RPM and a 7.31% improvement on eCPM in the online A/B test. Currently AutoGraph has been used as the main trafffc model, serving hundreds of millions of people.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) require post-training methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on instruction-response pairs to enable instruction following. However, this process can potentially harm existing capabilities learned during pre-training. In this paper, we investigate the loss of context awareness after SFT, where context awareness is defined as the ability to extract and understand information from user-provided context and respond accordingly. We are the first to identify and show that the loss of context awareness, as reflected by the performance drop in the Needle-in-a-Haystack test, occurs in instruction fine-tuned LLMs when the chat template is applied to input prompts. We identify that the performance decline is partially caused by an attention bias toward different roles learned during conversational instruction fine-tuning. We validate our hypothesis by visualizing changes in attention allocation after the chat template is applied and manually steering the attention heads. Based on these observations, we propose a metric to select context-dependent examples from general instruction fine-tuning datasets. We then apply conditional instruction fine-tuning with a context-dependency indicator, enabling the model to learn context awareness from these selected examples. Empirical experiments on four context-dependent downstream tasks and three pre-trained LLMs of different sizes show that our method effectively mitigates the loss of context awareness without compromising general instruction-following capabilities. Given our findings, we strongly advocate for careful benchmarking of context awareness after instruction fine-tuning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Temporal point process as the stochastic process on continuous domain of time is commonly used to model the asynchronous event sequence featuring with occurrence timestamps. Thanks to the strong expressivity of deep neural networks, they are emerging as a promising choice for capturing the patterns in asynchronous sequences, in the context of temporal point process. In this paper, we first review recent research emphasis and difficulties in modeling asynchronous event sequences with deep temporal point process, which can be concluded into four fields: encoding of history sequence, formulation of conditional intensity function, relational discovery of events and learning approaches for optimization. We introduce most of recently proposed models by dismantling them into the four parts, and conduct experiments by remodularizing the first three parts with the same learning strategy for a fair empirical evaluation. Besides, we extend the history encoders and conditional intensity function family, and propose a Granger causality discovery framework for exploiting the relations among multi-types of events. Because the Granger causality can be represented by the Granger causality graph, discrete graph structure learning in the framework of Variational Inference is employed to reveal latent structures of the graph. Further experiments show that the proposed framework with latent graph discovery can both capture the relations and achieve an improved fitting and predicting performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Long Context Language Models (LCLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm to perform Information Retrieval (IR), which enables the direct ingestion and retrieval of information by processing an entire corpus in their single context, showcasing the potential to surpass traditional sparse and dense retrieval methods. However, processing a large number of passages within in-context for retrieval is computationally expensive, and handling their representations during inference further exacerbates the processing time; thus, we aim to make LCLM retrieval more efficient and potentially more effective with passage compression. Specifically, we propose a new compression approach tailored for LCLM retrieval, which is trained to maximize the retrieval performance while minimizing the length of the compressed passages. To accomplish this, we generate the synthetic data, where compressed passages are automatically created and labeled as chosen or rejected according to their retrieval success for a given query, and we train the proposed Compression model for Long context Retrieval (CoLoR) with this data via preference optimization while adding the length regularization loss on top of it to enforce brevity. Through extensive experiments on 9 datasets, we show that CoLoR improves the retrieval performance by 6% while compressing the in-context size by a factor of 1.91.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rapid growth of blockchain technology, smart contracts are now crucial to Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications. Effective vulnerability detection is vital for securing these contracts against hackers and enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of security audits. In this paper, we present SimilarGPT, a unique vulnerability identification tool for smart contract, which combines Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) models with Code-based similarity checking methods. The main concept of the SimilarGPT tool is to measure the similarity between the code under inspection and the secure code from third-party libraries. To identify potential vulnerabilities, we connect the semantic understanding capability of large language models (LLMs) with Code-based similarity checking techniques. We propose optimizing the detection sequence using topological ordering to enhance logical coherence and reduce false positives during detection. Through analysis of code reuse patterns in smart contracts, we compile and process extensive third-party library code to establish a comprehensive reference codebase. Then, we utilize LLM to conduct an indepth analysis of similar codes to identify and explain potential vulnerabilities in the codes. The experimental findings indicate that SimilarGPT excels in detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts, particularly in missed detections and minimizing false positives.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially for topology perturbations, and many methods that improve the robustness of GNNs have received considerable attention. Recently, we have witnessed the significant success of large language models (LLMs), leading many to explore the great potential of LLMs on GNNs. However, they mainly focus on improving the performance of GNNs by utilizing LLMs to enhance the node features. Therefore, we ask: Will the robustness of GNNs also be enhanced with the powerful understanding and inference capabilities of LLMs? By presenting the empirical results, we find that despite that LLMs can improve the robustness of GNNs, there is still an average decrease of 23.1% in accuracy, implying that the GNNs remain extremely vulnerable against topology attacks. Therefore, another question is how to extend the capabilities of LLMs on graph adversarial robustness. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based robust graph structure inference framework, LLM4RGNN, which distills the inference capabilities of GPT-4 into a local LLM for identifying malicious edges and an LM-based edge predictor for finding missing important edges, so as to recover a robust graph structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLM4RGNN consistently improves the robustness across various GNNs. Even in some cases where the perturbation ratio increases to 40%, the accuracy of GNNs is still better than that on the clean graph.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose Adapter Merging with Centroid Prototype Mapping (ACMap), an exemplar-free framework for class-incremental learning (CIL) that addresses both catastrophic forgetting and scalability. While existing methods trade-off between inference time and accuracy, ACMap consolidates task-specific adapters into a single adapter, ensuring constant inference time across tasks without compromising accuracy. The framework employs adapter merging to build a shared subspace that aligns task representations and mitigates forgetting, while centroid prototype mapping maintains high accuracy through consistent adaptation in the shared subspace. To further improve scalability, an early stopping strategy limits adapter merging as tasks increase. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that ACMap matches state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining inference time comparable to the fastest existing methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Inferencing Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) from gene expression data is a pivotal challenge in systems biology, and several innovative computational methods have been introduced. However, most of these studies have not considered the skewed degree distribution of genes. Specifically, some genes may regulate multiple target genes while some genes may be regulated by multiple regulator genes. Such a skewed degree distribution issue significantly complicates the application of directed graph embedding methods. To tackle this issue, we propose the Cross-Attention Complex Dual Graph Embedding Model (XATGRN). Our XATGRN employs a cross-attention mechanism to effectively capture intricate gene interactions from gene expression profiles. Additionally, it uses a Dual Complex Graph Embedding approach to manage the skewed degree distribution, thereby ensuring precise prediction of regulatory relationships and their directionality. Our model consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across various datasets, underscoring its efficacy in elucidating complex gene regulatory mechanisms. Our codes used in this paper are publicly available at: https://github.com/kikixiong/XATGRN.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Explainable fake news detection predicts the authenticity of news items with annotated explanations. Today, Large Language Models (LLMs) are known for their powerful natural language understanding and explanation generation abilities. However, presenting LLMs for explainable fake news detection remains two main challenges. Firstly, fake news appears reasonable and could easily mislead LLMs, leaving them unable to understand the complex news-faking process. Secondly, utilizing LLMs for this task would generate both correct and incorrect explanations, which necessitates abundant labor in the loop. In this paper, we propose LLM-GAN, a novel framework that utilizes prompting mechanisms to enable an LLM to become Generator and Detector and for realistic fake news generation and detection. Our results demonstrate LLM-GAN's effectiveness in both prediction performance and explanation quality. We further showcase the integration of LLM-GAN to a cloud-native AI platform to provide better fake news detection service in the cloud.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) framework has gained widespread adoption due to its strong performance. However, the further development of CTDE faces two key challenges. First, agents struggle to autonomously assess the relevance of input information for cooperative tasks, impairing their decision-making abilities. Second, in communication-limited scenarios with partial observability, agents are unable to access global information, restricting their ability to collaborate effectively from a global perspective. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel cooperative MARL framework based on information selection and tacit learning. In this framework, agents gradually develop implicit coordination during training, enabling them to infer the cooperative behavior of others in a discrete space without communication, relying solely on local information. Moreover, we integrate gating and selection mechanisms, allowing agents to adaptively filter information based on environmental changes, thereby enhancing their decision-making capabilities. Experiments on popular MARL benchmarks show that our framework can be seamlessly integrated with state-of-the-art algorithms, leading to significant performance improvements.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is based on the quality of the prompts and the semantic and structural integrity information of the input data. However, current prompt generation methods primarily focus on generating prompts for clean input data, often overlooking the impact of perturbed inputs on prompt performance. To address this limitation, we propose BATprompt (By Adversarial Training prompt), a novel method for prompt generation designed to withstand input perturbations (such as typos in the input). Inspired by adversarial training techniques, BATprompt demonstrates strong performance on a variety of perturbed tasks through a two-step process: adversarial perturbation and iterative optimization on unperturbed input via LLM. Unlike conventional adversarial attack methods, BATprompt avoids reliance on real gradients or model parameters. Instead, it leverages the advanced reasoning, language understanding and self reflection capabilities of LLMs to simulate gradients, guiding the generation of adversarial perturbations and optimizing prompt performance. In our experiments, we evaluate BATprompt on multiple datasets across both language understanding and generation tasks. The results indicate that BATprompt outperforms existing prompt generation methods, delivering superior robustness and performance under diverse perturbation scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> General-purposed embodied agents are designed to understand the users' natural instructions or intentions and act precisely to complete universal tasks. Recently, methods based on foundation models especially Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have shown a substantial potential to solve language-conditioned manipulation (LCM) tasks well. However, existing benchmarks do not adequately meet the needs of VLAs and relative algorithms. To better define such general-purpose tasks in the context of LLMs and advance the research in VLAs, we present VLABench, an open-source benchmark for evaluating universal LCM task learning. VLABench provides 100 carefully designed categories of tasks, with strong randomization in each category of task and a total of 2000+ objects. VLABench stands out from previous benchmarks in four key aspects: 1) tasks requiring world knowledge and common sense transfer, 2) natural language instructions with implicit human intentions rather than templates, 3) long-horizon tasks demanding multi-step reasoning, and 4) evaluation of both action policies and language model capabilities. The benchmark assesses multiple competencies including understanding of mesh\&texture, spatial relationship, semantic instruction, physical laws, knowledge transfer and reasoning, etc. To support the downstream finetuning, we provide high-quality training data collected via an automated framework incorporating heuristic skills and prior information. The experimental results indicate that both the current state-of-the-art pretrained VLAs and the workflow based on VLMs face challenges in our tasks.

However, existing alignment paradigms struggle to guide such advanced AI systems. Superalignment, the alignment of AI systems with human values and safety requirements at superhuman levels of capability aims to addresses two primary goals -- scalability in supervision to provide high-quality guidance signals and robust governance to ensure alignment with human values. In this survey, we examine scalable oversight methods and potential solutions for superalignment. Specifically, we explore the concept of ASI, the challenges it poses, and the limitations of current alignment paradigms in addressing the superalignment problem. Then we review scalable oversight methods for superalignment. Finally, we discuss the key challenges and propose pathways for the safe and continual improvement of ASI systems. By comprehensively reviewing the current literature, our goal is provide a systematical introduction of existing methods, analyze their strengths and limitations, and discuss potential future directions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text-to-image generative models excel in creating images from text but struggle with ensuring alignment and consistency between outputs and prompts. This paper introduces TextMatch, a novel framework that leverages multimodal optimization to address image-text discrepancies in text-to-image (T2I) generation and editing. TextMatch employs a scoring strategy powered by large language models (LLMs) and visual question-answering (VQA) models to evaluate semantic consistency between prompts and generated images. By integrating multimodal in-context learning and chain of thought reasoning, our method dynamically refines prompts through iterative optimization. This process ensures that the generated images better capture user intent of, resulting in higher fidelity and relevance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TextMatch significantly improves text-image consistency across multiple benchmarks, establishing a reliable framework for advancing the capabilities of text-to-image generative models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sequential recommendation (SR) systems have evolved significantly over the past decade, transitioning from traditional collaborative filtering to deep learning approaches and, more recently, to large language models (LLMs). While the adoption of LLMs has driven substantial advancements, these models inherently lack collaborative filtering information, relying primarily on textual content data neglecting other modalities and thus failing to achieve optimal recommendation performance. To address this limitation, we propose Molar, a Multimodal large language sequential recommendation framework that integrates multiple content modalities with ID information to capture collaborative signals effectively. Molar employs an MLLM to generate unified item representations from both textual and non-textual data, facilitating comprehensive multimodal modeling and enriching item embeddings. Additionally, it incorporates collaborative filtering signals through a post-alignment mechanism, which aligns user representations from content-based and ID-based models, ensuring precise personalization and robust performance. By seamlessly combining multimodal content with collaborative filtering insights, Molar captures both user interests and contextual semantics, leading to superior recommendation accuracy. Extensive experiments validate that Molar significantly outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines, highlighting its strength in utilizing multimodal data and collaborative signals for sequential recommendation tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we introduce the Diff-Instruct* (DI*), an image data-free approach for building one-step text-to-image generative models that align with human preference while maintaining the ability to generate highly realistic images. We frame human preference alignment as online reinforcement learning using human feedback (RLHF), where the goal is to maximize the reward function while regularizing the generator distribution to remain close to a reference diffusion process. Unlike traditional RLHF approaches, which rely on the KL divergence for regularization, we introduce a novel score-based divergence regularization, which leads to significantly better performances. Although the direct calculation of this preference alignment objective remains intractable, we demonstrate that we can efficiently compute its gradient by deriving an equivalent yet tractable loss function. Remarkably, we used Diff-Instruct* to train a Stable Diffusion-XL-based 1-step model, the 2.6B DI*-SDXL-1step text-to-image model, which can generate images of a resolution of 1024x1024 with only 1 generation step. DI*-SDXL-1step model uses only 1.88% inference time and 29.30% GPU memory cost to outperform 12B FLUX-dev-50step significantly in PickScore, ImageReward, and CLIPScore on Parti prompt benchmark and HPSv2.1 on Human Preference Score benchmark, establishing a new state-of-the-art benchmark of human-preferred 1-step text-to-image generative models. Besides the strong quantitative performances, extensive qualitative comparisons also confirm the advantages of DI* in terms of maintaining diversity, improving image layouts, and enhancing aesthetic colors. We have released our industry-ready model on the homepage: \url{https://github.com/pkulwj1994/diff_instruct_star}.

To tackle these issues, we introduce \textsc{InvestorBench}, the first benchmark specifically designed for evaluating LLM-based agents in diverse financial decision-making contexts. InvestorBench enhances the versatility of LLM-enabled agents by providing a comprehensive suite of tasks applicable to different financial products, including single equities like stocks, cryptocurrencies and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Additionally, we assess the reasoning and decision-making capabilities of our agent framework using thirteen different LLMs as backbone models, across various market environments and tasks. Furthermore, we have curated a diverse collection of open-source, multi-modal datasets and developed a comprehensive suite of environments for financial decision-making. This establishes a highly accessible platform for evaluating financial agents' performance across various scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the standard data analysis framework, data is collected (once and for all), and then data analysis is carried out. However, with the advancement of digital technology, decision-makers constantly analyze past data and generate new data through their decisions. We model this as a Markov decision process and show that the dynamic interaction between data generation and data analysis leads to a new type of bias -- reinforcement bias -- that exacerbates the endogeneity problem in standard data analysis. We propose a class of instrument variable (IV)-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to correct for the bias and establish their theoretical properties by incorporating them into a stochastic approximation (SA) framework. Our analysis accommodates iterate-dependent Markovian structures and, therefore, can be used to study RL algorithms with policy improvement. We also provide formulas for inference on optimal policies of the IV-RL algorithms. These formulas highlight how intertemporal dependencies of the Markovian environment affect the inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into services such as ChatGPT to provide responses to user queries. To mitigate potential harm and prevent misuse, there have been concerted efforts to align the LLMs with human values and legal compliance by incorporating various techniques, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), into the training of the LLMs. However, recent research has exposed that even aligned LLMs are susceptible to adversarial manipulations known as Jailbreak Attacks. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a method called Token Highlighter to inspect and mitigate the potential jailbreak threats in the user query. Token Highlighter introduced a concept called Affirmation Loss to measure the LLM's willingness to answer the user query. It then uses the gradient of Affirmation Loss for each token in the user query to locate the jailbreak-critical tokens. Further, Token Highlighter exploits our proposed Soft Removal technique to mitigate the jailbreak effects of critical tokens via shrinking their token embeddings. Experimental results on two aligned LLMs (LLaMA-2 and Vicuna-V1.5) demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively defend against a variety of Jailbreak Attacks while maintaining competent performance on benign questions of the AlpacaEval benchmark. In addition, Token Highlighter is a cost-effective and interpretable defense because it only needs to query the protected LLM once to compute the Affirmation Loss and can highlight the critical tokens upon refusal.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The stateful nature of large language model (LLM) servingcan easily throttle precious GPU memory under load burstor long-generation requests like chain-of-thought reasoning,causing latency spikes due to queuing incoming requests. However, state-of-the-art KVCache centric approaches handleload spikes by dropping, migrating, or swapping KVCache,which faces an essential tradeoff between the performance ofongoing vs. incoming requests and thus still severely violatesSLO.This paper makes a key observation such that model param-eters are independent of the requests and are replicated acrossGPUs, and thus proposes a parameter-centric approach byselectively dropping replicated parameters to leave preciousmemory for requests. However, LLM requires KVCache tobe saved in bound with model parameters and thus droppingparameters can cause either huge computation waste or longnetwork delay, affecting all ongoing requests. Based on the ob-servation that attention operators can be decoupled from otheroperators, this paper further proposes a novel remote attentionmechanism through pipeline parallelism so as to serve up-coming requests with the additional memory borrowed fromparameters on remote GPUs. This paper further addresses sev-eral other challenges including lively exchanging KVCachewith incomplete parameters, generating an appropriate planthat balances memory requirements with cooperative exe-cution overhead, and seamlessly restoring parameters whenthe throttling has gone. Evaluations show thatKUNSERVEreduces the tail TTFT of requests under throttling by up to 27.3x compared to the state-of-the-art.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A potential difference of 1.3 Giga-Volts (GV) was inferred across a thundercloud using data from the GRAPES-3 muon telescope (G3MT). This was the first-ever estimation of gigavolt potential in thunderstorms, confirming prediction of C.T.R. Wilson almost a century ago. To infer the thundercloud potential required acceleration of muons in atmospheric electric field to be incorporated in the Monte Carlo simulation software CORSIKA. The G3MT records over 4 billion muons daily that are grouped into 169 directions covering 2.3 sr sky. This enabled changes as small as 0.1% in the muon flux on minute timescale, caused by thunderstorms to be accurately measured. But that requires high statistics simulation of muon fluxes in thunderstorm electric fields. The CORSIKA offers a choice of several generators for low- (FLUKA, GHEISHA, and UrQMD) and high-energy (SIBYLL, EPOS-LHC, and QGSJETII) hadronic interactions. Since it is unclear which combination of the low- and high-energy generators provides the correct description of hadronic interactions, all nine combinations of generators were explored, and they yielded thundercloud potentials ranging from 1.3 GV to 1.6 GV for the event recorded on 1 December 2014. The result of SIBYLL-FLUKA combination yielded the lowest electric potential of 1.3 GV was reported. Furthermore, another seven major thunderstorm events recorded between April 2011 and December 2020 were analyzed to measure the dependence of their thundercloud potential on the hadronic interaction generators. It is observed that the low-energy generators produce larger variation ($\sim$14%) in thundercloud potential than the high-energy generators ($\sim$8%). This probably reflects the fact that the GeV muons are predominantly produced in low-energy ($<$80 GeV) interactions, which effectively magnifies the differences in the meson production cross-sections among the low-energy generators.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Autonomous driving in high-speed racing, as opposed to urban environments, presents significant challenges in scene understanding due to rapid changes in the track environment. Traditional sequential network approaches may struggle to meet the real-time knowledge and decision-making demands of an autonomous agent covering large displacements in a short time. This paper proposes a novel baseline architecture for developing sophisticated models capable of true hardware-enabled parallelism, achieving neural processing speeds that mirror the agent's high velocity. The proposed model (Parallel Perception Network (PPN)) consists of two independent neural networks, segmentation and reconstruction networks, running parallelly on separate accelerated hardware. The model takes raw 3D point cloud data from the LiDAR sensor as input and converts it into a 2D Bird's Eye View Map on both devices. Each network independently extracts its input features along space and time dimensions and produces outputs parallelly. The proposed method's model is trained on a system with two NVIDIA T4 GPUs, using a combination of loss functions, including edge preservation, and demonstrates a 2x speedup in model inference time compared to a sequential configuration. Implementation is available at: https://github.com/suwesh/Parallel-Perception-Network.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision transformers have emerged as a promising alternative to convolutional neural networks for various image analysis tasks, offering comparable or superior performance. However, one significant drawback of ViTs is their resource-intensive nature, leading to increased memory footprint, computation complexity, and power consumption. To democratize this high-performance technology and make it more environmentally friendly, it is essential to compress ViT models, reducing their resource requirements while maintaining high performance. In this paper, we introduce a new block-structured pruning to address the resource-intensive issue for ViTs, offering a balanced trade-off between accuracy and hardware acceleration. Unlike unstructured pruning or channel-wise structured pruning, block pruning leverages the block-wise structure of linear layers, resulting in more efficient matrix multiplications. To optimize this pruning scheme, our paper proposes a novel hardware-aware learning objective that simultaneously maximizes speedup and minimizes power consumption during inference, tailored to the block sparsity structure. This objective eliminates the need for empirical look-up tables and focuses solely on reducing parametrized layer connections. Moreover, our paper provides a lightweight algorithm to achieve post-training pruning for ViTs, utilizing second-order Taylor approximation and empirical optimization to solve the proposed hardware-aware objective. Extensive experiments on ImageNet are conducted across various ViT architectures, including DeiT-B and DeiT-S, demonstrating competitive performance with other pruning methods and achieving a remarkable balance between accuracy preservation and power savings. Especially, we achieve up to 3.93x and 1.79x speedups on dedicated hardware and GPUs respectively for DeiT-B, and also observe an inference power reduction by 1.4x on real-world GPUs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at generating highly detailed captions but often produce hallucinations. Our analysis reveals that existing hallucination detection methods struggle with detailed captions. We attribute this to the increasing reliance of MLLMs on their generated text, rather than the input image, as the sequence length grows. To address this issue, we propose a multiagent approach that leverages LLM-MLLM collaboration to correct given captions. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation framework and a benchmark dataset to facilitate the systematic analysis of detailed captions. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed evaluation method better aligns with human judgments of factuality than existing metrics and that existing approaches to improve the MLLM factuality may fall short in hyper-detailed image captioning tasks. In contrast, our proposed method significantly enhances the factual accuracy of captions, even improving those generated by GPT-4V. Finally, we highlight a limitation of VQA-centric benchmarking by demonstrating that an MLLM's performance on VQA benchmarks may not correlate with its ability to generate detailed image captions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid growth of social media platforms has raised significant concerns regarding online content toxicity. When Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for toxicity detection, two key challenges emerge: 1) the absence of domain-specific toxic knowledge leads to false negatives; 2) the excessive sensitivity of LLMs to toxic speech results in false positives, limiting freedom of speech. To address these issues, we propose a novel method called MetaTox, leveraging graph search on a meta-toxic knowledge graph to enhance hatred and toxicity detection. First, we construct a comprehensive meta-toxic knowledge graph by utilizing LLMs to extract toxic information through a three-step pipeline, with toxic benchmark datasets serving as corpora. Second, we query the graph via retrieval and ranking processes to supplement accurate, relevant toxic knowledge. Extensive experiments and in-depth case studies across multiple datasets demonstrate that our MetaTox significantly decreases the false positive rate while boosting overall toxicity detection performance. Our code will be available soon.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scientific user facilities, such as synchrotron beamlines, are equipped with a wide array of hardware and software tools that require a codebase for human-computer-interaction. This often necessitates developers to be involved to establish connection between users/researchers and the complex instrumentation. The advent of generative AI presents an opportunity to bridge this knowledge gap, enabling seamless communication and efficient experimental workflows. Here we present a modular architecture for the Virtual Scientific Companion (VISION) by assembling multiple AI-enabled cognitive blocks that each scaffolds large language models (LLMs) for a specialized task. With VISION, we performed LLM-based operation on the beamline workstation with low latency and demonstrated the first voice-controlled experiment at an X-ray scattering beamline. The modular and scalable architecture allows for easy adaptation to new instrument and capabilities. Development on natural language-based scientific experimentation is a building block for an impending future where a science exocortex -- a synthetic extension to the cognition of scientists -- may radically transform scientific practice and discovery.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advancements, primarily due to their capabilities in modeling the hidden relationships within text sequences. This innovation presents a unique opportunity in the field of life sciences, where vast collections of single-cell omics data from multiple species provide a foundation for training foundational models. However, the challenge lies in the disparity of data scales across different species, hindering the development of a comprehensive model for interpreting genetic data across diverse organisms. In this study, we propose an innovative hybrid approach that integrates the general knowledge capabilities of LLMs with domain-specific representation models for single-cell omics data interpretation. We begin by focusing on genes as the fundamental unit of representation. Gene representations are initialized using functional descriptions, leveraging the strengths of mature language models such as LLaMA-2. By inputting single-cell gene-level expression data with prompts, we effectively model cellular representations based on the differential expression levels of genes across various species and cell types. In the experiments, we constructed developmental cells from humans and mice, specifically targeting cells that are challenging to annotate. We evaluated our methodology through basic tasks such as cell annotation and visualization analysis. The results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach compared to other methods using LLMs, highlighting significant improvements in accuracy and interoperability. Our hybrid approach enhances the representation of single-cell data and offers a robust framework for future research in cross-species genetic analysis.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Pre-trained vision-language models~(VLMs) are the de-facto foundation models for various downstream tasks. However, scene text recognition methods still prefer backbones pre-trained on a single modality, namely, the visual modality, despite the potential of VLMs to serve as powerful scene text readers. For example, CLIP can robustly identify regular (horizontal) and irregular (rotated, curved, blurred, or occluded) text in images. With such merits, we transform CLIP into a scene text reader and introduce CLIP4STR, a simple yet effective STR method built upon image and text encoders of CLIP. It has two encoder-decoder branches: a visual branch and a cross-modal branch. The visual branch provides an initial prediction based on the visual feature, and the cross-modal branch refines this prediction by addressing the discrepancy between the visual feature and text semantics. To fully leverage the capabilities of both branches, we design a dual predict-and-refine decoding scheme for inference. We scale CLIP4STR in terms of the model size, pre-training data, and training data, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 13 STR benchmarks. Additionally, a comprehensive empirical study is provided to enhance the understanding of the adaptation of CLIP to STR. Our method establishes a simple yet strong baseline for future STR research with VLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Emerging topics in biomedical research are continuously expanding, providing a wealth of information about genes and their function. This rapid proliferation of knowledge presents unprecedented opportunities for scientific discovery and formidable challenges for researchers striving to keep abreast of the latest advancements. One significant challenge is navigating the vast corpus of literature to extract vital gene-related information, a time-consuming and cumbersome task. To enhance the efficiency of this process, it is crucial to address several key challenges: (1) the overwhelming volume of literature, (2) the complexity of gene functions, and (3) the automated integration and generation. In response, we propose GeneSUM, a two-stage automated gene summary extractor utilizing a large language model (LLM). Our approach retrieves and eliminates redundancy of target gene literature and then fine-tunes the LLM to refine and streamline the summarization process. We conducted extensive experiments to validate the efficacy of our proposed framework. The results demonstrate that LLM significantly enhances the integration of gene-specific information, allowing more efficient decision-making in ongoing research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Learning-based probabilistic models can be combined with an entropy coder for data compression. However, due to the high complexity of learning-based models, their practical application as text compressors has been largely overlooked. To address this issue, our work focuses on a low-complexity design while maintaining compression performance. We introduce a novel Learned Lossless Low-complexity Text Compression method (L3TC). Specifically, we conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that RWKV models achieve the fastest decoding speed with a moderate compression ratio, making it the most suitable backbone for our method. Second, we propose an outlier-aware tokenizer that uses a limited vocabulary to cover frequent tokens while allowing outliers to bypass the prediction and encoding. Third, we propose a novel high-rank reparameterization strategy that enhances the learning capability during training without increasing complexity during inference. Experimental results validate that our method achieves 48% bit saving compared to gzip compressor. Besides, L3TC offers compression performance comparable to other learned compressors, with a 50x reduction in model parameters. More importantly, L3TC is the fastest among all learned compressors, providing real-time decoding speeds up to megabytes per second. Our code is available at https://github.com/alipay/L3TC-leveraging-rwkv-for-learned-lossless-low-complexity-text-compression.git.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely used to generate responses on social topics due to their world knowledge and generative capabilities. Beyond reasoning and generation performance, political bias is an essential issue that warrants attention. Political bias, as a universal phenomenon in human society, may be transferred to LLMs and distort LLMs' behaviors of information acquisition and dissemination with humans, leading to unequal access among different groups of people. To prevent LLMs from reproducing and reinforcing political biases, and to encourage fairer LLM-human interactions, comprehensively examining political bias in popular LLMs becomes urgent and crucial.   In this study, we systematically measure the political biases in a wide range of LLMs, using a curated set of questions addressing political bias in various contexts. Our findings reveal distinct patterns in how LLMs respond to political topics. For highly polarized topics, most LLMs exhibit a pronounced left-leaning bias. Conversely, less polarized topics elicit greater consensus, with similar response patterns across different LLMs. Additionally, we analyze how LLM characteristics, including release date, model scale, and region of origin affect political bias. The results indicate political biases evolve with model scale and release date, and are also influenced by regional factors of LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We consider the generative modeling of speech over multiple minutes, a requirement for long-form multimedia generation and audio-native voice assistants. However, current spoken language models struggle to generate plausible speech past tens of seconds, from high temporal resolution of speech tokens causing loss of coherence, to architectural issues with long-sequence training or extrapolation, to memory costs at inference time. With these considerations we propose SpeechSSM, the first speech language model to learn from and sample long-form spoken audio (e.g., 16 minutes of read or extemporaneous speech) in a single decoding session without text intermediates, based on recent advances in linear-time sequence modeling. Furthermore, to address growing challenges in spoken language evaluation, especially in this new long-form setting, we propose: new embedding-based and LLM-judged metrics; quality measurements over length and time; and a new benchmark for long-form speech processing and generation, LibriSpeech-Long. Speech samples and the dataset are released at https://google.github.io/tacotron/publications/speechssm/

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the rapidly evolving landscape of GameFi, a fusion of gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi), there exists a critical need to enhance player engagement and economic interaction within gaming ecosystems. Our GameFi ecosystem aims to fundamentally transform this landscape by integrating advanced embodied AI agents into GameFi platforms. These AI agents, developed using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude AI, are capable of proactive, adaptive, and contextually rich interactions with players. By going beyond traditional scripted responses, these agents become integral participants in the game's narrative and economic systems, directly influencing player strategies and in-game economies. We address the limitations of current GameFi platforms, which often lack immersive AI interactions and mechanisms for community engagement or creator monetization. Through the deep integration of AI agents with blockchain technology, we establish a consensus-driven, decentralized GameFi ecosystem. This ecosystem empowers creators to monetize their contributions and fosters democratic collaboration among players and creators. Furthermore, by embedding DeFi mechanisms into the gaming experience, we enhance economic participation and provide new opportunities for financial interactions within the game. Our approach enhances player immersion and retention and advances the GameFi ecosystem by bridging traditional gaming with Web3 technologies. By integrating sophisticated AI and DeFi elements, we contribute to the development of more engaging, economically robust, and community-centric gaming environments. This project represents a significant advancement in the state-of-the-art in GameFi, offering insights and methodologies that can be applied throughout the gaming industry.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are compact representations of all public knowledge of our physical environment and animal and human behaviors. The application of LLMs to robotics may offer a path to highly capable robots that perform well across most human tasks with limited or even zero tuning. Aside from increasingly sophisticated reasoning and task planning, networks of (suitably designed) LLMs offer ease of upgrading capabilities and allow humans to directly observe the robot's thinking. Here we explore the advantages, limitations, and particularities of using LLMs to control physical robots. The basic system consists of four LLMs communicating via a human language data bus implemented via web sockets and ROS2 message passing. Surprisingly, rich robot behaviors and good performance across different tasks could be achieved despite the robot's data fusion cycle running at only 1Hz and the central data bus running at the extremely limited rates of the human brain, of around 40 bits/s. The use of natural language for inter-LLM communication allowed the robot's reasoning and decision making to be directly observed by humans and made it trivial to bias the system's behavior with sets of rules written in plain English. These rules were immutably written into Ethereum, a global, public, and censorship resistant Turing-complete computer. We suggest that by using natural language as the data bus among interacting AIs, and immutable public ledgers to store behavior constraints, it is possible to build robots that combine unexpectedly rich performance, upgradability, and durable alignment with humans.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Tokenization is a necessary component within the current architecture of many language models, including the transformer-based large language models (LLMs) of Generative AI, yet its impact on the model's cognition is often overlooked. We argue that LLMs demonstrate that the Distributional Hypothesis (DH) is sufficient for reasonably human-like language performance, and that the emergence of human-meaningful linguistic units among tokens motivates linguistically-informed interventions in existing, linguistically-agnostic tokenization techniques, particularly with respect to their roles as (1) semantic primitives and as (2) vehicles for conveying salient distributional patterns from human language to the model. We explore tokenizations from a BPE tokenizer; extant model vocabularies obtained from Hugging Face and tiktoken; and the information in exemplar token vectors as they move through the layers of a RoBERTa (large) model. Besides creating sub-optimal semantic building blocks and obscuring the model's access to the necessary distributional patterns, we describe how tokenization pretraining can be a backdoor for bias and other unwanted content, which current alignment practices may not remediate. Additionally, we relay evidence that the tokenization algorithm's objective function impacts the LLM's cognition, despite being meaningfully insulated from the main system intelligence.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, an increasing number of AI-driven programming assistants powered by code LLMs have been integrated into various real-world software development environments, significantly boosting developer productivity. However, existing code generation benchmarks primarily focus on general-purpose scenarios, leaving the code generation performance of LLMs for specific application domains largely unknown. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark, MultiCodeBench, to fill this gap. MultiCodeBench comprises 2,400 programming tasks, covering 12 popular software development domains and 15 programming languages. Specifically, we perform in-depth research to identify these 12 application domains. Given that each domain may involve multiple technical frameworks, and that different frameworks present distinct challenges in the coding process, we categorize the commonly used frameworks and platforms within each domain. We then sample programming problems from GitHub repositories related to these subdomains. To ensure the quality of the tasks and mitigate data leakage issues, we invite annotators to rewrite the docstrings for each task in MultiCodeBench. Additionally, we build a static analysis-based dependency parsing tool to extract the dependencies in the ground truth for each task, enabling deeper performance analysis. Through extensive experiments on MultiCodeBench with eleven representative mainstream LLMs, we reveal the code generation performance of the LLMs across different application domains, providing practical insights for developers in downstream fields when selecting LLMs. Furthermore, we analyze the reasons behind the models' failures in completing software application development tasks, offering guidance for model developers to enhance domain-specific code generation capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Malware authors often employ code obfuscations to make their malware harder to detect. Existing tools for generating obfuscated code often require access to the original source code (e.g., C++ or Java), and adding new obfuscations is a non-trivial, labor-intensive process. In this study, we ask the following question: Can Large Language Models (LLMs) potentially generate a new obfuscated assembly code? If so, this poses a risk to anti-virus engines and potentially increases the flexibility of attackers to create new obfuscation patterns. We answer this in the affirmative by developing the MetamorphASM benchmark comprising MetamorphASM Dataset (MAD) along with three code obfuscation techniques: dead code, register substitution, and control flow change. The MetamorphASM systematically evaluates the ability of LLMs to generate and analyze obfuscated code using MAD, which contains 328,200 obfuscated assembly code samples. We release this dataset and analyze the success rate of various LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5/4, GPT-4o-mini, Starcoder, CodeGemma, CodeLlama, CodeT5, and LLaMA 3.1) in generating obfuscated assembly code. The evaluation was performed using established information-theoretic metrics and manual human review to ensure correctness and provide the foundation for researchers to study and develop remediations to this risk.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite recent advancements in speech processing, zero-resource speech translation (ST) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) remain challenging problems. In this work, we propose to leverage a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) to perform ST and ASR in languages for which the model has never seen paired audio-text data. We achieve this by using a pre-trained multilingual speech encoder, a multilingual LLM, and a lightweight adaptation module that maps the audio representations to the token embedding space of the LLM. We perform several experiments both in ST and ASR to understand how to best train the model and what data has the most impact on performance in previously unseen languages. In ST, our best model is capable to achieve BLEU scores over 23 in CoVoST2 for two previously unseen languages, while in ASR, we achieve WERs of up to 28.2\%. We finally show that the performance of our system is bounded by the ability of the LLM to output text in the desired language.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Fine-grained sentiment analysis (FSA) aims to extract and summarize user opinions from vast opinionated text. Recent studies demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) possess exceptional sentiment understanding capabilities. However, directly deploying LLMs for FSA applications incurs high inference costs. Therefore, this paper investigates the distillation of fine-grained sentiment understanding from LLMs into small language models (SLMs). We prompt LLMs to examine and interpret the sentiments of given reviews and then utilize the generated content to pretrain SLMs. Additionally, we develop a comprehensive FSA benchmark to evaluate both SLMs and LLMs. Extensive experiments on this benchmark reveal that: (1) distillation significantly enhances the performance of SLMs in FSA tasks, achieving a 6.00\% improvement in $F_1$-score, and the distilled model can outperform Llama-2-7b with only 220M parameters; (2) distillation equips SLMs with excellent zero-shot sentiment classification capabilities, enabling them to match or even exceed their teacher models. These results suggest that distillation from LLMs is a highly promising direction for FSA. We will release our code, data, and pretrained model weights at \url{https://github.com/HITSZ-HLT/FSA-Distillation}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To address this gap, we introduce Libra-Leaderboard, a comprehensive framework designed to rank LLMs through a balanced evaluation of performance and safety. Combining a dynamic leaderboard with an interactive LLM arena, Libra-Leaderboard encourages the joint optimization of capability and safety. Unlike traditional approaches that average performance and safety metrics, Libra-Leaderboard uses a distance-to-optimal-score method to calculate the overall rankings. This approach incentivizes models to achieve a balance rather than excelling in one dimension at the expense of some other ones. In the first release, Libra-Leaderboard evaluates 26 mainstream LLMs from 14 leading organizations, identifying critical safety challenges even in state-of-the-art models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reasoning is critical for large language models (LLMs) to excel in a wide range of tasks. While methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhance LLM performance by decomposing problems into intermediate steps, they also incur significant overhead in token usage, leading to increased costs. We find that the reasoning process of current LLMs is unnecessarily lengthy and it can be compressed by including a reasonable token budget in the prompt, but the choice of token budget plays a crucial role in the actual compression effectiveness. We then propose a token-budget-aware LLM reasoning framework, which dynamically estimates token budgets for different problems based on reasoning complexity and uses the estimated token budgets to guide the reasoning process. Experiments show that our method effectively reduces token costs in CoT reasoning with only a slight performance reduction, offering a practical solution to balance efficiency and accuracy in LLM reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Forecasting is a task that is difficult to evaluate: the ground truth can only be known in the future. Recent work showing LLM forecasters rapidly approaching human-level performance begs the question: how can we benchmark and evaluate these forecasters instantaneously? Following the consistency check framework, we measure the performance of forecasters in terms of the consistency of their predictions on different logically-related questions. We propose a new, general consistency metric based on arbitrage: for example, if a forecasting AI illogically predicts that both the Democratic and Republican parties have 60% probability of winning the 2024 US presidential election, an arbitrageur can trade against the forecaster's predictions and make a profit. We build an automated evaluation system that generates a set of base questions, instantiates consistency checks from these questions, elicits the predictions of the forecaster, and measures the consistency of the predictions. We then build a standard, proper-scoring-rule forecasting benchmark, and show that our (instantaneous) consistency metrics correlate with LLM forecasters' ground truth Brier scores (which are only known in the future). We also release a consistency benchmark that resolves in 2028, providing a long-term evaluation tool for forecasting.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), a sequence labeling task, has attracted increasing attention in multilingual contexts. While previous research has focused largely on fine-tuning or training models specifically for ABSA, we evaluate large language models (LLMs) under zero-shot conditions to explore their potential to tackle this challenge with minimal task-specific adaptation. We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of a series of LLMs on multilingual ABSA tasks, investigating various prompting strategies, including vanilla zero-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), self-improvement, self-debate, and self-consistency, across nine different models. Results indicate that while LLMs show promise in handling multilingual ABSA, they generally fall short of fine-tuned, task-specific models. Notably, simpler zero-shot prompts often outperform more complex strategies, especially in high-resource languages like English. These findings underscore the need for further refinement of LLM-based approaches to effectively address ABSA task across diverse languages.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet struggle with hallucination and outdated knowledge when tasked with complex knowledge reasoning, resulting in factually incorrect outputs. Previous studies have attempted to mitigate it by retrieving factual knowledge from large-scale knowledge graphs (KGs) to assist LLMs in logical reasoning and prediction of answers. However, this kind of approach often introduces noise and irrelevant data, especially in situations with extensive context from multiple knowledge aspects. In this way, LLM attention can be potentially mislead from question and relevant information. In our study, we introduce an Adaptive Multi-Aspect Retrieval-augmented over KGs (Amar) framework. This method retrieves knowledge including entities, relations, and subgraphs, and converts each piece of retrieved text into prompt embeddings. The Amar framework comprises two key sub-components: 1) a self-alignment module that aligns commonalities among entities, relations, and subgraphs to enhance retrieved text, thereby reducing noise interference; 2) a relevance gating module that employs a soft gate to learn the relevance score between question and multi-aspect retrieved data, to determine which information should be used to enhance LLMs' output, or even filtered altogether. Our method has achieved state-of-the-art performance on two common datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, showing a 1.9\% improvement in accuracy over its best competitor and a 6.6\% improvement in logical form generation over a method that directly uses retrieved text as context prompts. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Amar in improving the reasoning of LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Known as low energy consumption networks, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained a lot of attention within the past decades. While SNNs are increasing competitive with artificial neural networks (ANNs) for vision tasks, they are rarely used for long sequence tasks, despite their intrinsic temporal dynamics. In this work, we develop spiking state space models (SpikingSSMs) for long sequence learning by leveraging on the sequence learning abilities of state space models (SSMs). Inspired by dendritic neuron structure, we hierarchically integrate neuronal dynamics with the original SSM block, meanwhile realizing sparse synaptic computation. Furthermore, to solve the conflict of event-driven neuronal dynamics with parallel computing, we propose a light-weight surrogate dynamic network which accurately predicts the after-reset membrane potential and compatible to learnable thresholds, enabling orders of acceleration in training speed compared with conventional iterative methods. On the long range arena benchmark task, SpikingSSM achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art SSMs meanwhile realizing on average 90\% of network sparsity. On language modeling, our network significantly surpasses existing spiking large language models (spikingLLMs) on the WikiText-103 dataset with only a third of the model size, demonstrating its potential as backbone architecture for low computation cost LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Code review is a widespread practice to improve software quality and transfer knowledge. It is often seen as time-consuming due to the need for manual effort and potential delays. Several AI-assisted tools, such as Qodo, GitHub Copilot, and Coderabbit, provide automated reviews using large language models (LLMs). The effects of such tools in the industry are yet to be examined.   This study examines the impact of LLM-based automated code review tools in an industrial setting. The study was conducted within a software development environment that adopted an AI-assisted review tool (based on open-source Qodo PR Agent). Around 238 practitioners across ten projects had access to the tool. We focused on three projects with 4,335 pull requests, 1,568 of which underwent automated reviews. Data collection comprised three sources: (1) a quantitative analysis of pull request data, including comment labels indicating whether developers acted on the automated comments, (2) surveys sent to developers regarding their experience with reviews on individual pull requests, and (3) a broader survey of 22 practitioners capturing their general opinions on automated reviews.   73.8% of automated comments were resolved. However, the average pull request closure duration increased from five hours 52 minutes to eight hours 20 minutes, with varying trends across projects. Most practitioners reported a minor improvement in code quality due to automated reviews.   The LLM-based tool proved useful in software development, enhancing bug detection, increasing awareness of code quality, and promoting best practices. However, it also led to longer pull request closure times and introduced drawbacks like faulty reviews, unnecessary corrections, and irrelevant comments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Effective pre-training of large language models (LLMs) has been challenging due to the immense resource demands and the complexity of the technical processes involved. This paper presents a detailed technical report on YuLan-Mini, a highly capable base model with 2.42B parameters that achieves top-tier performance among models of similar parameter scale. Our pre-training approach focuses on enhancing training efficacy through three key technical contributions: an elaborate data pipeline combines data cleaning with data schedule strategies, a robust optimization method to mitigate training instability, and an effective annealing approach that incorporates targeted data selection and long context training. Remarkably, YuLan-Mini, trained on 1.08T tokens, achieves performance comparable to industry-leading models that require significantly more data. To facilitate reproduction, we release the full details of the data composition for each training phase. Project details can be accessed at the following link: https://github.com/RUC-GSAI/YuLan-Mini.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) shows promising potential for autonomous driving decision-making. However, DRL demands extensive computational resources to achieve a qualified policy in complex driving scenarios due to its low learning efficiency. Moreover, leveraging expert guidance from human to enhance DRL performance incurs prohibitively high labor costs, which limits its practical application. In this study, we propose a novel large language model (LLM) guided deep reinforcement learning (LGDRL) framework for addressing the decision-making problem of autonomous vehicles. Within this framework, an LLM-based driving expert is integrated into the DRL to provide intelligent guidance for the learning process of DRL. Subsequently, in order to efficiently utilize the guidance of the LLM expert to enhance the performance of DRL decision-making policies, the learning and interaction process of DRL is enhanced through an innovative expert policy constrained algorithm and a novel LLM-intervened interaction mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves superior driving performance with a 90\% task success rate but also significantly improves the learning efficiency and expert guidance utilization efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baseline algorithms. Moreover, the proposed method enables the DRL agent to maintain consistent and reliable performance in the absence of LLM expert guidance.

Our investigation serves as a case study leveraging specially designed datasets and experimental-scale LLMs to lay the groundwork for understanding these behaviors. Specifically, we aim to first enable LLMs to exhibit both memorization and generalization by training with the designed dataset, then (a) examine whether LLMs exhibit neuron-level spatial differentiation for memorization and generalization, (b) predict these behaviors using model internal representations, and (c) steer the behaviors through inference-time interventions. Our findings reveal that neuron-wise differentiation of memorization and generalization is observable in LLMs, and targeted interventions can successfully direct their behavior.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced natural language processing (NLP) applications. Nevertheless, these models often inherit biases from their training data. Despite the availability of various datasets for bias detection, most are limited to one or two NLP tasks (typically classification or evaluation) and lack comprehensive evaluations across a broader range of NLP tasks. To address this gap, we introduce the Bias Evaluations Across Domains BEADs dataset, designed to support a wide array of NLP tasks, including text classification, token classification, bias quantification, and benign language generation. A key focus of this paper is the gold label dataset that is annotated by GPT4 for scalabilty and verified by experts to ensure high reliability. BEADs provides data for both fine-tuning, including classification and language generation tasks, and for evaluating LLMs. Our findings indicate that BEADs effectively identifies numerous biases when fine-tuned on this dataset. It also reduces biases when used for fine-tuning language generation task, while preserving language quality. The results also reveal some prevalent demographic biases in LLMs when BEADs is used for evaluation in demographic task. We provide the BEADs dataset for detecting biases in various domains, and this dataset is readily usable for responsible AI development and application. The dataset can be accessed at https://huggingface.co/datasets/shainar/BEAD .

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced code completion capabilities, giving rise to a new generation of LLM-based Code Completion Tools (LCCTs). Unlike general-purpose LLMs, these tools possess unique workflows, integrating multiple information sources as input and prioritizing code suggestions over natural language interaction, which introduces distinct security challenges. Additionally, LCCTs often rely on proprietary code datasets for training, raising concerns about the potential exposure of sensitive data. This paper exploits these distinct characteristics of LCCTs to develop targeted attack methodologies on two critical security risks: jailbreaking and training data extraction attacks. Our experimental results expose significant vulnerabilities within LCCTs, including a 99.4% success rate in jailbreaking attacks on GitHub Copilot and a 46.3% success rate on Amazon Q. Furthermore, We successfully extracted sensitive user data from GitHub Copilot, including 54 real email addresses and 314 physical addresses associated with GitHub usernames. Our study also demonstrates that these code-based attack methods are effective against general-purpose LLMs, such as the GPT series, highlighting a broader security misalignment in the handling of code by modern LLMs. These findings underscore critical security challenges associated with LCCTs and suggest essential directions for strengthening their security frameworks. The example code and attack samples from our research are provided at https://github.com/Sensente/Security-Attacks-on-LCCTs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Significant advances have been made in developing general-purpose embodied AI in environments like Minecraft through the adoption of LLM-augmented hierarchical approaches. While these approaches, which combine high-level planners with low-level controllers, show promise, low-level controllers frequently become performance bottlenecks due to repeated failures. In this paper, we argue that the primary cause of failure in many low-level controllers is the absence of an episodic memory system. To address this, we introduce MrSteve (Memory Recall Steve-1), a novel low-level controller equipped with Place Event Memory (PEM), a form of episodic memory that captures what, where, and when information from episodes. This directly addresses the main limitation of the popular low-level controller, Steve-1. Unlike previous models that rely on short-term memory, PEM organizes spatial and event-based data, enabling efficient recall and navigation in long-horizon tasks. Additionally, we propose an Exploration Strategy and a Memory-Augmented Task Solving Framework, allowing agents to alternate between exploration and task-solving based on recalled events. Our approach significantly improves task-solving and exploration efficiency compared to existing methods. We will release our code and demos on the project page: https://sites.google.com/view/mr-steve.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As the development of large language models (LLMs) rapidly advances, securing these models effectively without compromising their utility has become a pivotal area of research. However, current defense strategies against jailbreak attacks (i.e., efforts to bypass security protocols) often suffer from limited adaptability, restricted general capability, and high cost. To address these challenges, we introduce SafeAligner, a methodology implemented at the decoding stage to fortify defenses against jailbreak attacks. We begin by developing two specialized models: the Sentinel Model, which is trained to foster safety, and the Intruder Model, designed to generate riskier responses. SafeAligner leverages the disparity in security levels between the responses from these models to differentiate between harmful and beneficial tokens, effectively guiding the safety alignment by altering the output token distribution of the target model. Extensive experiments show that SafeAligner can increase the likelihood of beneficial tokens, while reducing the occurrence of harmful ones, thereby ensuring secure alignment with minimal loss to generality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A 3D scene graph represents a compact scene model, storing information about the objects and the semantic relationships between them, making its use promising for robotic tasks. When interacting with a user, an embodied intelligent agent should be capable of responding to various queries about the scene formulated in natural language. Large Language Models (LLMs) are beneficial solutions for user-robot interaction due to their natural language understanding and reasoning abilities. Recent methods for creating learnable representations of 3D scenes have demonstrated the potential to improve the quality of LLMs responses by adapting to the 3D world. However, the existing methods do not explicitly utilize information about the semantic relationships between objects, limiting themselves to information about their coordinates. In this work, we propose a method 3DGraphLLM for constructing a learnable representation of a 3D scene graph. The learnable representation is used as input for LLMs to perform 3D vision-language tasks. In our experiments on popular ScanRefer, RIORefer, Multi3DRefer, ScanQA, Sqa3D, and Scan2cap datasets, we demonstrate the advantage of this approach over baseline methods that do not use information about the semantic relationships between objects. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/CognitiveAISystems/3DGraphLLM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The core of the Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) task is to predict and complete the missing relations or nodes in a KG. Common KGC tasks are mostly about inferring unknown elements with one or two elements being known in a triple. In comparison, the Triple Set Prediction (TSP) task is a more realistic knowledge graph completion task. It aims to predict all elements of unknown triples based on the information from known triples. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited significant advancements in language comprehension, demonstrating considerable potential for KGC tasks. However, the potential of LLM on the TSP task has not yet to be investigated. Thus in this paper we proposed a new framework to explore the strengths and limitations of LLM in the TSP task. Specifically, the framework consists of LLM-based rule mining and LLM-based triple set prediction. The relation list of KG embedded within rich semantic information is first leveraged to prompt LLM in the generation of rules. This process is both efficient and independent of statistical information, making it easier to mine effective and realistic rules. For each subgraph, the specified rule is applied in conjunction with the relevant triples within that subgraph to guide the LLM in predicting the missing triples. Subsequently, the predictions from all subgraphs are consolidated to derive the complete set of predicted triples on KG. Finally, the method is evaluated on the relatively complete CFamily dataset. The experimental results indicate that when LLMs are required to adhere to a large amount of factual knowledge to predict missing triples, significant hallucinations occurs, leading to a noticeable decline in performance. To further explore the causes of this phenomenon, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis supported by a detailed case study.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Our society increasingly benefits from Artificial Intelligence (AI). Unfortunately, more and more evidence shows that AI is also used for offensive purposes. Prior works have revealed various examples of use cases in which the deployment of AI can lead to violation of security and privacy objectives. No extant work, however, has been able to draw a holistic picture of the offensive potential of AI. In this SoK paper we seek to lay the ground for a systematic analysis of the heterogeneous capabilities of offensive AI. In particular we (i) account for AI risks to both humans and systems while (ii) consolidating and distilling knowledge from academic literature, expert opinions, industrial venues, as well as laymen -- all of which being valuable sources of information on offensive AI.   To enable alignment of such diverse sources of knowledge, we devise a common set of criteria reflecting essential technological factors related to offensive AI. With the help of such criteria, we systematically analyze: 95 research papers; 38 InfoSec briefings (from, e.g., BlackHat); the responses of a user study (N=549) entailing individuals with diverse backgrounds and expertise; and the opinion of 12 experts. Our contributions not only reveal concerning ways (some of which overlooked by prior work) in which AI can be offensively used today, but also represent a foothold to address this threat in the years to come.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> International enterprises, organizations, or hospitals collect large amounts of multi-modal data stored in databases, text documents, images, and videos. While there has been recent progress in the separate fields of multi-modal data exploration as well as in database systems that automatically translate natural language questions to database query languages, the research challenge of querying database systems combined with other unstructured modalities such as images in natural language is widely unexplored.   In this paper, we propose XMODE - a system that enables explainable, multi-modal data exploration in natural language. Our approach is based on the following research contributions: (1) Our system is inspired by a real-world use case that enables users to explore multi-modal information systems. (2) XMODE leverages a LLM-based agentic AI framework to decompose a natural language question into subtasks such as text-to-SQL generation and image analysis. (3) Experimental results on multi-modal datasets over relational data and images demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art multi-modal exploration systems, excelling not only in accuracy but also in various performance metrics such as query latency, API costs, planning efficiency, and explanation quality, thanks to the more effective utilization of the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Nowadays, AI researchers become more and more interested in fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM, whose size has grown to up to over 100B parameters, for their downstream tasks. One approach to fine-tune such huge models is to aggregate device memory from many GPUs. However, this approach introduces prohibitive costs for most data scientists with a limited budget for high-end GPU servers. In this paper, we focus on LLM fine-tuning on a single consumer-grade GPU in a commodity server with limited main memory capacity, which is accessible to most AI researchers. In such a scenario, existing offloading-based methods fail to fine-tune an LLM efficiently due to a lack of holistic intra-server tensor movement management. To this end, we present LoHan, a low-cost, high-performance deep learning training framework that enables efficient 100B-scale model fine-tuning on a commodity server with a consumer-grade GPU and limited main memory capacity. The key idea is to add holistic offloading traffic as an optimization dimension for 1)active gradient offloading, and 2)holistic traffic-aware activation swapping mechanism. The experimental results show that 1)LoHan is the first to fine-tune a 175B model on an RTX 4090 and 256 GB main memory, 2)LoHan achieves 2.32x throughput than the state-of-the-art baselines when fine-tuning a small 13B model, and 3)LoHan enables a cheap low-end consumer GPU to have higher cost-effectiveness than a DGX-A100 cluster when fine-tuning a 175B model.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Spear-phishing attacks present a significant security challenge, with large language models (LLMs) escalating the threat by generating convincing emails and facilitating target reconnaissance. To address this, we propose a detection approach based on a novel document vectorization method that utilizes an ensemble of LLMs to create representation vectors. By prompting LLMs to reason and respond to human-crafted questions, we quantify the presence of common persuasion principles in the email's content, producing prompted contextual document vectors for a downstream supervised machine learning model. We evaluate our method using a unique dataset generated by a proprietary system that automates target reconnaissance and spear-phishing email creation. Our method achieves a 91\% F1 score in identifying LLM-generated spear-phishing emails, with the training set comprising only traditional phishing and benign emails. Key contributions include a novel document vectorization method utilizing LLM reasoning, a publicly available dataset of high-quality spear-phishing emails, and the demonstrated effectiveness of our method in detecting such emails. This methodology can be utilized for various document classification tasks, particularly in adversarial problem domains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As social changes accelerate, the incidence of psychosomatic disorders has significantly increased, becoming a major challenge in global health issues. This necessitates an innovative knowledge system and analytical methods to aid in diagnosis and treatment. Here, we establish the ontology model and entity types, using the BERT model and LoRA-tuned LLM for named entity recognition, constructing the knowledge graph with 9668 triples. Next, by analyzing the network distances between disease, symptom, and drug modules, it was found that closer network distances among diseases can predict greater similarities in their clinical manifestations, treatment approaches, and psychological mechanisms, and closer distances between symptoms indicate that they are more likely to co-occur. Lastly, by comparing the proximity d and proximity z score, it was shown that symptom-disease pairs in primary diagnostic relationships have a stronger association and are of higher referential value than those in diagnostic relationships. The research results revealed the potential connections between diseases, co-occurring symptoms, and similarities in treatment strategies, providing new perspectives for the diagnosis and treatment of psychosomatic disorders and valuable information for future mental health research and practice.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current conversational recommendation systems focus predominantly on text. However, real-world recommendation settings are generally multimodal, causing a significant gap between existing research and practical applications. To address this issue, we propose Muse, the first multimodal conversational recommendation dataset. Muse comprises 83,148 utterances from 7,000 conversations centered around the Clothing domain. Each conversation contains comprehensive multimodal interactions, rich elements, and natural dialogues. Data in Muse are automatically synthesized by a multi-agent framework powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). It innovatively derives user profiles from real-world scenarios rather than depending on manual design and history data for better scalability, and then it fulfills conversation simulation and optimization. Both human and LLM evaluations demonstrate the high quality of conversations in Muse. Additionally, fine-tuning experiments on three MLLMs demonstrate Muse's learnable patterns for recommendations and responses, confirming its value for multimodal conversational recommendation. Our dataset and codes are available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Muse-0086}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in linguistic tasks but struggle with mathematical reasoning, particularly in non English languages like Hindi. This research aims to enhance the mathematical reasoning skills of smaller, resource efficient open-source LLMs in both Hindi and English. We evaluate models like OpenHathi 7B, LLaMA-2 7B, WizardMath 7B, Mistral 7B, LLeMMa 7B, MAmmoTH 7B, Gemini Pro, and GPT-4 using zero-shot, few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) methods, and supervised fine-tuning. Our approach incorporates curriculum learning, progressively training models on increasingly difficult problems, a novel Decomposition Strategy to simplify complex arithmetic operations, and a Structured Solution Design that divides solutions into phases. Our experiments result in notable performance enhancements. WizardMath 7B exceeds Gemini's accuracy on English datasets by +6% and matches Gemini's performance on Hindi datasets. Adopting a bilingual approach that combines English and Hindi samples achieves results comparable to individual language models, demonstrating the capability to learn mathematical reasoning in both languages. This research highlights the potential for improving mathematical reasoning in open-source LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) use the key-value (KV) cache to significantly accelerate inference by storing the key and value embeddings of past tokens. However, this cache consumes significant GPU memory. In this work, we introduce HashEvict, an algorithm that uses locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to compress the KV cache. HashEvict quickly locates tokens in the cache that are cosine dissimilar to the current query token. This is achieved by computing the Hamming distance between binarized Gaussian projections of the current token query and cached token keys, with a projection length much smaller than the embedding dimension. We maintain a lightweight binary structure in GPU memory to facilitate these calculations. Unlike existing compression strategies that compute attention to determine token retention, HashEvict makes these decisions pre-attention, thereby reducing computational costs. Additionally, HashEvict is dynamic - at every decoding step, the key and value of the current token replace the embeddings of a token expected to produce the lowest attention score. We demonstrate that HashEvict can compress the KV cache by 30%-70% while maintaining high performance across reasoning, multiple-choice, long-context retrieval and summarization tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, with frameworks like Chatbot Arena providing pioneering platforms for evaluating these models. By facilitating millions of pairwise comparisons based on human judgments, Chatbot Arena has become a cornerstone in LLM evaluation, offering rich datasets for ranking models in open-ended conversational tasks. Building upon this foundation, we propose a statistical framework that incorporates key advancements to address specific challenges in pairwise comparison analysis. First, we introduce a factored tie model that enhances the ability to handle ties -- an integral aspect of human-judged comparisons -- significantly improving the model's fit to observed data. Second, we extend the framework to model covariance between competitors, enabling deeper insights into performance relationships and facilitating intuitive groupings into performance tiers. Third, we resolve optimization challenges arising from parameter non-uniqueness by introducing novel constraints, ensuring stable and interpretable parameter estimation. Through rigorous evaluation and extensive experimentation, our framework demonstrates substantial improvements over existing methods in modeling pairwise comparison data. To support reproducibility and practical adoption, we release leaderbot, an open-source Python package implementing our models and analyses.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have emerged as the de facto approach for high-fidelity image synthesis, operating diffusion processes on continuous VAE latent, which significantly differ from the text generation methods employed by Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce a novel generative framework, the Recurrent Diffusion Probabilistic Model (RDPM), which enhances the diffusion process through a recurrent token prediction mechanism, thereby pioneering the field of Discrete Diffusion. By progressively introducing Gaussian noise into the latent representations of images and encoding them into vector-quantized tokens in a recurrent manner, RDPM facilitates a unique diffusion process on discrete-value domains. This process iteratively predicts the token codes for subsequent timesteps, transforming the initial standard Gaussian noise into the source data distribution, aligning with GPT-style models in terms of the loss function. RDPM demonstrates superior performance while benefiting from the speed advantage of requiring only a few inference steps. This model not only leverages the diffusion process to ensure high-quality generation but also converts continuous signals into a series of high-fidelity discrete tokens, thereby maintaining a unified optimization strategy with other discrete tokens, such as text. We anticipate that this work will contribute to the development of a unified model for multimodal generation, specifically by integrating continuous signal domains such as images, videos, and audio with text. We will release the code and model weights to the open-source community.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> AI agents are systems capable of perceiving their environment, autonomously planning and executing tasks. Recent advancements in LLM have introduced a transformative paradigm for AI agents, enabling them to interact with external resources and tools through prompts. In such agents, the workflow integrates developer-written code, which manages framework construction and logic control, with LLM-generated natural language that enhances dynamic decision-making and interaction. However, discrepancies between developer-implemented logic and the dynamically generated content of LLMs in terms of behavior and expected outcomes can lead to defects, such as tool invocation failures and task execution errors. These issues introduce specific risks, leading to various defects in LLM-based AI Agents, such as service interruptions. Despite the importance of these issues, there is a lack of systematic work that focuses on analyzing LLM-based AI Agents to uncover defects in their code. In this paper, we present the first study focused on identifying and detecting defects in LLM Agents. We collected and analyzed 6,854 relevant posts from StackOverflow to define 8 types of agent defects. For each type, we provided detailed descriptions with an example. Then, we designed a static analysis tool, named Agentable, to detect the defects. Agentable leverages Code Property Graphs and LLMs to analyze Agent workflows by efficiently identifying specific code patterns and analyzing natural language descriptions. To evaluate Agentable, we constructed two datasets: AgentSet, consists of 84 real-world Agents, and AgentTest, which contains 78 Agents specifically designed to include various types of defects. Our results show that Agentable achieved an overall accuracy of 88.79% and a recall rate of 91.03%. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the 889 defects of the AgentSet, highlighting the prevalence of these defects.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The field of machine translation has achieved significant advancements, yet domain-specific terminology translation, particularly in AI, remains challenging. We introduced GIST, a large-scale multilingual AI terminology dataset containing 5K terms extracted from top AI conference papers spanning 2000 to 2023. The terms were translated into Arabic, Chinese, French, Japanese, and Russian using a hybrid framework that combines LLMs for extraction with human expertise for translation. The dataset's quality was benchmarked against existing resources, demonstrating superior translation accuracy through crowdsourced evaluation. GIST was integrated into translation workflows using post-translation refinement methods that required no retraining, where LLM prompting consistently improved BLEU and COMET scores. A web demonstration on the ACL Anthology platform highlights its practical application, showcasing improved accessibility for non-English speakers. This work aims to address critical gaps in AI terminology resources and fosters global inclusivity and collaboration in AI research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) become increasingly prevalent, there is growing concern regarding their impact on public safety and privacy, highlighting the need for advanced tracking and trajectory estimation solutions. In response, this paper introduces a novel framework that utilizes audio array for 3D UAV trajectory estimation. Our approach incorporates a self-supervised learning model, starting with the conversion of audio data into mel-spectrograms, which are analyzed through an encoder to extract crucial temporal and spectral information. Simultaneously, UAV trajectories are estimated using LiDAR point clouds via unsupervised methods. These LiDAR-based estimations act as pseudo labels, enabling the training of an Audio Perception Network without requiring labeled data. In this architecture, the LiDAR-based system operates as the Teacher Network, guiding the Audio Perception Network, which serves as the Student Network. Once trained, the model can independently predict 3D trajectories using only audio signals, with no need for LiDAR data or external ground truth during deployment. To further enhance precision, we apply Gaussian Process modeling for improved spatiotemporal tracking. Our method delivers top-tier performance on the MMAUD dataset, establishing a new benchmark in trajectory estimation using self-supervised learning techniques without reliance on ground truth annotations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Solving complex mathematical problems via system-2 reasoning is a natural human skill, yet it remains a significant challenge for current large language models (LLMs). We identify the scarcity of deliberate multi-step reasoning data as a primary limiting factor. To this end, we introduce Enriched Instruction Tuning (EIT), a method that enriches existing human-annotated mathematical datasets by synergizing human and AI feedback to create fine-grained reasoning trajectories. These datasets are then used to fine-tune open-source LLMs, enhancing their mathematical reasoning abilities without reliance on any symbolic verification program. Concretely, EIT is composed of two critical steps: Enriching with Reasoning Plan (ERP) and Enriching with Reasoning Step (ERS). The former generates a high-level plan that breaks down complex instructions into a sequence of simpler objectives, while ERS fills in reasoning contexts often overlooked by human annotators, creating a smoother reasoning trajectory for LLM fine-tuning. Unlike existing CoT prompting methods that generate reasoning chains only depending on LLM's internal knowledge, our method leverages human-annotated initial answers as ``meta-knowledge'' to help LLMs generate more detailed and precise reasoning processes, leading to a more trustworthy LLM expert for complex mathematical problems. In experiments, EIT achieves an accuracy of 84.1% on GSM8K and 32.5% on MATH, surpassing state-of-the-art fine-tuning and prompting methods, and even matching the performance of tool-augmented methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA). However existing methods still have challenges: the inability to use external tools autonomously, and the inability to work in teams. Humans tend to know whether they need to use external tools when they encounter a new question, e.g., they tend to be able to give a direct answer to a familiar question, whereas they tend to use tools such as search engines when they encounter an unfamiliar question. In addition, humans also tend to collaborate and discuss with others to get better answers. Inspired by this, we propose the multi-agent voting framework. We design three LLM-based agents that simulate different levels of staff in a team, and assign the available tools according to the levels. Each agent provides the corresponding answer, and finally all the answers provided by the agents are voted to get the final answer. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA show that our approach outperforms other baselines by 2.2 and 1.0, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper provides the first incentive analysis of open radio access networks (ORAN) using game theory. We assess strategic interactions between telecom supply chain stakeholders: mobile network operators (MNOs), network infrastructure suppliers (NIS), and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) across three procurement scenarios: (i) Traditional, (ii) Predatory as monolithic radio access networks (MRAN), and (iii) DirectOEM as ORAN. We use random forest and gradient boosting models to evaluate the optimal margins across urban, suburban, and rural U.S. regions. Results suggest that ORAN deployment consistently demonstrates higher net present value (NPV) of profits in urban and suburban regions, outperforming the traditional procurement strategy by 11% to 31%. However, rural areas present lower NPVs across all scenarios, with significant variability at the county level. This analysis offers actionable insights for telecom investment strategies, bridging technical innovation with economic outcomes and addressing strategic supply chain dynamics through a game-theoretic lens.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Stochastic Nonlinear Optimal Control (SNOC) involves minimizing a cost function that averages out the random uncertainties affecting the dynamics of nonlinear systems. For tractability reasons, this problem is typically addressed by minimizing an empirical cost, which represents the average cost across a finite dataset of sampled disturbances. However, this approach raises the challenge of quantifying the control performance against out-of-sample uncertainties. Particularly, in scenarios where the training dataset is small, SNOC policies are prone to overfitting, resulting in significant discrepancies between the empirical cost and the true cost, i.e., the average SNOC cost incurred during control deployment. Therefore, establishing generalization bounds on the true cost is crucial for ensuring reliability in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that leverages PAC-Bayes theory to provide rigorous generalization bounds for SNOC. Based on these bounds, we propose a new method for designing optimal controllers, offering a principled way to incorporate prior knowledge into the synthesis process, which aids in improving the control policy and mitigating overfitting. Furthermore, by leveraging recent parametrizations of stabilizing controllers for nonlinear systems, our framework inherently ensures closed-loop stability. The effectiveness of our proposed method in incorporating prior knowledge and combating overfitting is shown by designing neural network controllers for tasks in cooperative robotics.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Conversational question answering (ConvQA) is a convenient means of searching over RDF knowledge graphs (KGs), where a prevalent approach is to translate natural language questions to SPARQL queries. However, SPARQL has certain shortcomings: (i) it is brittle for complex intents and conversational questions, and (ii) it is not suitable for more abstract needs. Instead, we propose a novel two-pronged system where we fuse: (i) SQL-query results over a database automatically derived from the KG, and (ii) text-search results over verbalizations of KG facts. Our pipeline supports iterative retrieval: when the results of any branch are found to be unsatisfactory, the system can automatically opt for further rounds. We put everything together in a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) setup, where an LLM generates a coherent response from accumulated search results. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed system over several baselines on a knowledge graph of BMW automobiles.

We introduce XRAG, an open-source, modular codebase that facilitates exhaustive evaluation of the performance of foundational components of advanced RAG modules.

We systematically analyse them across reconfigured datasets, providing a comprehensive benchmark for their effectiveness. As the complexity of RAG systems continues to escalate, we underscore the critical need to identify potential failure points in RAG systems. We formulate a suite of experimental methodologies and diagnostic testing protocols to dissect the failure points inherent in RAG engineering. Subsequently, we proffer bespoke solutions aimed at bolstering the overall performance of these modules. Our work thoroughly evaluates the performance of advanced core components in RAG systems, providing insights into optimizations for prevalent failure points.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their power comes with significant security considerations. While extensive research has been conducted on the safety of LLMs in chat mode, the security implications of their function calling feature have been largely overlooked. This paper uncovers a critical vulnerability in the function calling process of LLMs, introducing a novel "jailbreak function" attack method that exploits alignment discrepancies, user coercion, and the absence of rigorous safety filters. Our empirical study, conducted on six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-pro, reveals an alarming average success rate of over 90\% for this attack. We provide a comprehensive analysis of why function calls are susceptible to such attacks and propose defensive strategies, including the use of defensive prompts. Our findings highlight the urgent need for enhanced security measures in the function calling capabilities of LLMs, contributing to the field of AI safety by identifying a previously unexplored risk, designing an effective attack method, and suggesting practical defensive measures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), enhancing their performance has become a research hotspot. This paper presents a novel multi-prompt ensemble decoding approach designed to bolster the generation quality of LLMs by leveraging the aggregation of outcomes from multiple prompts. Given a unique input $X$, we submit $n$ variations of prompts with $X$ to LLMs in batch mode to decode and derive probability distributions. For each token prediction, we calculate the ensemble probability by averaging the $n$ probability distributions within the batch, utilizing this aggregated probability to generate the token. This technique is dubbed Inner-Batch Ensemble. To facilitate efficient batch inference, we implement a Left-Padding strategy to maintain uniform input lengths across the n prompts. Through extensive experimentation on diverse NLP tasks, including machine translation, code generation, and text simplification, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method in enhancing LLM performance. The results show substantial improvements in BLEU scores, pass@$k$ rates, and LENS metrics over conventional methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video anomaly detection (VAD) has witnessed significant advancements through the integration of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), addressing critical challenges such as interpretability, temporal reasoning, and generalization in dynamic, open-world scenarios. This paper presents an in-depth review of cutting-edge LLM-/VLM-based methods in 2024, focusing on four key aspects: (i) enhancing interpretability through semantic insights and textual explanations, making visual anomalies more understandable; (ii) capturing intricate temporal relationships to detect and localize dynamic anomalies across video frames; (iii) enabling few-shot and zero-shot detection to minimize reliance on large, annotated datasets; and (iv) addressing open-world and class-agnostic anomalies by using semantic understanding and motion features for spatiotemporal coherence. We highlight their potential to redefine the landscape of VAD. Additionally, we explore the synergy between visual and textual modalities offered by LLMs and VLMs, highlighting their combined strengths and proposing future directions to fully exploit the potential in enhancing video anomaly detection.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The growing ubiquity of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in several real-world services triggers severe concerns about their security. A RAG system improves the generative capabilities of a Large Language Models (LLM) by a retrieval mechanism which operates on a private knowledge base, whose unintended exposure could lead to severe consequences, including breaches of private and sensitive information. This paper presents a black-box attack to force a RAG system to leak its private knowledge base which, differently from existing approaches, is adaptive and automatic. A relevance-based mechanism and an attacker-side open-source LLM favor the generation of effective queries to leak most of the (hidden) knowledge base. Extensive experimentation proves the quality of the proposed algorithm in different RAG pipelines and domains, comparing to very recent related approaches, which turn out to be either not fully black-box, not adaptive, or not based on open-source models. The findings from our study remark the urgent need for more robust privacy safeguards in the design and deployment of RAG systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for easily adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to various tasks. However, our understanding of how ICL works remains limited. We explore a simple model of ICL in a controlled setup with synthetic training data to investigate ICL of univariate linear functions. We experiment with a range of GPT-2-like transformer models trained from scratch. Our findings challenge the prevailing narrative that transformers adopt algorithmic approaches like linear regression to learn a linear function in-context. These models fail to generalize beyond their training distribution, highlighting fundamental limitations in their capacity to infer abstract task structures. Our experiments lead us to propose a mathematically precise hypothesis of what the model might be learning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Code review is a vital but demanding aspect of software development, generating significant interest in automating review comments. Traditional evaluation methods for these comments, primarily based on text similarity, face two major challenges: inconsistent reliability of human-authored comments in open-source projects and the weak correlation of text similarity with objectives like enhancing code quality and detecting defects.   This study empirically analyzes benchmark comments using a novel set of criteria informed by prior research and developer interviews. We then similarly revisit the evaluation of existing methodologies. Our evaluation framework, DeepCRCEval, integrates human evaluators and Large Language Models (LLMs) for a comprehensive reassessment of current techniques based on the criteria set. Besides, we also introduce an innovative and efficient baseline, LLM-Reviewer, leveraging the few-shot learning capabilities of LLMs for a target-oriented comparison.   Our research highlights the limitations of text similarity metrics, finding that less than 10% of benchmark comments are high quality for automation. In contrast, DeepCRCEval effectively distinguishes between high and low-quality comments, proving to be a more reliable evaluation mechanism. Incorporating LLM evaluators into DeepCRCEval significantly boosts efficiency, reducing time and cost by 88.78% and 90.32%, respectively. Furthermore, LLM-Reviewer demonstrates significant potential of focusing task real targets in comment generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The role of reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing the reasoning of large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly significant. Despite the success of RL in many scenarios, there are still many challenges in improving the reasoning of LLMs. One challenge is the sparse reward, which makes optimization difficult for RL and necessitates a large amount of data samples. Another challenge stems from the inherent instability of RL, particularly when using Actor-Critic (AC) methods to derive optimal policies, which often leads to unstable training processes. To address these issues, we introduce Direct Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO), an novel step-level offline RL algorithm. Unlike standard alignment that rely solely outcome rewards to optimize policies (such as DPO), DAPO employs a critic function to predict the reasoning accuracy at each step, thereby generating dense signals to refine the generation strategy. Additionally, the Actor and Critic components in DAPO are trained independently, avoiding the co-training instability observed in standard AC algorithms like PPO. We train DAPO on mathematical and code query datasets and then evaluate its performance on multiple benchmarks. Our results show that DAPO can effectively enhance the mathematical and code capabilities on both SFT models and RL models, demonstrating the effectiveness of DAPO.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the first edition of the Academic Essay Authenticity Challenge, organized as part of the GenAI Content Detection shared tasks collocated with COLING 2025. This challenge focuses on detecting machine-generated vs. human-authored essays for academic purposes. The task is defined as follows: "Given an essay, identify whether it is generated by a machine or authored by a human.'' The challenge involves two languages: English and Arabic. During the evaluation phase, 25 teams submitted systems for English and 21 teams for Arabic, reflecting substantial interest in the task. Finally, seven teams submitted system description papers. The majority of submissions utilized fine-tuned transformer-based models, with one team employing Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Llama 2 and Llama 3. This paper outlines the task formulation, details the dataset construction process, and explains the evaluation framework. Additionally, we present a summary of the approaches adopted by participating teams. Nearly all submitted systems outperformed the n-gram-based baseline, with the top-performing systems achieving F1 scores exceeding 0.98 for both languages, indicating significant progress in the detection of machine-generated text.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we explore the relevance of large language models (LLMs) for annotating references to Roman and Greek mythological entities in modern and contemporary French literature. We present an annotation scheme and demonstrate that recent LLMs can be directly applied to follow this scheme effectively, although not without occasionally making significant analytical errors. Additionally, we show that LLMs (and, more specifically, ChatGPT) are capable of offering interpretative insights into the use of mythological references by literary authors. However, we also find that LLMs struggle to accurately identify relevant passages in novels (when used as an information retrieval engine), often hallucinating and generating fabricated examples-an issue that raises significant ethical concerns. Nonetheless, when used carefully, LLMs remain valuable tools for performing annotations with high accuracy, especially for tasks that would be difficult to annotate comprehensively on a large scale through manual methods alone.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a crucial ability, especially in complex decision-making tasks. One significant task to show LLMs' reasoning capability is code time complexity prediction, which involves various intricate factors such as the input range of variables and conditional loops. Current benchmarks fall short of providing a rigorous assessment due to limited data, language constraints, and insufficient labeling. They do not consider time complexity based on input representation and merely evaluate whether predictions fall into the same class, lacking a measure of how close incorrect predictions are to the correct ones. To address these dependencies, we introduce CodeComplex, the first robust and extensive dataset designed to evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities in predicting code time complexity. CodeComplex comprises 4,900 Java codes and an equivalent number of Python codes, overcoming language and labeling constraints, carefully annotated with complexity labels based on input characteristics by a panel of algorithmic experts. Additionally, we propose specialized evaluation metrics for the reasoning of complexity prediction tasks, offering a more precise and reliable assessment of LLMs' reasoning capabilities. We release our dataset (https://github.com/sybaik1/CodeComplex-Data) and baseline models (https://github.com/sybaik1/CodeComplex-Models) publicly to encourage the relevant (NLP, SE, and PL) communities to utilize and participate in this research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Code vulnerability detection (CVD) is essential for addressing and preventing system security issues, playing a crucial role in ensuring software security. Previous learning-based vulnerability detection methods rely on either fine-tuning medium-size sequence models or training smaller neural networks from scratch. Recent advancements in large pre-trained language models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities in various code intelligence tasks including code understanding and generation. However, the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting code vulnerabilities is largely under-explored. This work aims to investigate the gap by fine-tuning LLMs for the CVD task, involving four widely-used open-source LLMs. We also implement other five previous graph-based or medium-size sequence models for comparison. Experiments are conducted on five commonly-used CVD datasets, including both the part of short samples and long samples. In addition, we conduct quantitative experiments to investigate the class imbalance issue and the model's performance on samples of different lengths, which are rarely studied in previous works. To better facilitate communities, we open-source all codes and resources of this study in https://github.com/SakiRinn/LLM4CVD and https://huggingface.co/datasets/xuefen/VulResource.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Wearable Augmented Reality (AR) technologies are gaining recognition for their potential to transform surgical navigation systems. As these technologies evolve, selecting the right interaction method to control the system becomes crucial. Our work introduces a voice-controlled user interface (VCUI) for surgical AR assistance systems (ARAS), designed for pancreatic surgery, that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs). Employing a mixed-method research approach, we assessed the usability of our LLM-based design in both simulated surgical tasks and during pancreatic surgeries, comparing its performance against conventional VCUI for surgical ARAS using speech commands. Our findings demonstrated the usability of our proposed LLM-based VCUI, yielding a significantly lower task completion time and cognitive workload compared to speech commands. Additionally, qualitative insights from interviews with surgeons aligned with the quantitative data, revealing a strong preference for the LLM-based VCUI. Surgeons emphasized its intuitiveness and highlighted the potential of LLM-based VCUI in expediting decision-making in surgical environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as state-of-the-art methods to learn from graph-structured data for recommendation. However, most existing GNN-based recommendation methods focus on the optimization of model structures and learning strategies based on pre-defined graphs, neglecting the importance of the graph construction stage. Earlier works for graph construction usually rely on speciffic rules or crowdsourcing, which are either too simplistic or too labor-intensive. Recent works start to utilize large language models (LLMs) to automate the graph construction, in view of their abundant open-world knowledge and remarkable reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, they generally suffer from two limitations: (1) invisibility of global view (e.g., overlooking contextual information) and (2) construction inefficiency. To this end, we introduce AutoGraph, an automatic graph construction framework based on LLMs for recommendation. Specifically, we first use LLMs to infer the user preference and item knowledge, which is encoded as semantic vectors. Next, we employ vector quantization to extract the latent factors from the semantic vectors. The latent factors are then incorporated as extra nodes to link the user/item nodes, resulting in a graph with in-depth global-view semantics. We further design metapath-based message aggregation to effectively aggregate the semantic and collaborative information. The framework is model-agnostic and compatible with different backbone models. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy and efffciency of AutoGraph compared to existing baseline methods. We have deployed AutoGraph in Huawei advertising platform, and gain a 2.69% improvement on RPM and a 7.31% improvement on eCPM in the online A/B test. Currently AutoGraph has been used as the main trafffc model, serving hundreds of millions of people.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) require post-training methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on instruction-response pairs to enable instruction following. However, this process can potentially harm existing capabilities learned during pre-training. In this paper, we investigate the loss of context awareness after SFT, where context awareness is defined as the ability to extract and understand information from user-provided context and respond accordingly. We are the first to identify and show that the loss of context awareness, as reflected by the performance drop in the Needle-in-a-Haystack test, occurs in instruction fine-tuned LLMs when the chat template is applied to input prompts. We identify that the performance decline is partially caused by an attention bias toward different roles learned during conversational instruction fine-tuning. We validate our hypothesis by visualizing changes in attention allocation after the chat template is applied and manually steering the attention heads. Based on these observations, we propose a metric to select context-dependent examples from general instruction fine-tuning datasets. We then apply conditional instruction fine-tuning with a context-dependency indicator, enabling the model to learn context awareness from these selected examples. Empirical experiments on four context-dependent downstream tasks and three pre-trained LLMs of different sizes show that our method effectively mitigates the loss of context awareness without compromising general instruction-following capabilities. Given our findings, we strongly advocate for careful benchmarking of context awareness after instruction fine-tuning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Edge computing has emerged as a key paradigm for deploying deep learning-based object detection in time-sensitive scenarios. However, existing edge detection methods face challenges: 1) difficulty balancing detection precision with lightweight models, 2) limited adaptability of generalized deployment designs, and 3) insufficient real-world validation. To address these issues, we propose the Edge Detection Toolbox (ED-TOOLBOX), which utilizes generalizable plug-and-play components to adapt object detection models for edge environments. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight Reparameterized Dynamic Convolutional Network (Rep-DConvNet) featuring weighted multi-shape convolutional branches to enhance detection performance. Additionally, we design a Sparse Cross-Attention (SC-A) network with a localized-mapping-assisted self-attention mechanism, enabling a well-crafted joint module for adaptive feature transfer. For real-world applications, we incorporate an Efficient Head into the YOLO framework to accelerate edge model optimization. To demonstrate practical impact, we identify a gap in helmet detection -- overlooking band fastening, a critical safety factor -- and create the Helmet Band Detection Dataset (HBDD). Using ED-TOOLBOX-optimized models, we address this real-world task. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of ED-TOOLBOX, with edge detection models outperforming six state-of-the-art methods in visual surveillance simulations, achieving real-time and accurate performance. These results highlight ED-TOOLBOX as a superior solution for edge object detection.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rapid growth of blockchain technology, smart contracts are now crucial to Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications. Effective vulnerability detection is vital for securing these contracts against hackers and enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of security audits. In this paper, we present SimilarGPT, a unique vulnerability identification tool for smart contract, which combines Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) models with Code-based similarity checking methods. The main concept of the SimilarGPT tool is to measure the similarity between the code under inspection and the secure code from third-party libraries. To identify potential vulnerabilities, we connect the semantic understanding capability of large language models (LLMs) with Code-based similarity checking techniques. We propose optimizing the detection sequence using topological ordering to enhance logical coherence and reduce false positives during detection. Through analysis of code reuse patterns in smart contracts, we compile and process extensive third-party library code to establish a comprehensive reference codebase. Then, we utilize LLM to conduct an indepth analysis of similar codes to identify and explain potential vulnerabilities in the codes. The experimental findings indicate that SimilarGPT excels in detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts, particularly in missed detections and minimizing false positives.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially for topology perturbations, and many methods that improve the robustness of GNNs have received considerable attention. Recently, we have witnessed the significant success of large language models (LLMs), leading many to explore the great potential of LLMs on GNNs. However, they mainly focus on improving the performance of GNNs by utilizing LLMs to enhance the node features. Therefore, we ask: Will the robustness of GNNs also be enhanced with the powerful understanding and inference capabilities of LLMs? By presenting the empirical results, we find that despite that LLMs can improve the robustness of GNNs, there is still an average decrease of 23.1% in accuracy, implying that the GNNs remain extremely vulnerable against topology attacks. Therefore, another question is how to extend the capabilities of LLMs on graph adversarial robustness. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based robust graph structure inference framework, LLM4RGNN, which distills the inference capabilities of GPT-4 into a local LLM for identifying malicious edges and an LM-based edge predictor for finding missing important edges, so as to recover a robust graph structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLM4RGNN consistently improves the robustness across various GNNs. Even in some cases where the perturbation ratio increases to 40%, the accuracy of GNNs is still better than that on the clean graph.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has gained significant popularity for creating diverse content. Current AIGC models primarily focus on content quality within a centralized framework, resulting in a high service delay and negative user experiences. However, not only does the workload of an AIGC task depend on the AIGC model's complexity rather than the amount of data, but the large model and its multi-layer encoder structure also result in a huge demand for computational and memory resources. These unique characteristics pose new challenges in its modeling, deployment, and scheduling at edge networks. Thus, we model an offloading problem among edges for providing real AIGC services and propose LAD-TS, a novel Latent Action Diffusion-based Task Scheduling method that orchestrates multiple edge servers for expedited AIGC services. The LAD-TS generates a near-optimal offloading decision by leveraging the diffusion model's conditional generation capability and the reinforcement learning's environment interaction ability, thereby minimizing the service delays under multiple resource constraints. Meanwhile, a latent action diffusion strategy is designed to guide decision generation by utilizing historical action probability, enabling rapid achievement of near-optimal decisions. Furthermore, we develop DEdgeAI, a prototype edge system with a refined AIGC model deployment to implement and evaluate our LAD-TS method. DEdgeAI provides a real AIGC service for users, demonstrating up to 29.18% shorter service delays than the current five representative AIGC platforms. We release our open-source code at https://github.com/ChangfuXu/DEdgeAI/.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Explainable fake news detection predicts the authenticity of news items with annotated explanations. Today, Large Language Models (LLMs) are known for their powerful natural language understanding and explanation generation abilities. However, presenting LLMs for explainable fake news detection remains two main challenges. Firstly, fake news appears reasonable and could easily mislead LLMs, leaving them unable to understand the complex news-faking process. Secondly, utilizing LLMs for this task would generate both correct and incorrect explanations, which necessitates abundant labor in the loop. In this paper, we propose LLM-GAN, a novel framework that utilizes prompting mechanisms to enable an LLM to become Generator and Detector and for realistic fake news generation and detection. Our results demonstrate LLM-GAN's effectiveness in both prediction performance and explanation quality. We further showcase the integration of LLM-GAN to a cloud-native AI platform to provide better fake news detection service in the cloud.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is based on the quality of the prompts and the semantic and structural integrity information of the input data. However, current prompt generation methods primarily focus on generating prompts for clean input data, often overlooking the impact of perturbed inputs on prompt performance. To address this limitation, we propose BATprompt (By Adversarial Training prompt), a novel method for prompt generation designed to withstand input perturbations (such as typos in the input). Inspired by adversarial training techniques, BATprompt demonstrates strong performance on a variety of perturbed tasks through a two-step process: adversarial perturbation and iterative optimization on unperturbed input via LLM. Unlike conventional adversarial attack methods, BATprompt avoids reliance on real gradients or model parameters. Instead, it leverages the advanced reasoning, language understanding and self reflection capabilities of LLMs to simulate gradients, guiding the generation of adversarial perturbations and optimizing prompt performance. In our experiments, we evaluate BATprompt on multiple datasets across both language understanding and generation tasks. The results indicate that BATprompt outperforms existing prompt generation methods, delivering superior robustness and performance under diverse perturbation scenarios.

To better define such general-purpose tasks in the context of LLMs and advance the research in VLAs, we present VLABench, an open-source benchmark for evaluating universal LCM task learning. VLABench provides 100 carefully designed categories of tasks, with strong randomization in each category of task and a total of 2000+ objects. VLABench stands out from previous benchmarks in four key aspects: 1) tasks requiring world knowledge and common sense transfer, 2) natural language instructions with implicit human intentions rather than templates, 3) long-horizon tasks demanding multi-step reasoning, and 4) evaluation of both action policies and language model capabilities. The benchmark assesses multiple competencies including understanding of mesh\&texture, spatial relationship, semantic instruction, physical laws, knowledge transfer and reasoning, etc. To support the downstream finetuning, we provide high-quality training data collected via an automated framework incorporating heuristic skills and prior information. The experimental results indicate that both the current state-of-the-art pretrained VLAs and the workflow based on VLMs face challenges in our tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has sparked the possibility of about Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), a hypothetical AI system surpassing human intelligence. However, existing alignment paradigms struggle to guide such advanced AI systems. Superalignment, the alignment of AI systems with human values and safety requirements at superhuman levels of capability aims to addresses two primary goals -- scalability in supervision to provide high-quality guidance signals and robust governance to ensure alignment with human values. In this survey, we examine scalable oversight methods and potential solutions for superalignment. Specifically, we explore the concept of ASI, the challenges it poses, and the limitations of current alignment paradigms in addressing the superalignment problem. Then we review scalable oversight methods for superalignment. Finally, we discuss the key challenges and propose pathways for the safe and continual improvement of ASI systems. By comprehensively reviewing the current literature, our goal is provide a systematical introduction of existing methods, analyze their strengths and limitations, and discuss potential future directions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Even though Truck Mounted Attenuators (TMA)/Autonomous Truck Mounted Attenuators (ATMA) and traffic control devices are increasingly used in mobile work zones to enhance safety, work zone collisions remain a significant safety concern in the United States. In Missouri, there were 63 TMA-related crashes in 2023, a 27% increase compared to 2022. Currently, all the signs in the mobile work zones are passive safety measures, relying on drivers' recognition and attention. Some distracted drivers may ignore these signs and warnings, raising safety concerns. In this study, we proposed an additional proactive warning system that could be applied to the TMA/ATMA to improve overall safety. A feasible solution has been demonstrated by integrating a Panoptic Driving Perception algorithm into the Robot Operating System (ROS) and applying it to the TMA/ATMA systems. This enables us to alert vehicles on a collision course with the TMA. Our experimental setup, currently conducted in a laboratory environment with two ROS robots and a desktop GPU, demonstrates the system's capability to calculate real-time distance and speed and activate warning signals. Leveraging ROS's distributed computing capabilities allows for flexible system deployment and cost reduction. In future field tests, by combining the stopping sight distance (SSD) standards from the AASHTO Green Book, the system enables real-time monitoring of oncoming vehicles and provides additional proactive warnings to enhance the safety of mobile work zones.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text-to-image generative models excel in creating images from text but struggle with ensuring alignment and consistency between outputs and prompts. This paper introduces TextMatch, a novel framework that leverages multimodal optimization to address image-text discrepancies in text-to-image (T2I) generation and editing. TextMatch employs a scoring strategy powered by large language models (LLMs) and visual question-answering (VQA) models to evaluate semantic consistency between prompts and generated images. By integrating multimodal in-context learning and chain of thought reasoning, our method dynamically refines prompts through iterative optimization. This process ensures that the generated images better capture user intent of, resulting in higher fidelity and relevance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TextMatch significantly improves text-image consistency across multiple benchmarks, establishing a reliable framework for advancing the capabilities of text-to-image generative models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sequential recommendation (SR) systems have evolved significantly over the past decade, transitioning from traditional collaborative filtering to deep learning approaches and, more recently, to large language models (LLMs). While the adoption of LLMs has driven substantial advancements, these models inherently lack collaborative filtering information, relying primarily on textual content data neglecting other modalities and thus failing to achieve optimal recommendation performance. To address this limitation, we propose Molar, a Multimodal large language sequential recommendation framework that integrates multiple content modalities with ID information to capture collaborative signals effectively. Molar employs an MLLM to generate unified item representations from both textual and non-textual data, facilitating comprehensive multimodal modeling and enriching item embeddings. Additionally, it incorporates collaborative filtering signals through a post-alignment mechanism, which aligns user representations from content-based and ID-based models, ensuring precise personalization and robust performance. By seamlessly combining multimodal content with collaborative filtering insights, Molar captures both user interests and contextual semantics, leading to superior recommendation accuracy. Extensive experiments validate that Molar significantly outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines, highlighting its strength in utilizing multimodal data and collaborative signals for sequential recommendation tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements have underscored the potential of large language model (LLM)-based agents in financial decision-making. Despite this progress, the field currently encounters two main challenges: (1) the lack of a comprehensive LLM agent framework adaptable to a variety of financial tasks, and (2) the absence of standardized benchmarks and consistent datasets for assessing agent performance. To tackle these issues, we introduce \textsc{InvestorBench}, the first benchmark specifically designed for evaluating LLM-based agents in diverse financial decision-making contexts. InvestorBench enhances the versatility of LLM-enabled agents by providing a comprehensive suite of tasks applicable to different financial products, including single equities like stocks, cryptocurrencies and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Additionally, we assess the reasoning and decision-making capabilities of our agent framework using thirteen different LLMs as backbone models, across various market environments and tasks. Furthermore, we have curated a diverse collection of open-source, multi-modal datasets and developed a comprehensive suite of environments for financial decision-making. This establishes a highly accessible platform for evaluating financial agents' performance across various scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into services such as ChatGPT to provide responses to user queries. To mitigate potential harm and prevent misuse, there have been concerted efforts to align the LLMs with human values and legal compliance by incorporating various techniques, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), into the training of the LLMs. However, recent research has exposed that even aligned LLMs are susceptible to adversarial manipulations known as Jailbreak Attacks. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a method called Token Highlighter to inspect and mitigate the potential jailbreak threats in the user query. Token Highlighter introduced a concept called Affirmation Loss to measure the LLM's willingness to answer the user query. It then uses the gradient of Affirmation Loss for each token in the user query to locate the jailbreak-critical tokens. Further, Token Highlighter exploits our proposed Soft Removal technique to mitigate the jailbreak effects of critical tokens via shrinking their token embeddings. Experimental results on two aligned LLMs (LLaMA-2 and Vicuna-V1.5) demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively defend against a variety of Jailbreak Attacks while maintaining competent performance on benign questions of the AlpacaEval benchmark. In addition, Token Highlighter is a cost-effective and interpretable defense because it only needs to query the protected LLM once to compute the Affirmation Loss and can highlight the critical tokens upon refusal.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The stateful nature of large language model (LLM) servingcan easily throttle precious GPU memory under load burstor long-generation requests like chain-of-thought reasoning,causing latency spikes due to queuing incoming requests. However, state-of-the-art KVCache centric approaches handleload spikes by dropping, migrating, or swapping KVCache,which faces an essential tradeoff between the performance ofongoing vs. incoming requests and thus still severely violatesSLO.This paper makes a key observation such that model param-eters are independent of the requests and are replicated acrossGPUs, and thus proposes a parameter-centric approach byselectively dropping replicated parameters to leave preciousmemory for requests. However, LLM requires KVCache tobe saved in bound with model parameters and thus droppingparameters can cause either huge computation waste or longnetwork delay, affecting all ongoing requests. Based on the ob-servation that attention operators can be decoupled from otheroperators, this paper further proposes a novel remote attentionmechanism through pipeline parallelism so as to serve up-coming requests with the additional memory borrowed fromparameters on remote GPUs. This paper further addresses sev-eral other challenges including lively exchanging KVCachewith incomplete parameters, generating an appropriate planthat balances memory requirements with cooperative exe-cution overhead, and seamlessly restoring parameters whenthe throttling has gone. Evaluations show thatKUNSERVEreduces the tail TTFT of requests under throttling by up to 27.3x compared to the state-of-the-art.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> More than one-fifth of the US population does not subscribe to a fixed broadband service despite broadband being a recognized merit good. For example, less than 4% of citizens earning more than US \$70k annually do not have broadband, compared to 26% of those earning below US \$20k annually. To address this, the federal government has undertaken one of the largest broadband investment programs ever via The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, with the aim of addressing this disparity and expanding broadband connectivity to all citizens. We examine broadband availability, adoption, and need for each US state, and then construct an Input-Output model to explore the potential structural macroeconomic impacts of broadband spending on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and supply chain linkages. In terms of macroeconomic impact, the total potential indirect contribution to US GDP by the program could be as high as US \$84.8 billion, \$32.7 billion, and \$9.78 billion for the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment program, the Affordable Connectivity Program, and additional programs, respectively. Thus, overall, the broadband allocations could expand US GDP by up to US \$127.3 billion (0.10% of annual US GDP over the next five years). Moreover, the broadband packages within the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law could create up to 230,000 jobs (0.14% labor market increase). We contribute one of the first economic impact assessments of the US Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to the literature.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at generating highly detailed captions but often produce hallucinations. Our analysis reveals that existing hallucination detection methods struggle with detailed captions. We attribute this to the increasing reliance of MLLMs on their generated text, rather than the input image, as the sequence length grows. To address this issue, we propose a multiagent approach that leverages LLM-MLLM collaboration to correct given captions. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation framework and a benchmark dataset to facilitate the systematic analysis of detailed captions. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed evaluation method better aligns with human judgments of factuality than existing metrics and that existing approaches to improve the MLLM factuality may fall short in hyper-detailed image captioning tasks. In contrast, our proposed method significantly enhances the factual accuracy of captions, even improving those generated by GPT-4V. Finally, we highlight a limitation of VQA-centric benchmarking by demonstrating that an MLLM's performance on VQA benchmarks may not correlate with its ability to generate detailed image captions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid growth of social media platforms has raised significant concerns regarding online content toxicity. When Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for toxicity detection, two key challenges emerge: 1) the absence of domain-specific toxic knowledge leads to false negatives; 2) the excessive sensitivity of LLMs to toxic speech results in false positives, limiting freedom of speech. To address these issues, we propose a novel method called MetaTox, leveraging graph search on a meta-toxic knowledge graph to enhance hatred and toxicity detection. First, we construct a comprehensive meta-toxic knowledge graph by utilizing LLMs to extract toxic information through a three-step pipeline, with toxic benchmark datasets serving as corpora. Second, we query the graph via retrieval and ranking processes to supplement accurate, relevant toxic knowledge. Extensive experiments and in-depth case studies across multiple datasets demonstrate that our MetaTox significantly decreases the false positive rate while boosting overall toxicity detection performance. Our code will be available soon.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scientific user facilities, such as synchrotron beamlines, are equipped with a wide array of hardware and software tools that require a codebase for human-computer-interaction. This often necessitates developers to be involved to establish connection between users/researchers and the complex instrumentation. The advent of generative AI presents an opportunity to bridge this knowledge gap, enabling seamless communication and efficient experimental workflows. Here we present a modular architecture for the Virtual Scientific Companion (VISION) by assembling multiple AI-enabled cognitive blocks that each scaffolds large language models (LLMs) for a specialized task. With VISION, we performed LLM-based operation on the beamline workstation with low latency and demonstrated the first voice-controlled experiment at an X-ray scattering beamline. The modular and scalable architecture allows for easy adaptation to new instrument and capabilities. Development on natural language-based scientific experimentation is a building block for an impending future where a science exocortex -- a synthetic extension to the cognition of scientists -- may radically transform scientific practice and discovery.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advancements, primarily due to their capabilities in modeling the hidden relationships within text sequences. This innovation presents a unique opportunity in the field of life sciences, where vast collections of single-cell omics data from multiple species provide a foundation for training foundational models. However, the challenge lies in the disparity of data scales across different species, hindering the development of a comprehensive model for interpreting genetic data across diverse organisms. In this study, we propose an innovative hybrid approach that integrates the general knowledge capabilities of LLMs with domain-specific representation models for single-cell omics data interpretation. We begin by focusing on genes as the fundamental unit of representation. Gene representations are initialized using functional descriptions, leveraging the strengths of mature language models such as LLaMA-2. By inputting single-cell gene-level expression data with prompts, we effectively model cellular representations based on the differential expression levels of genes across various species and cell types. In the experiments, we constructed developmental cells from humans and mice, specifically targeting cells that are challenging to annotate. We evaluated our methodology through basic tasks such as cell annotation and visualization analysis. The results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach compared to other methods using LLMs, highlighting significant improvements in accuracy and interoperability. Our hybrid approach enhances the representation of single-cell data and offers a robust framework for future research in cross-species genetic analysis.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Autoregressive (AR) models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in text and image generation but suffer from slow generation due to the token-by-token process. We ask an ambitious question: can a pre-trained AR model be adapted to generate outputs in just one or two steps? If successful, this would significantly advance the development and deployment of AR models. We notice that existing works that try to speed up AR generation by generating multiple tokens at once fundamentally cannot capture the output distribution due to the conditional dependencies between tokens, limiting their effectiveness for few-step generation. To address this, we propose Distilled Decoding (DD), which uses flow matching to create a deterministic mapping from Gaussian distribution to the output distribution of the pre-trained AR model. We then train a network to distill this mapping, enabling few-step generation. DD doesn't need the training data of the original AR model, making it more practical. We evaluate DD on state-of-the-art image AR models and present promising results on ImageNet-256. For VAR, which requires 10-step generation, DD enables one-step generation (6.3$\times$ speed-up), with an acceptable increase in FID from 4.19 to 9.96. For LlamaGen, DD reduces generation from 256 steps to 1, achieving an 217.8$\times$ speed-up with a comparable FID increase from 4.11 to 11.35. In both cases, baseline methods completely fail with FID>100. DD also excels on text-to-image generation, reducing the generation from 256 steps to 2 for LlamaGen with minimal FID increase from 25.70 to 28.95. As the first work to demonstrate the possibility of one-step generation for image AR models, DD challenges the prevailing notion that AR models are inherently slow, and opens up new opportunities for efficient AR generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Emerging topics in biomedical research are continuously expanding, providing a wealth of information about genes and their function. This rapid proliferation of knowledge presents unprecedented opportunities for scientific discovery and formidable challenges for researchers striving to keep abreast of the latest advancements. One significant challenge is navigating the vast corpus of literature to extract vital gene-related information, a time-consuming and cumbersome task. To enhance the efficiency of this process, it is crucial to address several key challenges: (1) the overwhelming volume of literature, (2) the complexity of gene functions, and (3) the automated integration and generation. In response, we propose GeneSUM, a two-stage automated gene summary extractor utilizing a large language model (LLM). Our approach retrieves and eliminates redundancy of target gene literature and then fine-tunes the LLM to refine and streamline the summarization process. We conducted extensive experiments to validate the efficacy of our proposed framework. The results demonstrate that LLM significantly enhances the integration of gene-specific information, allowing more efficient decision-making in ongoing research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely used to generate responses on social topics due to their world knowledge and generative capabilities. Beyond reasoning and generation performance, political bias is an essential issue that warrants attention. Political bias, as a universal phenomenon in human society, may be transferred to LLMs and distort LLMs' behaviors of information acquisition and dissemination with humans, leading to unequal access among different groups of people. To prevent LLMs from reproducing and reinforcing political biases, and to encourage fairer LLM-human interactions, comprehensively examining political bias in popular LLMs becomes urgent and crucial.   In this study, we systematically measure the political biases in a wide range of LLMs, using a curated set of questions addressing political bias in various contexts. Our findings reveal distinct patterns in how LLMs respond to political topics. For highly polarized topics, most LLMs exhibit a pronounced left-leaning bias. Conversely, less polarized topics elicit greater consensus, with similar response patterns across different LLMs. Additionally, we analyze how LLM characteristics, including release date, model scale, and region of origin affect political bias. The results indicate political biases evolve with model scale and release date, and are also influenced by regional factors of LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Social media platforms are experiencing a growing presence of AI-Generated Texts (AIGTs). However, the misuse of AIGTs could have profound implications for public opinion, such as spreading misinformation and manipulating narratives. Despite its importance, a systematic study to assess the prevalence of AIGTs on social media is still lacking. To address this gap, this paper aims to quantify, monitor, and analyze the AIGTs on online social media platforms. We first collect a dataset (SM-D) with around 2.4M posts from 3 major social media platforms: Medium, Quora, and Reddit. Then, we construct a diverse dataset (AIGTBench) to train and evaluate AIGT detectors. AIGTBench combines popular open-source datasets and our AIGT datasets generated from social media texts by 12 LLMs, serving as a benchmark for evaluating mainstream detectors. With this setup, we identify the best-performing detector (OSM-Det). We then apply OSM-Det to SM-D to track AIGTs over time and observe different trends of AI Attribution Rate (AAR) across social media platforms from January 2022 to October 2024. Specifically, Medium and Quora exhibit marked increases in AAR, rising from 1.77% to 37.03% and 2.06% to 38.95%, respectively. In contrast, Reddit shows slower growth, with AAR increasing from 1.31% to 2.45% over the same period. Our further analysis indicates that AIGTs differ from human-written texts across several dimensions, including linguistic patterns, topic distributions, engagement levels, and the follower distribution of authors. We envision our analysis and findings on AIGTs in social media can shed light on future research in this domain.

However, existing benchmarks like GSM8K or MATH are now being solved with high accuracy (e.g., OpenAI o1 achieves 94.8\% on MATH dataset), indicating their inadequacy for truly challenging these models. To bridge this gap, we propose a comprehensive and challenging benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs' mathematical reasoning at the Olympiad level. Unlike existing Olympiad-related benchmarks, our dataset focuses exclusively on mathematics and comprises a vast collection of 4428 competition-level problems with rigorous human annotation. These problems are meticulously categorized into over 33 sub-domains and span more than 10 distinct difficulty levels, enabling a holistic assessment of model performance in Olympiad-mathematical reasoning. Furthermore, we conducted an in-depth analysis based on this benchmark. Our experimental results show that even the most advanced models, OpenAI o1-mini and OpenAI o1-preview, struggle with highly challenging Olympiad-level problems, with 60.54\% and 52.55\% accuracy, highlighting significant challenges in Olympiad-level mathematical reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The recent surge in jailbreaking attacks has revealed significant vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) when exposed to malicious inputs. While various defense strategies have been proposed to mitigate these threats, there has been limited research into the underlying mechanisms that make LLMs vulnerable to such attacks. In this study, we suggest that the self-safeguarding capability of LLMs is linked to specific activity patterns within their representation space. Although these patterns have little impact on the semantic content of the generated text, they play a crucial role in shaping LLM behavior under jailbreaking attacks. Our findings demonstrate that these patterns can be detected with just a few pairs of contrastive queries. Extensive experimentation shows that the robustness of LLMs against jailbreaking can be manipulated by weakening or strengthening these patterns. Further visual analysis provides additional evidence for our conclusions, providing new insights into the jailbreaking phenomenon. These findings highlight the importance of addressing the potential misuse of open-source LLMs within the community.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in complex reasoning tasks, but their safety and robustness in reasoning processes remain underexplored. Existing attacks on LLM reasoning are constrained by specific settings or lack of imperceptibility, limiting their feasibility and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose the Stepwise rEasoning Error Disruption (SEED) attack, which subtly injects errors into prior reasoning steps to mislead the model into producing incorrect subsequent reasoning and final answers. Unlike previous methods, SEED is compatible with zero-shot and few-shot settings, maintains the natural reasoning flow, and ensures covert execution without modifying the instruction. Extensive experiments on four datasets across four different models demonstrate SEED's effectiveness, revealing the vulnerabilities of LLMs to disruptions in reasoning processes. These findings underscore the need for greater attention to the robustness of LLM reasoning to ensure safety in practical applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Clustering is a key task in machine learning, with $k$-means being widely used for its simplicity and effectiveness. While 1D clustering is common, existing methods often fail to exploit the structure of 1D data, leading to inefficiencies. This thesis introduces optimized algorithms for $k$-means++ initialization and Lloyd's algorithm, leveraging sorted data, prefix sums, and binary search for improved computational performance. The main contributions are: (1) an optimized $k$-cluster algorithm achieving $O(l \cdot k^2 \cdot \log n)$ complexity for greedy $k$-means++ initialization and $O(i \cdot k \cdot \log n)$ for Lloyd's algorithm, where $l$ is the number of greedy $k$-means++ local trials, and $i$ is the number of Lloyd's algorithm iterations, and (2) a binary search-based two-cluster algorithm, achieving $O(\log n)$ runtime with deterministic convergence to a Lloyd's algorithm local minimum. Benchmarks demonstrate over a 4500x speedup compared to scikit-learn for large datasets while maintaining clustering quality measured by within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS). Additionally, the algorithms achieve a 300x speedup in an LLM quantization task, highlighting their utility in emerging applications. This thesis bridges theory and practice for 1D $k$-means clustering, delivering efficient and sound algorithms implemented in a JIT-optimized open-source Python library.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance across various domains, the deployment of these models on edge devices has emerged as a new trend. Quantization techniques, which reduce the size and memory footprint of LLMs, are effective for enabling deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. However, existing one-size-fits-all quantization methods often fail to dynamically adjust the memory consumption of LLMs based on specific hardware characteristics and usage scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose LSAQ (Layer-Specific Adaptive Quantization), a system for adaptive quantization and dynamic deployment of LLMs based on layer importance. LSAQ evaluates layer importance by constructing top-k token sets from the inputs and outputs of each layer and calculating their Jaccard coefficient. Using this evaluation, the system adaptively adjusts quantization strategies in real time according to the resource availability of edge devices, assigning different precision levels to layers of varying importance. This approach significantly reduces the storage requirements of LLMs while maintaining model performance, enabling efficient deployment across diverse hardware platforms and usage scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed the development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). However, existing research primarily focuses on tuning language and image instructions, ignoring the critical pretraining phase where models learn to process textual and visual modalities jointly. In this paper, we propose a new pretraining paradigm for LMMs to enhance the visual comprehension capabilities of LLMs by introducing a novel cross-modal comprehension stage. Specifically, we design a dynamically learnable prompt token pool and employ the Hungarian algorithm to replace part of the original visual tokens with the most relevant prompt tokens. Then, we conceptualize visual tokens as analogous to a "foreign language" for the LLMs and propose a mixed attention mechanism with bidirectional visual attention and unidirectional textual attention to comprehensively enhance the understanding of visual tokens. Meanwhile, we integrate a detailed caption generation task, leveraging rich descriptions to further facilitate LLMs in understanding visual semantic information. After pretraining on 1.5 million publicly accessible data, we present a new foundation model called Croc. Experimental results demonstrate that Croc achieves new state-of-the-art performance on massive vision-language benchmarks. To support reproducibility and facilitate further research, we release the training code and pre-trained model weights at https://github.com/deepglint/Croc.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurate prediction helps to achieve supply-demand balance in energy systems, supporting decision-making and scheduling. Traditional models, lacking AI-assisted automation, rely on experts, incur high costs, and struggle with sparse data prediction. To address these challenges, we propose the Energy Forecasting Large Language Model (EF-LLM), which integrates domain knowledge and temporal data for time-series forecasting, supporting both pre-forecast operations and post-forecast decision-support. EF-LLM's human-AI interaction capabilities lower the entry barrier in forecasting tasks, reducing the need for extra expert involvement. To achieve this, we propose a continual learning approach with updatable LoRA and a multi-channel architecture for aligning heterogeneous multimodal data, enabling EF-LLM to continually learn heterogeneous multimodal knowledge. In addition, EF-LLM enables accurate predictions under sparse data conditions through its ability to process multimodal data. We propose Fusion Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (F-PEFT) method to effectively leverage both time-series data and text for this purpose. EF-LLM is also the first energy-specific LLM to detect hallucinations and quantify their occurrence rate, achieved via multi-task learning, semantic similarity analysis, and ANOVA. We have achieved success in energy prediction scenarios for load, photovoltaic, and wind power forecast.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Emergency response services are vital for enhancing public safety by safeguarding the environment, property, and human lives. As frontline members of these services, 9-1-1 dispatchers have a direct impact on response times and the overall effectiveness of emergency operations. However, traditional dispatcher training methods, which rely on role-playing by experienced personnel, are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often neglect the specific needs of underserved communities. To address these challenges, we introduce Sim911, the first training simulation for 9-1-1 dispatchers powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Sim911 enhances training through three key technical innovations: (1) knowledge construction, which utilizes archived 9-1-1 call data to generate simulations that closely mirror real-world scenarios; (2) context-aware controlled generation, which employs dynamic prompts and vector bases to ensure that LLM behavior aligns with training objectives; and (3) validation with looped correction, which filters out low-quality responses and refines the system performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have brought exciting new advances to mobile UI agents, a long-standing research field that aims to complete arbitrary natural language tasks through mobile UI interactions. However, existing UI agents usually demand high reasoning capabilities of powerful large models that are difficult to be deployed locally on end-users' devices, which raises huge concerns about user privacy and centralized serving cost. One way to reduce the required model size is to customize a smaller domain-specific model with high-quality training data, e.g. large-scale human demonstrations of diverse types of apps and tasks, while such datasets are extremely difficult to obtain. Inspired by the remarkable coding abilities of recent small language models (SLMs), we propose to convert the UI task automation problem to a code generation problem, which can be effectively solved by an on-device SLM and efficiently executed with an on-device code interpreter. Unlike normal coding tasks that can be extensively pretrained with public datasets, generating UI automation code is challenging due to the diversity, complexity, and variability of target apps. Therefore, we adopt a document-centered approach that automatically builds fine-grained API documentation for each app and generates diverse task samples based on this documentation. By guiding the agent with the synthetic documents and task samples, it learns to generate precise and efficient scripts to complete unseen tasks. Based on detailed comparisons with state-of-the-art mobile UI agents, our approach effectively improves the mobile task automation with significantly higher success rates and lower latency/token consumption. Code will be open-sourced.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Tabular data, which accounts for over 80% of enterprise data assets, is vital in various fields. With growing concerns about privacy protection and data-sharing restrictions, generating high-quality synthetic tabular data has become essential. Recent advancements show that large language models (LLMs) can effectively gener-ate realistic tabular data by leveraging semantic information and overcoming the challenges of high-dimensional data that arise from one-hot encoding. However, current methods do not fully utilize the rich information available in tables. To address this, we introduce AI Generative Table (AIGT) based on prompt enhancement, a novel approach that utilizes meta data information, such as table descriptions and schemas, as prompts to generate ultra-high quality synthetic data. To overcome the token limit constraints of LLMs, we propose long-token partitioning algorithms that enable AIGT to model tables of any scale. AIGT achieves state-of-the-art performance on 14 out of 20 public datasets and two real industry datasets within the Alipay risk control system.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for their remarkable capabilities across various domains, whose vast parameter scales present challenges for practical deployment. Structured pruning is an effective method to balance model performance with efficiency, but performance restoration under computational resource constraints is a principal challenge in pruning LLMs. Therefore, we present a low-cost and fast structured pruning method for LLMs named SlimGPT based on the Optimal Brain Surgeon framework. We propose Batched Greedy Pruning for rapid and near-optimal pruning, which enhances the accuracy of head-wise pruning error estimation through grouped Cholesky decomposition and improves the pruning efficiency of FFN via Dynamic Group Size, thereby achieving approximate local optimal pruning results within one hour. Besides, we explore the limitations of layer-wise pruning from the perspective of error accumulation and propose Incremental Pruning Ratio, a non-uniform pruning strategy to reduce performance degradation. Experimental results on the LLaMA benchmark show that SlimGPT outperforms other methods and achieves state-of-the-art results.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The lack of training data gives rise to the system cold-start problem in recommendation systems, making them struggle to provide effective recommendations. To address this problem, Large Language Models (LLMs) can model recommendation tasks as language analysis tasks and provide zero-shot results based on their vast open-world knowledge. However, the large scale of the item corpus poses a challenge to LLMs, leading to substantial token consumption that makes it impractical to deploy in real-world recommendation systems. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a tree-based LLM recommendation framework LLMTreeRec, which structures all items into an item tree to improve the efficiency of LLM's item retrieval. LLMTreeRec achieves state-of-the-art performance under the system cold-start setting in two widely used datasets, which is even competitive with conventional deep recommendation systems that use substantial training data. Furthermore, LLMTreeRec outperforms the baseline model in A/B testing on Huawei industrial systems. Consequently, LLMTreeRec demonstrates its effectiveness as an industry-friendly solution that has been successfully deployed online.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Integrating Generative AI (GenAI) into educational contexts presents a transformative potential for enhancing learning experiences. This paper introduces CourseGPT, a generative AI tool designed to support instructors and enhance the educational experiences of undergraduate students. Built on open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) from Mistral AI, CourseGPT offers continuous instructor support and regular updates to course materials, enriching the learning environment. By utilizing course-specific content, such as slide decks and supplementary readings and references, CourseGPT provides precise, dynamically generated responses to student inquiries. Unlike generic AI models, CourseGPT allows instructors to manage and control the responses, thus extending the course scope without overwhelming details. The paper demonstrates the application of CourseGPT using the CPR E 431 - Basics of Information System Security course as a pilot. This course, with its large enrollments and diverse curriculum, serves as an ideal testbed for CourseGPT. The tool aims to enhance the learning experience, accelerate feedback processes, and streamline administrative tasks. The study evaluates CourseGPT's impact on student outcomes, focusing on correctness scores, context recall, and faithfulness of responses. Results indicate that the Mixtral-8x7b model, with a higher parameter count, outperforms smaller models, achieving an 88.0% correctness score and a 66.6% faithfulness score. Additionally, feedback from former students and teaching assistants on CourseGPT's accuracy, helpfulness, and overall performance was collected. The outcomes revealed that a significant majority found CourseGPT to be highly accurate and beneficial in addressing their queries, with many praising its ability to provide timely and relevant information.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in visual understanding. This impressive leap raises a compelling question: how can language models, initially trained solely on linguistic data, effectively interpret and process visual content? This paper aims to address this question with systematic investigation across 4 model families and 4 model scales, uncovering a unique class of attention heads that focus specifically on visual content. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between the behavior of these attention heads, the distribution of attention weights, and their concentration on visual tokens within the input. These findings enhance our understanding of how LLMs adapt to multimodal tasks, demonstrating their potential to bridge the gap between textual and visual understanding. This work paves the way for the development of AI systems capable of engaging with diverse modalities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Meeting growing demands for low latency and cost efficiency in production-grade large language model (LLM) serving systems requires integrating advanced optimization techniques. However, dynamic and unpredictable input-output lengths of LLM, compounded by these optimizations, exacerbate the issues of workload variability, making it difficult to maintain high efficiency on AI accelerators, especially DSAs with tile-based programming models. To address this challenge, we introduce XY-Serve, a versatile, Ascend native, end-to-end production LLM-serving system. The core idea is an abstraction mechanism that smooths out the workload variability by decomposing computations into unified, hardware-friendly, fine-grained meta primitives. For attention, we propose a meta-kernel that computes the basic pattern of matmul-softmax-matmul with architectural-aware tile sizes. For GEMM, we introduce a virtual padding scheme that adapts to dynamic shape changes while using highly efficient GEMM primitives with assorted fixed tile sizes. XY-Serve sits harmoniously with vLLM. Experimental results show up to 89% end-to-end throughput improvement compared with current publicly available baselines on Ascend NPUs. Additionally, our approach outperforms existing GEMM (average 14.6% faster) and attention (average 21.5% faster) kernels relative to existing libraries. While the work is Ascend native, we believe the approach can be readily applicable to SIMT architectures as well.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid growth of scientific techniques and knowledge is reflected in the exponential increase in new patents filed annually. While these patents drive innovation, they also present significant burden for researchers and engineers, especially newcomers. To avoid the tedious work of navigating a vast and complex landscape to identify trends and breakthroughs, researchers urgently need efficient tools to summarize, evaluate, and contextualize patents, revealing their innovative contributions and underlying scientific principles.To address this need, we present EvoPat, a multi-LLM-based patent agent designed to assist users in analyzing patents through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and advanced search strategies. EvoPat leverages multiple Large Language Models (LLMs), each performing specialized roles such as planning, identifying innovations, and conducting comparative evaluations. The system integrates data from local databases, including patents, literature, product catalogous, and company repositories, and online searches to provide up-to-date insights. The ability to collect information not included in original database automatically is also implemented. Through extensive testing in the natural language processing (NLP) domain, we demonstrate that EvoPat outperforms GPT-4 in tasks such as patent summarization, comparative analysis, and technical evaluation. EvoPat represents a significant step toward creating AI-powered tools that empower researchers and engineers to efficiently navigate the complexities of the patent landscape.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become an essential step in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to align them with human preferences. However, human labelers are selfish and have diverse preferences. They may strategically misreport their online feedback to influence the system's aggregation towards their own preferences. Current practice simply averages labelers' feedback per time and fails to identify the most accurate human labeler, leading to linear regret $\mathcal{O}(T)$ for $T$ time slots. To our best knowledge, we are the first to study online learning mechanisms against strategic human labelers in the LLM fine-tuning process. We formulate a new dynamic Bayesian game and dynamically adjust human labelers' weights in the preference aggregation, ensuring their truthful feedback and sublinear regret $\mathcal{O}(T^{1/2})$. Simulation results demonstrate our mechanism's great advantages over the existing benchmark schemes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as powerful tools in healthcare, particularly for complex, domain-specific tasks. This study describes the development and evaluation of the PErioperative AI CHatbot (PEACH), a secure LLM-based system integrated with local perioperative guidelines to support preoperative clinical decision-making. PEACH was embedded with 35 institutional perioperative protocols in the secure Claude 3.5 Sonet LLM framework within Pair Chat (developed by Singapore Government) and tested in a silent deployment with real-world data. Accuracy, safety, and usability were assessed. Deviations and hallucinations were categorized based on potential harm, and user feedback was evaluated using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Updates were made after the initial silent deployment to amend one protocol.   In 240 real-world clinical iterations, PEACH achieved a first-generation accuracy of 97.5% (78/80) and an overall accuracy of 96.7% (232/240) across three iterations. The updated PEACH demonstrated improved accuracy of 97.9% (235/240), with a statistically significant difference from the null hypothesis of 95% accuracy (p = 0.018, 95% CI: 0.952-0.991). Minimal hallucinations and deviations were observed (both 1/240 and 2/240, respectively). Clinicians reported that PEACH expedited decisions in 95% of cases, and inter-rater reliability ranged from kappa 0.772-0.893 within PEACH and 0.610-0.784 among attendings.   PEACH is an accurate, adaptable tool that enhances consistency and efficiency in perioperative decision-making. Future research should explore its scalability across specialties and its impact on clinical outcomes.
