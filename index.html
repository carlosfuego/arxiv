                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The C++ programming language and its cousins lean towards a memory-inefficient storage of structs: The compiler inserts helper bits such that individual instance variables fit to byte or cache boundaries, while it is not able to exploit knowledge about the range of integers, enums or bitsets. Furthermore, the language provides neither support for data exchange via MPI nor for arbitrary floating-point precisions. We propose C++ attributes through which developers can guide the compiler what memory arrangements would be beneficial: Can multiple booleans or integers with limited range be squeezed into one bit field, do floating point numbers hold fewer significant bits than in the IEEE standard, or does the code benefit from a MPI datatype for subsets of attributes? The extension offers the opportunity to fall back to normal alignment via plain C++ assignments, no dependencies upon external libraries are introduced, and the resulting code remains standard C++ subject to some weakened guarantees on addresses and pointer arithmetics. Our work implements the language annotations within LLVM and demonstrates their potential impact, both upon the runtime and the memory footprint, through smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) benchmarks. They uncover the potential gains in terms of performance and development productivity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion transformer (DiT) models have achieved remarkable success in image generation, thanks for their exceptional generative capabilities and scalability. Nonetheless, the iterative nature of diffusion models (DMs) results in high computation complexity, posing challenges for deployment. Although existing cache-based acceleration methods try to utilize the inherent temporal similarity to skip redundant computations of DiT, the lack of correction may induce potential quality degradation. In this paper, we propose increment-calibrated caching, a training-free method for DiT acceleration, where the calibration parameters are generated from the pre-trained model itself with low-rank approximation. To deal with the possible correction failure arising from outlier activations, we introduce channel-aware Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), which further strengthens the calibration effect. Experimental results show that our method always achieve better performance than existing naive caching methods with a similar computation resource budget. When compared with 35-step DDIM, our method eliminates more than 45% computation and improves IS by 12 at the cost of less than 0.06 FID increase.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based models are the foundation of modern machine learning, but their execution, particularly during autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs), places significant pressure on memory systems due to frequent memory accesses and growing key-value (KV) caches. This creates a bottleneck in memory bandwidth, especially as context lengths increase. Processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures are a promising solution, offering high internal bandwidth and compute parallelism near memory. However, current PIM designs are primarily optimized for dense attention and struggle with the dynamic, irregular access patterns introduced by modern KV cache sparsity techniques. Consequently, they suffer from workload imbalance, reducing throughput and resource utilization. In this work, we propose STARC, a novel sparsity-optimized data mapping scheme tailored specifically for efficient LLM decoding on PIM architectures. STARC clusters KV pairs by semantic similarity and maps them to contiguous memory regions aligned with PIM bank structures. During decoding, queries retrieve relevant tokens at cluster granularity by matching against precomputed centroids, enabling selective attention and parallel processing without frequent reclustering or data movement overhead. Experiments on the HBM-PIM system show that, compared to common token-wise sparsity methods, STARC reduces attention-layer latency by 19%--31% and energy consumption by 19%--27%. Under a KV cache budget of 1024, it achieves up to 54%--74% latency reduction and 45%--67% energy reduction compared to full KV cache retrieval. Meanwhile, STARC maintains model accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art sparse attention methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling efficient and hardware-friendly long-context LLM inference on PIM architectures.

  Requests Without Approximations</h2>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models (LLMs) handle increasingly longer contexts, serving long inference requests of millions of tokens presents unique challenges. We show that existing work for long context inference is largely based on techniques from long context training, and does not handle the high variability in input lengths during inference. This leads to inefficient resource utilization, server fragmentation, and head-of-line (HOL) blocking.   We present Medha, an end-to-end system for efficient long-context LLM inference that addresses these challenges through fine-grained time sharing. Medha introduces three key innovations: (1) the mechanism of adaptive prefill chunking to help mitigate HOL blocking with preemption; (2) two new parallelism strategies: Sequence Pipeline Parallelism (SPP) to reduce time-to-first-token by pipelining prefill chunks, and KV-Cache Parallelism (KVP) to lower time-peroutput-token by distributing decoding across servers; and (3) a novel input-length aware least remaining slack scheduling to meet Service Level Objectives (SLOs).   Medha enables exact inference scaling beyond 10 million tokens, maintaining high throughput and low latency across mixed-length workloads. Compared to state-of-the-art systems, Medha reduces server fragmentation, cuts median latency by up to 30x, and improves throughput by over 5x, delivering production-scale long-context inference without compromising performance on shorter requests.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Providing efficient and reliable content delivery in rural areas remains a significant challenge due to the lack of communication infrastructure. To bridge the digital divide, this paper investigates the potential of leveraging multiple high-altitude platforms (HAPs) for energy-efficient content delivery in wide rural regions. Each caching-enabled HAP is equipped with both Free-Space Optical (FSO) transceivers for backhaul links and Radio Frequency (RF) antenna arrays for access links. To further enhance network efficiency, we consider a network coding-based multicasting scheme, where different types of content are treated as distinct multicast sessions. With the objective of minimizing long-term power cost, we propose a hierarchical framework that integrates deep reinforcement learn-ing (DRL) and convex optimization to jointly optimize dynamic caching strategies and resource allocation across the network. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces power cost compared to several baseline approaches, providing a practical solution for improving rural connectivity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), have exhibited remarkable zero-shot performance across various image classification tasks. Fine-tuning these models on domain-specific datasets further enhances their effectiveness for downstream applications. However, fine-tuning in cloud environments raises significant concerns regarding data security and privacy. Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized solution by enabling model training across local clients without centralizing sensitive data, but the high communication and computation costs of transmitting full pre-trained models during training limit its scalability. Additionally, non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across local clients can negatively impact model convergence and performance. To address these challenges, we propose CacheFL, a novel federated learning method that replaces traditional full model fine-tuning with lightweight cache model fine-tuning. The cache model is initialized using a class-balanced dataset generated by a generative pre-trained model, effectively mitigating the impact of non-IID data. This cache model is then distributed to local clients for fine-tuning, and the updated parameters from each client are aggregated on the server and redistributed. With the updated cache model, the classification performance of CLIP is improved after just a few epochs. By limiting the training and communication to the cache model, CacheFL significantly reduces resource demands while ensuring data privacy and security. Extensive experiments conducted on ImageNet and 10 additional datasets demonstrate that CacheFL outperforms traditional approaches in terms of classification accuracy, resource efficiency, and privacy preservation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Speculation is key to achieving high CPU performance, yet it enables risks like Spectre attacks which remain a significant challenge to mitigate without incurring substantial performance overheads. These attacks typically unfold in three stages: access, transmit, and receive. Typically, they exploit a cache timing side channel during the transmit and receive phases: speculatively accessing sensitive data (access), altering cache state (transmit), and then utilizing a cache timing attack (e.g., Flush+Reload) to extract the secret (receive). Our key observation is that Spectre attacks only require the transmit instruction to execute and dispatch a request to the cache hierarchy. It need not complete before a misprediction is detected (and mis-speculated instructions squashed) because responses from memory that arrive at the cache after squashing still alter cache state. We propose a novel mitigation, CacheSquash, that cancels mis-speculated memory accesses. Immediately upon squashing, a cancellation is sent to the cache hierarchy, propagating downstream and preventing any changes to caches that have not yet received a response. This minimizes cache state changes, thereby reducing the likelihood of Spectre attacks succeeding. We implement CacheSquash on gem5 and show that it thwarts practical Spectre attacks, with near-zero performance overheads.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied in chatbots, code generators, and search engines. Workloads such as chain-of-thought, complex reasoning, and agent services significantly increase the inference cost by invoking the model repeatedly. Optimization methods such as parallelism, compression, and caching have been adopted to reduce costs, but the diverse service requirements make it hard to select the right method. Recently, specialized LLM inference engines have emerged as a key component for integrating the optimization methods into service-oriented infrastructures. However, a systematic study on inference engines is still lacking. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of 25 open-source and commercial inference engines. We examine each inference engine in terms of ease-of-use, ease-of-deployment, general-purpose support, scalability, and suitability for throughput- and latency-aware computation. Furthermore, we explore the design goals of each inference engine by investigating the optimization techniques it supports. In addition, we assess the ecosystem maturity of open source inference engines and handle the performance and cost policy of commercial solutions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Side-channel attacks on memory (SCAM) exploit unintended data leaks from memory subsystems to infer sensitive information, posing significant threats to system security. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities in memory access patterns, cache behaviors, and other microarchitectural features to bypass traditional security measures. The purpose of this research is to examine SCAM, classify various attack techniques, and evaluate existing defense mechanisms. It guides researchers and industry professionals in improving memory security and mitigating emerging threats. We begin by identifying the major vulnerabilities in the memory system that are frequently exploited in SCAM, such as cache timing, speculative execution, \textit{Rowhammer}, and other sophisticated approaches. Next, we outline a comprehensive taxonomy that systematically classifies these attacks based on their types, target systems, attack vectors, and adversarial capabilities required to execute them. In addition, we review the current landscape of mitigation strategies, emphasizing their strengths and limitations. This work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of memory-based side-channel attacks with the goal of providing significant insights for researchers and practitioners to better understand, detect, and mitigate SCAM risks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Comparing the tradeoffs of CPU and GPU compute for memory-heavy algorithms is often challenging, due to the drastically different memory subsystems on host CPUs and discrete GPUs. The AMD MI300A is an exception, since it sports both CPU and GPU cores in a single package, all backed by the same type of HBM memory. In this paper we analyze the performance of Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA), a non-parametric method that tests whether two or more groups of objects are significantly different based on a categorical factor. This method is memory-bound and has been recently optimized for CPU cache locality. Our tests show that GPU cores on the MI300A prefer the brute force approach instead, significantly outperforming the CPU-based implementation. The significant benefit of Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) was also a pleasant surprise.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Delivering high-quality, secure 360{\deg} video content introduces unique challenges, primarily due to the high bitrates and interactive demands of immersive media. Traditional HTTPS-based methods, although widely used, face limitations in computational efficiency and scalability when securing these high-resolution streams. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel framework integrating Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) with selective encryption techniques tailored specifically for tiled 360{\deg} video streaming. Our approach employs selective encryption of frames at varying levels to reduce computational overhead while ensuring robust protection against unauthorized access.   Moreover, we explore viewport-adaptive encryption, dynamically encrypting more frames within tiles occupying larger portions of the viewer's field of view. This targeted method significantly enhances security in critical viewing areas without unnecessary overhead in peripheral regions. We deploy and evaluate our proposed approach using the CloudLab testbed, comparing its performance against traditional HTTPS streaming. Experimental results demonstrate that our ABE-based model achieves reduced computational load on intermediate caches, improves cache hit rates, and maintains comparable visual quality to HTTPS, as assessed by Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modeling ultra-long user behavior sequences is critical for capturing both long- and short-term preferences in industrial recommender systems. Existing solutions typically rely on two-stage retrieval or indirect modeling paradigms, incuring upstream-downstream inconsistency and computational inefficiency. In this paper, we present LONGER, a Long-sequence Optimized traNsformer for GPU-Efficient Recommenders. LONGER incorporates (i) a global token mechanism for stabilizing attention over long contexts, (ii) a token merge module with lightweight InnerTransformers and hybrid attention strategy to reduce quadratic complexity, and (iii) a series of engineering optimizations, including training with mixed-precision and activation recomputation, KV cache serving, and the fully synchronous model training and serving framework for unified GPU-based dense and sparse parameter updates. LONGER consistently outperforms strong baselines in both offline metrics and online A/B testing in both advertising and e-commerce services at ByteDance, validating its consistent effectiveness and industrial-level scaling laws. Currently, LONGER has been fully deployed at more than 10 influential scenarios at ByteDance, serving billion users.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Continual Federated Learning (CFL) allows distributed devices to collaboratively learn novel concepts from continuously shifting training data while avoiding knowledge forgetting of previously seen tasks. To tackle this challenge, most current CFL approaches rely on extensive rehearsal of previous data. Despite effectiveness, rehearsal comes at a cost to memory, and it may also violate data privacy. Considering these, we seek to apply regularization techniques to CFL by considering their cost-efficient properties that do not require sample caching or rehearsal. Specifically, we first apply traditional regularization techniques to CFL and observe that existing regularization techniques, especially synaptic intelligence, can achieve promising results under homogeneous data distribution but fail when the data is heterogeneous. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective regularization algorithm for CFL named FedSSI, which tailors the synaptic intelligence for the CFL with heterogeneous data settings. FedSSI can not only reduce computational overhead without rehearsal but also address the data heterogeneity issue. Extensive experiments show that FedSSI achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Digital twins (DT) have received significant attention due to their numerous benefits, such as real-time data analytics and cost reduction in production. DT serves as a fundamental component of many applications, encompassing smart manufacturing, intelligent vehicles, and smart cities. By using Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, DTs can efficiently facilitate decision-making and productivity by simulating the status and changes of a physical entity. To handle the massive amount of data brought by DTs, it is challenging to achieve low response latency for data fetching over existing IP-based networks. IP-based networks use host addresses for end-to-end communication, making data distribution between DTs inefficient. Thus, we propose to use DTs in a distributed manner over Named Data Networking (NDN) networks. NDN is data-centric where data is routed based on content names, dynamically adjusting paths to optimize latency. Popular data is cached in network nodes, reducing data transmission and network congestion. Since data is fetched by content names, users and mobile devices can move freely without IP address reassignment. By using in-network caching and adaptive routing, we reckon NDN is an ideal fit for Future G Networks in the context of Digital Twins. We compared DTs in edge scenarios with cloud scenarios over NDN and IP-based networks to validate our insights. Extensive simulation results show that using DT in the edge reduces response latency by 10.2x. This position paper represents an initial investigation into the gap in distributed DTs over NDN, serving as an early-stage study.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Photoionization plays a crucial role in achieving spatial numerical convergence and accurate quantitative predictions in SF6 streamer simulations, but accurate models for SF6 photoionization remains limited, motivating this paper. First, we develop a computational model for SF6 photoionization and provide the detailed modeling process. Then, we perform comparative studies against simplified approaches. The results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively captures the non-local effects of SF6 photoionization, enhancing both the spatial numerical convergence and the accuracy of the streamer structure. Finally, we perform comparative studies by artificially increasing the photoionization intensity through multiplying the photoionization source term Sph by a factor of 10 (10*Sph) relative to the baseline intensity. Regarding breakdown voltage prediction, 10*Sph leads to a significant underestimation of the breakdown voltage for positive streamers, introducing errors greater than 0.5 kV, while exerting a relatively small impact on negative streamers. Regarding streamer propagation dynamics, 10*Sph reduces the contraction at the positive streamer head and significantly lowers the local field by more than 700 Td, thereby slowing down its speed. In contrast, 10*Sph has little impact on the morphology of the negative streamers and slightly enhances the local field by less than 200 Td, thereby consistently accelerating its propagation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks, and their application in edge scenarios has attracted significant attention. However, sparse-activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, which are well suited for edge scenarios, have received relatively little attention due to their high memory demands. Offload-based methods have been proposed to address this challenge, but they face difficulties with expert prediction. Inaccurate expert predictions can result in prolonged inference delays. To promote the application of MoE models in edge scenarios, we propose Fate, an offloading system designed for MoE models to enable efficient inference in resource-constrained environments. The key insight behind Fate is that gate inputs from adjacent layers can be effectively used for expert prefetching, achieving high prediction accuracy without additional GPU overhead. Furthermore, Fate employs a shallow-favoring expert caching strategy that increases the expert hit rate to 99\%. Additionally, Fate integrates tailored quantization strategies for cache optimization and IO efficiency. Experimental results show that, compared to Load on Demand and Expert Activation Path-based method, Fate achieves up to 4.5x and 1.9x speedups in prefill speed and up to 4.1x and 2.2x speedups in decoding speed, respectively, while maintaining inference quality. Moreover, Fate's performance improvements are scalable across different memory budgets.

Through a series of controlled experiments, we measure the validator's throughput and resource efficiency as RAM availability ranges between 128 GB to 1,536 GB (1.5 TB). We discover that the validator performance degrades significantly below 256 GB, with transaction processing falling behind real-time block production. Additionally, we study the program cache behavior, identifying inefficiencies in program eviction and load latency. Our results provide practical guidance for hardware provisioning and suggest improvements to the Solana execution and caching strategy, reducing latency due to the program cache by 90%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Latency is a major concern for web rendering engines like those in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. These engines reduce latency by using an incremental layout algorithm to redraw the page when the user interacts with it. In such an algorithm, elements that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty, and only those elements are processed to draw the next frame, dramatically reducing latency. However, the standard incremental layout algorithm must search the page for dirty elements, accessing auxiliary elements in the process. These auxiliary elements add cache misses and stalled cycles, and are responsible for a sizable fraction of all layout latency. We introduce a new, faster incremental layout algorithm called Spineless Traversal. Spineless Traversal uses a cache-friendlier priority queue algorithm that avoids accessing auxiliary nodes and thus reduces cache traffic and stalls. This leads to dramatic speedups on the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, and animation. Moreover, thanks to numerous low-level optimizations, Spineless Traversal is competitive across the whole spectrum of incremental layout workloads. Spineless Traversal is faster than the standard approach on 83.0% of 2216 benchmarks, with a mean speedup of 1.80x concentrated in the most latency-critical interactions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present "Reciprocating Locks", a novel mutual exclusion locking algorithm, targeting cache-coherent shared memory (CC), that enjoys a number of desirable properties. The doorway arrival phase and the release operation both run in constant-time. Waiting threads use local spinning and only a single waiting element is required per thread, regardless of the number of locks a thread might hold at a given time. While our lock does not provide strict FIFO admission, it bounds bypass and has strong anti-starvation properties. The lock is compact, space efficient, and has been intentionally designed to be readily usable in real-world general purpose computing environments such as the linux kernel, pthreads, or C++. We show the lock exhibits high throughput under contention and low latency in the uncontended case. The performance of Reciprocating Locks is competitive with and often better than the best state-of-the-art scalable spin locks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The comic production industry requires reference-based line art colorization with high accuracy, efficiency, contextual consistency, and flexible control. A comic page often involves diverse characters, objects, and backgrounds, which complicates the coloring process. Despite advancements in diffusion models for image generation, their application in line art colorization remains limited, facing challenges related to handling extensive reference images, time-consuming inference, and flexible control. We investigate the necessity of extensive contextual image guidance on the quality of line art colorization. To address these challenges, we introduce Cobra, an efficient and versatile method that supports color hints and utilizes over 200 reference images while maintaining low latency. Central to Cobra is a Causal Sparse DiT architecture, which leverages specially designed positional encodings, causal sparse attention, and Key-Value Cache to effectively manage long-context references and ensure color identity consistency. Results demonstrate that Cobra achieves accurate line art colorization through extensive contextual reference, significantly enhancing inference speed and interactivity, thereby meeting critical industrial demands. We release our codes and models on our project page: https://zhuang2002.github.io/Cobra/.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The growing context lengths of large language models (LLMs) pose significant challenges for efficient inference, primarily due to GPU memory and bandwidth constraints. We present RetroInfer, a novel system that reconceptualizes the key-value (KV) cache as a vector storage system which exploits the inherent attention sparsity to accelerate long-context LLM inference. At its core is the wave index, an Attention-aWare VEctor index that enables efficient and accurate retrieval of critical tokens through techniques such as tripartite attention approximation, accuracy-bounded attention estimation, and segmented clustering. Complementing this is the wave buffer, which coordinates KV cache placement and overlaps computation and data transfer across GPU and CPU to sustain high throughput. Unlike prior sparsity-based methods that struggle with token selection and hardware coordination, RetroInfer delivers robust performance without compromising model accuracy. Experiments on long-context benchmarks show up to 4.5X speedup over full attention within GPU memory limits and up to 10.5X over sparse attention baselines when KV cache is extended to CPU memory, all while preserving full-attention-level accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) based on autoregressive, decoder-only Transformers generate text one token at a time, where a token represents a discrete unit of text. As each newly produced token is appended to the partial output sequence, the length grows and so does the memory and compute load, due to the expanding key-value caches, which store intermediate representations of all previously generated tokens in the multi-head attention (MHA) layer. As this iterative process steadily increases memory and compute demands, layer-based partitioning in resource-constrained edge environments often results in memory overload or high inference latency. To address this and reduce inference latency, we propose a resource-aware Transformer architecture partitioning algorithm, where the partitioning decision is updated at regular intervals during token generation. The approach is myopic in that it is based on instantaneous information about device resource availability and network link bandwidths. When first executed, the algorithm places blocks on devices, and in later executions, it migrates these blocks among devices so that the sum of migration delay and inference delay remains low. Our approach partitions the decoder at the attention head level, co-locating each attention head with its key-value cache and allowing dynamic migrations whenever resources become tight. By allocating different attention heads to different devices, we exploit parallel execution of attention heads and thus achieve substantial reductions in inference delays. Our experiments show that in small-scale settings (3-5 devices), the proposed method achieves within 15 to 20 percent of an exact optimal solver's latency, while in larger-scale tests it achieves notable improvements in inference speed and memory usage compared to state-of-the-art layer-based partitioning approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Python is a popular programming language known for its ease of learning and extensive libraries. However, concerns about performance and energy consumption have led to the development of compilers to enhance Python code efficiency. Despite the proven benefits of existing compilers on the efficiency of Python code, there is limited analysis comparing their performance and energy efficiency, particularly considering code characteristics and factors like CPU frequency and core count. Our study investigates how compilation impacts the performance and energy consumption of Python code, using seven benchmarks compiled with eight different tools: PyPy, Numba, Nuitka, Mypyc, Codon, Cython, Pyston-lite, and the experimental Python 3.13 version, compared to CPython. The benchmarks are single-threaded and executed on an NUC and a server, measuring energy usage, execution time, memory usage, and Last-Level Cache (LLC) miss rates at a fixed frequency and on a single core. The results show that compilation can significantly enhance execution time, energy and memory usage, with Codon, PyPy, and Numba achieving over 90\% speed and energy improvements. Nuitka optimizes memory usage consistently on both testbeds. The impact of compilation on LLC miss rate is not clear since it varies considerably across benchmarks for each compiler. Our study is important for researchers and practitioners focused on improving Python code performance and energy efficiency. We outline future research directions, such as exploring caching effects on energy usage. Our findings help practitioners choose the best compiler based on their efficiency benefits and accessibility.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, though highly effective for various machine learning tasks, face significant deployment challenges on memory-constrained devices. While GPUs offer fast inference, their limited memory compared to CPUs means not all experts can be stored on the GPU simultaneously, necessitating frequent, costly data transfers from CPU memory, often negating GPU speed advantages. To address this, we present DAOP, an on-device MoE inference engine to optimize parallel GPU-CPU execution. DAOP dynamically allocates experts between CPU and GPU based on per-sequence activation patterns, and selectively pre-calculates predicted experts on CPUs to minimize transfer latency. This approach enables efficient resource utilization across various expert cache ratios while maintaining model accuracy through a novel graceful degradation mechanism. Comprehensive evaluations across various datasets show that DAOP outperforms traditional expert caching and prefetching methods by up to 8.20x and offloading techniques by 1.35x while maintaining accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph In-Context Learning, with the ability to adapt pre-trained graph models to novel and diverse downstream graphs without updating any parameters, has gained much attention in the community. The key to graph in-context learning is to perform downstream graphs conditioned on chosen prompt examples. Existing methods randomly select subgraphs or edges as prompts, leading to noisy graph prompts and inferior model performance. Additionally, due to the gap between pre-training and testing graphs, when the number of classes in the testing graphs is much greater than that in the training, the in-context learning ability will also significantly deteriorate. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we develop a multi-stage adaptive prompt optimization method GraphPrompter, which optimizes the entire process of generating, selecting, and using graph prompts for better in-context learning capabilities. Firstly, Prompt Generator introduces a reconstruction layer to highlight the most informative edges and reduce irrelevant noise for graph prompt construction. Furthermore, in the selection stage, Prompt Selector employs the $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm and pre-trained selection layers to dynamically choose appropriate samples and minimize the influence of irrelevant prompts. Finally, we leverage a Prompt Augmenter with a cache replacement strategy to enhance the generalization capability of the pre-trained model on new datasets. Extensive experiments show that GraphPrompter effectively enhances the in-context learning ability of graph models. On average across all the settings, our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines by over 8%. Our code is released at https://github.com/karin0018/GraphPrompter.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Model (LLM) inference uses an autoregressive manner to generate one token at a time, which exhibits notably lower operational intensity compared to earlier Machine Learning (ML) models such as encoder-only transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks. At the same time, LLMs possess large parameter sizes and use key-value caches to store context information. Modern LLMs support context windows with up to 1 million tokens to generate versatile text, audio, and video content. A large key-value cache unique to each prompt requires a large memory capacity, limiting the inference batch size. Both low operational intensity and limited batch size necessitate a high memory bandwidth. However, contemporary hardware systems for ML model deployment, such as GPUs and TPUs, are primarily optimized for compute throughput. This mismatch challenges the efficient deployment of advanced LLMs and makes users pay for expensive compute resources that are poorly utilized for the memory-bound LLM inference tasks.   We propose CENT, a CXL-ENabled GPU-Free sysTem for LLM inference, which harnesses CXL memory expansion capabilities to accommodate substantial LLM sizes, and utilizes near-bank processing units to deliver high memory bandwidth, eliminating the need for expensive GPUs. CENT exploits a scalable CXL network to support peer-to-peer and collective communication primitives across CXL devices. We implement various parallelism strategies to distribute LLMs across these devices. Compared to GPU baselines with maximum supported batch sizes and similar average power, CENT achieves 2.3$\times$ higher throughput and consumes 2.9$\times$ less energy. CENT enhances the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), generating 5.2$\times$ more tokens per dollar than GPUs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Caches are fundamental to latency-sensitive systems like Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). However, the delayed hit phenomenon where multiple requests for an object occur during its fetch from the remote server after a miss significantly inflates user-perceived latency. While recent algorithms acknowledge delayed hits by estimating the resulting aggregate delay, they predominantly focus on its mean value. We identify and demonstrate that such approaches are insufficient, as the real aggregate delay frequently exhibits substantial variance in the true production system, leading to suboptimal latency performance when ignored. Thus, we propose VA-CDH, a variance-aware method to optimize latency for caching with delayed hits. It employs a novel ranking function that explicitly incorporates both the empirically estimated mean and standard deviation of aggregate delay, allowing caching decisions to account for its variation. We derive the analytical distribution of aggregate delay under Poisson arrivals as a theoretical contribution, offering more statistical insight beyond the mean value. Through the simulations conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that VA-CDH reduces the total latency by 1%-6% approximately compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Coded caching leverages the differences in user cache memories to achieve gains that scale with the total cache size, alleviating network congestion due to high-quality content requests. Additionally, distributing transmitters over a wide area can mitigate the adverse effects of path loss. In this work, we consider a partially connected network where the channel between distributed transmitters (helpers) and users is modeled as a distributed multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) Gaussian broadcast channel. We propose a novel delivery scheme consisting of two phases: partitioning and transmission. In the partitioning phase, users with identical cache profiles are partitioned into the minimum number of sets, such that users within each set can successfully decode their desired message from a joint transmission enabled by MIMO precoding. To optimally partition the users, we employ the branch and bound method. In the transmission phase, each partition is treated as a single entity, and codewords are multicast to partitions with distinct cache profiles. The proposed delivery scheme is applicable to any partially connected network, and while the partitioning is optimal, the overall delivery scheme, including transmission, is heuristic. Interestingly, simulation results show that its performance closely approximates that of the fully connected optimal solution.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) excel in generative tasks but face practical deployment challenges due to high inference costs. Feature caching, which stores and retrieves redundant computations, offers the potential for acceleration. Existing learning-based caching, though adaptive, overlooks the impact of the prior timestep. It also suffers from misaligned objectives--aligned predicted noise vs. high-quality images--between training and inference. These two discrepancies compromise both performance and efficiency. To this end, we harmonize training and inference with a novel learning-based caching framework dubbed HarmoniCa. It first incorporates Step-Wise Denoising Training (SDT) to ensure the continuity of the denoising process, where prior steps can be leveraged. In addition, an Image Error Proxy-Guided Objective (IEPO) is applied to balance image quality against cache utilization through an efficient proxy to approximate the image error. Extensive experiments across $8$ models, $4$ samplers, and resolutions from $256\times256$ to $2K$ demonstrate superior performance and speedup of our framework. For instance, it achieves over $40\%$ latency reduction (i.e., $2.07\times$ theoretical speedup) and improved performance on PixArt-$\alpha$. Remarkably, our image-free approach reduces training time by $25\%$ compared with the previous method. Our code is available at https://github.com/ModelTC/HarmoniCa.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern embedding models capture both semantic and syntactic structures of queries, often mapping different queries to similar regions in vector space. This results in non-uniform cluster access patterns in disk-based vector search systems, particularly in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. While existing approaches optimize individual queries, they overlook the impact of cluster access patterns, failing to account for the locality effects of queries that access similar clusters. This oversight reduces cache efficiency and increases search latency due to excessive disk I/O. To address this, we introduce CaGR-RAG, a context-aware query grouping mechanism that organizes queries based on shared cluster access patterns. Additionally, it incorporates opportunistic cluster prefetching to minimize cache misses during transitions between query groups, further optimizing retrieval performance. Experimental results show that CaGR-RAG reduces 99th percentile tail latency by up to 51.55% while consistently maintaining a higher cache hit ratio than the baseline.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A critical element in the realization of large liquid and gas time projection chambers (TPCs) is the delivery and distribution of high voltages into and around the detector. Such experiments require of order tens of kilovolts to enable electron drift over meter-scale distances. This paper describes the design and operation of the cathode feedthrough and high voltage distribution through the field cage of the NEXT-100 experiment, an underground TPC that will search for neutrinoless double beta decay $0\nu\beta\beta$. The feedthrough has been demonstrated to hold pressures up to 20~bar and sustain voltages as high as -65~kV, and the TPC is operating stably at its design high voltages. The system has been realized within the constraints of a stringent radiopurity budget and is now being used to execute a suite of sensitive double beta decay analyses.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This dissertation revisits the topic of programmable cache coherence engines in the context of modern shared-memory multicore processors. First, the open-source BedRock cache coherence protocol is described. BedRock employs the canonical MOESIF coherence states and reduces implementation burden by eliminating transient coherence states from the protocol. The protocol's design complexity, concurrency, and verification effort are analyzed and compared to a canonical directory-based invalidate coherence protocol. Second, the architecture and microarchitecture of three separate cache coherence directories implementing the BedRock protocol within the BlackParrot 64-bit RISC-V multicore processor, collectively called BlackParrot-BedRock (BP-BedRock), are described. A fixed-function coherence directory engine implementation provides a baseline design for performance and area comparisons. A microcode-programmable coherence directory implementation demonstrates the feasibility of implementing a programmable coherence engine capable of maintaining sufficient protocol processing performance. A hybrid fixed-function and programmable coherence directory blends the protocol processing performance of the fixed-function design with the programmable flexibility of the microcode-programmable design. Collectively, the BedRock coherence protocol and its three BP-BedRock implementations demonstrate the feasibility and challenges of including programmable logic within the coherence system of modern shared-memory multicore processors, paving the way for future research into the application- and system-level benefits of programmable coherence engines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents an open-source kernel-level heterogeneous memory characterization framework (MemScope) for embedded systems that enables users to understand and precisely characterize the temporal behavior of all available memory modules under configurable contention stress scenarios. Since kernel-level provides a high degree of control over allocation, cache maintenance, $CPUs$, interrupts, and I/O device activity, seeking the most accurate way to benchmark heterogeneous memory subsystems, would be achieved by implementing it in the kernel. This gives us the privilege to directly map pieces of contiguous physical memory and instantiate allocators, allowing us to finely control cores to create and eliminate interference. Additionally, we can minimize noise and interruptions, guaranteeing more consistent and precise results compared to equivalent user-space solutions. Running our Framework on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ ZCU102 CPU_FPGA platform, demonstrates its capability to precisely benchmark bandwidth and latency across various memory types, including PL-side DRAM and BRAM, in a multi-core system.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Side-channel attacks on shared hardware resources increasingly threaten confidentiality, especially with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce Spill The Beans, a novel application of cache side-channels to leak tokens generated by an LLM. By co-locating an attack process on the same hardware as the victim model, we flush and reload embedding vectors from the embedding layer, where each token corresponds to a unique embedding vector. When accessed during token generation, it results in a cache hit detectable by our attack on shared lower-level caches.   A significant challenge is the massive size of LLMs, which, by nature of their compute intensive operation, quickly evicts embedding vectors from the cache. We address this by balancing the number of tokens monitored against the amount of information leaked. Monitoring more tokens increases potential vocabulary leakage but raises the chance of missing cache hits due to eviction; monitoring fewer tokens improves detection reliability but limits vocabulary coverage.   Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the feasibility of leaking tokens from LLMs via cache side-channels. Our findings reveal a new vulnerability in LLM deployments, highlighting that even sophisticated models are susceptible to traditional side-channel attacks. We discuss the implications for privacy and security in LLM-serving infrastructures and suggest considerations for mitigating such threats. For proof of concept we consider two concrete attack scenarios: Our experiments show that an attacker can recover as much as 80%-90% of a high entropy API key with single shot monitoring. As for English text we can reach a 40% recovery rate with a single shot. We should note that the rate highly depends on the monitored token set and these rates can be improved by targeting more specialized output domains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Fusion-based quantum computing with dual-rail qubits is a leading candidate for scalable quantum computing using linear optics. This paradigm requires single photons which are entangled into small resource states before being fed into a fusion network. The most common sources for single optical photons and for small entangled states are probabilistic and heralded. The realization of a single reliable deterministic source requires many redundant probabilistic sources and a complex optical network for rerouting and retiming probabilistic outputs. In this work, we show how optomechanics enables reliable production of resources for photonic quantum computing without the redundancy of the all-optical approach. This is achieved by using acoustic modes as caches of quantum resources, ranging from single-particle states to small entangled states, with on-demand read-out. The advantages of acoustic modes as optical quantum memories, compared to other technologies, include their intrinsically long lifetimes and that they are solid state, highly tailorable, and insensitive to electromagnetic noise. We show how the resource states can be prepared directly in the acoustic modes using optical controls. This is still probabilistic and heralded, as in the all-optical approach, but the acoustic modes act as a quantum memory which is integrated into the production of the states. The quantum states may be deterministically transferred from acoustic modes to optical modes, on demand, with another optical drive.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Extending the context window in large language models (LLMs) is essential for applications involving long-form content generation. However, the linear increase in key-value (KV) cache memory requirements and the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to sequence length present significant challenges during fine-tuning and inference. Existing methods suffer from performance degradation when extending to longer contexts. In this work, we introduce a novel context extension method that optimizes both fine-tuning and inference efficiency. Our method exploits a key observation: in the frequency domain, the energy distribution of the KV cache is primarily concentrated in low-frequency components. By filtering out the high-frequency components, the KV cache can be effectively compressed with minimal information loss. Building on this insight, we propose an efficient compression technique, FreqKV, that iteratively compresses the increasing KV cache to a fixed size in the frequency domain, applicable to both fine-tuning and inference. FreqKV introduces no additional parameters or architectural modifications. With minimal fine-tuning, LLMs can learn to leverage the limited cache that is compressed in the frequency domain and extend the context window efficiently. Experiments on various long context language modeling and understanding tasks demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed method.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in large language models highlighted the excessive quadratic cost of self-attention. Despite the significant research efforts, subquadratic attention methods still suffer from inferior performance in practice. We hypothesize that dynamic, learned content-based sparsity can lead to more efficient attention mechanisms. We present Mixture of Sparse Attention (MoSA), a novel approach inspired by Mixture of Experts (MoE) with expert choice routing. MoSA dynamically selects tokens for each attention head, allowing arbitrary sparse attention patterns. By selecting $k$ tokens from a sequence of length $T$, MoSA reduces the computational complexity of each attention head from $O(T^2)$ to $O(k^2 + T)$. This enables using more heads within the same computational budget, allowing higher specialization. We show that among the tested sparse attention variants, MoSA is the only one that can outperform the dense baseline, sometimes with up to 27% better perplexity for an identical compute budget. MoSA can also reduce the resource usage compared to dense self-attention. Despite using torch implementation without an optimized kernel, perplexity-matched MoSA models are simultaneously faster in wall-clock time, require less memory for training, and drastically reduce the size of the KV-cache compared to the dense transformer baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantization can accelerate large language model (LLM) inference. Going beyond INT8 quantization, the research community is actively exploring even lower precision, such as INT4. Nonetheless, state-of-the-art INT4 quantization techniques only accelerate low-batch, edge LLM inference, failing to deliver performance gains in large-batch, cloud-based LLM serving. We uncover a critical issue: existing INT4 quantization methods suffer from significant runtime overhead (20-90%) when dequantizing either weights or partial sums on GPUs. To address this challenge, we introduce QoQ, a W4A8KV4 quantization algorithm with 4-bit weight, 8-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache. QoQ stands for quattuor-octo-quattuor, which represents 4-8-4 in Latin. QoQ is implemented by the QServe inference library that achieves measured speedup. The key insight driving QServe is that the efficiency of LLM serving on GPUs is critically influenced by operations on low-throughput CUDA cores. Building upon this insight, in QoQ algorithm, we introduce progressive quantization that can allow low dequantization overhead in W4A8 GEMM. Additionally, we develop SmoothAttention to effectively mitigate the accuracy degradation incurred by 4-bit KV quantization. In the QServe system, we perform compute-aware weight reordering and take advantage of register-level parallelism to reduce dequantization latency. We also make fused attention memory-bound, harnessing the performance gain brought by KV4 quantization. As a result, QServe improves the maximum achievable serving throughput of Llama-3-8B by 1.2x on A100, 1.4x on L40S; and Qwen1.5-72B by 2.4x on A100, 3.5x on L40S, compared to TensorRT-LLM. Remarkably, QServe on L40S GPU can achieve even higher throughput than TensorRT-LLM on A100. Thus, QServe effectively reduces the dollar cost of LLM serving by 3x.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients, enhancing privacy by keeping data local. Yet conventional FL, relying on frequent parameter-sharing, suffers from high communication overhead and limited model heterogeneity. Distillation-based FL approaches address these issues by sharing predictions (soft-labels) instead, but they often involve redundant transmissions across communication rounds, reducing efficiency. We propose SCARLET, a novel framework integrating synchronized soft-label caching and an enhanced Entropy Reduction Aggregation (Enhanced ERA) mechanism. SCARLET minimizes redundant communication by reusing cached soft-labels, achieving up to 50% reduction in communication costs compared to existing methods while maintaining accuracy. Enhanced ERA can be tuned to adapt to non-IID data variations, ensuring robust aggregation and performance in diverse client scenarios. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SCARLET consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation-based FL methods in terms of accuracy and communication efficiency. The implementation of SCARLET is publicly available at https://github.com/kitsuyaazuma/SCARLET.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Transformer (DiT) is a crucial method for content generation. However, it needs a lot of time to sample. Many studies have attempted to use caching to reduce the time consumption of sampling. Existing caching methods accelerate generation by reusing DiT features from the previous time step and skipping calculations in the next, but they tend to locate and cache low-error modules without focusing on reducing caching-induced errors, resulting in a sharp decline in generated content quality when increasing caching intensity. To solve this problem, we propose the Error-Optimized Cache (EOC). This method introduces three key improvements: (1) Prior knowledge extraction: Extract and process the caching differences; (2) A judgment method for cache optimization: Determine whether certain caching steps need to be optimized; (3) Cache optimization: reduce caching errors. Experiments show that this algorithm significantly reduces the error accumulation caused by caching, especially excessive caching. On the ImageNet dataset, without substantially increasing the computational load, this method improves the FID of the generated images when the rule-based model FORA has a caching level of 75%, 50%, and 25%, and the training-based model Learning-to-cache has a caching level of 22%. Specifically, the FID values change from 30.454 to 21.690 (28.8%), from 6.857 to 5.821 (15.1%), from 3.870 to 3.692 (4.6%), and from 3.539 to 3.451 (2.5%) respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Altermagnets, combining zero net magnetization with intrinsic spin splitting, demonstrate unique quantum phenomena crucial for spintronic applications. KV$_2$Se$_2$O is proven to be a d-wave altermagnet with phase transition from a checkerboard-type (C-type) antiferromagnetic (AFM) state to a spin density wave (SDW) state as the temperature decreases. After phase transition, the apparent paradox emerges where angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) reveals negligible Fermi surface modifications, while physical property measurement system (PPMS) measurements uncover substantial changes in transport properties. Our study explores the microscopic mechanisms governing phase-dependent transport properties of KV$_2$Se$_2$O base on first-principles calculations. The spin canting driven by periodic spin modulation in the SDW phase reduces the magnetic symmetry of KV$_2$Se$_2$O. The resultant band degeneracy lifting and Fermi surface reconstruction induce the ``magnetic breakdown" phenomenon, which alters carrier trajectories, modifies carrier concentration, strengthens electron-hole compensation, and ultimately accounts for the contrasting magnetic-field-dependent Hall resistivity relative to the C-type AFM state. Our work proposes an innovative method for identifying the electronic structure evolution across phase transitions from transport signatures, providing a novel paradigm for altermagnets research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mobile video analysis systems often encounter various deploying environments, where environment shifts present greater demands for responsiveness in adaptations of deployed "expert DNN models". Existing model adaptation frameworks primarily operate in a cloud-centric way, exhibiting degraded performance during adaptation and delayed reactions to environment shifts. Instead, this paper proposes MOCHA, a novel framework optimizing the responsiveness of continuous model adaptation through hierarchical collaborations between mobile and cloud resources. Specifically, MOCHA (1) reduces adaptation response delays by performing on-device model reuse and fast fine-tuning before requesting cloud model retrieval and end-to-end retraining; (2) accelerates history expert model retrieval by organizing them into a structured taxonomy utilizing domain semantics analyzed by a cloud foundation model as indices; (3) enables efficient local model reuse by maintaining onboard expert model caches for frequent scenes, which proactively prefetch model weights from the cloud model database. Extensive evaluations with real-world videos on three DNN tasks show MOCHA improves the model accuracy during adaptation by up to 6.8% while saving the response delay and retraining time by up to 35.5x and 3.0x respectively.

Built on top of the Lean FRO's LeanREPL, it combines server-side parallelization by managing multiple Lean REPL processes in parallel, with an LRU caching strategy that reuses Lean imports across multiple requests. These features help reduce initialization overhead and allow large-scale batch processing of Lean code. The client-side interface allows users to submit batches of proofs and receive Lean feedback, including extracted tactics and tactic states via infotree processing. These features enable a high-performance, scalable workflow for both interaction and extraction of proofs, tactics, and tactic states. We open source our implementation on GitHub.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are identified as being susceptible to indirect prompt injection attack, where the model undesirably deviates from user-provided instructions by executing tasks injected in the prompt context. This vulnerability stems from LLMs' inability to distinguish between data and instructions within a prompt. In this paper, we propose CachePrune that defends against this attack by identifying and pruning task-triggering neurons from the KV cache of the input prompt context. By pruning such neurons, we encourage the LLM to treat the text spans of input prompt context as only pure data, instead of any indicator of instruction following. These neurons are identified via feature attribution with a loss function induced from an upperbound of the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) objective. We show that such a loss function enables effective feature attribution with only a few samples. We further improve on the quality of feature attribution, by exploiting an observed triggering effect in instruction following. Our approach does not impose any formatting on the original prompt or introduce extra test-time LLM calls. Experiments show that CachePrune significantly reduces attack success rates without compromising the response quality. Note: This paper aims to defend against indirect prompt injection attacks, with the goal of developing more secure and robust AI systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents a new achievable scheme for the K-user Linear Computation Broadcast Channel (K-LCBC). A K-LCBC comprises data stored on a server and K users, each aiming to retrieve a desired linear function of the data by leveraging their prior locally available side information in the form of another linear function of the data. The proposed scheme is based on a subspace decomposition derived from representable polymatroid spaces. This decomposition enables the server to effectively design multicast messages that simultaneously benefit multiple users and allow users to eliminate interference using their available side information. This work extends existing results for the 3-LCBC by introducing a linear programming framework to optimize multicast opportunities across an arbitrary number of users. The proposed approach can be used to derive achievable scheme for the K-user coded caching problem with linear coded placement and scalar linear function retrieval, which was our original motivation to investigate the K-LCBC.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly customized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a multiturn setting is highly inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the entire turn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation can begin. To address this problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), which modifies the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the tokens in the sequence \emph{after} the aLoRA is invoked. This change crucially allows aLoRA to accept the base model's KV cache of the input string, meaning that aLoRA can be instantly activated whenever needed in a chain without recomputing the cache. This enables building what we call \emph{intrinsics}, i.e. highly specialized models invoked to perform well-defined operations on portions of an input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the base model by default. We use aLoRA to train a set of intrinsics models, demonstrating competitive accuracy with standard LoRA while achieving significant inference benefits.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Low-latency applications like AR/VR and online gaming need fast, stable connections. New technologies such as V2X, LEO satellites, and 6G bring unique challenges in mobility management. Traditional solutions based on centralized or distributed anchors often fall short in supporting rapid mobility due to inefficient routing, low versatility, and insufficient multi-access support. In this paper, we design a new end-to-end system for tracking multi-connected mobile devices at scale and optimizing performance for latency-sensitive, highly dynamic applications. Our system, based on the locator/ID separation principle, extends to multi-access networks without requiring specialized routers or caching. Using a novel tree embedding-based overlay, we enable fast session setup while allowing endpoints to directly handle mobility between them. Evaluation with real network data shows our solution cuts connection latency to 7.42% inflation over the shortest path, compared to LISP's 359\% due to cache misses. It also significantly reduces location update overhead and disruption time during mobility.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Coded caching scheme originally proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MN) considered a broadcast network consisting of a single server connected to a set of users each having a cache memory. Motivated by practical scenarios, Karamchandani \textit{et al.} in [16] proposed a coded caching scheme for a two-layer hierarchical network consisting of a single server connected to multiple mirror sites and each mirror site connected to a distinct set of users, in which both mirror sites and users having cache memories. Low subpacketization level coded caching schemes are desirable for practical implementations. Placement delivery array (PDA) was proposed as a tool to design coded caching schemes with reduced subpacketization level by Yan \textit{et al.} in [4]. Schemes with reduced subpacketization levels are studied extensively in the literature for single-layer networks. Kong \textit{et al.} in [17] proposed a structure called hierarchical placement delivery arrays (HPDA), which characterizes a hierarchical coded caching system and also proposed a class of HPDAs that gives low subpacketization level schemes by using two PDAs. Low subpacketization level hierarchical schemes using combinatorial $t$-designs is proposed in [20]. Apart from that there is no other existing work that discusses the subpacketization problem in a hierarchical network. This paper proposes a class of HPDA construction that gives low subpacketization level hierarchical coded caching schemes, by first constructing a new class of PDAs. Compared with the existing schemes, in cases where the system parameters and subpacketization level are the same, the proposed hierarchical scheme has a better coding delay. Further, the new class of PDAs constructed either subsumes several known PDA constructions or achieves better transmission load for the same system parameters.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing density of transistors in Integrated Circuits (ICs) has enabled the development of highly integrated Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) and, more recently, Multiprocessor Systems-on-Chip (MPSoCs). To address scalability challenges in communication and memory performance, three-dimensional (3D) Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures have emerged, offering improvements in communication latency and throughput. However, memory system efficiency remains a critical bottleneck in NoC-based designs. This work proposes the design and experimental exploration of 3D MPSoCs with on-chip cache support by employing distinct communication infrastructures for inter-processor and memory interactions. Specifically, packet-based NoCs are adopted for inter-processor communication, while a crossbar-based infrastructure supports a cache coherence hierarchy for memory access. A two-layer system architecture is introduced, combining a Uniform Memory Access (UMA) model within clusters and a No Remote Memory Access (NORMA) model between clusters, aiming to balance scalability and coherence requirements. Emerging memory technologies such as PCRAM and MRAM are explored to optimize performance, energy consumption, and area usage. Experimental evaluations are conducted using the Gem5 simulator, targeting a model based on the ARM Versatile Express platform. The outcomes of this study aim to enhance MPSoC scalability while meeting the stringent demands of memory-centric applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vector quantization, a problem rooted in Shannon's source coding theory, aims to quantize high-dimensional Euclidean vectors while minimizing distortion in their geometric structure. We propose TurboQuant to address both mean-squared error (MSE) and inner product distortion, overcoming limitations of existing methods that fail to achieve optimal distortion rates. Our data-oblivious algorithms, suitable for online applications, achieve near-optimal distortion rates (within a small constant factor) across all bit-widths and dimensions. TurboQuant achieves this by randomly rotating input vectors, inducing a concentrated Beta distribution on coordinates, and leveraging the near-independence property of distinct coordinates in high dimensions to simply apply optimal scalar quantizers per each coordinate. Recognizing that MSE-optimal quantizers introduce bias in inner product estimation, we propose a two-stage approach: applying an MSE quantizer followed by a 1-bit Quantized JL (QJL) transform on the residual, resulting in an unbiased inner product quantizer. We also provide a formal proof of the information-theoretic lower bounds on best achievable distortion rate by any vector quantizer, demonstrating that TurboQuant closely matches these bounds, differing only by a small constant ($\approx 2.7$) factor. Experimental results validate our theoretical findings, showing that for KV cache quantization, we achieve absolute quality neutrality with 3.5 bits per channel and marginal quality degradation with 2.5 bits per channel. Furthermore, in nearest neighbor search tasks, our method outperforms existing product quantization techniques in recall while reducing indexing time to virtually zero.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Existing large language model (LLM) serving systems fall into two categories: 1) a unified system where prefill phase and decode phase are co-located on the same GPU, sharing the unified computational resource and storage, and 2) a disaggregated system where the two phases are disaggregated to different GPUs. The design of the disaggregated system addresses the latency interference and sophisticated scheduling issues in the unified system but leads to storage challenges including 1) replicated weights for both phases that prevent flexible deployment, 2) KV cache transfer overhead between the two phases, 3) storage imbalance that causes substantial wasted space of the GPU capacity, and 4) suboptimal resource adjustment arising from the difficulties in migrating KV cache. Such storage inefficiency delivers poor serving performance under high request rates.   In this paper, we identify that the advantage of the disaggregated system lies in the disaggregated computation, i.e., partitioning the computational resource to enable the asynchronous computation of two phases. Thus, we propose a novel LLM serving system, semi-PD, characterized by disaggregated computation and unified storage. In semi-PD, we introduce a computation resource controller to achieve disaggregated computation at the streaming multi-processor (SM) level, and a unified memory manager to manage the asynchronous memory access from both phases. semi-PD has a low-overhead resource adjustment mechanism between the two phases, and a service-level objective (SLO) aware dynamic partitioning algorithm to optimize the SLO attainment. Compared to state-of-the-art systems, semi-PD maintains lower latency at higher request rates, reducing the average end-to-end latency per request by 1.27-2.58x on DeepSeek series models, and serves 1.55-1.72x more requests adhering to latency constraints on Llama series models.

We first propose three new schemes for the three cases of cache size $M=1$, $N=2$ files and arbitrary $K$ users, delivery rate $ R=1$, arbitrary $N$ files and $K$ users, and the general case for arbitrary $N$ files and $K$ users, respectively. Then we derive converse results by characterizing new properties of secure coded caching schemes. As a result, we characterize the two end-points of the optimal memory-rate tradeoff curve for arbitrary number of users and files. Furthermore, for the case of $N=2$ files and arbitrary number of users, we also characterize a segment of the optimal memory-rate tradeoff curve, where the cache size is relatively small.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The need to develop a general framework for architecture analysis is becoming increasingly important, given the expanding design space of sequence models. To this end, we draw insights from classical signal processing and control theory, to develop a quantitative measure of \textit{memory utilization}: the internal mechanisms through which a model stores past information to produce future outputs. This metric, which we call \textbf{\textit{effective state-size}} (ESS), is tailored to the fundamental class of systems with \textit{input-invariant} and \textit{input-varying linear operators}, encompassing a variety of computational units such as variants of attention, convolutions, and recurrences. Unlike prior work on memory utilization, which either relies on raw operator visualizations (e.g. attention maps), or simply the total \textit{memory capacity} (i.e. cache size) of a model, our metrics provide highly interpretable and actionable measurements. In particular, we show how ESS can be leveraged to improve initialization strategies, inform novel regularizers and advance the performance-efficiency frontier through model distillation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the effect of context delimiters (such as end-of-speech tokens) on ESS highlights cross-architectural differences in how large language models utilize their available memory to recall information. Overall, we find that ESS provides valuable insights into the dynamics that dictate memory utilization, enabling the design of more efficient and effective sequence models.

However, similar progress in vision mechanistic interpretability has been hindered by the lack of accessible frameworks and pre-trained weights. We present Prisma (Access the codebase here: https://github.com/Prisma-Multimodal/ViT-Prisma), an open-source framework designed to accelerate vision mechanistic interpretability research, providing a unified toolkit for accessing 75+ vision and video transformers; support for sparse autoencoder (SAE), transcoder, and crosscoder training; a suite of 80+ pre-trained SAE weights; activation caching, circuit analysis tools, and visualization tools; and educational resources. Our analysis reveals surprising findings, including that effective vision SAEs can exhibit substantially lower sparsity patterns than language SAEs, and that in some instances, SAE reconstructions can decrease model loss. Prisma enables new research directions for understanding vision model internals while lowering barriers to entry in this emerging field.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Machine learning has enabled the use of implicit neural representations (INRs) to efficiently compress and reconstruct massive scientific datasets. However, despite advances in fast INR rendering algorithms, INR-based rendering remains computationally expensive, as computing data values from an INR is significantly slower than reading them from GPU memory. This bottleneck currently restricts interactive INR visualization to professional workstations. To address this challenge, we introduce an INR rendering framework accelerated by a scalable, multi-resolution GPU cache capable of efficiently representing tera-scale datasets. By minimizing redundant data queries and prioritizing novel volume regions, our method reduces the number of INR computations per frame, achieving an average 5x speedup over the state-of-the-art INR rendering method while still maintaining high visualization quality. Coupled with existing hardware-accelerated INR compressors, our framework enables scientists to generate and compress massive datasets in situ on high-performance computing platforms and then interactively explore them on consumer-grade hardware post hoc.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper proposes a general solution to enable point cloud recognition models to handle distribution shifts at test time. Unlike prior methods, which rely heavily on training data (often inaccessible during online inference) and are limited to recognizing a fixed set of point cloud classes predefined during training, we explore a more practical and challenging scenario: adapting the model solely based on online test data to recognize both previously seen classes and novel, unseen classes at test time. To this end, we develop \textbf{Point-Cache}, a hierarchical cache model that captures essential clues of online test samples, particularly focusing on the global structure of point clouds and their local-part details. Point-Cache, which serves as a rich 3D knowledge base, is dynamically managed to prioritize the inclusion of high-quality samples. Designed as a plug-and-play module, our method can be flexibly integrated into large multimodal 3D models to support open-vocabulary point cloud recognition. Notably, our solution operates with efficiency comparable to zero-shot inference, as it is entirely training-free. Point-Cache demonstrates substantial gains across 8 challenging benchmarks and 4 representative large 3D models, highlighting its effectiveness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become essential for computationally intensive applications. However, emerging workloads such as recommender systems, graph analytics, and data analytics often involve processing data exceeding GPU on-chip memory capacity. To mitigate this issue, existing solutions enable GPUs to use CPU DRAM or SSDs as external memory. Among them, the GPU-centric approach lets GPU threads directly initiate NVMe requests, eliminating CPU intervention overhead over traditional methods. However, the SOTA GPU-centric approach adopts a synchronous IO model, and threads must tolerate the long latency in communication before starting any tasks.   In this work, we propose AGILE, a lightweight and efficient asynchronous library allowing GPU threads to access SSDs asynchronously while eliminating deadlock risks. AGILE also integrates a flexible software cache using GPU High-Bandwidth Mamory (HBM). We demonstrate that the asynchronous GPU-centric IO achieves up to 1.88$\times$ improvement in workloads with different computation-to-communication (CTC) ratios. We also compare AGILE with the SOTA work BaM on Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRM) with various settings, and the results show that AGILE achieves 1.75$\times$ performance improvement due to its efficient design and the overlapping strategy enabled by an asynchronous IO model. We further evaluate AGILE's API overhead on graph applications, and the results demonstrate AGILE reduces software cache overhead by up to 3.12$\times$ and overhead in NVMe IO requests by up to 2.85$\times$. Compared with BaM, AGILE consumes fewer registers and exhibits up to 1.32$\times$ reduction in the usage of registers.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Real-time open-vocabulary scene understanding is essential for efficient 3D perception in applications such as vision-language navigation, embodied intelligence, and augmented reality. However, existing methods suffer from imprecise instance segmentation, static semantic updates, and limited handling of complex queries. To address these issues, we present OpenFusion++, a TSDF-based real-time 3D semantic-geometric reconstruction system. Our approach refines 3D point clouds by fusing confidence maps from foundational models, dynamically updates global semantic labels via an adaptive cache based on instance area, and employs a dual-path encoding framework that integrates object attributes with environmental context for precise query responses. Experiments on the ICL, Replica, ScanNet, and ScanNet++ datasets demonstrate that OpenFusion++ significantly outperforms the baseline in both semantic accuracy and query responsiveness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The WuNeng architecture introduces a novel approach to enhancing the expressivity and power of large language models by integrating recurrent neural network (RNN)-based RWKV-7 with advanced attention mechanisms, prioritizing heightened contextual coherence over reducing KV cache size. Building upon the hybrid-head concept from Hymba, WuNeng augments standard multi-head attention with additional RWKV-7 state-driven heads, rather than replacing existing heads, to enrich the model's representational capacity. A cross-head interaction technique fosters dynamic synergy among standard, state-driven, and newly introduced middle heads, leveraging concatenation, additive modulation, and gated fusion for robust information integration. Furthermore, a multi-token state processing mechanism harnesses the continuous RWKV-7 state to capture intricate, sequence-wide dependencies, significantly boosting expressivity. Remarkably, these enhancements are achieved with minimal additional parameters, ensuring efficiency while empowering the model to excel in complex reasoning and sequence generation tasks. WuNeng sets a new standard for balancing expressivity and computational efficiency in modern neural architectures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Operating Systems enforce logical isolation using abstractions such as processes, containers, and isolation technologies to protect a system from malicious or buggy code. In this paper, we show new types of side channels through the file system that break this logical isolation. The file system plays a critical role in the operating system, managing all I/O activities between the application layer and the physical storage device. We observe that the file system implementation is shared, leading to timing leakage when using common I/O system calls. Specifically, we found that modern operating systems take advantage of any flush operation (which saves cached blocks in memory to the SSD or disk) to flush all of the I/O buffers, even those used by other isolation domains. Thus, by measuring the delay of syncfs, the attacker can infer the I/O behavior of victim programs. We then demonstrate a syncfs covert channel attack on multiple file systems, including both Linux native file systems and the Windows file system, achieving a maximum bandwidth of 5 Kbps with an error rate of 0.15% on Linux and 7.6 Kbps with an error rate of 1.9% on Windows. In addition, we construct three side-channel attacks targeting both Linux and Android devices. On Linux devices, we implement a website fingerprinting attack and a video fingerprinting attack by tracking the write patterns of temporary buffering files. On Android devices, we design an application fingerprinting attack that leaks application write patterns during boot-up. The attacks achieve over 90% F1 score, precision, and recall. Finally, we demonstrate that these attacks can be exploited across containers implementing a container detection technique and a cross-container covert channel attack.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the widespread deployment of long-context large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing demand for efficient support of high-throughput inference. However, as the key-value (KV) cache expands with the sequence length, the increasing memory footprint and the need to access it for each token generation both result in low throughput when serving long-context LLMs. While various dynamic sparse attention methods have been proposed to speed up inference while maintaining generation quality, they either fail to sufficiently reduce GPU memory consumption or introduce significant decoding latency by offloading the KV cache to the CPU. We present ShadowKV, a high-throughput long-context LLM inference system that stores the low-rank key cache and offloads the value cache to reduce the memory footprint for larger batch sizes and longer sequences. To minimize decoding latency, ShadowKV employs an accurate KV selection strategy that reconstructs minimal sparse KV pairs on-the-fly. By evaluating ShadowKV on a broad range of benchmarks, including RULER, LongBench, and Needle In A Haystack, and models like Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3-8B-1M, GLM-4-9B-1M, Yi-9B-200K, Phi-3-Mini-128K, and Qwen2-7B-128K, we demonstrate that it can support up to 6$\times$ larger batch sizes and boost throughput by up to 3.04$\times$ on an A100 GPU without sacrificing accuracy, even surpassing the performance achievable with infinite batch size under the assumption of infinite GPU memory.

Building upon the resolution of the long-standing conjecture of the existence of Hamiltonian decompositions of complete hypergraphs, a problem that was resolved using existence-based methods, our contribution goes beyond the previous explicit designs, which were confined to the specific cases of $k=2$ and $k=3$, by providing explicit designs for all $k$ and $n$ prime, allowing for a broad applicability of Hamiltonian decompositions in various settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As the gap between network and CPU speeds rapidly increases, the CPU-centric network stack proves inadequate due to excessive CPU and memory overhead. While hardware-offloaded network stacks alleviate these issues, they suffer from limited flexibility in both control and data planes. Offloading network stack to off-path SmartNIC seems promising to provide high flexibility; however, throughput remains constrained by inherent SmartNIC architectural limitations.   To this end, we design FlexiNS, a SmartNIC-centric network stack with software transport programmability and line-rate packet processing capabilities. To grapple with the limitation of SmartNIC-induced challenges, FlexiNS introduces: (a) a header-only offloading TX path; (b) an unlimited-working-set in-cache processing RX path; (c) a high-performance DMA-only notification pipe; and (d) a programmable offloading engine. We prototype FlexiNS using Nvidia BlueField-3 SmartNIC and provide out-of-the-box RDMA IBV verbs compatibility to users. FlexiNS achieves 2.2$\times$ higher throughput than the microkernel-based baseline in block storage disaggregation and 1.3$\times$ higher throughput than the hardware-offloaded baseline in KVCache transfer.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We investigate the demand private coded caching problem, which is an $(N,K)$ coded caching problem with $N$ files, $K$ users, each equipped with a cache of size $M$, and an additional privacy constraint on user demands, i.e., each user can not gain any information about the demands of other users. We focus on scenarios where the size of users' caches is small, aiming to further characterize the fundamental limits of this problem. We first present a new virtual-user-based achievable scheme for arbitrary number of users and files, and two MDS-code-based achievable schemes for the case $N \le K$. With a newly derived converse bound for the case $N \le K$, these proposed schemes lead to the optimal memory-rate tradeoff of the demand private coded caching problem for $M \in \big[0, \frac{N}{(K+1)(N-1)} \big] $ where $N \le K \le 2N-2$, and the optimal memory-rate tradeoff for $M \in \big[0, \frac{1}{K+1} \big] $ where $ K > 2N-2$. Moreover, for the case of 2 files and arbitrary number of users, by deriving another new converse bound, the optimal memory-rate tradeoff is characterized for $M\in \big[0,\frac{2}{K}\big] \cup \big[\frac{2(K-1)}{K+1},2\big]$. Finally, we provide the optimal memory-rate tradeoff of the demand private coded caching problem for 2 files and 3 users.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) enable learning on realworld graphs and mini-batch training has emerged as the de facto standard for training GNNs because it can scale to very large graphs and improve convergence. Current mini-batch construction policies largely ignore efficiency considerations of GNN training. Specifically, existing mini-batching techniques employ randomization schemes to improve accuracy and convergence. However, these randomization schemes are often agnostic to the structural properties of the graph (for eg. community structure), resulting in highly irregular memory access patterns during GNN training that make suboptimal use of on-chip GPU caches. On the other hand, while deterministic mini-batching based solely on graph structure delivers fast runtime performance, the lack of randomness compromises both the final model accuracy and training convergence speed. In this paper, we present Community-structure-aware Randomized Mini-batching (COMM-RAND), a novel methodology that bridges the gap between the above extremes. COMM-RAND allows practitioners to explore the space between pure randomness and pure graph structural awareness during mini-batch construction, leading to significantly more efficient GNN training with similar accuracy. We evaluated COMM-RAND across four popular graph learning benchmarks. COMM-RAND cuts down GNN training time by up to 2.76x (1.8x on average) while achieving an accuracy that is within 1.79% points (0.42% on average) compared to popular random mini-batching approaches.

In this paper, we carefully characterize C3 in ML on GPUs, which are most widely deployed for ML training and inference. We observe that while C3 leads to performance uplifts, the uplifts are far lower than ideal speedups (serial computation and communication versus maximum of computation or communication; all times from isolated executions). That is, C3 on average achieves only 21% of ideal speedup. This is so, due to known challenges of compute and memory interference between concurrent GPU kernels (that is, sharing of GPU's compute units, caches and HBM).   To attain better performance for C3, first, we evaluate dual strategies of schedule prioritization and careful resource partitioning of compute units on GPUs to push performance attained with C3 (on average 42% of ideal speedup). We also provide heuristics that can guide a runtime while employing these strategies. To further enhance C3 performance, we propose to mitigate C3 interference by offloading communication tasks to the GPU's DMA engines. To this end, we build concurrent communication collectives (ConCCL) proof-of-concepts that harness DMA engines for communication. We show how ConCCL considerably closes the gap between realized and ideal speedup for C3 (on average 72% of ideal speedup is realized, up to 1.67x speedup). Overall, our work makes a strong case for GPU DMA engine advancements to better support C3 on GPUs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The kagome material AV$_3$Sb$_5$ exhibits multiple exotic orders, including an unconventional charge density wave (CDW). Elucidating the underlying mechanism behind the CDW transition is crucial for unraveling the complex interactions among these phases. However, the driving force of the CDW remains a topic of debate due to the intertwined interactions among the system's various excitations. Here we investigated the CDW transition in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by isolating the ultrafast electronic phase transition using time- and angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy. An ultrafast electronic phase transition was observed at a critical photoexcitation fluence, F$_c$, without reduction in CDW lattice-distortion-induced band folding. This folded band persisted up to 150 K under equilibrium heating, well above the CDW condensation temperature of T$_c$ = 78 K. Notably, the pump-induced band shifts at F$_c$ were comparable to those caused by thermal effects at T$_c$. These findings suggest that in KV$_3$Sb$_5$, a fluctuating lattice-driven in-plane CDW emerges above 150 K, with out-of-plane electronic correlations leading to the $2\times2 \times 2$ CDW near T$_c$, offering key insights into the interplay between the electronic and structural dynamics in AV$_3$Sb$_5$.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Nonlocal Coulomb interactions play a crucial role in stabilizing distinct electronic phases in kagome materials. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of on-site ($U$) and inter-site ($V$) Coulomb interactions on the electronic structure and stability of charge-density-wave (CDW) phases in the kagome metal KV$_3$Sb$_5$ using density functional theory (DFT+$U$+$V$) calculations. We demonstrate that $V$ promotes the formation and stability of CDW phases, whereas $U$ suppresses these phases, highlighting a fundamental competition between local and nonlocal electronic correlations. By directly comparing our theoretical results with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data, we identify realistic values of $U$ and $V$ that accurately describe the electronic band structure of KV$_3$Sb$_5$. Our findings establish a detailed $U$-$V$ phase diagram for KV$_3$Sb$_5$, offering valuable insights into the correlated electronic states in kagome metals and serving as a foundation for future explorations of correlation-driven phenomena in related materials.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly require processing long text sequences, but GPU memory limitations force difficult trade-offs between memory capacity and bandwidth. While HBM-based acceleration offers high bandwidth, its capacity remains constrained. Offloading data to host-side DIMMs improves capacity but introduces costly data swapping overhead. We identify that the critical memory bottleneck lies in the decoding phase of multi-head attention (MHA) exclusively, which demands substantial capacity for storing KV caches and high bandwidth for attention computation. Our key insight reveals this operation uniquely aligns with modern DIMM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures, which offers scalability of both capacity and bandwidth.   Based on this observation and insight, we propose L3, a hardware-software co-designed system integrating DIMM-PIM and GPU devices. L3 introduces three innovations: First, hardware redesigns resolve data layout mismatches and computational element mismatches in DIMM-PIM, enhancing LLM inference utilization. Second, communication optimization enables hiding the data transfer overhead with the computation. Third, an adaptive scheduler coordinates GPU-DIMM-PIM operations to maximize parallelism between devices. Evaluations using real-world traces show L3 achieves up to 6.1$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art HBM-PIM solutions while significantly improving batch sizes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Persistent Memory (PM) introduces new opportunities for designing crash-consistent applications without the traditional storage overheads. However, ensuring crash consistency in PM demands intricate knowledge of CPU, cache, and memory interactions. Hardware and software mechanisms have been proposed to ease this burden, but neither proved sufficient, prompting a variety of bug detection tools.   With the sunset of Intel Optane comes the rise of Compute Express Link (CXL) for PM. In this position paper, we discuss the impact of CXL's disaggregated and heterogeneous nature in the development of crash-consistent PM applications, and outline three research directions: hardware primitives, persistency frameworks, and bug detection tools.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Conventional wisdom holds that an efficient interface between an OS running on a CPU and a high-bandwidth I/O device should use Direct Memory Access (DMA) to offload data transfer, descriptor rings for buffering and queuing, and interrupts for asynchrony between cores and device.   In this paper we question this wisdom in the light of two trends: modern and emerging cache-coherent interconnects like CXL3.0, and workloads, particularly microservices and serverless computing. Like some others before us, we argue that the assumptions of the DMA-based model are obsolete, and in many use-cases programmed I/O, where the CPU explicitly transfers data and control information to and from a device via loads and stores, delivers a more efficient system.   However, we push this idea much further. We show, in a real hardware implementation, the gains in latency for fine-grained communication achievable using an open cache-coherence protocol which exposes cache transitions to a smart device, and that throughput is competitive with DMA over modern interconnects. We also demonstrate three use-cases: fine-grained RPC-style invocation of functions on an accelerator, offloading of operators in a streaming dataflow engine, and a network interface targeting serverless functions, comparing our use of coherence with both traditional DMA-style interaction and a highly-optimized implementation using memory-mapped programmed I/O over PCIe.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) applications face performance challenges due to their high computational demands and need for low-latency responses. Traditional approaches like on-device storage or reactive data fetching from the cloud often result in limited AR experiences or unacceptable lag. Edge caching, which caches AR objects closer to the user, provides a promising solution. However, existing edge caching approaches do not consider AR-specific features such as AR object sizes, user interactions, and physical location. This paper investigates how to further optimize edge caching by employing AR-aware prefetching techniques. We present SPAARC, a Spatial Proximity and Association-based Prefetching policy specifically designed for MAR Caches. SPAARC intelligently prioritizes the caching of virtual objects based on their association with other similar objects and the user's proximity to them. It also considers the recency of associations and uses a lazy fetching strategy to efficiently manage edge resources and maximize Quality of Experience (QoE).   Through extensive evaluation using both synthetic and real-world workloads, we demonstrate that SPAARC significantly improves cache hit rates compared to standard caching algorithms, achieving gains ranging from 3% to 40% while reducing the need for on-demand data retrieval from the cloud. Further, we present an adaptive tuning algorithm that automatically tunes SPAARC parameters to achieve optimal performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SPAARC to substantially enhance the user experience in MAR applications by ensuring the timely availability of virtual objects.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated the effectiveness of length scaling during post-training, yet its potential in pre-training remains underexplored. We present the Parallel Hidden Decoding Transformer (\textit{PHD}-Transformer), a novel framework that enables efficient length scaling during pre-training while maintaining inference efficiency. \textit{PHD}-Transformer achieves this through an innovative KV cache management strategy that distinguishes between original tokens and hidden decoding tokens. By retaining only the KV cache of original tokens for long-range dependencies while immediately discarding hidden decoding tokens after use, our approach maintains the same KV cache size as the vanilla transformer while enabling effective length scaling. To further enhance performance, we introduce two optimized variants: \textit{PHD-SWA} employs sliding window attention to preserve local dependencies, while \textit{PHD-CSWA} implements chunk-wise sliding window attention to eliminate linear growth in pre-filling time. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper examines memory mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs), emphasizing their importance for context-rich responses, reduced hallucinations, and improved efficiency. It categorizes memory into sensory, short-term, and long-term, with sensory memory corresponding to input prompts, short-term memory processing immediate context, and long-term memory implemented via external databases or structures. The text-based memory section covers acquisition (selection and summarization), management (updating, accessing, storing, and resolving conflicts), and utilization (full-text search, SQL queries, semantic search). The KV cache-based memory section discusses selection methods (regularity-based summarization, score-based approaches, special token embeddings) and compression techniques (low-rank compression, KV merging, multimodal compression), along with management strategies like offloading and shared attention mechanisms. Parameter-based memory methods (LoRA, TTT, MoE) transform memories into model parameters to enhance efficiency, while hidden-state-based memory approaches (chunk mechanisms, recurrent transformers, Mamba model) improve long-text processing by combining RNN hidden states with current methods. Overall, the paper offers a comprehensive analysis of LLM memory mechanisms, highlighting their significance and future research directions.

This method facilitates the deployment of LLM-based application requiring long input prompts in resource-constrained environments with limited memory and compute budgets. Unlike other KV cache eviction methods, KeyDiff can process arbitrarily long prompts within strict resource constraints and efficiently generate responses. We demonstrate that KeyDiff computes the optimal solution to a KV cache selection problem that maximizes key diversity, providing a theoretical understanding of KeyDiff. Notably,KeyDiff does not rely on attention scores, allowing the use of optimized attention mechanisms like FlashAttention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of KeyDiff across diverse tasks and models, illustrating a performance gap of less than 0.04\% with 8K cache budget ($\sim$ 23\% KV cache reduction) from the non-evicting baseline on the LongBench benchmark for Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.2-3B.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Digital pathology is a tool of rapidly evolving importance within the discipline of pathology. Whole slide imaging promises numerous advantages; however, adoption is limited by challenges in ease of use and speed of high-quality image rendering relative to the simplicity and visual quality of glass slides. We introduce Iris, a new high-performance digital pathology rendering system. Specifically, we outline and detail the performance metrics of Iris Core, the core rendering engine technology. Iris Core comprises machine code modules written from the ground up in C++ and using Vulkan, a low-level and low-overhead cross-platform graphical processing unit application program interface, and our novel rapid tile buffering algorithms. We provide a detailed explanation of Iris Core's system architecture, including the stateless isolation of core processes, interprocess communication paradigms, and explicit synchronization paradigms that provide powerful control over the graphical processing unit. Iris Core achieves slide rendering at the sustained maximum frame rate on all tested platforms and buffers an entire new slide field of, view without overlapping pixels, in 10 ms with enhanced detail in 30 ms. It is able to buffer and compute high-fidelity reduction-enhancements for viewing low-power cytology with increased visual quality at a rate of 100-160 us per slide tile, and with a cumulative median buffering rate of 1.36 GB of decompressed image data per second. This buffering rate allows for an entirely new field of view to be fully buffered and rendered in less than a single monitor refresh on a standard display, and high detail features within 2-3 monitor refresh frames. These metrics far exceed previously published specifications, beyond an order of magnitude in some contexts. The system shows no slowing with high use loads, but rather increases performance due to cache mechanisms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The network interface adapter (NIC) is a critical component of a cloud server occupying a unique position. Not only is network performance vital to efficient operation of the machine, but unlike compute accelerators like GPUs, the network subsystem must react to unpredictable events like the arrival of a network packet and communicate with the appropriate application end point with minimal latency.   Current approaches to server stacks navigate a trade-off between flexibility, efficiency, and performance: the fastest kernel-bypass approaches dedicate cores to applications, busy-wait on receive queues, etc. while more flexible approaches appropriate to more dynamic workload mixes incur much greater software overhead on the data path.   However, we reject this trade-off, which we ascribe to an arbitrary (and sub-optimal) split in system state between the OS and the NIC. Instead, by exploiting the properties of cache-coherent interconnects and integrating the NIC closely with the OS kernel, we can achieve something surprising: performance for RPC workloads better than the fastest kernelbypass approaches without sacrificing the robustness and dynamic adaptation of kernel-based network subsystems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While long context support of large language models has extended their abilities, it also incurs challenges in memory and compute which becomes crucial bottlenecks in resource-restricted devices. Token eviction, a widely adopted post-training methodology designed to alleviate the bottlenecks by evicting less important tokens from the cache, typically uses attention scores as proxy metrics for token importance. However, one major limitation of attention score as a token-wise importance metrics is that it lacks the information about contribution of tokens to the attention output. In this paper, we propose a simple eviction criterion based on the contribution of cached tokens to attention outputs. Our method, CAOTE, optimizes for eviction error due to token eviction, by seamlessly integrating attention scores and value vectors. This is the first method which uses value vector information on top of attention-based eviction scores. Additionally, CAOTE can act as a meta-heuristic method with flexible usage with any token eviction method. We show that CAOTE, when combined with the state-of-the-art attention score-based methods, always improves accuracies on the downstream task, indicating the importance of leveraging information from values during token eviction process.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Although benefits from caching in US HEP are well-known, current caching strategies are not adaptive i.e they do not adapt to changing cache access patterns. Newer developments such as the High-Luminosity - Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), a steady move toward streaming readout based Data Acquisition systems (DAQs) will increase the data production exponentially and hence burden the storage, compute & network infrastructures. Moreover, existing caching frameworks are optimized to reduce latency, but not optimized for storage. This, in combination with limited cache capacities relative to total data, makes it difficult to achieve data locality.   In this work, we present Machine Learning-aided (ML) caching strategies. Specifically, we first present a Long Short-Term Memory-based (LSTM) hourly and multi-step cache usage prediction. Second, we present an hourly file-level access prediction model based on CatboostRegressor. To date, most ML-based cache prediction strategies in HEP have focused on daily cache usage and limited works tackled hourly cache usage and even fewer strategies addressed hourly file-level access prediction. File-level access prediction allows for the design of intelligent prefetching and data placement strategies with fine-grained control. We validated our cache prediction strategies using data collected from SoCal MINI caches in August 2024. We are currently extending the WRENCH simulator to reflect the US HEP ecosystem at the storage, network and compute levels. We plan to deploy our cache prediction strategies into WRENCH and later perform extensive analysis with complex data access patterns and candidate infrastructure configurations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Disaggregated memory is an upcoming data center technology that will allow nodes (servers) to share data efficiently. Sharing data creates a debate on the level of cache coherence the system should provide. While current proposals aim to provide coherence for all or parts of the disaggregated memory, we argue that this approach is problematic, because of scalability limitations and hardware complexity. Instead, we propose and formally define federated coherence, a model that provides coherence only within nodes, not across nodes. Federated coherence can use current intra-node coherence provided by processors without requiring expensive mechanisms for inter-node coherence. Developers can use federated coherence with a few simple programming paradigms and a synchronization library. We sketch some potential applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in generating text, images, and video content. However, as context length grows, the computational cost of attention increases quadratically with the number of tokens, presenting significant efficiency challenges. This paper presents an analysis of various Key-Value (KV) cache compression strategies, offering a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes these methods by their underlying principles and implementation techniques. Furthermore, we evaluate their impact on performance and inference latency, providing critical insights into their effectiveness. Our findings highlight the trade-offs involved in KV cache compression and its influence on handling long-context scenarios, paving the way for more efficient LLM implementations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As AI workloads drive soaring memory requirements, there is a need for higher-density on-chip memory for domain-specific accelerators that goes beyond what current SRAM technology can provide. We motivate that algorithms and application behavior should guide the composition of heterogeneous on-chip memories. However, there has been little work in factoring dynamic application profiles into such design decisions. We present GainSight, a profiling framework that analyzes fine-grained memory access patterns and computes data lifetimes in domain-specific accelerators. By combining instrumentation and simulation across retargetable hardware backends, GainSight aligns heterogeneous memory designs with workload-specific traffic and lifetime metrics. Case studies on MLPerf Inference and PolyBench workloads using NVIDIA H100 GPUs and systolic arrays reveal key insights: (1) 40% of L1 and 18% of L2 GPU cache accesses, and 79% of systolic array scratchpad accesses across profiled workloads are short-lived and suitable for silicon-based gain cell RAM (Si-GCRAM); (2) Si-GCRAM reduces active energy by 11-28% compared to SRAM; (3) Up to 90% of GPU cache fetches are never reused, highlighting inefficiencies in terms of cache pollution. These insights that GainSight provides can be used to better understand the design spaces of both emerging on-chip memories and software algorithmic optimizations for the next generation of AI accelerators.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern LLM services demand high throughput and stringent SLO guarantees across two distinct inference phases-prefill and decode-and complex multi-turn workflows. However, current systems face a fundamental tradeoff: out-of-place compute partition enables per-phase SLO attainment, while in-place memory sharing maximizes throughput via KV cache reuse. Moreover, existing in-place compute partition also encounters low utilization and high overhead due to phase-coupling design. We present Drift, a new LLM serving framework that resolves this tension via PD multiplexing, enabling in-place and phase-decoupled compute partition. Drift leverages low-level GPU partitioning techniques to multiplex prefill and decode phases spatially and adaptively on shared GPUs, while preserving in-place memory sharing. To fully leverage the multiplexing capability, Drift introduces an adaptive gang scheduling mechanism, a contention-free modeling method, and a SLO-aware dispatching policy. Evaluation shows that Drift achieves an average $5.1\times$ throughput improvement (up to $17.5\times$) over state-of-the-art baselines, while consistently meeting SLO targets under complex LLM workloads.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) with different architectures and sizes have been developed. Serving each LLM with dedicated GPUs leads to resource waste and service inefficiency due to the varying demand of LLM requests. A common practice is to share multiple LLMs. However, existing sharing systems either do not consider the autoregressive pattern of LLM services, or only focus on improving the throughput, which impairs the sharing performance, especially the serving latency. We present SeaLLM, which enables service-aware and latency-optimized LLM sharing. SeaLLM improves the overall sharing performance by (1) a latency-optimized scheduling algorithm utilizing the characteristics of LLM services, (2) a placement algorithm to determine the placement plan and an adaptive replacement algorithm to decide the replacement interval, and (3) a unified key-value cache to share GPU memory among LLM services efficiently. Our evaluation under real-world traces and LLM services demonstrates that SeaLLM improves the normalized latency by up to $13.60\times$, the tail latency by up to $18.69\times$, and the SLO attainment by up to $3.64\times$ compared to existing solutions.

Existing techniques, such as pruning, quantization, and mixture of experts/depth, reduce memory capacity and/or bandwidth consumption at the cost of slight degradation in inference quality. This paper introduces a design solution that further alleviates memory bottlenecks by enhancing the on-chip memory controller in AI accelerators to achieve two main objectives: (1) significantly reducing memory capacity and bandwidth usage through lossless block compression~(e.g., LZ4 and ZSTD) of model weights and key-value (KV) cache without compromising inference quality, and (2) enabling memory bandwidth and energy consumption to scale proportionally with context-dependent dynamic quantization. These goals are accomplished by equipping the on-chip memory controller with mechanisms to improve fine-grained bit-level accessibility and compressibility of weights and KV cache through LLM-aware configuration of in-memory placement and representation. Experimental results on publicly available LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing memory footprint reductions of 25.2\% for model weights and 46.9\% for KV cache. In addition, our hardware prototype at 4\,GHz and 32 lanes (7\,nm) achieves 8\,TB/s throughput with a modest area overhead (under 3.8\,mm\(^2\)), which underscores the viability of LLM-aware memory control as a key to efficient large-scale inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformers, driven by attention mechanisms, form the foundation of large language models (LLMs). As these models scale up, efficient GPU attention kernels become essential for high-throughput and low-latency inference. Diverse LLM applications demand flexible and high-performance attention solutions. We present FlashInfer: a customizable and efficient attention engine for LLM serving. FlashInfer tackles KV-cache storage heterogeneity using block-sparse format and composable formats to optimize memory access and reduce redundancy. It also offers a customizable attention template, enabling adaptation to various settings through Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. Additionally, FlashInfer's load-balanced scheduling algorithm adjusts to dynamism of user requests while maintaining compatibility with CUDAGraph which requires static configuration. FlashInfer have been integrated into leading LLM serving frameworks like SGLang, vLLM and MLC-Engine. Comprehensive kernel-level and end-to-end evaluations demonstrate FlashInfer's ability to significantly boost kernel performance across diverse inference scenarios: compared to state-of-the-art LLM serving solutions, FlashInfer achieve 29-69% inter-token-latency reduction compared to compiler backends for LLM serving benchmark, 28-30% latency reduction for long-context inference, and 13-17% speedup for LLM serving with parallel generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, semantic communication (SemCom) has shown its great superiorities in resource savings and information exchanges. However, while its unique background knowledge guarantees accurate semantic reasoning and recovery, semantic information security-related concerns are introduced at the same time. Since the potential eavesdroppers may have the same background knowledge to accurately decrypt the private semantic information transmitted between legal SemCom users, this makes the knowledge management in SemCom networks rather challenging in joint consideration with the power control. To this end, this paper focuses on jointly addressing three core issues of power allocation, knowledge base caching (KBC), and device-to-device (D2D) user pairing (DUP) in secure SemCom networks. We first develop a novel performance metric, namely semantic secrecy throughput (SST), to quantify the information security level that can be achieved at each pair of D2D SemCom users. Next, an SST maximization problem is formulated subject to secure SemCom-related delay and reliability constraints. Afterward, we propose a security-aware resource management solution using the Lagrange primal-dual method and a two-stage method. Simulation results demonstrate our proposed solution nearly doubles the SST performance and realizes less than half of the queuing delay performance compared to different benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The growing interest in artificial intelligence has created workloads that require both sequential and random access. At the same time, NVMe-backed storage solutions have emerged, providing caching capability for large columnar datasets in cloud storage. Current columnar storage libraries fall short of effectively utilizing an NVMe device's capabilities, especially when it comes to random access. Historically, this has been assumed an implicit weakness in columnar storage formats, but this has not been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of popular columnar formats such as Apache Arrow, Apache Parquet, and Lance in both random access and full scan tasks against NVMe storage.   We argue that effective encoding of a column's structure, such as the repetition and validity information, is the key to unlocking the disk's performance. We show that Parquet, when configured correctly, can achieve over 60x better random access performance than default settings. We also show that this high random access performance requires making minor trade-offs in scan performance and RAM utilization. We then describe the Lance structural encoding scheme, which alternates between two different structural encodings based on data width, and achieves better random access performance without making trade-offs in scan performance or RAM utilization.

To this end, we extend the notion of competitiveness to block competitiveness and systematically analyze the competitiveness and block competitiveness of FIFO and MRU relative to LRU for arbitrary associativities. We show how competitiveness and block competitiveness can be exploited in state-of-the-art WCET analysis based on the results of existing persistence analyses for LRU. Unlike prior work, our approach is applicable to microarchitectures that exhibit timing anomalies. We experimentally evaluate the precision and cost of our approach on benchmarks from TACLeBench. The experiments demonstrate that quantitative cache analysis for FIFO and MRU comes close to the precision of LRU.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in processing long sequences and complex reasoning tasks, yet efficiently serving these models remains challenging due to the quadratic computational complexity of attention in the prefilling stage and the large memory footprint of the KV cache in the decoding stage. To address these issues, we introduce LServe, an efficient system that accelerates long-sequence LLM serving via hybrid sparse attention. This method unifies different hardware-friendly, structured sparsity patterns for both prefilling and decoding attention into a single framework, where computations on less important tokens are skipped block-wise. LServe demonstrates the compatibility of static and dynamic sparsity in long-context LLM attention. This design enables multiplicative speedups by combining these optimizations. Specifically, we convert half of the attention heads to nearly free streaming heads in both the prefilling and decoding stages. Additionally, we find that only a constant number of KV pages is required to preserve long-context and reasoning capabilities, irrespective of context length. We then design a hierarchical KV page selection policy that dynamically prunes KV pages based on query-centric similarity. On average, LServe accelerates LLM prefilling by up to 2.9x and decoding by 1.3-2.1x over vLLM, maintaining long-context accuracy. Code is released at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/omniserve.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Making it intelligent is a promising way in System/OS design. This paper proposes OSML+, a new ML-based resource scheduling mechanism for co-located cloud services. OSML+ intelligently schedules the cache and main memory bandwidth resources at the memory hierarchy and the computing core resources simultaneously. OSML+ uses a multi-model collaborative learning approach during its scheduling and thus can handle complicated cases, e.g., avoiding resource cliffs, sharing resources among applications, enabling different scheduling policies for applications with different priorities, etc. OSML+ can converge faster using ML models than previous studies. Moreover, OSML+ can automatically learn on the fly and handle dynamically changing workloads accordingly. Using transfer learning technologies, we show our design can work well across various cloud servers, including the latest off-the-shelf large-scale servers. Our experimental results show that OSML+ supports higher loads and meets QoS targets with lower overheads than previous studies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficient inference of LLMs remains a crucial challenge, with two main phases: a compute-intensive prompt computation and a memory-intensive token generation. Despite existing batching and scheduling techniques, token generation phases fail to fully utilize compute resources, especially when compared to prompt computation phases. To address these challenges, we propose Splitwiser, a methodology that splits the two phases of an LLM inference request onto the same GPU, thereby reducing overhead and improving memory access and cache utilization. By eliminating the need to transfer data across devices, Splitwiser aims to minimize network-related overheads. In this report, we describe the basic structure of our proposed pipeline while sharing preliminary results and analysis. We implement our proposed multiprocessing design on two widely-used and independent LLM architectures: Huggingface and vLLM. We open-source our code for the respective implementations: 1) Huggingface (https://github.com/asad-aali/splitwiser), and 2) vLLM (https://github.com/adney11/vllm-sysml).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Pipeline parallelism has emerged as a predominant approach for deploying large language models (LLMs) across distributed nodes, owing to its lower communication overhead compared to tensor parallelism. While demonstrating high throughput in request serving, pipeline parallelism often suffers from performance limitations caused by pipeline bubbles, which are primarily resulted from imbalanced computation delays across batches. Existing methods like Sarathi-Serve attempt to address this through hybrid scheduling of chunked prefill and decode tokens using a fixed token budget. However, such methods may experience significant fluctuations due to either insufficient prefill tokens or uneven distribution of decode tokens, ultimately leading to computational imbalance. To overcome these inefficiencies, we present gLLM, a globally balanced pipeline parallelism system incorporating Token Throttling to effectively mitigate the pipeline bubbles. Our Token Throttling mechanism is a fine-grained scheduling policy that independently regulates the quantities of prefill and decode tokens, thus enabling balanced computation by leveraging global information from the inference system. Specifically, for decode tokens, gLLM maintains near-consistent token count across processing batches. For prefill tokens, it dynamically adjusts batch sizes based on both total pending tokens and the memory utilization rates of key-value cache (KV cache). Furthermore, gLLM runtime adopts an asynchronous execution and message passing architecture specifically optimized for pipeline parallelism characteristics. Experimental evaluations with representative LLMs show that gLLM achieves significant performance improvements, delivering 11% to 398% higher maximum throughput compared to state-of-the-art pipeline or tensor parallelism systems, while simultaneously maintaining lower latency.

We introduce Star Attention, a two-phase block-sparse approximation that improves computational efficiency by sharding attention across multiple hosts while minimizing communication overhead. In the first phase, the context is processed using blockwise-local attention across hosts, in parallel. In the second phase, query and response tokens attend to all prior cached tokens through sequence-global attention. Star Attention integrates seamlessly with most Transformer-based LLMs trained with global attention, reducing memory requirements and inference time by up to 11x while preserving 97-100% of accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven the need for increasingly sophisticated inference pipelines and hardware platforms. Modern LLM serving extends beyond traditional prefill-decode workflows, incorporating multi-stage processes such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), key-value (KV) cache retrieval, dynamic model routing, and multi step reasoning. These stages exhibit diverse computational demands, requiring distributed systems that integrate GPUs, ASICs, CPUs, and memory-centric architectures. However, existing simulators lack the fidelity to model these heterogeneous, multi-engine workflows, limiting their ability to inform architectural decisions.   To address this gap, we introduce HERMES, a Heterogeneous Multi-stage LLM inference Execution Simulator. HERMES models diverse request stages; including RAG, KV retrieval, reasoning, prefill, and decode across complex hardware hierarchies. HERMES supports heterogeneous clients executing multiple models concurrently unlike prior frameworks while incorporating advanced batching strategies and multi-level memory hierarchies. By integrating real hardware traces with analytical modeling, HERMES captures critical trade-offs such as memory bandwidth contention, inter-cluster communication latency, and batching efficiency in hybrid CPU-accelerator deployments. Through case studies, we explore the impact of reasoning stages on end-to-end latency, optimal batching strategies for hybrid pipelines, and the architectural implications of remote KV cache retrieval. HERMES empowers system designers to navigate the evolving landscape of LLM inference, providing actionable insights into optimizing hardware-software co-design for next-generation AI workloads.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> An essential step for mounting cache attacks is finding eviction sets, collections of memory locations that contend on cache space. On Intel processors, one of the main challenges for identifying contending addresses is the sliced cache design, where the processor hashes the physical address to determine where in the cache a memory location is stored. While past works have demonstrated that the hash function can be reversed, they also showed that it depends on physical address bits that the adversary does not know.   In this work, we make three main contributions to the art of finding eviction sets. We first exploit microarchitectural races to compare memory access times and identify the cache slice to which an address maps. We then use the known hash function to both reduce the error rate in our slice identification method and to reduce the work by extrapolating slice mappings to untested memory addresses. Finally, we show how to propagate information on eviction sets across different page offsets for the hitherto unexplored case of non-linear hash functions.   Our contributions allow for entire LLC eviction set generation in 0.7 seconds on the Intel i7-9850H and 1.6 seconds on the i9-10900K, both using non-linear functions. This represents a significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art techniques taking 9x and 10x longer, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While recent advances in text-to-motion generation have shown promising results, they typically assume all individuals are grouped as a single unit. Scaling these methods to handle larger crowds and ensuring that individuals respond appropriately to specific events remains a significant challenge. This is primarily due to the complexities of scene planning, which involves organizing groups, planning their activities, and coordinating interactions, and controllable motion generation. In this paper, we present CrowdMoGen, the first zero-shot framework for collective motion generation, which effectively groups individuals and generates event-aligned motion sequences from text prompts. 1) Being limited by the available datasets for training an effective scene planning module in a supervised manner, we instead propose a crowd scene planner that leverages pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to organize individuals into distinct groups. While LLMs offer high-level guidance for group divisions, they lack the low-level understanding of human motion. To address this, we further propose integrating an SMPL-based joint prior to generate context-appropriate activities, which consists of both joint trajectories and textual descriptions. 2) Secondly, to incorporate the assigned activities into the generative network, we introduce a collective motion generator that integrates the activities into a transformer-based network in a joint-wise manner, maintaining the spatial constraints during the multi-step denoising process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CrowdMoGen significantly outperforms previous approaches, delivering realistic, event-driven motion sequences that are spatially coherent. As the first framework of collective motion generation, CrowdMoGen has the potential to advance applications in urban simulation, crowd planning, and other large-scale interactive environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We analyze a varying-coefficient dynamic spatial autoregressive model with spatial fixed effects. One salient feature of the model is the incorporation of multiple spatial weight matrices through their linear combinations with varying coefficients, which help solve the problem of choosing the most ``correct'' one for applied econometricians who often face the availability of multiple expert spatial weight matrices. We estimate and make inferences on the model coefficients and coefficients in basis expansions of the varying coefficients through penalized estimations, establishing the oracle properties of the estimators and the consistency of the overall estimated spatial weight matrix, which can be time-dependent. We further consider two applications of our model in change point detections in dynamic spatial autoregressive models, providing theoretical justifications in consistent change point locations estimation and practical implementations. Simulation experiments demonstrate the performance of our proposed methodology, and real data analyses are also carried out.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) has extended into literary domains. However, existing evaluation metrics prioritize mechanical accuracy over artistic expression and tend to overrate machine translation (MT) as being superior to experienced professional human translation. In the long run, this bias could result in a permanent decline in translation quality and cultural authenticity. In response to the urgent need for a specialized literary evaluation metric, we introduce LiTransProQA, a novel, reference-free, LLM-based question-answering framework designed specifically for literary translation evaluation. LiTransProQA uniquely integrates insights from professional literary translators and researchers, focusing on critical elements in literary quality assessment such as literary devices, cultural understanding, and authorial voice. Our extensive evaluation shows that while literary-finetuned XCOMET-XL yields marginal gains, LiTransProQA substantially outperforms current metrics, achieving up to 0.07 gain in correlation (ACC-EQ and Kendall's tau) and surpassing the best state-of-the-art metrics by over 15 points in adequacy assessments. Incorporating professional translator insights as weights further improves performance, highlighting the value of translator inputs. Notably, LiTransProQA approaches human-level evaluation performance comparable to trained linguistic annotators. It demonstrates broad applicability to open-source models such as LLaMA3.3-70b and Qwen2.5-32b, indicating its potential as an accessible and training-free literary evaluation metric and a valuable tool for evaluating texts that require local processing due to copyright or ethical considerations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Integrated autoregressive conditional duration (ACD) models serve as natural counterparts to the well-known integrated GARCH models used for financial returns. However, despite their resemblance, asymptotic theory for ACD is challenging and also not complete, in particular for integrated ACD. Central challenges arise from the facts that (i) integrated ACD processes imply durations with infinite expectation, and (ii) even in the non-integrated case, conventional asymptotic approaches break down due to the randomness in the number of durations within a fixed observation period. Addressing these challenges, we provide here unified asymptotic theory for the (quasi-) maximum likelihood estimator for ACD models; a unified theory which includes integrated ACD models. Based on the new results, we also provide a novel framework for hypothesis testing in duration models, enabling inference on a key empirical question: whether durations possess a finite or infinite expectation. We apply our results to high-frequency cryptocurrency ETF trading data. Motivated by parameter estimates near the integrated ACD boundary, we assess whether durations between trades in these markets have finite expectation, an assumption often made implicitly in the literature on point process models. Our empirical findings indicate infinite-mean durations for all the five cryptocurrencies examined, with the integrated ACD hypothesis rejected -- against alternatives with tail index less than one -- for four out of the five cryptocurrencies considered.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models (LLMs) become integral to diverse applications, ensuring their reliability under varying input conditions is crucial. One key issue affecting this reliability is order sensitivity, wherein slight variations in the input arrangement can lead to inconsistent or biased outputs. Although recent advances have reduced this sensitivity, the problem remains unresolved. This paper investigates the extent of order sensitivity in LLMs whose internal components are hidden from users (such as closed-source models or those accessed via API calls). We conduct experiments across multiple tasks, including paraphrasing, relevance judgment, and multiple-choice questions. Our results show that input order significantly affects performance across tasks, with shuffled inputs leading to measurable declines in output accuracy. Few-shot prompting demonstrates mixed effectiveness and offers partial mitigation; however, fails to fully resolve the problem. These findings highlight persistent risks, particularly in high-stakes applications, and point to the need for more robust LLMs or improved input-handling techniques in future development.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Social media user profiling through content analysis is crucial for tasks like misinformation detection, engagement prediction, hate speech monitoring, and user behavior modeling. However, existing profiling techniques, including tweet summarization, attribute-based profiling, and latent representation learning, face significant limitations: they often lack transferability, produce non-interpretable features, require large labeled datasets, or rely on rigid predefined categories that limit adaptability. We introduce a novel large language model (LLM)-based approach that leverages domain-defining statements, which serve as key characteristics outlining the important pillars of a domain as foundations for profiling. Our two-stage method first employs semi-supervised filtering with a domain-specific knowledge base, then generates both abstractive (synthesized descriptions) and extractive (representative tweet selections) user profiles. By harnessing LLMs' inherent knowledge with minimal human validation, our approach is adaptable across domains while reducing the need for large labeled datasets. Our method generates interpretable natural language user profiles, condensing extensive user data into a scale that unlocks LLMs' reasoning and knowledge capabilities for downstream social network tasks. We contribute a Persian political Twitter (X) dataset and an LLM-based evaluation framework with human validation. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and traditional methods by 9.8%, demonstrating its effectiveness in creating flexible, adaptable, and interpretable user profiles.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem widely applied in logistics distribution and transportation management. Its complexity stems from the constraints of vehicle capacity and time windows, which pose significant challenges to traditional approaches. Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) provide new possibilities for finding approximate solutions to CVRPTW. This paper proposes a novel LLM-enhanced Q-learning framework to address the CVRPTW with real-time emergency constraints. Our solution introduces an adaptive two-phase training mechanism that transitions from the LLM-guided exploration phase to the autonomous optimization phase of Q-network. To ensure reliability, we design a three-tier self-correction mechanism based on the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for LLMs: syntactic validation, semantic verification, and physical constraint enforcement. In addition, we also prioritized replay of the experience generated by LLMs to amplify the regulatory role of LLMs in the architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves a 7.3\% average reduction in cost compared to traditional Q-learning, with fewer training steps required for convergence.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retouching is an essential task in post-manipulation of raw photographs. Generative editing, guided by text or strokes, provides a new tool accessible to users but can easily change the identity of the original objects in unacceptable and unpredictable ways. In contrast, although traditional procedural edits, as commonly supported by photoediting tools (e.g., Gimp, Lightroom), are conservative, they are still preferred by professionals. Unfortunately, professional quality retouching involves many individual procedural editing operations that is challenging to plan for most novices. In this paper, we ask if a multimodal large language model (MLLM) can be taught to critique raw photographs, suggest suitable remedies, and finally realize them with a given set of pre-authored procedural image operations. We demonstrate that MLLMs can be first made aware of the underlying image processing operations, by training them to solve specially designed visual puzzles. Subsequently, such an operation-aware MLLM can both plan and propose edit sequences. To facilitate training, given a set of expert-edited photos, we synthesize a reasoning dataset by procedurally manipulating the expert edits and then grounding a pretrained LLM on the visual adjustments, to synthesize reasoning for finetuning. The proposed retouching operations are, by construction, understandable by the users, preserve object details and resolution, and can be optionally overridden. We evaluate our setup on a variety of test examples and show advantages, in terms of explainability and identity preservation, over existing generative and other procedural alternatives.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces a novel in-context learning (ICL) framework, inspired by large language models (LLMs), for soft-input soft-output channel equalization in coded multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The proposed approach learns to infer posterior symbol distributions directly from a prompt of pilot signals and decoder feedback. A key innovation is the use of prompt augmentation to incorporate extrinsic information from the decoder output as additional context, enabling the ICL model to refine its symbol estimates iteratively across turbo decoding iterations. Two model variants, based on Transformer and state-space architectures, are developed and evaluated. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, when traditional linear assumptions break down, e.g., in the presence of low-resolution quantization, ICL equalizers consistently outperform conventional model-based baselines, even when the latter are provided with perfect channel state information. Results also highlight the advantage of Transformer-based models under limited training diversity, as well as the efficiency of state-space models in resource-constrained scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work presents a new approach to anomaly detection and localization in synthetic aperture radar imagery (SAR), expanding upon the existing patch distribution modeling framework (PaDiM). We introduce the adaptive cosine estimator (ACE) detection statistic. PaDiM uses the Mahalanobis distance at inference, an unbounded metric. ACE instead uses the cosine similarity metric, providing bounded anomaly detection scores. The proposed method is evaluated across multiple SAR datasets, with performance metrics including the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) at the image and pixel level, aiming for increased performance in anomaly detection and localization of SAR imagery. The code is publicly available: https://github.com/Advanced-Vision-and-Learning-Lab/PaDiM-ACE.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce a scaling law for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) under fixed compute budgets that explicitly accounts for data composition. Conventional approaches measure training data solely by total tokens, yet the number of examples and their average token length -- what we term \emph{dataset volume} -- play a decisive role in model performance. Our formulation is tuned following established procedures. Experiments on the BRICC dataset \cite{salavati2024reducing} and subsets of the MMLU dataset \cite{hendrycks2021measuringmassivemultitasklanguage}, evaluated under multiple subsampling strategies, reveal that data composition significantly affects token efficiency. These results motivate refined scaling laws for practical LLM fine-tuning in resource-constrained settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Foundation models are transforming machine learning across many modalities, with in-context learning replacing classical model training. Recent work on tabular data hints at a similar opportunity to build foundation models for classification for numerical data. However, existing meta-learning approaches can not compete with tree-based methods in terms of inference time. In this paper, we propose MotherNet, a hypernetwork architecture trained on synthetic classification tasks that, once prompted with a never-seen-before training set generates the weights of a trained ``child'' neural-network by in-context learning using a single forward pass. In contrast to most existing hypernetworks that are usually trained for relatively constrained multi-task settings, MotherNet can create models for multiclass classification on arbitrary tabular datasets without any dataset specific gradient descent. The child network generated by MotherNet outperforms neural networks trained using gradient descent on small datasets, and is comparable to predictions by TabPFN and standard ML methods like Gradient Boosting. Unlike a direct application of TabPFN, MotherNet generated networks are highly efficient at inference time. We also demonstrate that HyperFast is unable to perform effective in-context learning on small datasets, and heavily relies on dataset specific fine-tuning and hyper-parameter tuning, while MotherNet requires no fine-tuning or per-dataset hyper-parameters.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite growing interest in automated hate speech detection, most existing approaches overlook the linguistic diversity of online content. Multilingual instruction-tuned large language models such as LLaMA, Aya, Qwen, and BloomZ offer promising capabilities across languages, but their effectiveness in identifying hate speech through zero-shot and few-shot prompting remains underexplored. This work evaluates LLM prompting-based detection across eight non-English languages, utilizing several prompting techniques and comparing them to fine-tuned encoder models. We show that while zero-shot and few-shot prompting lag behind fine-tuned encoder models on most of the real-world evaluation sets, they achieve better generalization on functional tests for hate speech detection. Our study also reveals that prompt design plays a critical role, with each language often requiring customized prompting techniques to maximize performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose Rec-R1, a general reinforcement learning framework that bridges large language models (LLMs) with recommendation systems through closed-loop optimization. Unlike prompting and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Rec-R1 directly optimizes LLM generation using feedback from a fixed black-box recommendation model, without relying on synthetic SFT data from proprietary models such as GPT-4o. This avoids the substantial cost and effort required for data distillation. To verify the effectiveness of Rec-R1, we evaluate it on two representative tasks: product search and sequential recommendation. Experimental results demonstrate that Rec-R1 not only consistently outperforms prompting- and SFT-based methods, but also achieves significant gains over strong discriminative baselines, even when used with simple retrievers such as BM25. Moreover, Rec-R1 preserves the general-purpose capabilities of the LLM, unlike SFT, which often impairs instruction-following and reasoning. These findings suggest Rec-R1 as a promising foundation for continual task-specific adaptation without catastrophic forgetting.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The concept of signatures and expected signatures is vital in data science, especially for sequential data analysis. The signature transform, a Cartan type development, translates paths into high-dimensional feature vectors, capturing their intrinsic characteristics. Under natural conditions, the expectation of the signature determines the law of the signature, providing a statistical summary of the data distribution. This property facilitates robust modeling and inference in machine learning and stochastic processes. Building on previous work by the present authors [Unified signature cumulants and generalized Magnus expansions, FoM Sigma '22] we here revisit the actual computation of expected signatures, in a general semimartingale setting. Several new formulae are given. A log-transform of (expected) signatures leads to log-signatures (signature cumulants), offering a significant reduction in complexity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present an analysis of the H$\alpha$-emitting ionized gas in the warm phase of the NGC 253 outflow using integral field spectroscopy from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). In each spaxel, we decompose H$\alpha$, [N II], and [S II] emission lines into a system of up to 3 Gaussian components, accounting for the velocity contributions due to the disk and both intercepted walls of an outflow cone. In the approaching southern lobe of the outflow, we find maximum deprojected outflow velocities down to ~ -500 km/s. Velocity gradients of this outflowing gas range from ~ -350 to -550 km/s/kpc with increasing distance from the nucleus. Additionally, [N II]/H$\alpha$ and [S II]/H$\alpha$ integrated line ratios are suggestive of shocks as the dominant ionization source throughout the wind. Electron densities, inferred from the [S II] doublet, peak at 2100 cm$^{-3}$ near the nucleus and reach $\lesssim 50 $cm$^{-3}$ in the wind. Finally, at an uncertainty of 0.3 dex on the inferred mass of $4\times10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$, the mass-outflow rate of the H$\alpha$-emitting gas in the southern outflow lobe is ~ 0.4 M$_{\odot}$/year. This yields a mass-loading factor of $\eta$ ~ 0.1 and a ~ 2% starburst energy efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Tumor documentation in Germany is largely done manually, requiring reading patient records and entering data into structured databases. Large language models (LLMs) could potentially enhance this process by improving efficiency and reliability. This evaluation tests eleven different open source LLMs with sizes ranging from 1-70 billion model parameters on three basic tasks of the tumor documentation process: identifying tumor diagnoses, assigning ICD-10 codes, and extracting the date of first diagnosis. For evaluating the LLMs on these tasks, a dataset of annotated text snippets based on anonymized doctors' notes from urology was prepared. Different prompting strategies were used to investigate the effect of the number of examples in few-shot prompting and to explore the capabilities of the LLMs in general. The models Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 7B, and Mistral NeMo 12 B performed comparably well in the tasks. Models with less extensive training data or having fewer than 7 billion parameters showed notably lower performance, while larger models did not display performance gains. Examples from a different medical domain than urology could also improve the outcome in few-shot prompting, which demonstrates the ability of LLMs to handle tasks needed for tumor documentation. Open source LLMs show a strong potential for automating tumor documentation. Models from 7-12 billion parameters could offer an optimal balance between performance and resource efficiency. With tailored fine-tuning and well-designed prompting, these models might become important tools for clinical documentation in the future. The code for the evaluation is available from https://github.com/stefan-m-lenz/UroLlmEval. We also release the dataset as a new valuable resource that addresses the shortage of authentic and easily accessible benchmarks in German-language medical NLP.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> There has been a recent surge of interest in time series modeling using the Transformer architecture. However, forecasting multivariate time series with Transformer presents a unique challenge as it requires modeling both temporal (cross-time) and variate (cross-variate) dependencies. While Transformer-based models have gained popularity for their flexibility in capturing both sequential and cross-variate relationships, it is unclear how to best integrate these two sources of information in the context of the Transformer architecture while optimizing for both performance and efficiency. We re-purpose the Transformer architecture to effectively model both cross-time and cross-variate dependencies. Our approach begins by embedding each variate independently into a variate-wise representation that captures its cross-time dynamics, and then models cross-variate dependencies through attention mechanisms on these learned embeddings. Gating operations in both cross-time and cross-variate modeling phases regulate information flow, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant features for accurate predictions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 real-world datasets and can be seamlessly integrated into other Transformer-based and LLM-based forecasters, delivering performance improvements up to 20.7\% over original models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper studies the challenge of developing robots capable of understanding under-specified instructions for creating functional object arrangements, such as "set up a dining table for two"; previous arrangement approaches have focused on much more explicit instructions, such as "put object A on the table." We introduce a framework, SetItUp, for learning to interpret under-specified instructions. SetItUp takes a small number of training examples and a human-crafted program sketch to uncover arrangement rules for specific scene types. By leveraging an intermediate graph-like representation of abstract spatial relationships among objects, SetItUp decomposes the arrangement problem into two subproblems: i) learning the arrangement patterns from limited data and ii) grounding these abstract relationships into object poses. SetItUp leverages large language models (LLMs) to propose the abstract spatial relationships among objects in novel scenes as the constraints to be satisfied; then, it composes a library of diffusion models associated with these abstract relationships to find object poses that satisfy the constraints. We validate our framework on a dataset comprising study desks, dining tables, and coffee tables, with the results showing superior performance in generating physically plausible, functional, and aesthetically pleasing object arrangements compared to existing models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce ELA-ZSON, an efficient layout-aware zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) approach designed for complex multi-room indoor environments.   By planning hierarchically leveraging a global topologigal map with layout information and local imperative approach with detailed scene representation memory, ELA-ZSON achieves both efficient and effective navigation.   The process is managed by an LLM-powered agent, ensuring seamless effective planning and navigation, without the need for human interaction, complex rewards, or costly training.   Our experimental results on the MP3D benchmark achieves 85\% object navigation success rate (SR) and 79\% success rate weighted by path length (SPL) (over 40\% point improvement in SR and 60\% improvement in SPL compared to exsisting methods). Furthermore, we validate the robustness of our approach through virtual agent and real-world robotic deployment, showcasing its capability in practical scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce k-LLMmeans, a novel modification of the k-means algorithm for text clustering that leverages LLM-generated summaries as cluster centroids, capturing semantic nuances often missed by purely numerical averages. This design preserves the core optimization properties of k-means while enhancing semantic interpretability and avoiding the scalability and instability issues typical of modern LLM-based clustering. Unlike existing methods, our approach does not increase LLM usage with dataset size and produces transparent intermediate outputs. We further extend it with a mini-batch variant for efficient, real-time clustering of streaming text. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, embeddings, and LLMs show that k-LLMmeans consistently outperforms k-means and other traditional baselines and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art LLM-based clustering, with a fraction of the LLM calls. Finally, we present a case study on sequential text streams and introduce a new benchmark dataset constructed from StackExchange to evaluate text-stream clustering methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper addresses the problem of parameter privacy-preserving data sharing in coupled systems, where a data provider shares data with a data user but wants to protect its sensitive parameters. The shared data affects not only the data user's decision-making but also the data provider's operations through system interactions. To trade off control performance and privacy, we propose an interaction-aware privacy-preserving data sharing approach. Our approach generates distorted data by minimizing a combination of (i) mutual information, quantifying privacy leakage of sensitive parameters, and (ii) the impact of distorted data on the data provider's control performance, considering the interactions between stakeholders. The optimization problem is formulated into a Bellman equation and solved by a particle filter reinforcement learning (RL)-based approach. Compared to existing RL-based methods, our formulation significantly reduces history dependency and efficiently handles scenarios with continuous state space. Validated in a mixed-autonomy platoon scenario, our method effectively protects sensitive driving behavior parameters of human-driven vehicles (HDVs) against inference attacks while maintaining negligible impact on fuel efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> People experiencing severe distress increasingly use Large Language Model (LLM) chatbots as mental health support tools. Discussions on social media have described how engagements were lifesaving for some, but evidence suggests that general-purpose LLM chatbots also have notable risks that could endanger the welfare of users if not designed responsibly. In this study, we investigate the lived experiences of people who have used LLM chatbots for mental health support. We build on interviews with 21 individuals from globally diverse backgrounds to analyze how users create unique support roles for their chatbots, fill in gaps in everyday care, and navigate associated cultural limitations when seeking support from chatbots. We ground our analysis in psychotherapy literature around effective support, and introduce the concept of therapeutic alignment, or aligning AI with therapeutic values for mental health contexts. Our study offers recommendations for how designers can approach the ethical and effective use of LLM chatbots and other AI mental health support tools in mental health care.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We entertain the constraints that the absence of vacuum Cherenkov radiation of ultrahigh-energy electrons inferred from LHAASO observations of the Crab Nebula can impose on generic models in which Lorentz symmetry of the particle vacuum is violated, as established by some recent studies in \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2022.137034}{\emph{Phys. Lett. B} {\bf 829} (2022) 137034}; \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2022.137536}{{\bf 835} (2022) 137536}; \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.063006}{\emph{Phys. Rev. D} {\bf108} (2023) 063006}. We demonstrate in the present paper, that implementing a phenomenological approach to the Lorentz violation, the rates of this vacuum process are substantial such that one is justified in deriving bounds on the violation scales from simple threshold analysis just as these works did. Albeit such results are likely effective then, they do not apply in the same form among scenarios. Specifically, we show that these Cherenkov constraints are naturally evaded in models of space-time foam inspired from~(supercritical) string theory, involving D-branes as space-time defects in a brane-world scenario, in which subluminous energy-dependent refractive indices of light have been suggested. We examine here two specific foam situations and find for both cases~(though, for different reasons) the potentiality that charged quanta such as electrons do \emph{not} radiate as they pass through the gravitational vacuum `medium' despite moving faster than photons.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are conversational interfaces. As such, LLMs have the potential to assist their users not only when they can fully specify the task at hand, but also to help them define, explore, and refine what they need through multi-turn conversational exchange. Although analysis of LLM conversation logs has confirmed that underspecification occurs frequently in user instructions, LLM evaluation has predominantly focused on the single-turn, fully-specified instruction setting. In this work, we perform large-scale simulation experiments to compare LLM performance in single- and multi-turn settings. Our experiments confirm that all the top open- and closed-weight LLMs we test exhibit significantly lower performance in multi-turn conversations than single-turn, with an average drop of 39% across six generation tasks. Analysis of 200,000+ simulated conversations decomposes the performance degradation into two components: a minor loss in aptitude and a significant increase in unreliability. We find that LLMs often make assumptions in early turns and prematurely attempt to generate final solutions, on which they overly rely. In simpler terms, we discover that *when LLMs take a wrong turn in a conversation, they get lost and do not recover*.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The recent popularity of foundation models and the pre-train-and-adapt paradigm, where a large-scale model is transferred to downstream tasks, is gaining attention for volumetric medical image segmentation. However, current transfer learning strategies devoted to full fine-tuning for transfer learning may require significant resources and yield sub-optimal results when the labeled data of the target task is scarce. This makes its applicability in real clinical settings challenging since these institutions are usually constrained on data and computational resources to develop proprietary solutions. To address this challenge, we formalize Few-Shot Efficient Fine-Tuning (FSEFT), a novel and realistic scenario for adapting medical image segmentation foundation models. This setting considers the key role of both data- and parameter-efficiency during adaptation. Building on a foundation model pre-trained on open-access CT organ segmentation sources, we propose leveraging Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning and black-box Adapters to address such challenges. Furthermore, novel efficient adaptation methodologies are introduced in this work, which include Spatial black-box Adapters that are more appropriate for dense prediction tasks and constrained transductive inference, leveraging task-specific prior knowledge. Our comprehensive transfer learning experiments confirm the suitability of foundation models in medical image segmentation and unveil the limitations of popular fine-tuning strategies in few-shot scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurate defect detection of photovoltaic (PV) cells is critical for ensuring quality and efficiency in intelligent PV manufacturing systems. However, the scarcity of rich defect data poses substantial challenges for effective model training. While existing methods have explored generative models to augment datasets, they often suffer from instability, limited diversity, and domain shifts. To address these issues, we propose PDIG, a Photovoltaic Defect Image Generator based on Stable Diffusion (SD). PDIG leverages the strong priors learned from large-scale datasets to enhance generation quality under limited data. Specifically, we introduce a Semantic Concept Embedding (SCE) module that incorporates text-conditioned priors to capture the relational concepts between defect types and their appearances. To further enrich the domain distribution, we design a Lightweight Industrial Style Adaptor (LISA), which injects industrial defect characteristics into the SD model through cross-disentangled attention. At inference, we propose a Text-Image Dual-Space Constraints (TIDSC) module, enforcing the quality of generated images via positional consistency and spatial smoothing alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDIG achieves superior realism and diversity compared to state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, our approach improves Frechet Inception Distance (FID) by 19.16 points over the second-best method and significantly enhances the performance of downstream defect detection tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent research have demonstrated LLMs' impressive performance in math and reasoning. However, the capacity of LLMs to address math problems under unconventional conditions, such as internal inconsistencies and flawed assumptions, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel benchmark Unreasonable Math Problem (UMP) designed to assess LLMs' ability to recognize and respond to unreasonability in math problem. The benchmark consists of a carefully curated collection of unreasonable math questions across diverse types. Based on extensive experiments covering 19 LLMs, we observe that even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o achieve only limited performance of 0.6 in UMP, while reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 are prone to overthinking and unstable. We further explore strategies for improving the recognition of unreasonable inputs, shedding light on both the possibility and limitations of LLMs in this challenging setting.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This study systematically evaluates 27 frontier Large Language Models on eight diverse biology benchmarks spanning molecular biology, genetics, cloning, virology, and biosecurity. Models from major AI developers released between November 2022 and April 2025 were assessed through ten independent runs per benchmark. The findings reveal dramatic improvements in biological capabilities. Top model performance increased more than 4-fold on the challenging text-only subset of the Virology Capabilities Test over the study period, with the top model now performing twice as well as expert virologists. Several models now match or exceed expert-level performance on other challenging benchmarks, including LAB-Bench CloningScenarios and the biology subsets of GPQA and WMDP. Contrary to expectations, chain-of-thought did not substantially improve performance over zero-shot evaluation, while extended reasoning features in o3-mini and Claude 3.7 Sonnet typically improved performance as predicted by inference scaling. Benchmarks such as PubMedQA and the MMLU and WMDP biology subsets exhibited performance plateaus well below 100%, suggesting benchmark saturation and errors in the underlying benchmark data. The analysis highlights the need for more sophisticated evaluation methodologies as AI systems continue to advance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Limitations in Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities for hardware design tasks, such as generating functional Verilog codes, have motivated various fine-tuning optimizations utilizing curated hardware datasets from open-source repositories. However, these datasets remain limited in size and contain minimal checks on licensing for reuse, resulting in potential copyright violations by fine-tuned LLMs. Therefore, we propose an evaluation benchmark to estimate the risk of Verilog-trained LLMs to generate copyright-protected codes. To minimize this risk, we present an open-source Verilog dataset, FreeSet, containing over 220k files, along with the automated dataset curation framework utilized to provide additional guarantees of fair-use Verilog data. We then execute an LLM fine-tuning framework consisting of continual pre-training, resulting in a fine-tuned Llama model for Verilog, FreeV. Our results indicate that FreeV demonstrates the smallest risk of copyright-infringement among prior works, with only a 3% violation rate. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate improvements in Verilog generation functionality over its baseline model, improving VerilogEval pass@10 rates by over 10%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Testing is an essential part of software development. Test generation tools attempt to automate the otherwise labor-intensive task of test creation, but generating high-coverage tests remains challenging. This paper proposes CoverUp, a novel approach to driving the generation of high-coverage Python regression tests. CoverUp combines coverage analysis, code context, and feedback in prompts that iteratively guide the LLM to generate tests that improve line and branch coverage. We evaluate our prototype CoverUp implementation across a benchmark of challenging code derived from open-source Python projects and show that CoverUp substantially improves on the state of the art. Compared to CodaMosa, a hybrid search/LLM-based test generator, CoverUp achieves a per-module median line+branch coverage of 80% (vs. 47%). Compared to MuTAP, a mutation- and LLM-based test generator, CoverUp achieves an overall line+branch coverage of 89% (vs. 77%). We also demonstrate that CoverUp's performance stems not only from the LLM used but from the combined effectiveness of its components.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing demand for generative AI as Large Language Models (LLMs) services has driven the need for specialized hardware architectures that optimize computational efficiency and energy consumption. This paper evaluates the performance of the Tenstorrent Grayskull e75 RISC-V accelerator for basic linear algebra kernels at reduced numerical precision, a fundamental operation in LLM computations. We present a detailed characterization of Grayskull's execution model, gridsize, matrix dimensions, data formats, and numerical precision impact computational efficiency. Furthermore, we compare Grayskull's performance against state-of-the-art architectures with tensor acceleration, including Intel Sapphire Rapids processors and two NVIDIA GPUs (V100 and A100). Whilst NVIDIA GPUs dominate raw performance, Grayskull demonstrates a competitive trade-off between power consumption and computational throughput, reaching a peak of 1.55 TFLOPs/Watt with BF16.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As the Large-scale Language Models (LLMs) continue to scale, the requisite computational power and bandwidth escalate. To address this, we introduce UB-Mesh, a novel AI datacenter network architecture designed to enhance scalability, performance, cost-efficiency and availability. Unlike traditional datacenters that provide symmetrical node-to-node bandwidth, UB-Mesh employs a hierarchically localized nD-FullMesh network topology. This design fully leverages the data locality of LLM training, prioritizing short-range, direct interconnects to minimize data movement distance and reduce switch usage.   Although UB-Mesh's nD-FullMesh topology offers several theoretical advantages, its concrete architecture design, physical implementation and networking system optimization present new challenges. For the actual construction of UB-Mesh, we first design the UB-Mesh-Pod architecture, which is based on a 4D-FullMesh topology. UB-Mesh-Pod is implemented via a suite of hardware components that serve as the foundational building blocks, including specifically-designed NPU, CPU, Low-Radix-Switch (LRS), High-Radix-Switch (HRS), NICs and others. These components are interconnected via a novel Unified Bus (UB) technique, which enables flexible IO bandwidth allocation and hardware resource pooling. For networking system optimization, we propose advanced routing mechanism named All-Path-Routing (APR) to efficiently manage data traffic. These optimizations, combined with topology-aware performance enhancements and robust reliability measures like 64+1 backup design, result in 2.04x higher cost-efficiency, 7.2% higher network availability compared to traditional Clos architecture and 95%+ linearity in various LLM training tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> There are no clean samples in nature. Therefore, when we come to discuss the entanglement properties of quantum materials, the effects of disorder must be taken into account. This question is of particular interest for high-entangled phases, such as quantum spin liquids, which lie outside the Landau paradigm for classifying phases of matter. In this work, we explore what experimentally-accessible measures, in the form of concurrence, residual tangle and quantum Fisher information, can teach us about the entanglement in the presence of disorder. As a representative example, we consider the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLL) and disorder-driven random singlet (RS) phases found in antiferromagnetic quantum spin chains. Using quantum Fisher information and residual tangle, we demonstrate that both TLL and RS phases exhibit multi-partite entanglement. In the case of the RS phase, we attribute this to entanglement localized below a crossover length scale. We further show that the order of disorder average matters in calculating measures like concurrence, and that this can lead to false inferences when interpreting experiment. Nonetheless, correctly interpreted, these witnesses provide useful information about the effects of disorder. We explore how information about the central charge of the TLL can be extracted from the low-temperature behavior of concurrence, and conjecture that this analysis can be extended to the effective central charge of the RS phase. Finally, we establish how RS and TLL phases can be distinguished through the growth of multi-partite entanglement, as witnessed by the equal-time structure factor. These results establish that, used carefully, experiments based on entanglement witnesses can provide important information about quantum spin systems in the presence of disorder.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Assessing how well a large language model (LLM) understands human, rather than merely text, remains an open challenge. To bridge the gap, we introduce Sentient Agent as a Judge (SAGE), an automated evaluation framework that measures an LLM's higher-order social cognition. SAGE instantiates a Sentient Agent that simulates human-like emotional changes and inner thoughts during interaction, providing a more realistic evaluation of the tested model in multi-turn conversations. At every turn, the agent reasons about (i) how its emotion changes, (ii) how it feels, and (iii) how it should reply, yielding a numerical emotion trajectory and interpretable inner thoughts. Experiments on 100 supportive-dialogue scenarios show that the final Sentient emotion score correlates strongly with Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory (BLRI) ratings and utterance-level empathy metrics, validating psychological fidelity. We also build a public Sentient Leaderboard covering 18 commercial and open-source models that uncovers substantial gaps (up to 4x) between frontier systems (GPT-4o-Latest, Gemini2.5-Pro) and earlier baselines, gaps not reflected in conventional leaderboards (e.g., Arena). SAGE thus provides a principled, scalable and interpretable tool for tracking progress toward genuinely empathetic and socially adept language agents.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To determine an optimal plan for complex tasks, one often deals with dynamic and hierarchical relationships between several entities. Traditionally, such problems are tackled with optimal control, which relies on the optimization of cost functions; instead, a recent biologically-motivated proposal casts planning and control as an inference process. Active inference assumes that action and perception are two complementary aspects of life whereby the role of the former is to fulfill the predictions inferred by the latter. Here, we present an active inference approach that exploits discrete and continuous processing, based on three features: the representation of potential body configurations in relation to the objects of interest; the use of hierarchical relationships that enable the agent to easily interpret and flexibly expand its body schema for tool use; the definition of potential trajectories related to the agent's intentions, used to infer and plan with dynamic elements at different temporal scales. We evaluate this deep hybrid model on a habitual task: reaching a moving object after having picked a moving tool. We show that the model can tackle the presented task under different conditions. This study extends past work on planning as inference and advances an alternative direction to optimal control.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As Large Language Models (LLMs) become widely accessible, a detailed understanding of their knowledge within specific domains becomes necessary for successful real world use. This is particularly critical in public health, where failure to retrieve relevant, accurate, and current information could significantly impact UK residents. However, currently little is known about LLM knowledge of UK Government public health information. To address this issue, this paper introduces a new benchmark, PubHealthBench, with over 8000 questions for evaluating LLMs' Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) and free form responses to public health queries, created via an automated pipeline. We also release a new dataset of the extracted UK Government public health guidance documents used as source text for PubHealthBench. Assessing 24 LLMs on PubHealthBench we find the latest private LLMs (GPT-4.5, GPT-4.1 and o1) have a high degree of knowledge, achieving >90% in the MCQA setup, and outperform humans with cursory search engine use. However, in the free form setup we see lower performance with no model scoring >75%. Therefore, whilst there are promising signs that state of the art (SOTA) LLMs are an increasingly accurate source of public health information, additional safeguards or tools may still be needed when providing free form responses on public health topics.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Some transition disks host misaligned inner disks with radii of several au. Understanding the geometric and physical properties of these misaligned disks is essential for advancing terrestrial planet formation models. This study introduces a novel method to infer the three-dimensional structures of both inner and outer disks by analyzing non-axisymmetric shadows and the horizon in optical and infrared scattered light images of the outer disk. This method was applied to the HD 100453 system, in which infrared scattered light images from the Very Large Telescope revealed disk shadows. These results indicate that the inner disk is misaligned by $\sim$70$^{\circ}$ relative to the outer disk, which is consistent with the results of previous studies. The aspect ratio of the inner disk surface was estimated to be 0.17, which may reflect the surface height of the optically thick dusty component due to vertical lofting by MHD winds or turbulence. In addition, the surface height distribution of the outer disk was characterized, providing novel insights into its vertical structure.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs) play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). While recent advancements have primarily focused on improving the model structure and training data of MRMs, there has been limited exploration into the effectiveness of long-term reasoning capabilities for reward modeling and how to activate these capabilities in MRMs. In this paper, we explore how Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be used to improve reward modeling. Specifically, we reformulate the reward modeling problem as a rule-based RL task. However, we observe that directly applying existing RL algorithms, such as Reinforce++, to reward modeling often leads to training instability or even collapse due to the inherent limitations of these algorithms. To address this issue, we propose the StableReinforce algorithm, which refines the training loss, advantage estimation strategy, and reward design of existing RL methods. These refinements result in more stable training dynamics and superior performance. To facilitate MRM training, we collect 200K preference data from diverse datasets. Our reward model, R1-Reward, trained using the StableReinforce algorithm on this dataset, significantly improves performance on multimodal reward modeling benchmarks. Compared to previous SOTA models, R1-Reward achieves a $8.4\%$ improvement on the VL Reward-Bench and a $14.3\%$ improvement on the Multimodal Reward Bench. Moreover, with more inference compute, R1-Reward's performance is further enhanced, highlighting the potential of RL algorithms in optimizing MRMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reliance on spurious correlations (shortcuts) has been shown to underlie many of the successes of language models. Previous work focused on identifying the input elements that impact prediction. We investigate how shortcuts are actually processed within the model's decision-making mechanism. We use actor names in movie reviews as controllable shortcuts with known impact on the outcome. We use mechanistic interpretability methods and identify specific attention heads that focus on shortcuts. These heads gear the model towards a label before processing the complete input, effectively making premature decisions that bypass contextual analysis. Based on these findings, we introduce Head-based Token Attribution (HTA), which traces intermediate decisions back to input tokens. We show that HTA is effective in detecting shortcuts in LLMs and enables targeted mitigation by selectively deactivating shortcut-related attention heads.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces Unilogit, a novel self-distillation method for machine unlearning in Large Language Models. Unilogit addresses the challenge of selectively forgetting specific information while maintaining overall model utility, a critical task in compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR. Unlike prior methods that rely on static hyperparameters or starting model outputs, Unilogit dynamically adjusts target logits to achieve a uniform probability for the target token, leveraging the current model's outputs for more accurate self-distillation targets. This approach not only eliminates the need for additional hyperparameters but also enhances the model's ability to approximate the golden targets. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and an in-house e-commerce dataset demonstrate Unilogit's superior performance in balancing forget and retain objectives, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as NPO and UnDIAL. Our analysis further reveals Unilogit's robustness across various scenarios, highlighting its practical applicability and effectiveness in achieving efficacious machine unlearning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding visual art requires reasoning across multiple perspectives -- cultural, historical, and stylistic -- beyond mere object recognition. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) perform well on general image captioning, they often fail to capture the nuanced interpretations that fine art demands. We propose ArtRAG, a novel, training-free framework that combines structured knowledge with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for multi-perspective artwork explanation. ArtRAG automatically constructs an Art Context Knowledge Graph (ACKG) from domain-specific textual sources, organizing entities such as artists, movements, themes, and historical events into a rich, interpretable graph. At inference time, a multi-granular structured retriever selects semantically and topologically relevant subgraphs to guide generation. This enables MLLMs to produce contextually grounded, culturally informed art descriptions. Experiments on the SemArt and Artpedia datasets show that ArtRAG outperforms several heavily trained baselines. Human evaluations further confirm that ArtRAG generates coherent, insightful, and culturally enriched interpretations.

In this paper, we explore the performance of 17 popular models used to correct grammatical issues in texts stated in English, German, Italian, and Swedish when using a single model to correct texts in all those languages. We analyze the outputs generated by these models, focusing on decreasing the number of grammatical errors while keeping the changes small. The conclusions drawn help us understand what problems occur among those models and which models can be recommended for multilingual grammatical error correction tasks. We list six models that improve grammatical correctness in all four languages and show that Gemma 9B is currently the best performing one for the languages considered.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large-scale pre-trained models have achieved remarkable success in language and image tasks, leading an increasing number of studies to explore the application of pre-trained image models, such as CLIP, in the domain of few-shot action recognition (FSAR). However, current methods generally suffer from several problems: 1) Direct fine-tuning often undermines the generalization capability of the pre-trained model; 2) The exploration of task-specific information is insufficient in the visual tasks; 3) The semantic order information is typically overlooked during text modeling; 4) Existing cross-modal alignment techniques ignore the temporal coupling of multimodal information. To address these, we propose Task-Adapter++, a parameter-efficient dual adaptation method for both image and text encoders. Specifically, to make full use of the variations across different few-shot learning tasks, we design a task-specific adaptation for the image encoder so that the most discriminative information can be well noticed during feature extraction. Furthermore, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate detailed sequential sub-action descriptions for each action class, and introduce semantic order adapters into the text encoder to effectively model the sequential relationships between these sub-actions. Finally, we develop an innovative fine-grained cross-modal alignment strategy that actively maps visual features to reside in the same temporal stage as semantic descriptions. Extensive experiments fully demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5 benchmarks consistently.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In response to the challenge of accommodating non-Gaussian behaviour in data, the shifted asymmetric Laplace (SAL) cluster-weighted model (SALCWM) is introduced as a model-based method for jointly clustering responses and random covariates that exhibit skewness. Within each cluster, the multivariate SAL distribution is assumed for both the covariates and the responses given the covariates. To mitigate the effect of possible atypical observations, a heavy-tailed extension, the contaminated SALCWM (cSALCWM), is also proposed. In addition to the SALCWM parameters, each mixture component has a parameter controlling the proportion of outliers, one controlling the proportion of leverage points, one specifying the degree of outlierness, and another specifying the degree of leverage. The cSALCWM has the added benefit that once the model parameters are estimated and the observations are assigned to components, a more refined intra-group classification in typical points, (mild) outliers, good leverage, and bad leverage points can be directly obtained. An expectation-conditional maximization algorithm is developed for efficient maximum likelihood parameter estimation under this framework. Theoretical identifiability conditions are established, and empirical results from simulation studies and validation via real-world applications demonstrate that the cSALCWM not only preserves the modelling strengths of the SALCWM but also significantly enhances outlier detection and overall inference reliability. The methodology proposed in this paper has been implemented in an \texttt{R} package, which is publicly available at https://github.com/arnootto/ALCWM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite remarkable progress in machine learning, current AI systems continue to fall short of true human-like intelligence. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in pattern recognition and response generation, they lack genuine understanding - an essential hallmark of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Existing AGI evaluation methods fail to offer a practical, gradual, and informative metric. This paper introduces the Artificial General Intelligence Test Bed (AGITB), comprising twelve rigorous tests that form a signal-processing-level foundation for the potential emergence of cognitive capabilities. AGITB evaluates intelligence through a model's ability to predict binary signals across time without relying on symbolic representations or pretraining. Unlike high-level tests grounded in language or perception, AGITB focuses on core computational invariants reflective of biological intelligence, such as determinism, sensitivity, and generalisation. The test bed assumes no prior bias, operates independently of semantic meaning, and ensures unsolvability through brute force or memorization. While humans pass AGITB by design, no current AI system has met its criteria, making AGITB a compelling benchmark for guiding and recognizing progress toward AGI.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Grasping has been a long-standing challenge in facilitating the final interface between a robot and the environment. As environments and tasks become complicated, the need to embed higher intelligence to infer from the surroundings and act on them has become necessary. Although most methods utilize techniques to estimate grasp pose by treating the problem via pure sampling-based approaches in the six-degree-of-freedom space or as a learning problem, they usually fail in real-life settings owing to poor generalization across domains. In addition, the time taken to generate the grasp plan and the lack of repeatability, owing to sampling inefficiency and the probabilistic nature of existing grasp planning approaches, severely limits their application in real-world tasks. This paper presents a lightweight analytical approach towards robotic grasp planning, particularly antipodal grasps, with little to no sampling in the six-degree-of-freedom space. The proposed grasp planning algorithm is formulated as an optimization problem towards estimating grasp points on the object surface instead of directly estimating the end-effector pose. To this extent, a soft-region-growing algorithm is presented for effective plane segmentation, even in the case of curved surfaces. An optimization-based quality metric is then used for the evaluation of grasp points to ensure indirect force closure. The proposed grasp framework is compared with the existing state-of-the-art grasp planning approach, Grasp pose detection (GPD), as a baseline over multiple simulated objects. The effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison to GPD is also evaluated in a real-world setting using image and point-cloud data, with the planned grasps being executed using a ROBOTIQ gripper and UR5 manipulator.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the widespread adoption of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, there is a growing demand for efficient inference on memory-constrained devices. While offloading expert parameters to CPU memory and loading activated experts on demand has emerged as a potential solution, the large size of activated experts overburdens the limited PCIe bandwidth, hindering the effectiveness in latency-sensitive scenarios. To mitigate this, we propose FloE, an on-the-fly MoE inference system on memory-constrained GPUs. FloE is built on the insight that there exists substantial untapped redundancy within sparsely activated experts. It employs various compression techniques on the expert's internal parameter matrices to reduce the data movement load, combined with low-cost sparse prediction, achieving perceptible inference acceleration in wall-clock time on resource-constrained devices. Empirically, FloE achieves a 9.3x compression of parameters per expert in Mixtral-8x7B; enables deployment on a GPU with only 11GB VRAM, reducing the memory footprint by up to 8.5x; and delivers a 48.7x inference speedup compared to DeepSpeed-MII on a single GeForce RTX 3090.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in large language models (LLMs) is challenging because benchmarks can quickly become stale. Questions initially requiring retrieval may become answerable from pretraining knowledge as newer models incorporate more recent information during pretraining, making it difficult to distinguish evidence-based reasoning from recall. We introduce NeoQA (News Events for Out-of-training Question Answering), a benchmark designed to address this issue. To construct NeoQA, we generated timelines and knowledge bases of fictional news events and entities along with news articles and Q\&A pairs to prevent LLMs from leveraging pretraining knowledge, ensuring that no prior evidence exists in their training data. We propose our dataset as a new platform for evaluating evidence-based question answering, as it requires LLMs to generate responses exclusively from retrieved evidence and only when sufficient evidence is available. NeoQA enables controlled evaluation across various evidence scenarios, including cases with missing or misleading details. Our findings indicate that LLMs struggle to distinguish subtle mismatches between questions and evidence, and suffer from short-cut reasoning when key information required to answer a question is missing from the evidence, underscoring key limitations in evidence-based reasoning.

We apply elastic weight consolidation (EWC) to the full set of the model's parameters and investigate language understanding benchmarks, consisting of Arc, Belebele, Gsm8K, Hellaswag, MMLU, TruthfulQA, and Winogrande sets (both in English and Lithuanian versions), and perplexity benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As a critical psychological stress response, micro-expressions (MEs) are fleeting and subtle facial movements revealing genuine emotions. Automatic ME recognition (MER) holds valuable applications in fields such as criminal investigation and psychological diagnosis. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) encodes expressions by identifying activations of specific facial action units (AUs), serving as a key reference for ME analysis. However, current MER methods typically limit AU utilization to defining regions of interest (ROIs) or relying on specific prior knowledge, often resulting in limited performance and poor generalization. To address this, we integrate the CLIP model's powerful cross-modal semantic alignment capability into MER and propose a novel approach namely MER-CLIP. Specifically, we convert AU labels into detailed textual descriptions of facial muscle movements, guiding fine-grained spatiotemporal ME learning by aligning visual dynamics and textual AU-based representations. Additionally, we introduce an Emotion Inference Module to capture the nuanced relationships between ME patterns and emotions with higher-level semantic understanding. To mitigate overfitting caused by the scarcity of ME data, we put forward LocalStaticFaceMix, an effective data augmentation strategy blending facial images to enhance facial diversity while preserving critical ME features. Finally, comprehensive experiments on four benchmark ME datasets confirm the superiority of MER-CLIP. Notably, UF1 scores on CAS(ME)3 reach 0.7832, 0.6544, and 0.4997 for 3-, 4-, and 7-class classification tasks, significantly outperforming previous methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Motifs are thought to be some fundamental components of social face-to-face interaction temporal networks. However, the motifs previously considered are either limited to a handful of nodes and edges, or do not include triangles, which are thought to be of critical relevance to understand the dynamics of social systems. Thus, we introduce a new class of motifs, that include these triangles, are not limited in their number of nodes or edges, and yet can be mined efficiently in any temporal network. Referring to these motifs as the edge-centered motifs, we show analytically how they subsume the Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods motifs of the literature. We also confirm in empirical data that the edge-centered motifs bring relevant information with respect to the Egocentric motifs by using a principle of maximum entropy. Then, we show how mining for the edge-centered motifs in a network can be used to probe for spatial correlations in the underlying dynamics that have produced that network. We deduce an approximate formula for the distribution of the edge-centered motifs in empirical networks of social face-to-face interactions. In the last section of this paper, we explore how the statistics of the edge-centered motifs can be used to infer the complete topology of the network they were sampled from. This leads to the needs of mathematical development, that we inaugurate here under the name of graph tiling theory.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Purpose: Noise resilience in image reconstructions by scan-specific robust artificial neural networks for k-space interpolation (RAKI) is linked to nonlinear activations in k-space. To gain a deeper understanding of this relationship, an image space formalism of RAKI is introduced for analyzing noise propagation analytically, identifying and characterizing image reconstruction features and to describe the role of nonlinear activations in a human readable manner. Methods: The image space formalism for RAKI inference is employed by expressing nonlinear activations in k-space as element-wise multiplications with activation masks, which transform into convolutions in image space. Jacobians of the de-aliased, coil-combined image relative to the aliased coil images can be expressed algebraically, and thus, the noise amplification is quantified analytically (g-factor maps). We analyze the role of nonlinearity for noise resilience by controlling the degree of nonlinearity in the reconstruction model via the negative slope parameter in leaky ReLU. Results: The analytical g-factor maps correspond with those obtained from Monte Carlo simulations and from an auto differentiation approach for in vivo brain images. Apparent blurring and contrast loss artifacts are identified as implications of enhanced noise resilience. These residual artifacts can be traded against noise resilience by adjusting the degree of nonlinearity in the model (Tikhonov-like regularization) in case of limited training data. The inspection of image space activations reveals an autocorrelation pattern leading to a potential center artifact. Conclusion: The image space formalism of RAKI provides the means for analytical quantitative noisepropagation analysis and human-readable visualization of the effects of the nonlinear activation functions in k-space.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant popularity due to their remarkable capabilities in text understanding and generation. However, despite their widespread deployment in inference services such as ChatGPT, concerns about the potential leakage of sensitive user data have arisen. Existing solutions primarily rely on privacy-enhancing technologies to mitigate such risks, facing the trade-off among efficiency, privacy, and utility. To narrow this gap, we propose Cape, a context-aware prompt perturbation mechanism based on differential privacy, to enable efficient inference with an improved privacy-utility trade-off. Concretely, we introduce a hybrid utility function that better captures the token similarity. Additionally, we propose a bucketized sampling mechanism to handle large sampling space, which might lead to long-tail phenomenons. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, along with ablation studies, demonstrate that Cape achieves a better privacy-utility trade-off compared to prior state-of-the-art works.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The capability of large language models to handle long-context information is crucial across various real-world applications. Existing evaluation methods often rely either on real-world long texts, making it difficult to exclude the influence of models' inherent knowledge, or introduce irrelevant filler content to artificially achieve target lengths, reducing assessment effectiveness. To address these limitations, we introduce NeedleBench, a synthetic framework for assessing retrieval and reasoning performance in bilingual long-context tasks with adaptive context lengths. NeedleBench systematically embeds key data points at varying depths to rigorously test model capabilities. Tasks are categorized into two scenarios: information-sparse, featuring minimal relevant details within extensive irrelevant text to simulate simple retrieval tasks; and information-dense (the Ancestral Trace Challenge), where relevant information is continuously distributed throughout the context to simulate complex reasoning tasks. Our experiments reveal that although recent reasoning models like Deepseek-R1 and OpenAI's o3 excel in mathematical reasoning, they struggle with continuous retrieval and reasoning in information-dense scenarios, even at shorter context lengths. We also characterize a phenomenon termed 'under-thinking', where models prematurely conclude reasoning despite available information. NeedleBench thus provides critical insights and targeted tools essential for evaluating and improving LLMs' long-context capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Urban causal research is essential for understanding the complex dynamics of cities and informing evidence-based policies. However, it is challenged by the inefficiency and bias of hypothesis generation, barriers to multimodal data complexity, and the methodological fragility of causal experimentation. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to rethink how urban causal analysis is conducted. This Perspective examines current urban causal research by analyzing taxonomies that categorize research topics, data sources, and methodological approaches to identify structural gaps. We then introduce an LLM-driven conceptual framework, AutoUrbanCI, composed of four distinct modular agents responsible for hypothesis generation, data engineering, experiment design and execution, and results interpretation with policy recommendations. We propose evaluation criteria for rigor and transparency and reflect on implications for human-AI collaboration, equity, and accountability. We call for a new research agenda that embraces AI-augmented workflows not as replacements for human expertise but as tools to broaden participation, improve reproducibility, and unlock more inclusive forms of urban causal reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we go beyond identifying anomalies only in structural terms and think about better anomaly detection motivated by anomaly causes. Most anomalies are regarded as the result of unpredictable defective forces from internal and external sources, and their opposite forces are sought to correct the anomalies. We introduced a Mechanics Complementary framework for 3D anomaly detection (MC4AD) to generate internal and external Corrective forces for each point. A Diverse Anomaly-Generation (DA-Gen) module is first proposed to simulate various anomalies. Then, we present a Corrective Force Prediction Network (CFP-Net) with complementary representations for point-level representation to simulate the different contributions of internal and external corrective forces. A combined loss was proposed, including a new symmetric loss and an overall loss, to constrain the corrective forces properly. As a highlight, we consider 3D anomaly detection in industry more comprehensively, creating a hierarchical quality control strategy based on a three-way decision and contributing a dataset named Anomaly-IntraVariance with intraclass variance to evaluate the model. On the proposed and existing five datasets, we obtained nine state-of-the-art performers with the minimum parameters and the fastest inference speed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Entity Linking (EL) and Relation Extraction (RE) are fundamental tasks in Natural Language Processing, serving as critical components in a wide range of applications. In this paper, we propose ReLiK, a Retriever-Reader architecture for both EL and RE, where, given an input text, the Retriever module undertakes the identification of candidate entities or relations that could potentially appear within the text. Subsequently, the Reader module is tasked to discern the pertinent retrieved entities or relations and establish their alignment with the corresponding textual spans. Notably, we put forward an innovative input representation that incorporates the candidate entities or relations alongside the text, making it possible to link entities or extract relations in a single forward pass and to fully leverage pre-trained language models contextualization capabilities, in contrast with previous Retriever-Reader-based methods, which require a forward pass for each candidate. Our formulation of EL and RE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks while using academic budget training and with up to 40x inference speed compared to competitors. Finally, we show how our architecture can be used seamlessly for Information Extraction (cIE), i.e. EL + RE, and setting a new state of the art by employing a shared Reader that simultaneously extracts entities and relations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated Learning (FL) is widely recognized as a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm due to its model-sharing mechanism that avoids direct data exchange. Nevertheless, model training leaves exploitable traces that can be used to infer sensitive information. In Decentralized FL (DFL), the topology, defining how participants are connected, plays a crucial role in shaping the model's privacy, robustness, and convergence. However, the topology introduces an unexplored vulnerability: attackers can exploit it to infer participant relationships and launch targeted attacks. This work uncovers the hidden risks of DFL topologies by proposing a novel Topology Inference Attack that infers the topology solely from model behavior. A taxonomy of topology inference attacks is introduced, categorizing them by the attacker's capabilities and knowledge. Practical attack strategies are designed for various scenarios, and experiments are conducted to identify key factors influencing attack success. The results demonstrate that analyzing only the model of each node can accurately infer the DFL topology, highlighting a critical privacy risk in DFL systems. These findings offer valuable insights for improving privacy preservation in DFL environments.

Observing sizable cross-correlations among energy fluctuations of different qubits, we conclude that these fluctuations are dominated by charge noise. At low frequencies, the noise spectra do not fit well a power law; rather, we can recognize a few individual two-level fluctuators (TLFs). We demonstrate that the noise cross-correlations allow one to get information on the spatial location of such individual TLFs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficient on-device neural network (NN) inference has various advantages over cloud-based processing, including predictable latency, enhanced privacy, greater reliability, and reduced operating costs for vendors. This has sparked the recent rapid development of microcontroller-scale NN accelerators, often referred to as neural processing units ($\mu$NPUs), designed specifically for ultra-low-power applications.   In this paper we present the first comparative evaluation of a number of commercially-available $\mu$NPUs, as well as the first independent benchmarks for several of these platforms. We develop and open-source a model compilation framework to enable consistent benchmarking of quantized models across diverse $\mu$NPU hardware. Our benchmark targets end-to-end performance and includes model inference latency, power consumption, and memory overhead, alongside other factors. The resulting analysis uncovers both expected performance trends as well as surprising disparities between hardware specifications and actual performance, including $\mu$NPUs exhibiting unexpected scaling behaviors with increasing model complexity. Our framework provides a foundation for further evaluation of $\mu$NPU platforms alongside valuable insights for both hardware designers and software developers in this rapidly evolving space.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose a model for the evolutionary ecology of words as one attempt to extend evolutionary game theory and agent-based models by utilizing the rich linguistic expressions of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our model enables the emergence and evolution of diverse and infinite options for interactions among agents. Within the population, each agent possesses a short word (or phrase) generated by an LLM and moves within a spatial environment. When agents become adjacent, the outcome of their interaction is determined by the LLM based on the relationship between their words, with the loser's word being replaced by the winner's. Word mutations, also based on LLM outputs, may occur. We conducted preliminary experiments assuming that ``strong animal species" would survive. The results showed that from an initial population consisting of well-known species, many species emerged both gradually and in a punctuated equilibrium manner. Each trial demonstrated the unique evolution of diverse populations, with one type of large species becoming dominant, such as terrestrial animals, marine life, or extinct species, which were ecologically specialized and adapted ones across diverse extreme habitats. We also conducted a long-term experiment with a large population, demonstrating the emergence and coexistence of diverse species.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cloud-based mobile agents powered by (multimodal) large language models ((M)LLMs) offer strong reasoning abilities but suffer from high latency and cost. While fine-tuned (M)SLMs enable edge deployment, they often lose general capabilities and struggle with complex tasks. To address this, we propose \textbf{EcoAgent}, an \textbf{E}dge-\textbf{C}loud c\textbf{O}llaborative multi-agent framework for mobile automation. EcoAgent features a closed-loop collaboration among a cloud-based Planning Agent and two edge-based agents: the Execution Agent for action execution and the Observation Agent for verifying outcomes. The Observation Agent uses a Pre-Understanding Module to compress screen images into concise text, reducing token usage and communication overhead. In case of failure, the Planning Agent retrieves screen history through a Memory Module and replans via a Reflection Module. Experiments on AndroidWorld show that EcoAgent achieves task success rates comparable to cloud-based mobile agents while significantly reducing MLLM token consumption, enabling efficient and practical mobile automation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The strong planning and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fostered the development of agent-based systems capable of leveraging external tools and interacting with increasingly complex environments. However, these powerful features also introduce a critical security risk: indirect prompt injection, a sophisticated attack vector that compromises the core of these agents, the LLM, by manipulating contextual information rather than direct user prompts. In this work, we propose a generic black-box fuzzing framework, AgentXploit, designed to automatically discover and exploit indirect prompt injection vulnerabilities across diverse LLM agents. Our approach starts by constructing a high-quality initial seed corpus, then employs a seed selection algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to iteratively refine inputs, thereby maximizing the likelihood of uncovering agent weaknesses. We evaluate AgentXploit on two public benchmarks, AgentDojo and VWA-adv, where it achieves 71% and 70% success rates against agents based on o3-mini and GPT-4o, respectively, nearly doubling the performance of baseline attacks. Moreover, AgentXploit exhibits strong transferability across unseen tasks and internal LLMs, as well as promising results against defenses. Beyond benchmark evaluations, we apply our attacks in real-world environments, successfully misleading agents to navigate to arbitrary URLs, including malicious sites.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Semantic communication technology emerges as a pivotal bridge connecting AI with classical communication. The current semantic communication systems are generally modeled as an Auto-Encoder (AE). AE lacks a deep integration of AI principles with communication strategies due to its inability to effectively capture channel dynamics. This gap makes it difficult to justify the need for joint source-channel coding (JSCC) and to explain why performance improves. This paper begins by exploring lossless and lossy communication, highlighting that the inclusion of data distortion distinguishes semantic communication from classical communication. It breaks the conditions for the separation theorem to hold and explains why the amount of data transferred by semantic communication is less. Therefore, employing JSCC becomes imperative for achieving optimal semantic communication. Moreover, a Variational Source-Channel Coding (VSCC) method is proposed for constructing semantic communication systems based on data distortion theory, integrating variational inference and channel characteristics. Using a deep learning network, we develop a semantic communication system employing the VSCC method and demonstrate its capability for semantic transmission. We also establish semantic communication systems of equivalent complexity employing the AE method and the VAE method. Experimental results reveal that the VSCC model offers superior interpretability compared to AE model, as it clearly captures the semantic features of the transmitted data, represented as the variance of latent variables in our experiments. In addition, VSCC model exhibits superior semantic transmission capabilities compared to VAE model. At the same level of data distortion evaluated by PSNR, VSCC model exhibits stronger human interpretability, which can be partially assessed by SSIM.

Although robotic arms are currently used primarily for functional tasks, there is considerable potential to explore ways to enhance users' body language capabilities during social interactions. This paper introduces an Augmented Body Communicator system that integrates robotic arms and a large language model. Through the incorporation of kinetic memory, disabled users and their supporters can collaboratively design actions for the robot arm. The LLM system then provides suggestions on the most suitable action based on contextual cues during interactions. The system underwent thorough user testing with six participants who have conditions affecting upper limb mobility. Results indicate that the system improves users' ability to express themselves. Based on our findings, we offer recommendations for developing robotic arms that support disabled individuals with body language capabilities and functional tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Magnetars have inferred polar field strengths in excess of the Schwinger limit, where non-linear electromagnetic effects can be significant. Their internal fields may be even stronger, suggesting that Maxwellian characterizations of hydromagnetic structure may require revision. A generalized Grad-Shafranov equation, describing static and axisymmetric fluid stars with mixed poloidal-toroidal fields, is introduced and subsequently solved in a perturbative scheme to calculate quadrupolar deformations. In the Born-Infeld theory, we show that the toroidal field has a maximum strength set by the scale parameter, $b$, implying an upper limit to the stellar prolateness, $|\epsilon_{\rm max}| \sim 10^{-5} \left(b/10^{16}\text{ G}\right)^2$, that is independent of field specifics. Observations of magnetar phenomena that are interpreted as evidence for ellipticity, such as precession, can thus implicitly constrain post-Maxwellian parameters in a way that complements terrestrial experiments. Toroidal ceilings also have implications for dynamo theory and gravitational waves, which we revisit together with field evolution in crusts abiding by beyond-Maxwell physics.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> How can we train graph-based models to recognize unseen classes while keeping labeling costs low? Graph open-set learning (GOL) and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection aim to address this challenge by training models that can accurately classify known, in-distribution (ID) classes while identifying and handling previously unseen classes during inference. It is critical for high-stakes, real-world applications where models frequently encounter unexpected data, including finance, security, and healthcare. However, current GOL methods assume access to many labeled ID samples, which is unrealistic for large-scale graphs due to high annotation costs. In this paper, we propose LEGO-Learn (Label-Efficient Graph Open-set Learning), a novel framework that tackles open-set node classification on graphs within a given label budget by selecting the most informative ID nodes. LEGO-Learn employs a GNN-based filter to identify and exclude potential OOD nodes and then select highly informative ID nodes for labeling using the K-Medoids algorithm. To prevent the filter from discarding valuable ID examples, we introduce a classifier that differentiates between the C known ID classes and an additional class representing OOD nodes (hence, a C+1 classifier). This classifier uses a weighted cross-entropy loss to balance the removal of OOD nodes while retaining informative ID nodes. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate that LEGO-Learn significantly outperforms leading methods, with up to a 6.62% improvement in ID classification accuracy and a 7.49% increase in AUROC for OOD detection.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Radio continuum galaxy surveys can provide a relatively fast map of the projected distribution of structure in the Universe, at the cost of lacking information about the radial distribution. We can use these surveys to learn about the growth of structure and the fundamental physics of the Universe, but doing so requires extra information to be provided in the modelling of the redshift distribution, $dN/dz$. In this work, we show how the cross-correlation of the two dimensional radio continuum map with another galaxy map (in this case a photometric optical extragalactic survey), with a known redshift distribution, can be used to determine the redshift distribution through statistical inference. We use data from the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) Pilot Survey 1 and cross-correlate it with optical data from the Dark Energy Survey to fit the parameters of our $dN/dz$ model. We show that the recovered distribution fits the data much better than current simulated $dN/dz$ models available in the literature, and peaks at a much higher redshift. These results will have significance for future cosmological analyses with large-scale radio continuum surveys such as the full EMU, or with the SKAO.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> There has been a growing interest in translating C code to Rust due to Rust's robust memory and thread safety guarantees. Tools such as C2RUST enable syntax-guided transpilation from C to semantically equivalent Rust code. However, the resulting Rust programs often rely heavily on unsafe constructs--particularly raw pointers--which undermines Rust's safety guarantees. This paper aims to improve the memory safety of Rust programs generated by C2RUST by eliminating raw pointers. Specifically, we propose a peephole raw pointer rewriting technique that lifts raw pointers in individual functions to appropriate Rust data structures. Technically, PR2 employs decision-tree-based prompting to guide the pointer lifting process. Additionally, it leverages code change analysis to guide the repair of errors introduced during rewriting, effectively addressing errors encountered during compilation and test case execution. We implement PR2 as a prototype and evaluate it using gpt-4o-mini on 28 real-world C projects. The results show that PR2 successfully eliminates 13.22% of local raw pointers across these projects, significantly enhancing the safety of the translated Rust code. On average, PR2 completes the transformation of a project in 5.44 hours, at an average cost of $1.46.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent times, the field of unsupervised representation learning (URL) for time series data has garnered significant interest due to its remarkable adaptability across diverse downstream applications. Unsupervised learning goals differ from downstream tasks, making it tricky to ensure downstream task utility by focusing only on temporal feature characterization. Researchers have proposed multiple transformations to extract discriminative patterns implied in informative time series, trying to fill the gap. Despite the introduction of a variety of feature engineering techniques, e.g. spectral domain, wavelet transformed features, features in image form and symbolic features etc. the utilization of intricate feature fusion methods and dependence on heterogeneous features during inference hampers the scalability of the solutions. To address this, our study introduces an innovative approach that focuses on aligning and binding time series representations encoded from different modalities, inspired by spectral graph theory, thereby guiding the neural encoder to uncover latent pattern associations among these multi-modal features. In contrast to conventional methods that fuse features from multiple modalities, our proposed approach simplifies the neural architecture by retaining a single time series encoder, consequently leading to preserved scalability. We further demonstrate and prove mechanisms for the encoder to maintain better inductive bias. In our experimental evaluation, we validated the proposed method on a diverse set of time series datasets from various domains. Our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art URL methods across diverse downstream tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Over the past few years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have developed rapidly and are widely applied in various domains. However, LLMs face the issue of hallucinations, generating responses that may be unreliable when the models lack relevant knowledge. To be aware of potential hallucinations, uncertainty estimation methods have been introduced, and most of them have confirmed that reliability lies in critical tokens. However, probability-based methods perform poorly in identifying token reliability, limiting their practical utility. In this paper, we reveal that the probability-based method fails to estimate token reliability due to the loss of evidence strength information which is accumulated in the training stage. Therefore, we present Logits-induced token uncertainty (LogTokU), a framework for estimating decoupled token uncertainty in LLMs, enabling real-time uncertainty estimation without requiring multiple sampling processes. We employ evidence modeling to implement LogTokU and use the estimated uncertainty to guide downstream tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that LogTokU has significant effectiveness and promise.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Robotic manipulation in 3D requires learning an $N$ degree-of-freedom joint space trajectory of a robot manipulator. Robots must possess semantic and visual perception abilities to transform real-world mappings of their workspace into the low-level control necessary for object manipulation. Recent work has demonstrated the capabilities of fine-tuning large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to learn the mapping between RGB images, language instructions, and joint space control. These models typically take as input RGB images of the workspace and language instructions, and are trained on large datasets of teleoperated robot demonstrations. In this work, we explore methods to improve the scene context awareness of a popular recent Vision-Language-Action model by integrating chain-of-thought reasoning, depth perception, and task-oriented region of interest detection. Our experiments in the LIBERO simulation environment show that our proposed model, 3D-CAVLA, improves the success rate across various LIBERO task suites, achieving an average success rate of 98.1$\%$. We also evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of our method, demonstrating that 3D scene awareness leads to robust learning and adaptation for completely unseen tasks. 3D-CAVLA achieves an absolute improvement of 8.8$\%$ on unseen tasks. We will open-source our code and the unseen tasks dataset to promote community-driven research here: https://3d-cavla.github.io

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Logical reasoning is a critical component of Large Language Models (LLMs), and substantial research efforts in recent years have aimed to enhance their deductive reasoning capabilities. However, existing deductive reasoning benchmarks, which are crucial for evaluating and advancing LLMs, are inadequate due to their lack of task complexity, presence of prior knowledge as a confounder, and superficial error analysis. To address these deficiencies, we introduce JustLogic, a synthetically generated deductive reasoning benchmark designed for rigorous evaluation of LLMs. JustLogic is (i) highly complex, capable of generating a diverse range of linguistic patterns, vocabulary, and argument structures; (ii) prior knowledge independent, eliminating the advantage of models possessing prior knowledge and ensuring that only deductive reasoning is used to answer questions; and (iii) capable of in-depth error analysis on the heterogeneous effects of reasoning depth and argument form on model accuracy. Our experimental results on JustLogic reveal that (i) state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning LLMs perform on par or better than the human average but significantly worse than the human ceiling, and (ii) SOTA non-reasoning models still underperform the human average.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly pushing the limits of contemporary computing hardware. For example, training GPT-3 has been estimated to consume around 1300 MWh of electricity, and projections suggest future models may require city-scale (gigawatt) power budgets. These demands motivate exploration of computing paradigms beyond conventional von Neumann architectures. This review surveys emerging photonic hardware optimized for next-generation generative AI computing. We discuss integrated photonic neural network architectures (e.g., Mach-Zehnder interferometer meshes, lasers, wavelength-multiplexed microring resonators) that perform ultrafast matrix operations. We also examine promising alternative neuromorphic devices, including spiking neural network circuits and hybrid spintronic-photonic synapses, which combine memory and processing. The integration of two-dimensional materials (graphene, TMDCs) into silicon photonic platforms is reviewed for tunable modulators and on-chip synaptic elements. Transformer-based LLM architectures (self-attention and feed-forward layers) are analyzed in this context, identifying strategies and challenges for mapping dynamic matrix multiplications onto these novel hardware substrates. We then dissect the mechanisms of mainstream LLMs, such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and LLaMA, highlighting their architectural similarities and differences. We synthesize state-of-the-art components, algorithms, and integration methods, highlighting key advances and open issues in scaling such systems to mega-sized LLM models. We find that photonic computing systems could potentially surpass electronic processors by orders of magnitude in throughput and energy efficiency, but require breakthroughs in memory, especially for long-context windows and long token sequences, and in storage of ultra-large datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion policies have demonstrated remarkable dexterity and robustness in intricate, high-dimensional robot manipulation tasks, while training from a small number of demonstrations. However, the reason for this performance remains a mystery. In this paper, we offer a surprising hypothesis: diffusion policies essentially memorize an action lookup table -- and this is beneficial. We posit that, at runtime, diffusion policies find the closest training image to the test image in a latent space, and recall the associated training action sequence, offering reactivity without the need for action generalization. This is effective in the sparse data regime, where there is not enough data density for the model to learn action generalization. We support this claim with systematic empirical evidence. Even when conditioned on wildly out of distribution (OOD) images of cats and dogs, the Diffusion Policy still outputs an action sequence from the training data. With this insight, we propose a simple policy, the Action Lookup Table (ALT), as a lightweight alternative to the Diffusion Policy. Our ALT policy uses a contrastive image encoder as a hash function to index the closest corresponding training action sequence, explicitly performing the computation that the Diffusion Policy implicitly learns. We show empirically that for relatively small datasets, ALT matches the performance of a diffusion model, while requiring only 0.0034 of the inference time and 0.0085 of the memory footprint, allowing for much faster closed-loop inference with resource constrained robots. We also train our ALT policy to give an explicit OOD flag when the distance between the runtime image is too far in the latent space from the training images, giving a simple but effective runtime monitor.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Occupations referred to as "dirty work" often face entrenched social stigma, which adversely affects the mental health of workers in these fields and impedes occupational equity. In this study, we propose a novel Interactive Fiction (IF) framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to encourage perspective-taking and reduce biases against these stigmatized yet essential roles. Through an experiment with participants (n = 100) across four such occupations, we observed a significant increase in participants' understanding of these occupations, as well as a high level of empathy and a strong sense of connection to individuals in these roles. Additionally, qualitative interviews with participants (n = 15) revealed that the LLM-based perspective-taking IF enhanced immersion, deepened emotional resonance and empathy toward "dirty work," and allowed participants to experience a sense of professional fulfillment in these occupations. However, participants also highlighted ongoing challenges, such as limited contextual details generated by the LLM and the unintentional reinforcement of existing stereotypes. Overall, our findings underscore that an LLM-based perspective-taking IF framework offers a promising and scalable strategy for mitigating stigma and promoting social equity in marginalized professions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Evaluating user interface (UI) design effectiveness extends beyond aesthetics to influencing user behavior, a principle central to Design Persuasiveness. A/B testing is the predominant method for determining which UI variations drive higher user engagement, but it is costly and time-consuming. While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can process automated UI analysis, current approaches focus on isolated design attributes rather than comparative persuasiveness-the key factor in optimizing user interactions. To address this, we introduce WiserUI-Bench, a benchmark designed for Pairwise UI Design Persuasiveness Assessment task, featuring 300 real-world UI image pairs labeled with A/B test results and expert rationales. Additionally, we propose G-FOCUS, a novel inference-time reasoning strategy that enhances VLM-based persuasiveness assessment by reducing position bias and improving evaluation accuracy. Experimental results show that G-FOCUS surpasses existing inference strategies in consistency and accuracy for pairwise UI evaluation. Through promoting VLM-driven evaluation of UI persuasiveness, our work offers an approach to complement A/B testing, propelling progress in scalable UI preference modeling and design optimization. Code and data will be released publicly.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, the emergence of LLMs has prompted researchers to integrate language descriptions into graphs, aiming to enhance model encoding capabilities from a data-centric perspective. This graph representation is called text-attributed graphs (TAGs). A review of prior advancements highlights that graph structure learning (GSL) is a pivotal technique for improving data utility, making it highly relevant to efficient TAG learning. However, most GSL methods are tailored for traditional graphs without textual information, underscoring the necessity of developing a new GSL paradigm. Despite clear motivations, it remains challenging: (1) How can we define a reasonable optimization objective for GSL in the era of LLMs, considering the massive parameters in LLM? (2) How can we design an efficient model architecture that enables seamless integration of LLM for this optimization objective? For Question 1, we reformulate existing GSL optimization objectives as a tree optimization framework, shifting the focus from obtaining a well-trained edge predictor to a language-aware tree sampler. For Question 2, we propose decoupled and training-free model design principles for LLM integration, shifting the focus from computation-intensive fine-tuning to more efficient inference. Based on this, we propose Large Language and Tree Assistant (LLaTA), which leverages tree-based LLM in-context learning to enhance the understanding of topology and text, enabling reliable inference and generating improved graph structure. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets demonstrate that LLaTA enjoys flexibility-incorporated with any backbone; scalability-outperforms other LLM-enhanced graph learning methods; effectiveness-achieves SOTA predictive performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vehicle trajectories, with their detailed geolocations, are a promising data source to compute traffic flow maps at scales ranging from the city/regional level to the road level. The main obstacle is that trajectory data are prone to measurement noise. While this is negligible for city level large-scale flow aggregation, it poses substantial difficulties for road level small-scale aggregation. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. We deploy these algorithms in an iterative workflow to compute locally aligned flow maps. By applying this workflow to synthetic and empirical trajectories, we verify that our locally aligned flow maps provide high levels of accuracy and spatial resolution of flow aggregation at multiple scales for static and interactive maps.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, many humanoid robots have been increasingly deployed in various facilities, including hospitals and assisted living environments, where they are often remotely controlled by human operators. Their kinematic redundancy enhances reachability and manipulability, enabling them to navigate complex, cluttered environments and perform a wide range of tasks. However, this redundancy also presents significant control challenges, particularly in coordinating the movements of the robot's macro-micro structure (torso and arms). Therefore, we propose various human-robot collaborative (HRC) methods for coordinating the torso and arm of remotely controlled mobile humanoid robots, aiming to balance autonomy and human input to enhance system efficiency and task execution. The proposed methods include human-initiated approaches, where users manually control torso movements, and robot-initiated approaches, which autonomously coordinate torso and arm based on factors such as reachability, task goal, or inferred human intent. We conducted a user study with N=17 participants to compare the proposed approaches in terms of task performance, manipulability, and energy efficiency, and analyzed which methods were preferred by participants.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based models are the foundation of modern machine learning, but their execution, particularly during autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs), places significant pressure on memory systems due to frequent memory accesses and growing key-value (KV) caches. This creates a bottleneck in memory bandwidth, especially as context lengths increase. Processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures are a promising solution, offering high internal bandwidth and compute parallelism near memory. However, current PIM designs are primarily optimized for dense attention and struggle with the dynamic, irregular access patterns introduced by modern KV cache sparsity techniques. Consequently, they suffer from workload imbalance, reducing throughput and resource utilization. In this work, we propose STARC, a novel sparsity-optimized data mapping scheme tailored specifically for efficient LLM decoding on PIM architectures. STARC clusters KV pairs by semantic similarity and maps them to contiguous memory regions aligned with PIM bank structures. During decoding, queries retrieve relevant tokens at cluster granularity by matching against precomputed centroids, enabling selective attention and parallel processing without frequent reclustering or data movement overhead. Experiments on the HBM-PIM system show that, compared to common token-wise sparsity methods, STARC reduces attention-layer latency by 19%--31% and energy consumption by 19%--27%. Under a KV cache budget of 1024, it achieves up to 54%--74% latency reduction and 45%--67% energy reduction compared to full KV cache retrieval. Meanwhile, STARC maintains model accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art sparse attention methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling efficient and hardware-friendly long-context LLM inference on PIM architectures.

Since in public health settings, patients often begin treatment after they become eligible, we account for delay times in treatment initiation. Excellent finite sample properties of the proposed estimator are demonstrated in an extensive simulation study under different delay scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As an information-flow privacy property, opacity characterizes whether a malicious external observer (referred to as an intruder) is able to infer the secret behavior of a system. This paper addresses the problem of opacity enforcement using edit functions in discrete event systems modeled by partially observed deterministic finite automata. A defender uses the edit function as an interface at the output of a system to manipulate actual observations through insertion, substitution, and deletion operations so that the intruder will be prevented from inferring the secret behavior of the system. Unlike existing work which usually assumes that the observation capabilities of the intruder and the defender are identical, we consider a more general setting where they may observe incomparable subsets of events generated by the system.To characterize whether the defender has the ability to enforce opacity of the system under this setting, the notion of \emph{$ic$-enforceability} is introduced. Then, the opacity enforcement problem is transformed to a two-player game, with imperfect information between the system and the defender, which can be used to determine a feasible decision-making strategy for the defender. Within the game scheme, an edit mechanism is constructed to enumerate all feasible edit actions following system behavior. We further show that an $ic$-enforcing edit function (if one exists) can be synthesized from the edit mechanism to enforce opacity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we introduce RWKV-X, a novel hybrid architecture that combines the efficiency of RWKV for short-range modeling with a sparse attention mechanism designed to capture long-range context. Unlike previous hybrid approaches that rely on full attention layers and retain quadratic complexity, RWKV-X achieves linear-time complexity in training and constant-time complexity in inference decoding. We demonstrate that RWKV-X, when continually pretrained on 64K-token sequences, achieves near-perfect accuracy on the 64K passkey retrieval benchmark. It consistently outperforms prior RWKV-7 models on long-context benchmarks, while maintaining strong performance on short-context tasks. These results highlight RWKV-X as a scalable and efficient backbone for general-purpose language modeling, capable of decoding sequences up to 1 million tokens with stable speed and memory usage. To facilitate further research and analysis, we have made the checkpoints and the associated code publicly accessible at: https://github.com/howard-hou/RWKV-X.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Since the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), various research based on such models have maintained significant academic attention and impact, especially in AI and robotics. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent framework with LLMs to construct an integrated system for robotic task analysis, mechanical design, and path generation. The framework includes three core agents: Task Analyst, Robot Designer, and Reinforcement Learning Designer. Outputs are formatted as multimodal results, such as code files or technical reports, for stronger understandability and usability. To evaluate generalizability comparatively, we conducted experiments with models from both GPT and DeepSeek. Results demonstrate that the proposed system can design feasible robots with control strategies when appropriate task inputs are provided, exhibiting substantial potential for enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of robotic system development in research and industrial applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Formal reasoning and automated theorem proving constitute a challenging subfield of machine learning, in which machines are tasked with proving mathematical theorems using formal languages like Lean. A formal verification system can check whether a formal proof is correct or not almost instantaneously, but generating a completely correct formal proof with large language models (LLMs) remains a formidable task. The usual approach in the literature is to prompt the LLM many times (up to several thousands) until one of the generated proofs passes the verification system. In this work, we present APOLLO (Automated PrOof repair via LLM and Lean cOllaboration), a modular, model-agnostic pipeline that combines the strengths of the Lean compiler with an LLM's reasoning abilities to achieve better proof-generation results at a low sampling budget. Apollo directs a fully automated process in which the LLM generates proofs for theorems, a set of agents analyze the proofs, fix the syntax errors, identify the mistakes in the proofs using Lean, isolate failing sub-lemmas, utilize automated solvers, and invoke an LLM on each remaining goal with a low top-K budget. The repaired sub-proofs are recombined and reverified, iterating up to a user-controlled maximum number of attempts. On the miniF2F benchmark, we establish a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 75.0% among 7B-parameter models while keeping the sampling budget below one thousand. Moreover, Apollo raises the state-of-the-art accuracy for Goedel-Prover-SFT to 65.6% while cutting sample complexity from 25,600 to a few hundred. General-purpose models (o3-mini, o4-mini) jump from 3-7% to over 40% accuracy. Our results demonstrate that targeted, compiler-guided repair of LLM outputs yields dramatic gains in both efficiency and correctness, suggesting a general paradigm for scalable automated theorem proving.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have unveiled remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating both natural language and code, but LLM reasoning is prone to hallucination and struggle with complex, novel scenarios, often getting stuck on partial or incorrect solutions. However, the inherent ability of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to explore extensive and complex search spaces makes them particularly effective in scenarios where traditional optimization methodologies may falter. However, EAs explore a vast search space when applied to complex problems.   To address the computational bottleneck of evaluating large populations, particularly crucial for complex evolutionary tasks, we introduce a highly efficient evaluation framework. This implementation maintains compatibility with existing primitive definitions, ensuring the generation of valid individuals.   Using LLMs, we propose an enhanced evolutionary search strategy that enables a more focused exploration of expansive solution spaces. LLMs facilitate the generation of superior candidate solutions, as evidenced by empirical results demonstrating their efficacy in producing improved outcomes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising paradigm for training Large Language Models (LLMs) in a decentralized manner while preserving data privacy and minimizing communication overhead. This survey examines recent advancements in FL-driven LLMs, with a particular emphasis on architectural designs, performance optimization, and security concerns, including the emerging area of machine unlearning. In this context, machine unlearning refers to the systematic removal of specific data contributions from trained models to comply with privacy regulations such as the Right to be Forgotten. We review a range of strategies enabling unlearning in federated LLMs, including perturbation-based methods, model decomposition, and incremental retraining, while evaluating their trade-offs in terms of efficiency, privacy guarantees, and model utility. Through selected case studies and empirical evaluations, we analyze how these methods perform in practical FL scenarios. This survey identifies critical research directions toward developing secure, adaptable, and high-performing federated LLM systems for real-world deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in rewriting text across various styles. However, effectively leveraging this ability for example-based arbitrary style transfer, where an input text is rewritten to match the style of a given exemplar, remains an open challenge. A key question is how to describe the style of the exemplar to guide LLMs toward high-quality rewrites. In this work, we propose a prompting method based on register analysis to guide LLMs to perform this task. Empirical evaluations across multiple style transfer tasks show that our prompting approach enhances style transfer strength while preserving meaning more effectively than existing prompting strategies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in solving complex tasks, making them a promising tool for enhancing tabular learning. However, existing LLM-based methods suffer from high resource requirements, suboptimal demonstration selection, and limited interpretability, which largely hinder their prediction performance and application in the real world. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel in-context learning framework for tabular prediction. The core idea is to leverage the explanations generated by LLMs to guide a smaller, locally deployable Surrogate Language Model (SLM) to make interpretable tabular predictions. Specifically, our framework mainly involves three stages: (i) Post Hoc Explanation Generation, where LLMs are utilized to generate explanations for question-answer pairs in candidate demonstrations, providing insights into the reasoning behind the answer. (ii) Post Hoc Explanation-Guided Demonstrations Selection, which utilizes explanations generated by LLMs to guide the process of demonstration selection from candidate demonstrations. (iii) Post Hoc Explanation-Guided Interpretable SLM Prediction, which utilizes the demonstrations obtained in step (ii) as in-context and merges corresponding explanations as rationales to improve the performance of SLM and guide the model to generate interpretable outputs. Experimental results highlight the framework's effectiveness, with an average accuracy improvement of 5.31% across various tabular datasets in diverse domains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The scarcity of high-quality multimodal biomedical data limits the ability to effectively fine-tune pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) for specialized biomedical tasks. To address this challenge, we introduce MINT (Multimodal Integrated kNowledge Transfer), a framework that aligns unimodal large decoder models with domain-specific decision patterns from multimodal biomedical data through preference optimization. While MINT supports different optimization techniques, we primarily implement it with the Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) framework as its backbone. This strategy enables the aligned LLMs to perform predictive tasks using text-only or image-only inputs while retaining knowledge learnt from multimodal data. MINT leverages an upstream multimodal machine learning (MML) model trained on high-quality multimodal data to transfer domain-specific insights to downstream text-only or image-only LLMs. We demonstrate its effectiveness through two key applications: (1) Rare genetic disease prediction from texts, where MINT uses a multimodal encoder model, trained on facial photos and clinical notes, to generate a preference dataset for aligning a lightweight Llama 3.2-3B-Instruct. Despite relying on text input only, the MINT-derived model outperforms models trained with SFT, RAG, or DPO, and even outperforms Llama 3.1-405B-Instruct. (2) Tissue type classification using cell nucleus images, where MINT uses a vision-language foundation model as the preference generator, containing knowledge learnt from both text and histopathological images to align downstream image-only models. The resulting MINT-derived model significantly improves the performance of Llama 3.2-Vision-11B-Instruct on tissue type classification. In summary, MINT provides an effective strategy to align unimodal LLMs with high-quality multimodal expertise through preference optimization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language model (LLM) training is one of the most demanding distributed computations today, often requiring thousands of GPUs with frequent synchronization across machines. Such a workload pattern makes it susceptible to stragglers, where the training can be stalled by few slow workers. At ByteDance we find stragglers are not trivially always caused by hardware failures, but can arise from multiple complex factors. This work aims to present a comprehensive study on the straggler issues in LLM training, using a five-month trace collected from our ByteDance LLM training cluster. The core methodology is what-if analysis that simulates the scenario without any stragglers and contrasts with the actual case. We use this method to study the following questions: (1) how often do stragglers affect training jobs, and what effect do they have on job performance; (2) do stragglers exhibit temporal or spatial patterns; and (3) what are the potential root causes for stragglers?

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Watermarking has emerged as a critical technique for combating misinformation and protecting intellectual property in large language models (LLMs). A recent discovery, termed watermark radioactivity, reveals that watermarks embedded in teacher models can be inherited by student models through knowledge distillation. On the positive side, this inheritance allows for the detection of unauthorized knowledge distillation by identifying watermark traces in student models. However, the robustness of watermarks against scrubbing attacks and their unforgeability in the face of spoofing attacks under unauthorized knowledge distillation remain largely unexplored. Existing watermark attack methods either assume access to model internals or fail to simultaneously support both scrubbing and spoofing attacks. In this work, we propose Contrastive Decoding-Guided Knowledge Distillation (CDG-KD), a unified framework that enables bidirectional attacks under unauthorized knowledge distillation. Our approach employs contrastive decoding to extract corrupted or amplified watermark texts via comparing outputs from the student model and weakly watermarked references, followed by bidirectional distillation to train new student models capable of watermark removal and watermark forgery, respectively. Extensive experiments show that CDG-KD effectively performs attacks while preserving the general performance of the distilled model. Our findings underscore critical need for developing watermarking schemes that are robust and unforgeable.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid advancement of LLMs (Large Language Models) has established them as a foundational technology for many AI and ML powered human computer interactions. A critical challenge in this context is the attribution of LLM-generated text, either to the specific language model used or to the individual user who generated it. This is essential for combating misinformation, fake news, misinterpretation, and plagiarism. One of the key techniques for addressing this issue is watermarking.   This work presents a watermarking scheme for LLM-generated text based on Lagrange interpolation, which enables the recovery of a secret author identity even when the text has been heavily redacted by an adversary. The core idea is to embed a continuous sequence of points (x, f(x)) that lie on a single straight line. The x-coordinates are generated pseudorandomly using either an LFSR (when security is not a priority) or a cryptographically secure NFSR for high-security applications. The scheme efficiency and resilience to adversarial modifications are analysed. Experimental results show that the proposed method is highly effective, allowing the recovery of the author identity when as few as three points survive adversarial manipulation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Supervised and preference-based fine-tuning techniques have become popular for aligning large language models (LLMs) with user intent and correctness criteria. However, real-world training data often exhibits spurious correlations -- arising from biases, dataset artifacts, or other "shortcut" features -- that can compromise a model's performance or generalization. In this paper, we systematically evaluate three post-training algorithms -- Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and KTO (Kahneman-Tversky Optimization) -- across a diverse set of synthetic tasks and spuriousness conditions. Our tasks span mathematical reasoning, constrained instruction-following, and document-grounded question answering. We vary the degree of spurious correlation (10% vs. 90%) and investigate two forms of artifacts: "Feature Ambiguity" and "Distributional Narrowness." Our results show that the models often but not always degrade under higher spuriousness. The preference-based methods (DPO/KTO) can demonstrate relative robustness in mathematical reasoning tasks. By contrast, SFT maintains stronger performance in complex, context-intensive tasks. These findings highlight that no single post-training strategy universally outperforms in all scenarios; the best choice depends on the type of target task and the nature of spurious correlations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models (LLMs) handle increasingly longer contexts, serving long inference requests of millions of tokens presents unique challenges. We show that existing work for long context inference is largely based on techniques from long context training, and does not handle the high variability in input lengths during inference. This leads to inefficient resource utilization, server fragmentation, and head-of-line (HOL) blocking.   We present Medha, an end-to-end system for efficient long-context LLM inference that addresses these challenges through fine-grained time sharing. Medha introduces three key innovations: (1) the mechanism of adaptive prefill chunking to help mitigate HOL blocking with preemption; (2) two new parallelism strategies: Sequence Pipeline Parallelism (SPP) to reduce time-to-first-token by pipelining prefill chunks, and KV-Cache Parallelism (KVP) to lower time-peroutput-token by distributing decoding across servers; and (3) a novel input-length aware least remaining slack scheduling to meet Service Level Objectives (SLOs).   Medha enables exact inference scaling beyond 10 million tokens, maintaining high throughput and low latency across mixed-length workloads. Compared to state-of-the-art systems, Medha reduces server fragmentation, cuts median latency by up to 30x, and improves throughput by over 5x, delivering production-scale long-context inference without compromising performance on shorter requests.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Agentic Generative AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and Vector Stores (VSs), represents a transformative technology applicable to specialized domains such as legal systems, research, recommender systems, cybersecurity, and global security, including proliferation research. This technology excels at inferring relationships within vast unstructured or semi-structured datasets. The legal domain here comprises complex data characterized by extensive, interrelated, and semi-structured knowledge systems with complex relations. It comprises constitutions, statutes, regulations, and case law. Extracting insights and navigating the intricate networks of legal documents and their relations is crucial for effective legal research. Here, we introduce a generative AI system that integrates RAG, VS, and KG, constructed via Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), to enhance legal information retrieval and AI reasoning and minimize hallucinations. In the legal system, these technologies empower AI agents to identify and analyze complex connections among cases, statutes, and legal precedents, uncovering hidden relationships and predicting legal trends-challenging tasks that are essential for ensuring justice and improving operational efficiency. Our system employs web scraping techniques to systematically collect legal texts, such as statutes, constitutional provisions, and case law, from publicly accessible platforms like Justia. It bridges the gap between traditional keyword-based searches and contextual understanding by leveraging advanced semantic representations, hierarchical relationships, and latent topic discovery. This framework supports legal document clustering, summarization, and cross-referencing, for scalable, interpretable, and accurate retrieval for semi-structured data while advancing computational law and AI.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While recent advances in text-to-motion generation have shown promising results, they typically assume all individuals are grouped as a single unit. Scaling these methods to handle larger crowds and ensuring that individuals respond appropriately to specific events remains a significant challenge. This is primarily due to the complexities of scene planning, which involves organizing groups, planning their activities, and coordinating interactions, and controllable motion generation. In this paper, we present CrowdMoGen, the first zero-shot framework for collective motion generation, which effectively groups individuals and generates event-aligned motion sequences from text prompts. 1) Being limited by the available datasets for training an effective scene planning module in a supervised manner, we instead propose a crowd scene planner that leverages pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to organize individuals into distinct groups. While LLMs offer high-level guidance for group divisions, they lack the low-level understanding of human motion. To address this, we further propose integrating an SMPL-based joint prior to generate context-appropriate activities, which consists of both joint trajectories and textual descriptions. 2) Secondly, to incorporate the assigned activities into the generative network, we introduce a collective motion generator that integrates the activities into a transformer-based network in a joint-wise manner, maintaining the spatial constraints during the multi-step denoising process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CrowdMoGen significantly outperforms previous approaches, delivering realistic, event-driven motion sequences that are spatially coherent. As the first framework of collective motion generation, CrowdMoGen has the potential to advance applications in urban simulation, crowd planning, and other large-scale interactive environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) has extended into literary domains. However, existing evaluation metrics prioritize mechanical accuracy over artistic expression and tend to overrate machine translation (MT) as being superior to experienced professional human translation. In the long run, this bias could result in a permanent decline in translation quality and cultural authenticity. In response to the urgent need for a specialized literary evaluation metric, we introduce LiTransProQA, a novel, reference-free, LLM-based question-answering framework designed specifically for literary translation evaluation. LiTransProQA uniquely integrates insights from professional literary translators and researchers, focusing on critical elements in literary quality assessment such as literary devices, cultural understanding, and authorial voice. Our extensive evaluation shows that while literary-finetuned XCOMET-XL yields marginal gains, LiTransProQA substantially outperforms current metrics, achieving up to 0.07 gain in correlation (ACC-EQ and Kendall's tau) and surpassing the best state-of-the-art metrics by over 15 points in adequacy assessments. Incorporating professional translator insights as weights further improves performance, highlighting the value of translator inputs. Notably, LiTransProQA approaches human-level evaluation performance comparable to trained linguistic annotators. It demonstrates broad applicability to open-source models such as LLaMA3.3-70b and Qwen2.5-32b, indicating its potential as an accessible and training-free literary evaluation metric and a valuable tool for evaluating texts that require local processing due to copyright or ethical considerations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models (LLMs) become integral to diverse applications, ensuring their reliability under varying input conditions is crucial. One key issue affecting this reliability is order sensitivity, wherein slight variations in the input arrangement can lead to inconsistent or biased outputs. Although recent advances have reduced this sensitivity, the problem remains unresolved. This paper investigates the extent of order sensitivity in LLMs whose internal components are hidden from users (such as closed-source models or those accessed via API calls). We conduct experiments across multiple tasks, including paraphrasing, relevance judgment, and multiple-choice questions. Our results show that input order significantly affects performance across tasks, with shuffled inputs leading to measurable declines in output accuracy. Few-shot prompting demonstrates mixed effectiveness and offers partial mitigation; however, fails to fully resolve the problem. These findings highlight persistent risks, particularly in high-stakes applications, and point to the need for more robust LLMs or improved input-handling techniques in future development.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Social media user profiling through content analysis is crucial for tasks like misinformation detection, engagement prediction, hate speech monitoring, and user behavior modeling. However, existing profiling techniques, including tweet summarization, attribute-based profiling, and latent representation learning, face significant limitations: they often lack transferability, produce non-interpretable features, require large labeled datasets, or rely on rigid predefined categories that limit adaptability. We introduce a novel large language model (LLM)-based approach that leverages domain-defining statements, which serve as key characteristics outlining the important pillars of a domain as foundations for profiling. Our two-stage method first employs semi-supervised filtering with a domain-specific knowledge base, then generates both abstractive (synthesized descriptions) and extractive (representative tweet selections) user profiles. By harnessing LLMs' inherent knowledge with minimal human validation, our approach is adaptable across domains while reducing the need for large labeled datasets. Our method generates interpretable natural language user profiles, condensing extensive user data into a scale that unlocks LLMs' reasoning and knowledge capabilities for downstream social network tasks. We contribute a Persian political Twitter (X) dataset and an LLM-based evaluation framework with human validation. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and traditional methods by 9.8%, demonstrating its effectiveness in creating flexible, adaptable, and interpretable user profiles.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem widely applied in logistics distribution and transportation management. Its complexity stems from the constraints of vehicle capacity and time windows, which pose significant challenges to traditional approaches. Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) provide new possibilities for finding approximate solutions to CVRPTW. This paper proposes a novel LLM-enhanced Q-learning framework to address the CVRPTW with real-time emergency constraints. Our solution introduces an adaptive two-phase training mechanism that transitions from the LLM-guided exploration phase to the autonomous optimization phase of Q-network. To ensure reliability, we design a three-tier self-correction mechanism based on the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for LLMs: syntactic validation, semantic verification, and physical constraint enforcement. In addition, we also prioritized replay of the experience generated by LLMs to amplify the regulatory role of LLMs in the architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves a 7.3\% average reduction in cost compared to traditional Q-learning, with fewer training steps required for convergence.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retouching is an essential task in post-manipulation of raw photographs. Generative editing, guided by text or strokes, provides a new tool accessible to users but can easily change the identity of the original objects in unacceptable and unpredictable ways. In contrast, although traditional procedural edits, as commonly supported by photoediting tools (e.g., Gimp, Lightroom), are conservative, they are still preferred by professionals. Unfortunately, professional quality retouching involves many individual procedural editing operations that is challenging to plan for most novices. In this paper, we ask if a multimodal large language model (MLLM) can be taught to critique raw photographs, suggest suitable remedies, and finally realize them with a given set of pre-authored procedural image operations. We demonstrate that MLLMs can be first made aware of the underlying image processing operations, by training them to solve specially designed visual puzzles. Subsequently, such an operation-aware MLLM can both plan and propose edit sequences. To facilitate training, given a set of expert-edited photos, we synthesize a reasoning dataset by procedurally manipulating the expert edits and then grounding a pretrained LLM on the visual adjustments, to synthesize reasoning for finetuning. The proposed retouching operations are, by construction, understandable by the users, preserve object details and resolution, and can be optionally overridden. We evaluate our setup on a variety of test examples and show advantages, in terms of explainability and identity preservation, over existing generative and other procedural alternatives.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces a novel in-context learning (ICL) framework, inspired by large language models (LLMs), for soft-input soft-output channel equalization in coded multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The proposed approach learns to infer posterior symbol distributions directly from a prompt of pilot signals and decoder feedback. A key innovation is the use of prompt augmentation to incorporate extrinsic information from the decoder output as additional context, enabling the ICL model to refine its symbol estimates iteratively across turbo decoding iterations. Two model variants, based on Transformer and state-space architectures, are developed and evaluated. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, when traditional linear assumptions break down, e.g., in the presence of low-resolution quantization, ICL equalizers consistently outperform conventional model-based baselines, even when the latter are provided with perfect channel state information. Results also highlight the advantage of Transformer-based models under limited training diversity, as well as the efficiency of state-space models in resource-constrained scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce a scaling law for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) under fixed compute budgets that explicitly accounts for data composition. Conventional approaches measure training data solely by total tokens, yet the number of examples and their average token length -- what we term \emph{dataset volume} -- play a decisive role in model performance. Our formulation is tuned following established procedures. Experiments on the BRICC dataset \cite{salavati2024reducing} and subsets of the MMLU dataset \cite{hendrycks2021measuringmassivemultitasklanguage}, evaluated under multiple subsampling strategies, reveal that data composition significantly affects token efficiency. These results motivate refined scaling laws for practical LLM fine-tuning in resource-constrained settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite growing interest in automated hate speech detection, most existing approaches overlook the linguistic diversity of online content. Multilingual instruction-tuned large language models such as LLaMA, Aya, Qwen, and BloomZ offer promising capabilities across languages, but their effectiveness in identifying hate speech through zero-shot and few-shot prompting remains underexplored. This work evaluates LLM prompting-based detection across eight non-English languages, utilizing several prompting techniques and comparing them to fine-tuned encoder models. We show that while zero-shot and few-shot prompting lag behind fine-tuned encoder models on most of the real-world evaluation sets, they achieve better generalization on functional tests for hate speech detection. Our study also reveals that prompt design plays a critical role, with each language often requiring customized prompting techniques to maximize performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose Rec-R1, a general reinforcement learning framework that bridges large language models (LLMs) with recommendation systems through closed-loop optimization. Unlike prompting and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Rec-R1 directly optimizes LLM generation using feedback from a fixed black-box recommendation model, without relying on synthetic SFT data from proprietary models such as GPT-4o. This avoids the substantial cost and effort required for data distillation. To verify the effectiveness of Rec-R1, we evaluate it on two representative tasks: product search and sequential recommendation. Experimental results demonstrate that Rec-R1 not only consistently outperforms prompting- and SFT-based methods, but also achieves significant gains over strong discriminative baselines, even when used with simple retrievers such as BM25. Moreover, Rec-R1 preserves the general-purpose capabilities of the LLM, unlike SFT, which often impairs instruction-following and reasoning. These findings suggest Rec-R1 as a promising foundation for continual task-specific adaptation without catastrophic forgetting.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Echosounders are high-frequency sonar systems used to sense fish and zooplankton underwater. Their deployment on a variety of ocean observing platforms is generating vast amounts of data at an unprecedented speed from the oceans. Efficient and integrative analysis of these data, whether across different echosounder instruments or in combination with other oceanographic datasets, is crucial for understanding marine ecosystem response to the rapidly changing climate. Here we present Echopype, an open-source Python software library designed to address this need. By standardizing data as labeled, multi-dimensional arrays encoded in the widely embraced netCDF data model following a community convention, Echopype enhances the interoperability of echosounder data, making it easier to explore and use. By leveraging scientific Python libraries optimized for distributed computing, Echopype achieves computational scalability, enabling efficient processing in both local and cloud computing environments. Echopype's modularized package structure further provides a unified framework for expanding support for additional instrument raw data formats and incorporating new analysis functionalities. We plan to continue developing Echopype by supporting and collaborating with the echosounder user community, and envision that the growth of this package will catalyze the integration of echosounder data into broader regional and global ocean observation strategies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Tumor documentation in Germany is largely done manually, requiring reading patient records and entering data into structured databases. Large language models (LLMs) could potentially enhance this process by improving efficiency and reliability. This evaluation tests eleven different open source LLMs with sizes ranging from 1-70 billion model parameters on three basic tasks of the tumor documentation process: identifying tumor diagnoses, assigning ICD-10 codes, and extracting the date of first diagnosis. For evaluating the LLMs on these tasks, a dataset of annotated text snippets based on anonymized doctors' notes from urology was prepared. Different prompting strategies were used to investigate the effect of the number of examples in few-shot prompting and to explore the capabilities of the LLMs in general. The models Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 7B, and Mistral NeMo 12 B performed comparably well in the tasks. Models with less extensive training data or having fewer than 7 billion parameters showed notably lower performance, while larger models did not display performance gains. Examples from a different medical domain than urology could also improve the outcome in few-shot prompting, which demonstrates the ability of LLMs to handle tasks needed for tumor documentation. Open source LLMs show a strong potential for automating tumor documentation. Models from 7-12 billion parameters could offer an optimal balance between performance and resource efficiency. With tailored fine-tuning and well-designed prompting, these models might become important tools for clinical documentation in the future. The code for the evaluation is available from https://github.com/stefan-m-lenz/UroLlmEval. We also release the dataset as a new valuable resource that addresses the shortage of authentic and easily accessible benchmarks in German-language medical NLP.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> There has been a recent surge of interest in time series modeling using the Transformer architecture. However, forecasting multivariate time series with Transformer presents a unique challenge as it requires modeling both temporal (cross-time) and variate (cross-variate) dependencies. While Transformer-based models have gained popularity for their flexibility in capturing both sequential and cross-variate relationships, it is unclear how to best integrate these two sources of information in the context of the Transformer architecture while optimizing for both performance and efficiency. We re-purpose the Transformer architecture to effectively model both cross-time and cross-variate dependencies. Our approach begins by embedding each variate independently into a variate-wise representation that captures its cross-time dynamics, and then models cross-variate dependencies through attention mechanisms on these learned embeddings. Gating operations in both cross-time and cross-variate modeling phases regulate information flow, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant features for accurate predictions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 real-world datasets and can be seamlessly integrated into other Transformer-based and LLM-based forecasters, delivering performance improvements up to 20.7\% over original models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper studies the challenge of developing robots capable of understanding under-specified instructions for creating functional object arrangements, such as "set up a dining table for two"; previous arrangement approaches have focused on much more explicit instructions, such as "put object A on the table." We introduce a framework, SetItUp, for learning to interpret under-specified instructions. SetItUp takes a small number of training examples and a human-crafted program sketch to uncover arrangement rules for specific scene types. By leveraging an intermediate graph-like representation of abstract spatial relationships among objects, SetItUp decomposes the arrangement problem into two subproblems: i) learning the arrangement patterns from limited data and ii) grounding these abstract relationships into object poses. SetItUp leverages large language models (LLMs) to propose the abstract spatial relationships among objects in novel scenes as the constraints to be satisfied; then, it composes a library of diffusion models associated with these abstract relationships to find object poses that satisfy the constraints. We validate our framework on a dataset comprising study desks, dining tables, and coffee tables, with the results showing superior performance in generating physically plausible, functional, and aesthetically pleasing object arrangements compared to existing models.

The process is managed by an LLM-powered agent, ensuring seamless effective planning and navigation, without the need for human interaction, complex rewards, or costly training.   Our experimental results on the MP3D benchmark achieves 85\% object navigation success rate (SR) and 79\% success rate weighted by path length (SPL) (over 40\% point improvement in SR and 60\% improvement in SPL compared to exsisting methods). Furthermore, we validate the robustness of our approach through virtual agent and real-world robotic deployment, showcasing its capability in practical scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce k-LLMmeans, a novel modification of the k-means algorithm for text clustering that leverages LLM-generated summaries as cluster centroids, capturing semantic nuances often missed by purely numerical averages. This design preserves the core optimization properties of k-means while enhancing semantic interpretability and avoiding the scalability and instability issues typical of modern LLM-based clustering. Unlike existing methods, our approach does not increase LLM usage with dataset size and produces transparent intermediate outputs. We further extend it with a mini-batch variant for efficient, real-time clustering of streaming text. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, embeddings, and LLMs show that k-LLMmeans consistently outperforms k-means and other traditional baselines and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art LLM-based clustering, with a fraction of the LLM calls. Finally, we present a case study on sequential text streams and introduce a new benchmark dataset constructed from StackExchange to evaluate text-stream clustering methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the Fourth Industrial Revolution, wherein artificial intelligence and the automation of machines occupy a central role, the deployment of robots is indispensable. However, the manufacturing process using robots, especially in collaboration with humans, is highly intricate. In particular, modeling the friction torque in robotic joints is a longstanding problem due to the lack of a good mathematical description. This motivates the usage of data-driven methods in recent works. However, model-based and data-driven models often exhibit limitations in their ability to generalize beyond the specific dynamics they were trained on, as we demonstrate in this paper. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach based on residual learning, which aims to adapt an existing friction model to new dynamics using as little data as possible. We validate our approach by training a base neural network on a symmetric friction data set to learn an accurate relation between the velocity and the friction torque. Subsequently, to adapt to more complex asymmetric settings, we train a second network on a small dataset, focusing on predicting the residual of the initial network's output. By combining the output of both networks in a suitable manner, our proposed estimator outperforms the conventional model-based approach, an extended LuGre model, and the base neural network significantly. Furthermore, we evaluate our method on trajectories involving external loads and still observe a substantial improvement, approximately 60-70%, over the conventional approach. Our method does not rely on data with external load during training, eliminating the need for external torque sensors. This demonstrates the generalization capability of our approach, even with a small amount of data--less than a minute--enabling adaptation to diverse scenarios based on prior knowledge about friction in different settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> People experiencing severe distress increasingly use Large Language Model (LLM) chatbots as mental health support tools. Discussions on social media have described how engagements were lifesaving for some, but evidence suggests that general-purpose LLM chatbots also have notable risks that could endanger the welfare of users if not designed responsibly. In this study, we investigate the lived experiences of people who have used LLM chatbots for mental health support. We build on interviews with 21 individuals from globally diverse backgrounds to analyze how users create unique support roles for their chatbots, fill in gaps in everyday care, and navigate associated cultural limitations when seeking support from chatbots. We ground our analysis in psychotherapy literature around effective support, and introduce the concept of therapeutic alignment, or aligning AI with therapeutic values for mental health contexts. Our study offers recommendations for how designers can approach the ethical and effective use of LLM chatbots and other AI mental health support tools in mental health care.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are conversational interfaces. As such, LLMs have the potential to assist their users not only when they can fully specify the task at hand, but also to help them define, explore, and refine what they need through multi-turn conversational exchange. Although analysis of LLM conversation logs has confirmed that underspecification occurs frequently in user instructions, LLM evaluation has predominantly focused on the single-turn, fully-specified instruction setting. In this work, we perform large-scale simulation experiments to compare LLM performance in single- and multi-turn settings. Our experiments confirm that all the top open- and closed-weight LLMs we test exhibit significantly lower performance in multi-turn conversations than single-turn, with an average drop of 39% across six generation tasks. Analysis of 200,000+ simulated conversations decomposes the performance degradation into two components: a minor loss in aptitude and a significant increase in unreliability. We find that LLMs often make assumptions in early turns and prematurely attempt to generate final solutions, on which they overly rely. In simpler terms, we discover that *when LLMs take a wrong turn in a conversation, they get lost and do not recover*.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A generalist robot should perform effectively across various environments. However, most existing approaches heavily rely on scaling action-annotated data to enhance their capabilities. Consequently, they are often limited to single physical specification and struggle to learn transferable knowledge across different embodiments and environments. To confront these limitations, we propose UniVLA, a new framework for learning cross-embodiment vision-language-action (VLA) policies. Our key innovation is to derive task-centric action representations from videos with a latent action model. This enables us to exploit extensive data across a wide spectrum of embodiments and perspectives. To mitigate the effect of task-irrelevant dynamics, we incorporate language instructions and establish a latent action model within the DINO feature space. Learned from internet-scale videos, the generalist policy can be deployed to various robots through efficient latent action decoding. We obtain state-of-the-art results across multiple manipulation and navigation benchmarks, as well as real-robot deployments. UniVLA achieves superior performance over OpenVLA with less than 1/20 of pretraining compute and 1/10 of downstream data. Continuous performance improvements are observed as heterogeneous data, even including human videos, are incorporated into the training pipeline. The results underscore UniVLA's potential to facilitate scalable and efficient robot policy learning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent research have demonstrated LLMs' impressive performance in math and reasoning. However, the capacity of LLMs to address math problems under unconventional conditions, such as internal inconsistencies and flawed assumptions, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel benchmark Unreasonable Math Problem (UMP) designed to assess LLMs' ability to recognize and respond to unreasonability in math problem. The benchmark consists of a carefully curated collection of unreasonable math questions across diverse types. Based on extensive experiments covering 19 LLMs, we observe that even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o achieve only limited performance of 0.6 in UMP, while reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 are prone to overthinking and unstable. We further explore strategies for improving the recognition of unreasonable inputs, shedding light on both the possibility and limitations of LLMs in this challenging setting.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This study systematically evaluates 27 frontier Large Language Models on eight diverse biology benchmarks spanning molecular biology, genetics, cloning, virology, and biosecurity. Models from major AI developers released between November 2022 and April 2025 were assessed through ten independent runs per benchmark. The findings reveal dramatic improvements in biological capabilities. Top model performance increased more than 4-fold on the challenging text-only subset of the Virology Capabilities Test over the study period, with the top model now performing twice as well as expert virologists. Several models now match or exceed expert-level performance on other challenging benchmarks, including LAB-Bench CloningScenarios and the biology subsets of GPQA and WMDP. Contrary to expectations, chain-of-thought did not substantially improve performance over zero-shot evaluation, while extended reasoning features in o3-mini and Claude 3.7 Sonnet typically improved performance as predicted by inference scaling. Benchmarks such as PubMedQA and the MMLU and WMDP biology subsets exhibited performance plateaus well below 100%, suggesting benchmark saturation and errors in the underlying benchmark data. The analysis highlights the need for more sophisticated evaluation methodologies as AI systems continue to advance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Limitations in Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities for hardware design tasks, such as generating functional Verilog codes, have motivated various fine-tuning optimizations utilizing curated hardware datasets from open-source repositories. However, these datasets remain limited in size and contain minimal checks on licensing for reuse, resulting in potential copyright violations by fine-tuned LLMs. Therefore, we propose an evaluation benchmark to estimate the risk of Verilog-trained LLMs to generate copyright-protected codes. To minimize this risk, we present an open-source Verilog dataset, FreeSet, containing over 220k files, along with the automated dataset curation framework utilized to provide additional guarantees of fair-use Verilog data. We then execute an LLM fine-tuning framework consisting of continual pre-training, resulting in a fine-tuned Llama model for Verilog, FreeV. Our results indicate that FreeV demonstrates the smallest risk of copyright-infringement among prior works, with only a 3% violation rate. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate improvements in Verilog generation functionality over its baseline model, improving VerilogEval pass@10 rates by over 10%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The internet is undergoing a historical transformation from the "Internet of Websites" to the "Internet of AgentSites." While traditional Websites served as the foundation for information hosting and dissemination, a new frontier is emerging where AgentSites serve as the hubs of the internet, where each AgentSite hosts one or more AI agents that receive tasks, address them, and deliver actionable solutions, marking a significant shift in the digital landscape and representing the next generation of online ecosystems. Under this vision, AIOS, the AI Agent Operating System, serves as the server for the development, deployment and execution of AI agents, which is a fundamental infrastructure for the Internet of Agentsites.   In this paper, we introduce AIOS Server, a runtime framework to host agents and enable global-scale collaboration among decentralized agents. AIOS Server provides a communication protocol leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and JSON-RPC to enable agent-agent or human-agent interactions. Each AIOS node operates as a server to host and execute agents, while supporting peer-to-peer coordination without reliance on centralized orchestration. Based on AIOS Server, we further present the world's first practically deployed Internet of Agentsites (AIOS-IoA), including AgentHub for agent registration and discovery and AgentChat for interactive communication, at https://planet.aios.foundation. The agent discovery mechanism based on Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) and a Gossip protocol serves as the search engine for the internet of agentsites. This work provides a practical foundation for building the Internet of Agentsites-a new paradigm where autonomous agents become first-class citizens of the web. The implementation is available at https://github.com/agiresearch/AIOS.Server and is integrated into the AIOS main branch at https://github.com/agiresearch/AIOS.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Testing is an essential part of software development. Test generation tools attempt to automate the otherwise labor-intensive task of test creation, but generating high-coverage tests remains challenging. This paper proposes CoverUp, a novel approach to driving the generation of high-coverage Python regression tests. CoverUp combines coverage analysis, code context, and feedback in prompts that iteratively guide the LLM to generate tests that improve line and branch coverage. We evaluate our prototype CoverUp implementation across a benchmark of challenging code derived from open-source Python projects and show that CoverUp substantially improves on the state of the art. Compared to CodaMosa, a hybrid search/LLM-based test generator, CoverUp achieves a per-module median line+branch coverage of 80% (vs. 47%). Compared to MuTAP, a mutation- and LLM-based test generator, CoverUp achieves an overall line+branch coverage of 89% (vs. 77%). We also demonstrate that CoverUp's performance stems not only from the LLM used but from the combined effectiveness of its components.

This paper evaluates the performance of the Tenstorrent Grayskull e75 RISC-V accelerator for basic linear algebra kernels at reduced numerical precision, a fundamental operation in LLM computations. We present a detailed characterization of Grayskull's execution model, gridsize, matrix dimensions, data formats, and numerical precision impact computational efficiency. Furthermore, we compare Grayskull's performance against state-of-the-art architectures with tensor acceleration, including Intel Sapphire Rapids processors and two NVIDIA GPUs (V100 and A100). Whilst NVIDIA GPUs dominate raw performance, Grayskull demonstrates a competitive trade-off between power consumption and computational throughput, reaching a peak of 1.55 TFLOPs/Watt with BF16.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As the Large-scale Language Models (LLMs) continue to scale, the requisite computational power and bandwidth escalate. To address this, we introduce UB-Mesh, a novel AI datacenter network architecture designed to enhance scalability, performance, cost-efficiency and availability. Unlike traditional datacenters that provide symmetrical node-to-node bandwidth, UB-Mesh employs a hierarchically localized nD-FullMesh network topology. This design fully leverages the data locality of LLM training, prioritizing short-range, direct interconnects to minimize data movement distance and reduce switch usage.   Although UB-Mesh's nD-FullMesh topology offers several theoretical advantages, its concrete architecture design, physical implementation and networking system optimization present new challenges. For the actual construction of UB-Mesh, we first design the UB-Mesh-Pod architecture, which is based on a 4D-FullMesh topology. UB-Mesh-Pod is implemented via a suite of hardware components that serve as the foundational building blocks, including specifically-designed NPU, CPU, Low-Radix-Switch (LRS), High-Radix-Switch (HRS), NICs and others. These components are interconnected via a novel Unified Bus (UB) technique, which enables flexible IO bandwidth allocation and hardware resource pooling. For networking system optimization, we propose advanced routing mechanism named All-Path-Routing (APR) to efficiently manage data traffic. These optimizations, combined with topology-aware performance enhancements and robust reliability measures like 64+1 backup design, result in 2.04x higher cost-efficiency, 7.2% higher network availability compared to traditional Clos architecture and 95%+ linearity in various LLM training tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Electromyography (EMG)-based gesture recognition is a promising approach for designing intuitive human-computer interfaces. However, while these systems typically perform well in controlled laboratory settings, their usability in real-world applications is compromised by declining performance during real-time control. This decline is largely due to goal-directed behaviors that are not captured in static, offline scenarios. To address this issue, we use \textit{Context Informed Incremental Learning} (CIIL) - marking its first deployment in an object-manipulation scenario - to continuously adapt the classifier using contextual cues. Nine participants without upper limb differences completed a functional task in a virtual reality (VR) environment involving transporting objects with life-like grips. We compared two scenarios: one where the classifier was adapted in real-time using contextual information, and the other using a traditional open-loop approach without adaptation. The CIIL-based approach not only enhanced task success rates and efficiency, but also reduced the perceived workload by 7.1 %, despite causing a 5.8 % reduction in offline classification accuracy. This study highlights the potential of real-time contextualized adaptation to enhance user experience and usability of EMG-based systems for practical, goal-oriented applications, crucial elements towards their long-term adoption.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Assessing how well a large language model (LLM) understands human, rather than merely text, remains an open challenge. To bridge the gap, we introduce Sentient Agent as a Judge (SAGE), an automated evaluation framework that measures an LLM's higher-order social cognition. SAGE instantiates a Sentient Agent that simulates human-like emotional changes and inner thoughts during interaction, providing a more realistic evaluation of the tested model in multi-turn conversations. At every turn, the agent reasons about (i) how its emotion changes, (ii) how it feels, and (iii) how it should reply, yielding a numerical emotion trajectory and interpretable inner thoughts. Experiments on 100 supportive-dialogue scenarios show that the final Sentient emotion score correlates strongly with Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory (BLRI) ratings and utterance-level empathy metrics, validating psychological fidelity. We also build a public Sentient Leaderboard covering 18 commercial and open-source models that uncovers substantial gaps (up to 4x) between frontier systems (GPT-4o-Latest, Gemini2.5-Pro) and earlier baselines, gaps not reflected in conventional leaderboards (e.g., Arena). SAGE thus provides a principled, scalable and interpretable tool for tracking progress toward genuinely empathetic and socially adept language agents.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As Large Language Models (LLMs) become widely accessible, a detailed understanding of their knowledge within specific domains becomes necessary for successful real world use. This is particularly critical in public health, where failure to retrieve relevant, accurate, and current information could significantly impact UK residents. However, currently little is known about LLM knowledge of UK Government public health information. To address this issue, this paper introduces a new benchmark, PubHealthBench, with over 8000 questions for evaluating LLMs' Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) and free form responses to public health queries, created via an automated pipeline. We also release a new dataset of the extracted UK Government public health guidance documents used as source text for PubHealthBench. Assessing 24 LLMs on PubHealthBench we find the latest private LLMs (GPT-4.5, GPT-4.1 and o1) have a high degree of knowledge, achieving >90% in the MCQA setup, and outperform humans with cursory search engine use. However, in the free form setup we see lower performance with no model scoring >75%. Therefore, whilst there are promising signs that state of the art (SOTA) LLMs are an increasingly accurate source of public health information, additional safeguards or tools may still be needed when providing free form responses on public health topics.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reliance on spurious correlations (shortcuts) has been shown to underlie many of the successes of language models. Previous work focused on identifying the input elements that impact prediction. We investigate how shortcuts are actually processed within the model's decision-making mechanism. We use actor names in movie reviews as controllable shortcuts with known impact on the outcome. We use mechanistic interpretability methods and identify specific attention heads that focus on shortcuts. These heads gear the model towards a label before processing the complete input, effectively making premature decisions that bypass contextual analysis. Based on these findings, we introduce Head-based Token Attribution (HTA), which traces intermediate decisions back to input tokens. We show that HTA is effective in detecting shortcuts in LLMs and enables targeted mitigation by selectively deactivating shortcut-related attention heads.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces Unilogit, a novel self-distillation method for machine unlearning in Large Language Models. Unilogit addresses the challenge of selectively forgetting specific information while maintaining overall model utility, a critical task in compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR. Unlike prior methods that rely on static hyperparameters or starting model outputs, Unilogit dynamically adjusts target logits to achieve a uniform probability for the target token, leveraging the current model's outputs for more accurate self-distillation targets. This approach not only eliminates the need for additional hyperparameters but also enhances the model's ability to approximate the golden targets. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and an in-house e-commerce dataset demonstrate Unilogit's superior performance in balancing forget and retain objectives, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as NPO and UnDIAL. Our analysis further reveals Unilogit's robustness across various scenarios, highlighting its practical applicability and effectiveness in achieving efficacious machine unlearning.

In this paper, we explore the performance of 17 popular models used to correct grammatical issues in texts stated in English, German, Italian, and Swedish when using a single model to correct texts in all those languages. We analyze the outputs generated by these models, focusing on decreasing the number of grammatical errors while keeping the changes small. The conclusions drawn help us understand what problems occur among those models and which models can be recommended for multilingual grammatical error correction tasks. We list six models that improve grammatical correctness in all four languages and show that Gemma 9B is currently the best performing one for the languages considered.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large-scale pre-trained models have achieved remarkable success in language and image tasks, leading an increasing number of studies to explore the application of pre-trained image models, such as CLIP, in the domain of few-shot action recognition (FSAR). However, current methods generally suffer from several problems: 1) Direct fine-tuning often undermines the generalization capability of the pre-trained model; 2) The exploration of task-specific information is insufficient in the visual tasks; 3) The semantic order information is typically overlooked during text modeling; 4) Existing cross-modal alignment techniques ignore the temporal coupling of multimodal information. To address these, we propose Task-Adapter++, a parameter-efficient dual adaptation method for both image and text encoders. Specifically, to make full use of the variations across different few-shot learning tasks, we design a task-specific adaptation for the image encoder so that the most discriminative information can be well noticed during feature extraction. Furthermore, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate detailed sequential sub-action descriptions for each action class, and introduce semantic order adapters into the text encoder to effectively model the sequential relationships between these sub-actions. Finally, we develop an innovative fine-grained cross-modal alignment strategy that actively maps visual features to reside in the same temporal stage as semantic descriptions. Extensive experiments fully demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5 benchmarks consistently. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/Jaulin-Bage/Task-Adapter-pp.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite remarkable progress in machine learning, current AI systems continue to fall short of true human-like intelligence. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in pattern recognition and response generation, they lack genuine understanding - an essential hallmark of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Existing AGI evaluation methods fail to offer a practical, gradual, and informative metric. This paper introduces the Artificial General Intelligence Test Bed (AGITB), comprising twelve rigorous tests that form a signal-processing-level foundation for the potential emergence of cognitive capabilities. AGITB evaluates intelligence through a model's ability to predict binary signals across time without relying on symbolic representations or pretraining. Unlike high-level tests grounded in language or perception, AGITB focuses on core computational invariants reflective of biological intelligence, such as determinism, sensitivity, and generalisation. The test bed assumes no prior bias, operates independently of semantic meaning, and ensures unsolvability through brute force or memorization. While humans pass AGITB by design, no current AI system has met its criteria, making AGITB a compelling benchmark for guiding and recognizing progress toward AGI.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the widespread adoption of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, there is a growing demand for efficient inference on memory-constrained devices. While offloading expert parameters to CPU memory and loading activated experts on demand has emerged as a potential solution, the large size of activated experts overburdens the limited PCIe bandwidth, hindering the effectiveness in latency-sensitive scenarios. To mitigate this, we propose FloE, an on-the-fly MoE inference system on memory-constrained GPUs. FloE is built on the insight that there exists substantial untapped redundancy within sparsely activated experts. It employs various compression techniques on the expert's internal parameter matrices to reduce the data movement load, combined with low-cost sparse prediction, achieving perceptible inference acceleration in wall-clock time on resource-constrained devices. Empirically, FloE achieves a 9.3x compression of parameters per expert in Mixtral-8x7B; enables deployment on a GPU with only 11GB VRAM, reducing the memory footprint by up to 8.5x; and delivers a 48.7x inference speedup compared to DeepSpeed-MII on a single GeForce RTX 3090.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in large language models (LLMs) is challenging because benchmarks can quickly become stale. Questions initially requiring retrieval may become answerable from pretraining knowledge as newer models incorporate more recent information during pretraining, making it difficult to distinguish evidence-based reasoning from recall. We introduce NeoQA (News Events for Out-of-training Question Answering), a benchmark designed to address this issue. To construct NeoQA, we generated timelines and knowledge bases of fictional news events and entities along with news articles and Q\&A pairs to prevent LLMs from leveraging pretraining knowledge, ensuring that no prior evidence exists in their training data. We propose our dataset as a new platform for evaluating evidence-based question answering, as it requires LLMs to generate responses exclusively from retrieved evidence and only when sufficient evidence is available. NeoQA enables controlled evaluation across various evidence scenarios, including cases with missing or misleading details. Our findings indicate that LLMs struggle to distinguish subtle mismatches between questions and evidence, and suffer from short-cut reasoning when key information required to answer a question is missing from the evidence, underscoring key limitations in evidence-based reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, spiking neural networks (SNNs), deployed on neuromorphic chips, provide highly efficient solutions on edge devices in different scenarios. However, their ability to adapt to distribution shifts after deployment has become a crucial challenge. Online test-time adaptation (OTTA) offers a promising solution by enabling models to dynamically adjust to new data distributions without requiring source data or labeled target samples. Nevertheless, existing OTTA methods are largely designed for traditional artificial neural networks and are not well-suited for SNNs. To address this gap, we propose a low-power, neuromorphic chip-friendly online test-time adaptation framework, aiming to enhance model generalization under distribution shifts. The proposed approach is called Threshold Modulation (TM), which dynamically adjusts the firing threshold through neuronal dynamics-inspired normalization, being more compatible with neuromorphic hardware. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in improving the robustness of SNNs against distribution shifts while maintaining low computational cost. The proposed method offers a practical solution for online test-time adaptation of SNNs, providing inspiration for the design of future neuromorphic chips. The demo code is available at github.com/NneurotransmitterR/TM-OTTA-SNN.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant popularity due to their remarkable capabilities in text understanding and generation. However, despite their widespread deployment in inference services such as ChatGPT, concerns about the potential leakage of sensitive user data have arisen. Existing solutions primarily rely on privacy-enhancing technologies to mitigate such risks, facing the trade-off among efficiency, privacy, and utility. To narrow this gap, we propose Cape, a context-aware prompt perturbation mechanism based on differential privacy, to enable efficient inference with an improved privacy-utility trade-off. Concretely, we introduce a hybrid utility function that better captures the token similarity. Additionally, we propose a bucketized sampling mechanism to handle large sampling space, which might lead to long-tail phenomenons. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, along with ablation studies, demonstrate that Cape achieves a better privacy-utility trade-off compared to prior state-of-the-art works.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The capability of large language models to handle long-context information is crucial across various real-world applications. Existing evaluation methods often rely either on real-world long texts, making it difficult to exclude the influence of models' inherent knowledge, or introduce irrelevant filler content to artificially achieve target lengths, reducing assessment effectiveness. To address these limitations, we introduce NeedleBench, a synthetic framework for assessing retrieval and reasoning performance in bilingual long-context tasks with adaptive context lengths. NeedleBench systematically embeds key data points at varying depths to rigorously test model capabilities. Tasks are categorized into two scenarios: information-sparse, featuring minimal relevant details within extensive irrelevant text to simulate simple retrieval tasks; and information-dense (the Ancestral Trace Challenge), where relevant information is continuously distributed throughout the context to simulate complex reasoning tasks. Our experiments reveal that although recent reasoning models like Deepseek-R1 and OpenAI's o3 excel in mathematical reasoning, they struggle with continuous retrieval and reasoning in information-dense scenarios, even at shorter context lengths. We also characterize a phenomenon termed 'under-thinking', where models prematurely conclude reasoning despite available information. NeedleBench thus provides critical insights and targeted tools essential for evaluating and improving LLMs' long-context capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Urban causal research is essential for understanding the complex dynamics of cities and informing evidence-based policies. However, it is challenged by the inefficiency and bias of hypothesis generation, barriers to multimodal data complexity, and the methodological fragility of causal experimentation. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to rethink how urban causal analysis is conducted. This Perspective examines current urban causal research by analyzing taxonomies that categorize research topics, data sources, and methodological approaches to identify structural gaps. We then introduce an LLM-driven conceptual framework, AutoUrbanCI, composed of four distinct modular agents responsible for hypothesis generation, data engineering, experiment design and execution, and results interpretation with policy recommendations. We propose evaluation criteria for rigor and transparency and reflect on implications for human-AI collaboration, equity, and accountability. We call for a new research agenda that embraces AI-augmented workflows not as replacements for human expertise but as tools to broaden participation, improve reproducibility, and unlock more inclusive forms of urban causal reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose a model for the evolutionary ecology of words as one attempt to extend evolutionary game theory and agent-based models by utilizing the rich linguistic expressions of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our model enables the emergence and evolution of diverse and infinite options for interactions among agents. Within the population, each agent possesses a short word (or phrase) generated by an LLM and moves within a spatial environment. When agents become adjacent, the outcome of their interaction is determined by the LLM based on the relationship between their words, with the loser's word being replaced by the winner's. Word mutations, also based on LLM outputs, may occur. We conducted preliminary experiments assuming that ``strong animal species" would survive. The results showed that from an initial population consisting of well-known species, many species emerged both gradually and in a punctuated equilibrium manner. Each trial demonstrated the unique evolution of diverse populations, with one type of large species becoming dominant, such as terrestrial animals, marine life, or extinct species, which were ecologically specialized and adapted ones across diverse extreme habitats. We also conducted a long-term experiment with a large population, demonstrating the emergence and coexistence of diverse species.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the last few decades, Machine Learning (ML) has achieved significant success across domains ranging from healthcare, sustainability, and the social sciences, to criminal justice and finance. But its deployment in increasingly sophisticated, critical, and sensitive areas affecting individuals, the groups they belong to, and society as a whole raises critical concerns around fairness, transparency, robustness, and privacy, among others. As the complexity and scale of ML systems and of the settings in which they are deployed grow, so does the need for responsible ML methods that address these challenges while providing guaranteed performance in deployment.   Mixed-integer optimization (MIO) offers a powerful framework for embedding responsible ML considerations directly into the learning process while maintaining performance. For example, it enables learning of inherently transparent models that can conveniently incorporate fairness or other domain specific constraints. This tutorial paper provides an accessible and comprehensive introduction to this topic discussing both theoretical and practical aspects. It outlines some of the core principles of responsible ML, their importance in applications, and the practical utility of MIO for building ML models that align with these principles. Through examples and mathematical formulations, it illustrates practical strategies and available tools for efficiently solving MIO problems for responsible ML. It concludes with a discussion on current limitations and open research questions, providing suggestions for future work.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cloud-based mobile agents powered by (multimodal) large language models ((M)LLMs) offer strong reasoning abilities but suffer from high latency and cost. While fine-tuned (M)SLMs enable edge deployment, they often lose general capabilities and struggle with complex tasks. To address this, we propose \textbf{EcoAgent}, an \textbf{E}dge-\textbf{C}loud c\textbf{O}llaborative multi-agent framework for mobile automation. EcoAgent features a closed-loop collaboration among a cloud-based Planning Agent and two edge-based agents: the Execution Agent for action execution and the Observation Agent for verifying outcomes. The Observation Agent uses a Pre-Understanding Module to compress screen images into concise text, reducing token usage and communication overhead. In case of failure, the Planning Agent retrieves screen history through a Memory Module and replans via a Reflection Module. Experiments on AndroidWorld show that EcoAgent achieves task success rates comparable to cloud-based mobile agents while significantly reducing MLLM token consumption, enabling efficient and practical mobile automation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The strong planning and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fostered the development of agent-based systems capable of leveraging external tools and interacting with increasingly complex environments. However, these powerful features also introduce a critical security risk: indirect prompt injection, a sophisticated attack vector that compromises the core of these agents, the LLM, by manipulating contextual information rather than direct user prompts. In this work, we propose a generic black-box fuzzing framework, AgentXploit, designed to automatically discover and exploit indirect prompt injection vulnerabilities across diverse LLM agents. Our approach starts by constructing a high-quality initial seed corpus, then employs a seed selection algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to iteratively refine inputs, thereby maximizing the likelihood of uncovering agent weaknesses. We evaluate AgentXploit on two public benchmarks, AgentDojo and VWA-adv, where it achieves 71% and 70% success rates against agents based on o3-mini and GPT-4o, respectively, nearly doubling the performance of baseline attacks. Moreover, AgentXploit exhibits strong transferability across unseen tasks and internal LLMs, as well as promising results against defenses. Beyond benchmark evaluations, we apply our attacks in real-world environments, successfully misleading agents to navigate to arbitrary URLs, including malicious sites.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Individuals with upper limb movement limitations face challenges in interacting with others. Although robotic arms are currently used primarily for functional tasks, there is considerable potential to explore ways to enhance users' body language capabilities during social interactions. This paper introduces an Augmented Body Communicator system that integrates robotic arms and a large language model. Through the incorporation of kinetic memory, disabled users and their supporters can collaboratively design actions for the robot arm. The LLM system then provides suggestions on the most suitable action based on contextual cues during interactions. The system underwent thorough user testing with six participants who have conditions affecting upper limb mobility. Results indicate that the system improves users' ability to express themselves.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Profanity is nearly as old as language itself, and cursing has become particularly ubiquitous within the last century. At the same time, robots in personal and service applications are often overly polite, even though past work demonstrates the potential benefits of robot norm-breaking. Thus, we became curious about robots using curse words in error scenarios as a means for improving social perceptions by human users. We investigated this idea using three phases of exploratory work: an online video-based study (N = 76) with a student pool, an online video-based study (N = 98) in the general U.S. population, and an in-person proof-of-concept deployment (N = 52) in a campus space, each of which included the following conditions: no-speech, non-expletive error response, and expletive error response. A surprising result in the outcomes for all three studies was that although verbal acknowledgment of an error was typically beneficial (as expected based on prior work), few significant differences appeared between the non-expletive and expletive error acknowledgment conditions (counter to our expectations). Within the cultural context of our work, the U.S., it seems that many users would likely not mind if robots curse, and may even find it relatable and humorous. This work signals a promising and mischievous design space that challenges typical robot character design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion transformer (DiT) models have achieved remarkable success in image generation, thanks for their exceptional generative capabilities and scalability. Nonetheless, the iterative nature of diffusion models (DMs) results in high computation complexity, posing challenges for deployment. Although existing cache-based acceleration methods try to utilize the inherent temporal similarity to skip redundant computations of DiT, the lack of correction may induce potential quality degradation. In this paper, we propose increment-calibrated caching, a training-free method for DiT acceleration, where the calibration parameters are generated from the pre-trained model itself with low-rank approximation. To deal with the possible correction failure arising from outlier activations, we introduce channel-aware Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), which further strengthens the calibration effect. Experimental results show that our method always achieve better performance than existing naive caching methods with a similar computation resource budget. When compared with 35-step DDIM, our method eliminates more than 45% computation and improves IS by 12 at the cost of less than 0.06 FID increase.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> There has been a growing interest in translating C code to Rust due to Rust's robust memory and thread safety guarantees. Tools such as C2RUST enable syntax-guided transpilation from C to semantically equivalent Rust code. However, the resulting Rust programs often rely heavily on unsafe constructs--particularly raw pointers--which undermines Rust's safety guarantees. This paper aims to improve the memory safety of Rust programs generated by C2RUST by eliminating raw pointers. Specifically, we propose a peephole raw pointer rewriting technique that lifts raw pointers in individual functions to appropriate Rust data structures. Technically, PR2 employs decision-tree-based prompting to guide the pointer lifting process. Additionally, it leverages code change analysis to guide the repair of errors introduced during rewriting, effectively addressing errors encountered during compilation and test case execution. We implement PR2 as a prototype and evaluate it using gpt-4o-mini on 28 real-world C projects. The results show that PR2 successfully eliminates 13.22% of local raw pointers across these projects, significantly enhancing the safety of the translated Rust code. On average, PR2 completes the transformation of a project in 5.44 hours, at an average cost of $1.46.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Over the past few years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have developed rapidly and are widely applied in various domains. However, LLMs face the issue of hallucinations, generating responses that may be unreliable when the models lack relevant knowledge. To be aware of potential hallucinations, uncertainty estimation methods have been introduced, and most of them have confirmed that reliability lies in critical tokens. However, probability-based methods perform poorly in identifying token reliability, limiting their practical utility. In this paper, we reveal that the probability-based method fails to estimate token reliability due to the loss of evidence strength information which is accumulated in the training stage. Therefore, we present Logits-induced token uncertainty (LogTokU), a framework for estimating decoupled token uncertainty in LLMs, enabling real-time uncertainty estimation without requiring multiple sampling processes. We employ evidence modeling to implement LogTokU and use the estimated uncertainty to guide downstream tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that LogTokU has significant effectiveness and promise.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Robotic manipulation in 3D requires learning an $N$ degree-of-freedom joint space trajectory of a robot manipulator. Robots must possess semantic and visual perception abilities to transform real-world mappings of their workspace into the low-level control necessary for object manipulation. Recent work has demonstrated the capabilities of fine-tuning large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to learn the mapping between RGB images, language instructions, and joint space control. These models typically take as input RGB images of the workspace and language instructions, and are trained on large datasets of teleoperated robot demonstrations. In this work, we explore methods to improve the scene context awareness of a popular recent Vision-Language-Action model by integrating chain-of-thought reasoning, depth perception, and task-oriented region of interest detection. Our experiments in the LIBERO simulation environment show that our proposed model, 3D-CAVLA, improves the success rate across various LIBERO task suites, achieving an average success rate of 98.1$\%$. We also evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of our method, demonstrating that 3D scene awareness leads to robust learning and adaptation for completely unseen tasks. 3D-CAVLA achieves an absolute improvement of 8.8$\%$ on unseen tasks. We will open-source our code and the unseen tasks dataset to promote community-driven research here: https://3d-cavla.github.io

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models face deployment challenges due to their large parameter counts and computational demands. We explore quantization for MoE models and highlight two key insights: 1) linear blocks exhibit varying quantization sensitivity, and 2) divergent expert activation frequencies create heterogeneous computational characteristics. Based on these observations, we introduce MxMoE, a mixed-precision optimization framework for MoE models that considers both algorithmic and system perspectives. MxMoE navigates the design space defined by parameter sensitivity, expert activation dynamics, and hardware resources to derive efficient mixed-precision configurations. Additionally, MxMoE automatically generates optimized mixed-precision GroupGEMM kernels, enabling parallel execution of GEMMs with different precisions. Evaluations show that MxMoE outperforms existing methods, achieving 2.4 lower Wikitext-2 perplexity than GPTQ at 2.25-bit and delivering up to 3.4x speedup over full precision, as well as up to 29.4% speedup over uniform quantization at equivalent accuracy with 5-bit weight-activation quantization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Logical reasoning is a critical component of Large Language Models (LLMs), and substantial research efforts in recent years have aimed to enhance their deductive reasoning capabilities. However, existing deductive reasoning benchmarks, which are crucial for evaluating and advancing LLMs, are inadequate due to their lack of task complexity, presence of prior knowledge as a confounder, and superficial error analysis. To address these deficiencies, we introduce JustLogic, a synthetically generated deductive reasoning benchmark designed for rigorous evaluation of LLMs. JustLogic is (i) highly complex, capable of generating a diverse range of linguistic patterns, vocabulary, and argument structures; (ii) prior knowledge independent, eliminating the advantage of models possessing prior knowledge and ensuring that only deductive reasoning is used to answer questions; and (iii) capable of in-depth error analysis on the heterogeneous effects of reasoning depth and argument form on model accuracy. Our experimental results on JustLogic reveal that (i) state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning LLMs perform on par or better than the human average but significantly worse than the human ceiling, and (ii) SOTA non-reasoning models still underperform the human average.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly pushing the limits of contemporary computing hardware. For example, training GPT-3 has been estimated to consume around 1300 MWh of electricity, and projections suggest future models may require city-scale (gigawatt) power budgets. These demands motivate exploration of computing paradigms beyond conventional von Neumann architectures. This review surveys emerging photonic hardware optimized for next-generation generative AI computing. We discuss integrated photonic neural network architectures (e.g., Mach-Zehnder interferometer meshes, lasers, wavelength-multiplexed microring resonators) that perform ultrafast matrix operations. We also examine promising alternative neuromorphic devices, including spiking neural network circuits and hybrid spintronic-photonic synapses, which combine memory and processing. The integration of two-dimensional materials (graphene, TMDCs) into silicon photonic platforms is reviewed for tunable modulators and on-chip synaptic elements. Transformer-based LLM architectures (self-attention and feed-forward layers) are analyzed in this context, identifying strategies and challenges for mapping dynamic matrix multiplications onto these novel hardware substrates. We then dissect the mechanisms of mainstream LLMs, such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and LLaMA, highlighting their architectural similarities and differences. We synthesize state-of-the-art components, algorithms, and integration methods, highlighting key advances and open issues in scaling such systems to mega-sized LLM models. We find that photonic computing systems could potentially surpass electronic processors by orders of magnitude in throughput and energy efficiency, but require breakthroughs in memory, especially for long-context windows and long token sequences, and in storage of ultra-large datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Occupations referred to as "dirty work" often face entrenched social stigma, which adversely affects the mental health of workers in these fields and impedes occupational equity. In this study, we propose a novel Interactive Fiction (IF) framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to encourage perspective-taking and reduce biases against these stigmatized yet essential roles. Through an experiment with participants (n = 100) across four such occupations, we observed a significant increase in participants' understanding of these occupations, as well as a high level of empathy and a strong sense of connection to individuals in these roles. Additionally, qualitative interviews with participants (n = 15) revealed that the LLM-based perspective-taking IF enhanced immersion, deepened emotional resonance and empathy toward "dirty work," and allowed participants to experience a sense of professional fulfillment in these occupations. However, participants also highlighted ongoing challenges, such as limited contextual details generated by the LLM and the unintentional reinforcement of existing stereotypes. Overall, our findings underscore that an LLM-based perspective-taking IF framework offers a promising and scalable strategy for mitigating stigma and promoting social equity in marginalized professions.

However, most GSL methods are tailored for traditional graphs without textual information, underscoring the necessity of developing a new GSL paradigm. Despite clear motivations, it remains challenging: (1) How can we define a reasonable optimization objective for GSL in the era of LLMs, considering the massive parameters in LLM? (2) How can we design an efficient model architecture that enables seamless integration of LLM for this optimization objective? For Question 1, we reformulate existing GSL optimization objectives as a tree optimization framework, shifting the focus from obtaining a well-trained edge predictor to a language-aware tree sampler. For Question 2, we propose decoupled and training-free model design principles for LLM integration, shifting the focus from computation-intensive fine-tuning to more efficient inference. Based on this, we propose Large Language and Tree Assistant (LLaTA), which leverages tree-based LLM in-context learning to enhance the understanding of topology and text, enabling reliable inference and generating improved graph structure. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets demonstrate that LLaTA enjoys flexibility-incorporated with any backbone; scalability-outperforms other LLM-enhanced graph learning methods; effectiveness-achieves SOTA predictive performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based models are the foundation of modern machine learning, but their execution, particularly during autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs), places significant pressure on memory systems due to frequent memory accesses and growing key-value (KV) caches. This creates a bottleneck in memory bandwidth, especially as context lengths increase. Processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures are a promising solution, offering high internal bandwidth and compute parallelism near memory. However, current PIM designs are primarily optimized for dense attention and struggle with the dynamic, irregular access patterns introduced by modern KV cache sparsity techniques. Consequently, they suffer from workload imbalance, reducing throughput and resource utilization. In this work, we propose STARC, a novel sparsity-optimized data mapping scheme tailored specifically for efficient LLM decoding on PIM architectures. STARC clusters KV pairs by semantic similarity and maps them to contiguous memory regions aligned with PIM bank structures. During decoding, queries retrieve relevant tokens at cluster granularity by matching against precomputed centroids, enabling selective attention and parallel processing without frequent reclustering or data movement overhead. Experiments on the HBM-PIM system show that, compared to common token-wise sparsity methods, STARC reduces attention-layer latency by 19%--31% and energy consumption by 19%--27%. Under a KV cache budget of 1024, it achieves up to 54%--74% latency reduction and 45%--67% energy reduction compared to full KV cache retrieval. Meanwhile, STARC maintains model accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art sparse attention methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling efficient and hardware-friendly long-context LLM inference on PIM architectures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Code large language models (CodeLLMs) and agents have shown great promise in tackling complex software engineering tasks.Compared to traditional software engineering methods, CodeLLMs and agents offer stronger abilities, and can flexibly process inputs and outputs in both natural and code. Benchmarking plays a crucial role in evaluating the capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents, guiding their development and deployment. However, despite their growing significance, there remains a lack of comprehensive reviews of benchmarks for CodeLLMs and agents. To bridge this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of existing benchmarks for CodeLLMs and agents, studying and analyzing 181 benchmarks from 461 relevant papers, covering the different phases of the software development life cycle (SDLC). Our findings reveal a notable imbalance in the coverage of current benchmarks, with approximately 60% focused on the software development phase in SDLC, while requirements engineering and software design phases receive minimal attention at only 5% and 3%, respectively. Additionally, Python emerges as the dominant programming language across the reviewed benchmarks. Finally, this paper highlights the challenges of current research and proposes future directions, aiming to narrow the gap between the theoretical capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents and their application in real-world scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Formal reasoning and automated theorem proving constitute a challenging subfield of machine learning, in which machines are tasked with proving mathematical theorems using formal languages like Lean. A formal verification system can check whether a formal proof is correct or not almost instantaneously, but generating a completely correct formal proof with large language models (LLMs) remains a formidable task. The usual approach in the literature is to prompt the LLM many times (up to several thousands) until one of the generated proofs passes the verification system. In this work, we present APOLLO (Automated PrOof repair via LLM and Lean cOllaboration), a modular, model-agnostic pipeline that combines the strengths of the Lean compiler with an LLM's reasoning abilities to achieve better proof-generation results at a low sampling budget. Apollo directs a fully automated process in which the LLM generates proofs for theorems, a set of agents analyze the proofs, fix the syntax errors, identify the mistakes in the proofs using Lean, isolate failing sub-lemmas, utilize automated solvers, and invoke an LLM on each remaining goal with a low top-K budget. The repaired sub-proofs are recombined and reverified, iterating up to a user-controlled maximum number of attempts. On the miniF2F benchmark, we establish a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 75.0% among 7B-parameter models while keeping the sampling budget below one thousand. Moreover, Apollo raises the state-of-the-art accuracy for Goedel-Prover-SFT to 65.6% while cutting sample complexity from 25,600 to a few hundred. General-purpose models (o3-mini, o4-mini) jump from 3-7% to over 40% accuracy. Our results demonstrate that targeted, compiler-guided repair of LLM outputs yields dramatic gains in both efficiency and correctness, suggesting a general paradigm for scalable automated theorem proving.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have unveiled remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating both natural language and code, but LLM reasoning is prone to hallucination and struggle with complex, novel scenarios, often getting stuck on partial or incorrect solutions. However, the inherent ability of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to explore extensive and complex search spaces makes them particularly effective in scenarios where traditional optimization methodologies may falter. However, EAs explore a vast search space when applied to complex problems.   To address the computational bottleneck of evaluating large populations, particularly crucial for complex evolutionary tasks, we introduce a highly efficient evaluation framework. This implementation maintains compatibility with existing primitive definitions, ensuring the generation of valid individuals.   Using LLMs, we propose an enhanced evolutionary search strategy that enables a more focused exploration of expansive solution spaces. LLMs facilitate the generation of superior candidate solutions, as evidenced by empirical results demonstrating their efficacy in producing improved outcomes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving user data privacy by keeping data local. Despite these advantages, FL remains vulnerable to privacy attacks on user updates and model parameters during training and deployment. Secure aggregation protocols have been proposed to protect user updates by encrypting them, but these methods often incur high computational costs and are not resistant to quantum computers. Additionally, differential privacy (DP) has been used to mitigate privacy leakages, but existing methods focus on secure aggregation or DP, neglecting their potential synergies. To address these gaps, we introduce Beskar, a novel framework that provides post-quantum secure aggregation, optimizes computational overhead for FL settings, and defines a comprehensive threat model that accounts for a wide spectrum of adversaries. We also integrate DP into different stages of FL training to enhance privacy protection in diverse scenarios. Our framework provides a detailed analysis of the trade-offs between security, performance, and model accuracy, representing the first thorough examination of secure aggregation protocols combined with various DP approaches for post-quantum secure FL. Beskar aims to address the pressing privacy and security issues FL while ensuring quantum-safety and robust performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising paradigm for training Large Language Models (LLMs) in a decentralized manner while preserving data privacy and minimizing communication overhead. This survey examines recent advancements in FL-driven LLMs, with a particular emphasis on architectural designs, performance optimization, and security concerns, including the emerging area of machine unlearning. In this context, machine unlearning refers to the systematic removal of specific data contributions from trained models to comply with privacy regulations such as the Right to be Forgotten. We review a range of strategies enabling unlearning in federated LLMs, including perturbation-based methods, model decomposition, and incremental retraining, while evaluating their trade-offs in terms of efficiency, privacy guarantees, and model utility. Through selected case studies and empirical evaluations, we analyze how these methods perform in practical FL scenarios. This survey identifies critical research directions toward developing secure, adaptable, and high-performing federated LLM systems for real-world deployment.

However, effectively leveraging this ability for example-based arbitrary style transfer, where an input text is rewritten to match the style of a given exemplar, remains an open challenge. A key question is how to describe the style of the exemplar to guide LLMs toward high-quality rewrites. In this work, we propose a prompting method based on register analysis to guide LLMs to perform this task. Empirical evaluations across multiple style transfer tasks show that our prompting approach enhances style transfer strength while preserving meaning more effectively than existing prompting strategies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in solving complex tasks, making them a promising tool for enhancing tabular learning. However, existing LLM-based methods suffer from high resource requirements, suboptimal demonstration selection, and limited interpretability, which largely hinder their prediction performance and application in the real world. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel in-context learning framework for tabular prediction. The core idea is to leverage the explanations generated by LLMs to guide a smaller, locally deployable Surrogate Language Model (SLM) to make interpretable tabular predictions. Specifically, our framework mainly involves three stages: (i) Post Hoc Explanation Generation, where LLMs are utilized to generate explanations for question-answer pairs in candidate demonstrations, providing insights into the reasoning behind the answer. (ii) Post Hoc Explanation-Guided Demonstrations Selection, which utilizes explanations generated by LLMs to guide the process of demonstration selection from candidate demonstrations. (iii) Post Hoc Explanation-Guided Interpretable SLM Prediction, which utilizes the demonstrations obtained in step (ii) as in-context and merges corresponding explanations as rationales to improve the performance of SLM and guide the model to generate interpretable outputs. Experimental results highlight the framework's effectiveness, with an average accuracy improvement of 5.31% across various tabular datasets in diverse domains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The scarcity of high-quality multimodal biomedical data limits the ability to effectively fine-tune pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) for specialized biomedical tasks. To address this challenge, we introduce MINT (Multimodal Integrated kNowledge Transfer), a framework that aligns unimodal large decoder models with domain-specific decision patterns from multimodal biomedical data through preference optimization. While MINT supports different optimization techniques, we primarily implement it with the Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) framework as its backbone. This strategy enables the aligned LLMs to perform predictive tasks using text-only or image-only inputs while retaining knowledge learnt from multimodal data. MINT leverages an upstream multimodal machine learning (MML) model trained on high-quality multimodal data to transfer domain-specific insights to downstream text-only or image-only LLMs. We demonstrate its effectiveness through two key applications: (1) Rare genetic disease prediction from texts, where MINT uses a multimodal encoder model, trained on facial photos and clinical notes, to generate a preference dataset for aligning a lightweight Llama 3.2-3B-Instruct. Despite relying on text input only, the MINT-derived model outperforms models trained with SFT, RAG, or DPO, and even outperforms Llama 3.1-405B-Instruct. (2) Tissue type classification using cell nucleus images, where MINT uses a vision-language foundation model as the preference generator, containing knowledge learnt from both text and histopathological images to align downstream image-only models. The resulting MINT-derived model significantly improves the performance of Llama 3.2-Vision-11B-Instruct on tissue type classification. In summary, MINT provides an effective strategy to align unimodal LLMs with high-quality multimodal expertise through preference optimization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language model (LLM) training is one of the most demanding distributed computations today, often requiring thousands of GPUs with frequent synchronization across machines. Such a workload pattern makes it susceptible to stragglers, where the training can be stalled by few slow workers. At ByteDance we find stragglers are not trivially always caused by hardware failures, but can arise from multiple complex factors. This work aims to present a comprehensive study on the straggler issues in LLM training, using a five-month trace collected from our ByteDance LLM training cluster. The core methodology is what-if analysis that simulates the scenario without any stragglers and contrasts with the actual case. We use this method to study the following questions: (1) how often do stragglers affect training jobs, and what effect do they have on job performance; (2) do stragglers exhibit temporal or spatial patterns; and (3) what are the potential root causes for stragglers?

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Watermarking has emerged as a critical technique for combating misinformation and protecting intellectual property in large language models (LLMs). A recent discovery, termed watermark radioactivity, reveals that watermarks embedded in teacher models can be inherited by student models through knowledge distillation. On the positive side, this inheritance allows for the detection of unauthorized knowledge distillation by identifying watermark traces in student models. However, the robustness of watermarks against scrubbing attacks and their unforgeability in the face of spoofing attacks under unauthorized knowledge distillation remain largely unexplored. Existing watermark attack methods either assume access to model internals or fail to simultaneously support both scrubbing and spoofing attacks. In this work, we propose Contrastive Decoding-Guided Knowledge Distillation (CDG-KD), a unified framework that enables bidirectional attacks under unauthorized knowledge distillation. Our approach employs contrastive decoding to extract corrupted or amplified watermark texts via comparing outputs from the student model and weakly watermarked references, followed by bidirectional distillation to train new student models capable of watermark removal and watermark forgery, respectively. Extensive experiments show that CDG-KD effectively performs attacks while preserving the general performance of the distilled model. Our findings underscore critical need for developing watermarking schemes that are robust and unforgeable.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid advancement of LLMs (Large Language Models) has established them as a foundational technology for many AI and ML powered human computer interactions. A critical challenge in this context is the attribution of LLM-generated text, either to the specific language model used or to the individual user who generated it. This is essential for combating misinformation, fake news, misinterpretation, and plagiarism. One of the key techniques for addressing this issue is watermarking.   This work presents a watermarking scheme for LLM-generated text based on Lagrange interpolation, which enables the recovery of a secret author identity even when the text has been heavily redacted by an adversary. The core idea is to embed a continuous sequence of points (x, f(x)) that lie on a single straight line. The x-coordinates are generated pseudorandomly using either an LFSR (when security is not a priority) or a cryptographically secure NFSR for high-security applications. The scheme efficiency and resilience to adversarial modifications are analysed. Experimental results show that the proposed method is highly effective, allowing the recovery of the author identity when as few as three points survive adversarial manipulation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The integration of AI into daily life has generated considerable attention and excitement, while also raising concerns about automating algorithmic harms and re-entrenching existing social inequities. While the responsible deployment of trustworthy AI systems is a worthy goal, there are many possible ways to realize it, from policy and regulation to improved algorithm design and evaluation. In fact, since AI trains on social data, there is even a possibility for everyday users, citizens, or workers to directly steer its behavior through Algorithmic Collective Action, by deliberately modifying the data they share with a platform to drive its learning process in their favor. This paper considers how these grassroots efforts to influence AI interact with methods already used by AI firms and governments to improve model trustworthiness. In particular, we focus on the setting where the AI firm deploys a differentially private model, motivated by the growing regulatory focus on privacy and data protection. We investigate how the use of Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) affects the collective's ability to influence the learning process. Our findings show that while differential privacy contributes to the protection of individual data, it introduces challenges for effective algorithmic collective action. We characterize lower bounds on the success of algorithmic collective action under differential privacy as a function of the collective's size and the firm's privacy parameters, and verify these trends experimentally by simulating collective action during the training of deep neural network classifiers across several datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Supervised and preference-based fine-tuning techniques have become popular for aligning large language models (LLMs) with user intent and correctness criteria. However, real-world training data often exhibits spurious correlations -- arising from biases, dataset artifacts, or other "shortcut" features -- that can compromise a model's performance or generalization. In this paper, we systematically evaluate three post-training algorithms -- Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and KTO (Kahneman-Tversky Optimization) -- across a diverse set of synthetic tasks and spuriousness conditions. Our tasks span mathematical reasoning, constrained instruction-following, and document-grounded question answering. We vary the degree of spurious correlation (10% vs. 90%) and investigate two forms of artifacts: "Feature Ambiguity" and "Distributional Narrowness." Our results show that the models often but not always degrade under higher spuriousness. The preference-based methods (DPO/KTO) can demonstrate relative robustness in mathematical reasoning tasks. By contrast, SFT maintains stronger performance in complex, context-intensive tasks. These findings highlight that no single post-training strategy universally outperforms in all scenarios; the best choice depends on the type of target task and the nature of spurious correlations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Purpose: Deep learning has demonstrated strong potential for MRI reconstruction, but conventional supervised learning methods require high-quality reference images, which are often unavailable in practice. Self-supervised learning offers an alternative, yet its performance degrades at high acceleration rates. To overcome these limitations, we propose hybrid learning, a novel two-stage training framework that combines self-supervised and supervised learning for robust image reconstruction.   Methods: Hybrid learning is implemented in two sequential stages. In the first stage, self-supervised learning is employed to generate improved images from noisy or undersampled reference data. These enhanced images then serve as pseudo-ground truths for the second stage, which uses supervised learning to refine reconstruction performance and support higher acceleration rates. We evaluated hybrid learning in two representative applications: (1) accelerated 0.55T spiral-UTE lung MRI using noisy reference data, and (2) 3D T1 mapping of the brain without access to fully sampled ground truth.   Results: For spiral-UTE lung MRI, hybrid learning consistently improved image quality over both self-supervised and conventional supervised methods across different acceleration rates, as measured by SSIM and NMSE. For 3D T1 mapping, hybrid learning achieved superior T1 quantification accuracy across a wide dynamic range, outperforming self-supervised learning in all tested conditions.   Conclusions: Hybrid learning provides a practical and effective solution for training deep MRI reconstruction networks when only low-quality or incomplete reference data are available. It enables improved image quality and accurate quantitative mapping across different applications and field strengths, representing a promising technique toward broader clinical deployment of deep learning-based MRI.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models (LLMs) handle increasingly longer contexts, serving long inference requests of millions of tokens presents unique challenges. We show that existing work for long context inference is largely based on techniques from long context training, and does not handle the high variability in input lengths during inference. This leads to inefficient resource utilization, server fragmentation, and head-of-line (HOL) blocking.   We present Medha, an end-to-end system for efficient long-context LLM inference that addresses these challenges through fine-grained time sharing. Medha introduces three key innovations: (1) the mechanism of adaptive prefill chunking to help mitigate HOL blocking with preemption; (2) two new parallelism strategies: Sequence Pipeline Parallelism (SPP) to reduce time-to-first-token by pipelining prefill chunks, and KV-Cache Parallelism (KVP) to lower time-peroutput-token by distributing decoding across servers; and (3) a novel input-length aware least remaining slack scheduling to meet Service Level Objectives (SLOs).   Medha enables exact inference scaling beyond 10 million tokens, maintaining high throughput and low latency across mixed-length workloads. Compared to state-of-the-art systems, Medha reduces server fragmentation, cuts median latency by up to 30x, and improves throughput by over 5x, delivering production-scale long-context inference without compromising performance on shorter requests.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Agentic Generative AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and Vector Stores (VSs), represents a transformative technology applicable to specialized domains such as legal systems, research, recommender systems, cybersecurity, and global security, including proliferation research. This technology excels at inferring relationships within vast unstructured or semi-structured datasets. The legal domain here comprises complex data characterized by extensive, interrelated, and semi-structured knowledge systems with complex relations. It comprises constitutions, statutes, regulations, and case law. Extracting insights and navigating the intricate networks of legal documents and their relations is crucial for effective legal research. Here, we introduce a generative AI system that integrates RAG, VS, and KG, constructed via Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), to enhance legal information retrieval and AI reasoning and minimize hallucinations. In the legal system, these technologies empower AI agents to identify and analyze complex connections among cases, statutes, and legal precedents, uncovering hidden relationships and predicting legal trends-challenging tasks that are essential for ensuring justice and improving operational efficiency. Our system employs web scraping techniques to systematically collect legal texts, such as statutes, constitutional provisions, and case law, from publicly accessible platforms like Justia. It bridges the gap between traditional keyword-based searches and contextual understanding by leveraging advanced semantic representations, hierarchical relationships, and latent topic discovery. This framework supports legal document clustering, summarization, and cross-referencing, for scalable, interpretable, and accurate retrieval for semi-structured data while advancing computational law and AI.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce Bielik v3, a series of parameter-efficient generative text models (1.5B and 4.5B) optimized for Polish language processing. These models demonstrate that smaller, well-optimized architectures can achieve performance comparable to much larger counterparts while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. Our approach incorporates several key innovations: a custom Polish tokenizer (APT4) that significantly improves token efficiency, Weighted Instruction Cross-Entropy Loss to balance learning across instruction types, and Adaptive Learning Rate that dynamically adjusts based on training progress. Trained on a meticulously curated corpus of 292 billion tokens spanning 303 million documents, these models excel across multiple benchmarks, including the Open PL LLM Leaderboard, Complex Polish Text Understanding Benchmark, Polish EQ-Bench, and Polish Medical Leaderboard. The 4.5B parameter model achieves results competitive with models 2-3 times its size, while the 1.5B model delivers strong performance despite its extremely compact profile. These advances establish new benchmarks for parameter-efficient language modeling in less-represented languages, making high-quality Polish language AI more accessible for resource-constrained applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present Bielik 11B v2, a state-of-the-art language model optimized for Polish text processing. Built on the Mistral 7B v0.2 architecture and scaled to 11B parameters using depth up-scaling, this model demonstrates exceptional performance across Polish language benchmarks while maintaining strong cross-lingual capabilities. We introduce two key technical innovations: Weighted Instruction Cross-Entropy Loss, which optimizes learning across diverse instruction types by assigning quality-based weights to training examples, and Adaptive Learning Rate, which dynamically adjusts based on context length. Comprehensive evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that Bielik 11B v2 outperforms many larger models, including those with 2-6 times more parameters, and significantly surpasses other specialized Polish language models on tasks ranging from linguistic understanding to complex reasoning. The model's parameter efficiency and extensive quantization options enable deployment across various hardware configurations, advancing Polish language AI capabilities and establishing new benchmarks for resource-efficient language modeling in less-represented languages.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The issue of clone code has persisted in software engineering, primarily because developers often copy and paste code segments. This common practice has elevated the importance of clone code detection, garnering attention from both software engineering researchers and industry professionals. Their collective concern arises from the potential negative impacts that clone code can have on software quality. The emergence of powerful Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has exacerbated the clone code problem. These advanced models possess code generation capabilities that can inadvertently create code clones. As a result, the need to detect clone code has become more critical than ever before. In this study, we assess the suitability of LLMs for clone code detection. Our results demonstrate that the Palm model achieved a high F1 score of 89.30 for the avatar dataset and 86.41 for the poolC dataset. A known issue with LLMs is their susceptibility to prompt bias, where the performance of these models fluctuates based on the input prompt provided. In our research, we delve deeper into the reasons behind these fluctuations and propose a framework to mitigate prompt bias for clone detection. Our analysis identifies eight distinct categories of prompt bias, and our devised approach leveraging these biases yields a significant improvement of up to 10.81% in the F1 score. These findings underscore the substantial impact of prompt bias on the performance of LLMs and highlight the potential for leveraging model errors to alleviate this bias.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite rapid advancements in the capabilities of generative models, pretrained text-to-image models still struggle in capturing the semantics conveyed by complex prompts that compound multiple objects and instance-level attributes. Consequently, we are witnessing growing interests in integrating additional structural constraints, %leveraging additional structural inputs typically in the form of coarse bounding boxes, to better guide the generation process in such challenging cases. In this work, we take the idea of structural guidance a step further by making the observation that contemporary image generation models can directly provide a plausible \emph{fine-grained} structural initialization. We propose a technique that couples this image-based structural guidance with LLM-based instance-level instructions, yielding output images that adhere to all parts of the text prompt, including object counts, instance-level attributes, and spatial relations between instances.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a popular technique for enhancing the reliability and utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) by grounding responses in external documents. Traditional RAG systems rely on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to first process scanned documents into text. However, even state-of-the-art OCRs can introduce errors, especially in degraded or complex documents. Recent vision-language approaches, such as ColPali, propose direct visual embedding of documents, eliminating the need for OCR. This study presents a systematic comparison between a vision-based RAG system (ColPali) and more traditional OCR-based pipelines utilizing Llama 3.2 (90B) and Nougat OCR across varying document qualities. Beyond conventional retrieval accuracy metrics, we introduce a semantic answer evaluation benchmark to assess end-to-end question-answering performance. Our findings indicate that while vision-based RAG performs well on documents it has been fine-tuned on, OCR-based RAG is better able to generalize to unseen documents of varying quality. We highlight the key trade-offs between computational efficiency and semantic accuracy, offering practical guidance for RAG practitioners in selecting between OCR-dependent and vision-based document retrieval systems in production environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated success in generalizing across decision-making tasks including planning, control and prediction, but their tendency to hallucinate unsafe and undesired outputs poses risks. We argue that detecting such failures is necessary, especially in safety-critical scenarios. Existing black-box methods often detect hallucinations by identifying inconsistencies across multiple samples. Many of these approaches typically introduce prompt perturbations like randomizing detail order or generating adversarial inputs, with the intuition that a confident model should produce stable outputs. We first perform a manual case study showing that other forms of perturbations (e.g., adding noise, removing sensor details) cause LLMs to hallucinate in a driving environment. We then propose a novel method for efficiently searching the space of prompt perturbations using Adaptive Stress Testing (AST) with Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Our AST formulation enables discovery of scenarios and prompts that cause language models to act with high uncertainty. By generating MCTS prompt perturbation trees across diverse scenarios, we show that offline analyses can be used at runtime to automatically generate prompts that influence model uncertainty, and to inform real-time trust assessments of an LLM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models (LLMs) increasingly adapt and personalize to diverse sets of users, there is an increased risk of systems appropriating sociolects, i.e., language styles or dialects that are associated with specific minoritized lived experiences (e.g., African American English, Queer slang). In this work, we examine whether sociolect usage by an LLM agent affects user reliance on its outputs and user perception (satisfaction, frustration, trust, and social presence). We designed and conducted user studies where 498 African American English (AAE) speakers and 487 Queer slang speakers performed a set of question-answering tasks with LLM-based suggestions in either standard American English (SAE) or their self-identified sociolect. Our findings showed that sociolect usage by LLMs influenced both reliance and perceptions, though in some surprising ways. Results suggest that both AAE and Queer slang speakers relied more on the SAE agent, and had more positive perceptions of the SAE agent. Yet, only Queer slang speakers felt more social presence from the Queer slang agent over the SAE one, whereas only AAE speakers preferred and trusted the SAE agent over the AAE one. These findings emphasize the need to test for behavioral outcomes rather than simply assume that personalization would lead to a better and safer reliance outcome. They also highlight the nuanced dynamics of minoritized language in machine interactions, underscoring the need for LLMs to be carefully designed to respect cultural and linguistic boundaries while fostering genuine user engagement and trust.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Data privacy remains a critical concern in educational research, requiring strict adherence to ethical standards and regulatory protocols. While traditional approaches rely on anonymization and centralized data collection, they often expose raw student data to security vulnerabilities and impose substantial logistical overhead. In this study, we propose a federated learning (FL) framework for automated scoring of educational assessments that eliminates the need to share sensitive data across institutions. Our approach leverages parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enabling each client (school) to train locally while sharing only optimized model updates. To address data heterogeneity, we implement an adaptive weighted aggregation strategy that considers both client performance and data volume. We benchmark our model against two state-of-the-art FL methods and a centralized learning baseline using NGSS-aligned multi-label science assessment data from nine middle schools. Results show that our model achieves the highest accuracy (94.5%) among FL approaches, and performs within 0.5-1.0 percentage points of the centralized model on these metrics. Additionally, it achieves comparable rubric-level scoring accuracy, with only a 1.3% difference in rubric match and a lower score deviation (MAE), highlighting its effectiveness in preserving both prediction quality and interpretability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Aerial vision-and-language navigation (VLN), requiring drones to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex urban environments, emerges as a critical embodied AI challenge that bridges human-robot interaction, 3D spatial reasoning, and real-world deployment. Although existing ground VLN agents achieved notable results in indoor and outdoor settings, they struggle in aerial VLN due to the absence of predefined navigation graphs and the exponentially expanding action space in long-horizon exploration. In this work, we propose \textbf{CityNavAgent}, a large language model (LLM)-empowered agent that significantly reduces the navigation complexity for urban aerial VLN. Specifically, we design a hierarchical semantic planning module (HSPM) that decomposes the long-horizon task into sub-goals with different semantic levels. The agent reaches the target progressively by achieving sub-goals with different capacities of the LLM. Additionally, a global memory module storing historical trajectories into a topological graph is developed to simplify navigation for visited targets. Extensive benchmark experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant improvement. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of different modules of CityNavAgent for aerial VLN in continuous city environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has influenced the development of their lighter counterparts-Small Language Models (SLMs)-to enable on-device deployment across smartphones and edge devices. These SLMs offer enhanced privacy, reduced latency, server-free functionality, and improved user experience. However, due to resource constraints of on-device environment, SLMs undergo size optimization through compression techniques like quantization, which can inadvertently introduce fairness, ethical and privacy risks. Critically, quantized SLMs may respond to harmful queries directly, without requiring adversarial manipulation, raising significant safety and trust concerns.   To address this, we propose LiteLMGuard (LLMG), an on-device prompt guard that provides real-time, prompt-level defense for quantized SLMs. Additionally, our prompt guard is designed to be model-agnostic such that it can be seamlessly integrated with any SLM, operating independently of underlying architectures. Our LLMG formalizes prompt filtering as a deep learning (DL)-based prompt answerability classification task, leveraging semantic understanding to determine whether a query should be answered by any SLM. Using our curated dataset, Answerable-or-Not, we trained and fine-tuned several DL models and selected ELECTRA as the candidate, with 97.75% answerability classification accuracy.   Our safety effectiveness evaluations demonstrate that LLMG defends against over 87% of harmful prompts, including both direct instruction and jailbreak attack strategies. We further showcase its ability to mitigate the Open Knowledge Attacks, where compromised SLMs provide unsafe responses without adversarial prompting. In terms of prompt filtering effectiveness, LLMG achieves near state-of-the-art filtering accuracy of 94%, with an average latency of 135 ms, incurring negligible overhead for users.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Predicting enzymatic reactions is crucial for applications in biocatalysis, metabolic engineering, and drug discovery, yet it remains a complex and resource-intensive task. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success in various scientific domains, e.g., through their ability to generalize knowledge, reason over complex structures, and leverage in-context learning strategies. In this study, we systematically evaluate the capability of LLMs, particularly the Llama-3.1 family (8B and 70B), across three core biochemical tasks: Enzyme Commission number prediction, forward synthesis, and retrosynthesis. We compare single-task and multitask learning strategies, employing parameter-efficient fine-tuning via LoRA adapters. Additionally, we assess performance across different data regimes to explore their adaptability in low-data settings. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs capture biochemical knowledge, with multitask learning enhancing forward- and retrosynthesis predictions by leveraging shared enzymatic information. We also identify key limitations, for example challenges in hierarchical EC classification schemes, highlighting areas for further improvement in LLM-driven biochemical modeling.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce ReplaceMe, a generalized training-free depth pruning method that effectively replaces transformer blocks with a linear operation, while maintaining high performance for low compression ratios. In contrast to conventional pruning approaches that require additional training or fine-tuning, our approach requires only a small calibration dataset that is used to estimate a linear transformation to approximate the pruned blocks. This estimated linear mapping can be seamlessly merged with the remaining transformer blocks, eliminating the need for any additional network parameters. Our experiments show that ReplaceMe consistently outperforms other training-free approaches and remains highly competitive with state-of-the-art pruning methods that involve extensive retraining/fine-tuning and architectural modifications. Applied to several large language models (LLMs), ReplaceMe achieves up to 25% pruning while retaining approximately 90% of the original model's performance on open benchmarks - without any training or healing steps, resulting in minimal computational overhead (see Fig.1). We provide an open-source library implementing ReplaceMe alongside several state-of-the-art depth pruning techniques, available at this repository.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we discuss learning algorithms and their importance in different types of applications which includes training to identify important patterns and features in a straightforward, easy-to-understand manner. We will review the main concepts of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and hybrid models. Some important subsets of Machine Learning algorithms such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning are also discussed in this paper. These techniques can be used for some important tasks like prediction, classification, and segmentation. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used for image and video processing and many more applications. We dive into the architecture of CNNs and how to integrate CNNs with ML algorithms to build hybrid models. This paper explores the vulnerability of learning algorithms to noise, leading to misclassification. We further discuss the integration of learning algorithms with Large Language Models (LLM) to generate coherent responses applicable to many domains such as healthcare, marketing, and finance by learning important patterns from large volumes of data. Furthermore, we discuss the next generation of learning algorithms and how we may have an unified Adaptive and Dynamic Network to perform important tasks. Overall, this article provides brief overview of learning algorithms, exploring their current state, applications and future direction.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Contrastively-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have become the de facto approach for discriminative vision-language representation learning. However, these models have limited language understanding, often exhibiting a "bag of words" behavior. At the same time, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which combine vision encoders with LLMs, have been shown to be capable of detailed vision-language reasoning, yet their autoregressive nature renders them less suitable for discriminative tasks.   In this work, we propose to combine "the best of both worlds": a new training approach for discriminative fine-tuning of LVLMs that results in strong discriminative and compositional capabilities. Essentially, our approach converts a generative LVLM into a discriminative one, unlocking its capability for powerful image-text discrimination combined with enhanced language understanding.   Our contributions include (1) a carefully designed training/optimization framework that utilizes image-text pairs of variable length and granularity for training the model with both contrastive and next-token prediction losses. This is accompanied by ablation studies that justify the necessity of our framework's components; (2) a parameter-efficient adaptation method using a combination of soft prompting and LoRA adapters; (3) significant improvements over state-of-the-art CLIP-like models of similar size, including standard image-text retrieval benchmarks and notable gains in compositionality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI systems evolve, robustly estimating their capabilities from inherently stochastic outputs while systematically quantifying uncertainty in these estimates becomes increasingly important. Further, advanced AI evaluations often have a nested hierarchical structure, exhibit high levels of complexity, and come with high costs in testing the most advanced AI systems. To address these challenges, we introduce HiBayES, a generalizable Hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework for AI Evaluation Statistics. HiBayES supports robust inferences in classical question-answer benchmarks and advanced agentic evaluations, particularly in low-data scenarios (e.g., < 20 data points per evaluation). Built on Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Bayesian data analysis, and formal model comparison, HiBayES provides principled uncertainty quantification and robust parameter estimation. This paper offers a comprehensive introduction to HiBayES, including illustrative examples, comparisons to conventional statistical methods, and practical guidance for implementing multilevel Bayesian GLMs. Additionally, we provide a HiBayES software package [4] (Beta version) for out-of-the-box implementation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The application of Artificial Intelligence has become a powerful approach to detecting software vulnerabilities. However, effective vulnerability detection relies on accurately capturing the semantic structure of code and its contextual relationships. Given that the same functionality can be implemented in various forms, a preprocessing tool that standardizes code representation is important. This tool must be efficient, adaptable across programming languages, and capable of supporting new transformations. To address this challenge, we build on the existing SCoPE framework and introduce SCoPE2, an enhanced version with improved performance. We compare both versions in terms of processing time and memory usage and evaluate their impact on a Large Language Model (LLM) for vulnerability detection. Our results show a 97.3\% reduction in processing time with SCoPE2, along with an improved F1-score for the LLM, solely due to the refined preprocessing approach.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for real-time, high-resolution novel view synthesis. By representing scenes as a mixture of Gaussian primitives, 3DGS leverages GPU rasterization pipelines for efficient rendering and reconstruction. To optimize scene coverage and capture fine details, 3DGS employs a densification algorithm to generate additional points. However, this process often leads to redundant point clouds, resulting in excessive memory usage, slower performance, and substantial storage demands - posing significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. To address this limitation, we propose a theoretical framework that demystifies and improves density control in 3DGS. Our analysis reveals that splitting is crucial for escaping saddle points. Through an optimization-theoretic approach, we establish the necessary conditions for densification, determine the minimal number of offspring Gaussians, identify the optimal parameter update direction, and provide an analytical solution for normalizing off-spring opacity. Building on these insights, we introduce SteepGS, incorporating steepest density control, a principled strategy that minimizes loss while maintaining a compact point cloud. SteepGS achieves a ~50% reduction in Gaussian points without compromising rendering quality, significantly enhancing both efficiency and scalability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mutation testing is a widely recognized technique for assessing and enhancing the effectiveness of software test suites by introducing deliberate code mutations. However, its application often results in overly large test suites, as developers generate numerous tests to kill specific mutants, increasing computational overhead. This paper introduces PRIMG (Prioritization and Refinement Integrated Mutation-driven Generation), a novel framework for incremental and adaptive test case generation for Solidity smart contracts. PRIMG integrates two core components: a mutation prioritization module, which employs a machine learning model trained on mutant subsumption graphs to predict the usefulness of surviving mutants, and a test case generation module, which utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and iteratively refine test cases to achieve syntactic and behavioral correctness.   We evaluated PRIMG on real-world Solidity projects from Code4Arena to assess its effectiveness in improving mutation scores and generating high-quality test cases. The experimental results demonstrate that PRIMG significantly reduces test suite size while maintaining high mutation coverage. The prioritization module consistently outperformed random mutant selection, enabling the generation of high-impact tests with reduced computational effort. Furthermore, the refining process enhanced the correctness and utility of LLM-generated tests, addressing their inherent limitations in handling edge cases and complex program logic.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Critical peer review of scientific manuscripts presents a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), partly due to data limitations and the complexity of expert reasoning. This report introduces Persistent Workflow Prompting (PWP), a potentially broadly applicable prompt engineering methodology designed to bridge this gap using standard LLM chat interfaces (zero-code, no APIs). We present a proof-of-concept PWP prompt for the critical analysis of experimental chemistry manuscripts, featuring a hierarchical, modular architecture (structured via Markdown) that defines detailed analysis workflows. We develop this PWP prompt through iterative application of meta-prompting techniques and meta-reasoning aimed at systematically codifying expert review workflows, including tacit knowledge. Submitted once at the start of a session, this PWP prompt equips the LLM with persistent workflows triggered by subsequent queries, guiding modern reasoning LLMs through systematic, multimodal evaluations. Demonstrations show the PWP-guided LLM identifying major methodological flaws in a test case while mitigating LLM input bias and performing complex tasks, including distinguishing claims from evidence, integrating text/photo/figure analysis to infer parameters, executing quantitative feasibility checks, comparing estimates against claims, and assessing a priori plausibility. To ensure transparency and facilitate replication, we provide full prompts, detailed demonstration analyses, and logs of interactive chats as supplementary resources. Beyond the specific application, this work offers insights into the meta-development process itself, highlighting the potential of PWP, informed by detailed workflow formalization, to enable sophisticated analysis using readily available LLMs for complex scientific tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) involves assigning documents to labels organized within a taxonomy. Most previous research on HTC has focused on supervised methods. However, in real-world scenarios, employing supervised HTC can be challenging due to a lack of annotated data. Moreover, HTC often faces issues with large label spaces and long-tail distributions. In this work, we present Knowledge Graphs for zero-shot Hierarchical Text Classification (KG-HTC), which aims to address these challenges of HTC in applications by integrating knowledge graphs with Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide structured semantic context during classification. Our method retrieves relevant subgraphs from knowledge graphs related to the input text using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. Our KG-HTC can enhance LLMs to understand label semantics at various hierarchy levels. We evaluate KG-HTC on three open-source HTC datasets: WoS, DBpedia, and Amazon. Our experimental results show that KG-HTC significantly outperforms three baselines in the strict zero-shot setting, particularly achieving substantial improvements at deeper levels of the hierarchy. This evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating structured knowledge into LLMs to address HTC's challenges in large label spaces and long-tailed label distributions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present StreamBridge, a simple yet effective framework that seamlessly transforms offline Video-LLMs into streaming-capable models. It addresses two fundamental challenges in adapting existing models into online scenarios: (1) limited capability for multi-turn real-time understanding, and (2) lack of proactive response mechanisms. Specifically, StreamBridge incorporates (1) a memory buffer combined with a round-decayed compression strategy, supporting long-context multi-turn interactions, and (2) a decoupled, lightweight activation model that can be effortlessly integrated into existing Video-LLMs, enabling continuous proactive responses. To further support StreamBridge, we construct Stream-IT, a large-scale dataset tailored for streaming video understanding, featuring interleaved video-text sequences and diverse instruction formats. Extensive experiments show that StreamBridge significantly improves the streaming understanding capabilities of offline Video-LLMs across various tasks, outperforming even proprietary models such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Simultaneously, it achieves competitive or superior performance on standard video understanding benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Direct alignment methods are increasingly used for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, these methods suffer from the issues of verbosity and likelihood displacement, which can be driven by the noisy preference pairs that induce similar likelihood for preferred and dispreferred responses. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we propose a new preference alignment method based on comparison oracles and provide the convergence guarantee for its basic scheme. Second, we improve our method using some heuristics and conduct the experiments to demonstrate the flexibility and compatibility of practical scheme in improving the performance of LLMs using noisy preference pairs. Evaluations are conducted across multiple base and instruction-tuned models (Mistral-7B, Llama-3-8B and Gemma-2-9B) with benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2, MT-Bench and Arena-Hard). Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method as an alternative to addressing the limitations of existing direct alignment methods. A highlight of our work is that we evidence the importance of designing specialized methods for preference pairs with distinct likelihood margin, which complements the recent findings in \citet{Razin-2025-Unintentional}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine visual perception with the general capabilities, such as reasoning, of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the mechanisms by which these two abilities can be combined and contribute remain poorly understood. In this work, we explore to compose perception and reasoning through model merging that connects parameters of different models. Unlike previous works that often focus on merging models of the same kind, we propose merging models across modalities, enabling the incorporation of the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into VLMs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that model merging offers a successful pathway to transfer reasoning abilities from LLMs to VLMs in a training-free manner. Moreover, we utilize the merged models to understand the internal mechanism of perception and reasoning and how merging affects it. We find that perception capabilities are predominantly encoded in the early layers of the model, whereas reasoning is largely facilitated by the middle-to-late layers. After merging, we observe that all layers begin to contribute to reasoning, whereas the distribution of perception abilities across layers remains largely unchanged. These observations shed light on the potential of model merging as a tool for multimodal integration and interpretation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the recent success of large language models (LLMs), the idea of AI-augmented Business Process Management systems is becoming more feasible. One of their essential characteristics is the ability to be conversationally actionable, allowing humans to interact with the LLM effectively to perform crucial process life cycle tasks such as process model design and redesign. However, most current research focuses on single-prompt execution and evaluation of results, rather than on continuous interaction between the user and the LLM. In this work, we aim to explore the feasibility of using LLMs to empower domain experts in the creation and redesign of process models in an iterative and effective way. The proposed conversational process model redesign (CPD) approach receives as input a process model and a redesign request by the user in natural language. Instead of just letting the LLM make changes, the LLM is employed to (a) identify process change patterns from literature, (b) re-phrase the change request to be aligned with an expected wording for the identified pattern (i.e., the meaning), and then to (c) apply the meaning of the change to the process model. This multi-step approach allows for explainable and reproducible changes. In order to ensure the feasibility of the CPD approach, and to find out how well the patterns from literature can be handled by the LLM, we performed an extensive evaluation. The results show that some patterns are hard to understand by LLMs and by users. Within the scope of the study, we demonstrated that users need support to describe the changes clearly. Overall the evaluation shows that the LLMs can handle most changes well according to a set of completeness and correctness criteria.
