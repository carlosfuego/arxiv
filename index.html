                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios. Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware compression approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph-based high-dimensional vector indices have become a mainstream solution for large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS). However, their substantial memory footprint often requires storage on secondary devices, where frequent on-demand loading of graph and vector data leads to I/O becoming the dominant bottleneck, accounting for over 90\% of query latency. Existing static caching strategies mitigate this issue only in the initial navigation phase by preloading entry points and multi-hop neighbors, but they fail in the second phase where query-dependent nodes must be dynamically accessed to achieve high recall. We propose GoVector, an I/O-efficient caching strategy tailored for disk-based graph indices. GoVector combines (1) a static cache that stores entry points and frequently accessed neighbors, and (2) a dynamic cache that adaptively captures nodes with high spatial locality during the second search phase. To further align storage layout with similarity-driven search patterns, GoVector reorders nodes on disk so that similar vectors are colocated on the same or adjacent pages, thereby improving locality and reducing I/O overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that GoVector achieves substantial performance improvements. At 90% recall, it reduces I/O operations by 46% on average, increases query throughput by 1.73x, and lowers query latency by 42% compared to state-of-the-art disk-based graph indexing systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Stateful serverless workflows consist of multiple serverless functions that access state on a remote database. Developers sometimes add a cache layer between the serverless runtime and the database to improve I/O latency. However, in a serverless environment, functions in the same workflow may be scheduled to different nodes with different caches, which can cause non-intuitive anomalies. This paper presents CausalMesh, a novel approach to causally consistent caching in environments where a computation may migrate from one machine to another, such as in serverless computing. CausalMesh is the first cache system that supports coordination-free and abort-free read/write operations and read transactions when clients roam among multiple servers. CausalMesh also supports read-write transactional causal consistency in the presence of client roaming, but at the cost of abort-freedom.   We have formally verified CausalMesh's protocol in Dafny, and our experimental evaluation shows that CausalMesh has lower latency and higher throughput than existing proposals

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As power consumption from AI training and inference continues to increase, AI accelerators are being integrated directly into the CPU. Intel's Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX) is one such example, debuting on the 4th generation Intel Xeon Scalable CPU. We discover a timing side and covert channel, GATEBLEED, caused by the aggressive power gating utilized to keep the CPU within operating limits. We show that the GATEBLEED side channel is a threat to AI privacy as many ML models such as transformers and CNNs make critical computationally-heavy decisions based on private values like confidence thresholds and routing logits. Timing delays from selective powering down of AMX components mean that each matrix multiplication is a potential leakage point when executed on the AMX accelerator. Our research identifies over a dozen potential gadgets across popular ML libraries (HuggingFace, PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.), revealing that they can leak sensitive and private information. GATEBLEED poses a risk for local and remote timing inference, even under previous protective measures. GATEBLEED can be used as a high performance, stealthy remote covert channel and a generic magnifier for timing transmission channels, capable of bypassing traditional cache defenses to leak arbitrary memory addresses and evading state of the art microarchitectural attack detectors under realistic network conditions and system configurations in which previous attacks fail. We implement an end-to-end microarchitectural inference attack on a transformer model optimized with Intel AMX, achieving a membership inference accuracy of 81% and a precision of 0.89. In a CNN-based or transformer-based mixture-of-experts model optimized with Intel AMX, we leak expert choice with 100% accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first side-channel attack on AI privacy that exploits hardware optimizations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mixed-precision inference techniques reduce the memory and computational demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) by applying hybrid precision formats to model weights, activations, and KV caches. This work introduces mixed-precision LLM inference techniques that encompass (i) systematic memory and compute optimization across hierarchical storage and tensor core architectures, and (ii) comprehensive end-to-end mixed-precision optimization across diverse precision formats and hardware configurations. Our approach features two novel mixed-precision pipelines designed for optimal hardware utilization: a General Matrix Multiply (GEMM) pipeline that optimizes matrix operations through offline weight packing and online acceleration, and an attention pipeline that enables efficient attention computation with arbitrary Query, Key, and Value precision combinations. The key implementation of the pipelines includes (i) hardware-aware weight packing for automatic format optimization, (ii) adaptive head alignment for efficient attention computation, (iii) instruction-level parallelism for memory hierarchy exploitation, and (iv) KV memory loading pipeline for enhanced inference efficiency. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across 16 popular LLMs and 4 representative GPU architectures. Results demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 61% lower serving latency (30% on average) and up to 156% higher throughput (58% on average) in mixed-precision workloads compared to existing mixed-precision frameworks, establishing consistent performance improvements across all tested configurations and hardware types. This work is integrated into TurboMind, a high-performance inference engine of the LMDeploy project, which is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Directed q-analysis is a recent extension of q-analysis, an established method for extracting structure from networks, to directed graphs. Until recently, a lack of efficient algorithms heavily restricted the application of this technique: Previous approaches scale with the square of the input size, which is also the maximal size of the output, rendering such approaches worst-case optimal. In practice, output sizes of relevant networks are usually far from the worst case, a fact that could be exploited by an (efficient) output-sensitive algorithm. We develop such an algorithm and formally describe it in detail. The key insight, obtained by carefully studying various approaches to directed q-analysis and how they relate to each other, is that inverting the order of computation leads to significant complexity gains. Targeted precomputation and caching tactics further reduce the introduced overhead, enough to achieve (under mild assumptions) a time complexity that is linear in output size. The resulting algorithm for performing directed q-analysis is shown to be time-optimal.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In response to the challenges in large-scale quantum state simulation on classical computing platforms, including memory limits, frequent disk I/O, and high computational complexity, this study builds upon a previously proposed hierarchical storage-based quantum simulation system and introduces an optimization framework, the Quantum Vector Optimization Framework (QVecOpt). QVecOpt integrates four strategies: amplitude pairing, cache optimization, block storage optimization, and parallel optimization. These collectively enhance state vector storage and computational scheduling. The amplitude pairing mechanism locates relevant amplitude pairs via bitwise XOR, reducing traversal complexity of single-qubit gates from $O(2^n)$ to $O(1)$. Cache optimization pre-allocates buffers and loads only required data, cutting disk I/O. Block storage optimization partitions the state vector for on-demand loading and local updates, reducing redundant access. Parallel optimization distributes the state vector across nodes for collaborative computation, achieving near-linear speedup. Complexity analysis shows that, compared with hierarchical storage simulation, the method reduces state vector traversals for single-qubit gates from $2^n$ to 1, removing the main bottleneck. It also lowers computational and I/O complexity from $O(2^n)$ to $O(2^n/C)$ and $O(2^n/B)$. In simulations of 16-29 qubits, efficiency improves nearly tenfold, breaking the memory bottleneck of existing tools and enabling high-bit quantum circuit simulations beyond traditional methods. This work provides an efficient, scalable solution for classical simulation of large-scale quantum computation with significant academic and practical value.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present 3DGS-LM, a new method that accelerates the reconstruction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by replacing its ADAM optimizer with a tailored Levenberg-Marquardt (LM). Existing methods reduce the optimization time by decreasing the number of Gaussians or by improving the implementation of the differentiable rasterizer. However, they still rely on the ADAM optimizer to fit Gaussian parameters of a scene in thousands of iterations, which can take up to an hour. To this end, we change the optimizer to LM that runs in conjunction with the 3DGS differentiable rasterizer. For efficient GPU parallization, we propose a caching data structure for intermediate gradients that allows us to efficiently calculate Jacobian-vector products in custom CUDA kernels. In every LM iteration, we calculate update directions from multiple image subsets using these kernels and combine them in a weighted mean. Overall, our method is 20% faster than the original 3DGS while obtaining the same reconstruction quality. Our optimization is also agnostic to other methods that acclerate 3DGS, thus enabling even faster speedups compared to vanilla 3DGS.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Next-generation mobile networks are expected to facilitate fast AI model downloading to end users. By caching models on edge servers, mobile networks can deliver models to end users with low latency, resulting in a paradigm of edge model caching. In this paper, we develop a novel model placement framework, called parameter-sharing model caching (TrimCaching). TrimCaching exploits the key observation that a wide range of AI models, such as convolutional neural networks or large language models, can share a significant proportion of parameter blocks containing reusable knowledge, thereby improving storage efficiency. To this end, we formulate a parameter-sharing model placement problem to maximize the cache hit ratio in multi-edge wireless networks by balancing the fundamental tradeoff between storage efficiency and service latency. We show that the formulated problem is a submodular maximization problem with submodular constraints, for which no polynomial-time approximation algorithm exists. To tackle this challenge, we study an important special case, where a small fixed number of parameter blocks are shared across models, which often holds in practice. In such a case, a polynomial-time algorithm with a $\left(1-\epsilon\right)/2$-approximation guarantee is developed. Subsequently, we address the original problem for the general case by developing a greedy algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed TrimCaching framework significantly improves the cache hit ratio compared with state-of-the-art content caching without exploiting shared parameters in AI models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Similarity-based vector search underpins many important applications, but a key challenge is processing massive vector datasets (e.g., in TBs). To reduce costs, some systems utilize SSDs as the primary data storage. They employ a proximity graph, which connects similar vectors to form a graph and is the state-of-the-art index for vector search. However, these systems are hindered by sub-optimal data layouts that fail to effectively utilize valuable memory space to reduce disk access and suffer from poor locality for accessing disk-resident data. Through extensive profiling and analysis, we found that the structure of the proximity graph index is accessed more frequently than the vectors themselves, yet existing systems do not distinguish between the two. To address this problem, we design the Gorgeous system with the principle of prioritizing graph structure over vectors. Specifically, Gorgeous features a memory cache that keeps the adjacency lists of graph nodes to improve cache hits and a disk block format that explicitly stores neighbors' adjacency lists along with a vector to enhance data locality. Experimental results show that Gorgeous consistently outperforms two state-of-the-art disk-based systems for vector search, boosting average query throughput by over 60% and reducing query latency by over 35%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis), thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques, making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration. By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern AI, fueling remarkable progress across applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal learning. As these models continue to scale explosively for performance, implementation efficiency remains a critical challenge. Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, selectively activating specialized subnetworks (experts), offer a unique balance between model accuracy and computational cost. However, the adaptive routing in MoE architectures, where input tokens are dynamically directed to specialized experts based on their semantic meaning inadvertently opens up a new attack surface for privacy breaches. These input-dependent activation patterns leave distinctive temporal and spatial traces in hardware execution, which adversaries could exploit to deduce sensitive user data. In this work, we propose MoEcho, discovering a side channel analysis based attack surface that compromises user privacy on MoE based systems. Specifically, in MoEcho, we introduce four novel architectural side channels on different computing platforms, including Cache Occupancy Channels and Pageout+Reload on CPUs, and Performance Counter and TLB Evict+Reload on GPUs, respectively. Exploiting these vulnerabilities, we propose four attacks that effectively breach user privacy in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) based on MoE architectures: Prompt Inference Attack, Response Reconstruction Attack, Visual Inference Attack, and Visual Reconstruction Attack. MoEcho is the first runtime architecture level security analysis of the popular MoE structure common in modern transformers, highlighting a serious security and privacy threat and calling for effective and timely safeguards when harnessing MoE based models for developing efficient large scale AI services.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the growing size of deep neural networks and datasets, the computational costs of training have significantly increased. The layer-freezing technique has recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively reduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing methods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate feature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs. To overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches feature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to train directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be straightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely overlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations to feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these overlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method will be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first to comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution. To improve training accuracy, we propose \textit{similarity-aware channel augmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a minimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate lossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \textit{progressive compression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are frozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with a minor time overhead. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of freezing and compression strategies, providing insights into optimizing their application for efficient DNN training.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Implicit collaborative filtering recommenders are usually trained to learn user positive preferences. Negative sampling, which selects informative negative items to form negative training data, plays a crucial role in this process. Since items are often clustered in the latent space, existing negative sampling strategies normally oversample negative items from the dense regions. This leads to homogeneous negative data and limited model expressiveness. In this paper, we propose Diverse Negative Sampling (DivNS), a novel approach that explicitly accounts for diversity in negative training data during the negative sampling process. DivNS first finds hard negative items with large preference scores and constructs user-specific caches that store unused but highly informative negative samples. Then, its diversity-augmented sampler selects a diverse subset of negative items from the cache while ensuring dissimilarity from the user's hard negatives. Finally, a synthetic negatives generator combines the selected diverse negatives with hard negatives to form more effective training data. The resulting synthetic negatives are both informative and diverse, enabling recommenders to learn a broader item space and improve their generalisability. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DivNS in improving recommendation quality while maintaining computational efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reranking plays a crucial role in modern recommender systems by capturing the mutual influences within the list. Due to the inherent challenges of combinatorial search spaces, most methods adopt a two-stage search paradigm: a simple General Search Unit (GSU) efficiently reduces the candidate space, and an Exact Search Unit (ESU) effectively selects the optimal sequence. These methods essentially involve making trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency, while suffering from a severe \textbf{inconsistency problem}, that is, the GSU often misses high-value lists from ESU. To address this problem, we propose YOLOR, a one-stage reranking method that removes the GSU while retaining only the ESU. Specifically, YOLOR includes: (1) a Tree-based Context Extraction Module (TCEM) that hierarchically aggregates multi-scale contextual features to achieve "list-level effectiveness", and (2) a Context Cache Module (CCM) that enables efficient feature reuse across candidate permutations to achieve "permutation-level efficiency". Extensive experiments across public and industry datasets validate YOLOR's performance, and we have successfully deployed YOLOR on the Meituan food delivery platform.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs) parallelize text generation by framing decoding as a denoising process, but suffer from high computational overhead since they predict all future suffix tokens at each step while retaining only a small fraction. We propose Diffusion Scratchpad (DPad), a training-free method that restricts attention to a small set of nearby suffix tokens, preserving fidelity while eliminating redundancy. DPad integrates two strategies: (i) a sliding window, which maintains a fixed-length suffix window, and (ii) distance-decay dropout, which deterministically removes distant suffix tokens before attention computation. This simple design is compatible with existing optimizations such as prefix caching and can be implemented with only a few lines of code. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks on LLaDA-1.5 and Dream models demonstrate that DPad delivers up to $\mathbf{61.4\times}$ speedup over vanilla dLLMs while maintaining comparable accuracy, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable long-sequence inference.

KV-separated LSM-trees address write amplification but introduce significant space amplification, a critical concern in cost-sensitive scenarios. Garbage collection (GC) can reduce space amplification, but existing strategies are often inefficient and fail to account for workload characteristics.

In this paper, we systematically analyze the sources of space amplification in KV-separated LSM-trees and propose Scavenger+, which achieves a better performance-space trade-off. Scavenger+ introduces (1) an I/O-efficient garbage collection scheme to reduce I/O overhead, (2) a space-aware compaction strategy based on compensated size to mitigate index-induced space amplification, and (3) a dynamic GC scheduler that adapts to system load to make better use of CPU and storage resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Scavenger+ significantly improves write performance and reduces space amplification compared to state-of-the-art KV-separated LSM-trees, including BlobDB, Titan, and TerarkDB.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> WCET (Worst-Case Execution Time) estimation on multicore architecture is particularly challenging mainly due to the complex accesses over cache shared by multiple cores. Existing analysis identifies possible contentions between parallel tasks by leveraging the partial order of the tasks or their program regions. Unfortunately, they overestimate the number of cache misses caused by a remote block access without considering the actual cache state and the number of accesses. This paper reports a new analysis for inter-core cache contention. Based on the order of program regions in a task, we first identify memory references that could be affected if a remote access occurs in a region. Afterwards, a fine-grained contention analysis is constructed that computes the number of cache misses based on the access quantity of local and remote blocks. We demonstrate that the overall inter-core cache interference of a task can be obtained via dynamic programming. Experiments show that compared to existing methods, the proposed analysis reduces inter-core cache interference and WCET estimations by 52.31% and 8.94% on average, without significantly increasing computation overhead.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Symbolic regression encompasses a family of search algorithms that aim to discover the best fitting function for a set of data without requiring an a priori specification of the model structure. The most successful and commonly used technique for symbolic regression is Genetic Programming (GP), an evolutionary search method that evolves a population of mathematical expressions through the mechanism of natural selection. In this work we analyze the efficiency of the evolutionary search in GP and show that many points in the search space are re-visited and re-evaluated multiple times by the algorithm, leading to wasted computational effort. We address this issue by introducing a caching mechanism based on the Zobrist hash, a type of hashing frequently used in abstract board games for the efficient construction and subsequent update of transposition tables. We implement our caching approach using the open-source framework Operon and demonstrate its performance on a selection of real-world regression problems, where we observe up to 34\% speedups without any detrimental effects on search quality. The hashing approach represents a straightforward way to improve runtime performance while also offering some interesting possibilities for adjusting search strategy based on cached information.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Real-time streaming of point cloud video, characterized by massive data volumes and high sensitivity to packet loss, remains a key challenge for immersive applications under dynamic network conditions. While connection-oriented protocols such as TCP and more modern alternatives like QUIC alleviate some transport-layer inefficiencies, including head-of-line blocking, they still retain a coarse-grained, segment-based delivery model and a centralized control loop that limit fine-grained adaptation and effective caching. We introduce INDS (Incremental Named Data Streaming), an adaptive streaming framework based on Information-Centric Networking (ICN) that rethinks delivery for hierarchical, layered media. INDS leverages the Octree structure of point cloud video and expressive content naming to support progressive, partial retrieval of enhancement layers based on consumer bandwidth and decoding capability. By combining time-windows with Group-of-Frames (GoF), INDS's naming scheme supports fine-grained in-network caching and facilitates efficient multi-user data reuse. INDS can be deployed as an overlay, remaining compatible with QUIC-based transport infrastructure as well as future Media-over-QUIC (MoQ) architectures, without requiring changes to underlying IP networks. Our prototype implementation shows up to 80% lower delay, 15-50% higher throughput, and 20-30% increased cache hit rates compared to state-of-the-art DASH-style systems. Together, these results establish INDS as a scalable, cache-friendly solution for real-time point cloud streaming under variable and lossy conditions, while its compatibility with MoQ overlays further positions it as a practical, forward-compatible architecture for emerging immersive media systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable capabilities in processing graph-structured data prevalent in various real-world applications. However, the scalability of full-batch GNN training becomes severely limited by high communication overhead and load imbalance in distributed environments. In this paper, we present CaPGNN, a novel framework for efficient parallel full-batch GNN training on single-server with multi-GPU, designed specifically to reduce redundant inter-GPU communication and balance computational workloads. We propose a joint adaptive caching algorithm that leverages both CPU and GPU memory to significantly reduce the repetitive transmission of vertex features across partitions. Additionally, we introduce a resource-aware graph partitioning algorithm that adjusts subgraph sizes dynamically according to the heterogeneous computational and communication capacities of GPUs. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate that CaPGNN effectively reduces communication costs by up to 96% and accelerates GNN training by up to 12.7 times compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Our results highlight the potential of adaptive caching and resource-aware partitioning to facilitate scalable, efficient, and practical deployment of full-batch GNN training in distributed computing environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Low-precision matrix engines, such as FP16 cube, offer high throughput but lack support for full-precision computation. In this work, we propose SGEMM-cube, a high-performance algorithm for emulating FP32 general matrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM) using only FP16 computation units on a representative AI accelerator. The method decomposes each FP32 operand into two FP16 values and compensates for numerical errors through a tunable scaling strategy. A detailed analysis of numerical errors, including underflow conditions and precision loss, guides the selection of scaling parameters to preserve up to 22 bits of mantissa accuracy. We further investigate the effect of computation order on accuracy and demonstrate that a term-wise accumulation scheme improves numerical stability over conventional FP32 GEMM in low-exponent regimes. Finally, a cache-aware blocking strategy and double-buffered pipeline are introduced to overlap memory transfers with computation, enabling SGEMM-cube to achieve up to 77\% of the theoretical FP32-equivalent peak performance on Ascend 910A NPU lacking native FP32 support. Extensive numerical experiments confirm that our method not only recovers the accuracy of native FP32 GEMM but also exhibits superior numerical stability under certain conditions, due to its structured and error-aware computation order.

We discuss how LAMMPS has adapted to the modern heterogeneous computing landscape by integrating the Kokkos performance portability library into the existing C++ code. We investigate performance portability of simple pairwise, many-body reactive, and machine-learned force-field interatomic potentials. We present results on GPUs across different vendors and generations, and analyze performance trends, probing FLOPS throughput, memory bandwidths, cache capabilities, and thread-atomic operation performance. Finally, we demonstrate strong scaling on all current US exascale machines -- OLCF Frontier, and ALCF Aurora, and NNSA El Capitan -- for the three potentials.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps. Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2) region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$ on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without compromising generation quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Nonlocal Coulomb interactions play a crucial role in stabilizing distinct electronic phases in kagome materials. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of on-site ($U$) and inter-site ($V$) Coulomb interactions on the electronic structure and stability of charge-density-wave (CDW) phases in the kagome metal KV$_3$Sb$_5$ using density functional theory (DFT+$U$+$V$) calculations. We demonstrate that $V$ promotes the formation and stability of CDW phases, whereas $U$ suppresses these phases, highlighting a fundamental competition between local and nonlocal Coulomb interactions. By directly comparing our theoretical results with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data, we identify realistic values of $U$ and $V$ that accurately describe the electronic band structure of KV$_3$Sb$_5$. Our findings establish a detailed $U$-$V$ phase diagram for KV$_3$Sb$_5$, offering valuable insights into the correlated electronic states in kagome metals and serving as a foundation for future explorations of correlation-driven phenomena in related materials.

Datarus is trained not on isolated question-answer pairs but on full analytical trajectories including reasoning steps, code execution, error traces, self-corrections, and final conclusions, all captured in a ReAct-style notebook format spanning finance, medicine, numerical analysis, and other quantitative domains. Our training pipeline combines (i) a trajectory-centric synthetic data generator that yielded 144 000 tagged notebook episodes, (ii) a dual-reward framework blending a lightweight tag-based structural signal with a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM) that scores both single-step soundness and end-to-end coherence, and (iii) a memory-optimized implementation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) featuring KV-cache reuse, sequential generation, and reference-model sharding. A cosine curriculum smoothly shifts emphasis from structural fidelity to semantic depth, reducing the format collapse and verbosity that often plague RL-aligned LLMs. A central design choice in Datarus is it dual reasoning interface. In agentic mode the model produces ReAct-tagged steps that invoke Python tools to execute real code; in reflection mode it outputs compact Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces delimited by <think> and <answer> tags. On demanding postgraduate-level problems, Datarus exhibits an "AHA-moment" pattern: it sketches hypotheses, revises them once or twice, and converges avoiding the circular, token-inflating loops common to contemporary systems. Across standard public benchmarks Datarus surpasses similar size models and even reaches the level of larger reasoning models such as QwQ-32B achieving up to 30% higher accuracy on AIME 2024/2025 and LiveCodeBench while emitting 18-49% fewer tokens per solution.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in generative AI have accelerated the discovery of novel chemicals and materials. However, scaling these discoveries to industrial production remains a major bottleneck due to the synthesis gap -- the need to develop entirely new manufacturing processes. This challenge requires detailed engineering blueprints: PFDs for equipment layouts and material/energy flows, and PIDs for process plant operations. Current AI systems cannot yet reliably generate these critical engineering schematics, creating a fundamental obstacle to manufacturing scale-up of novel discoveries. We present a closed-loop, physics-aware framework for automated generation of industrially viable PFDs and PIDs. The framework integrates three key components: (1) domain-specialized small language models (SLMs) trained for auto-generation of PFDs and PIDs, (2) a hierarchical knowledge graph containing process flow and instrumentation descriptions for 1,020+ chemicals for Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRAG), and (3) an open-source chemical process simulator for modeling, simulation, optimization, and analysis of novel chemical processes. The SLMs are trained through a multi-stage pipeline on synthetic datasets, with process simulator-in-the-loop validation ensuring feasibility. To enhance computational efficiency, the framework implements structural pruning (width and depth) guided by importance heuristics to reduce language model size while preserving accuracy, followed by advanced inference optimizations including FlashAttention, Lookahead Decoding, PagedAttention with KV-cache quantization, and Test-Time Inference Scaling. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework generates simulator-validated process descriptions with high fidelity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex tasks, but their extended chain-of-thought reasoning process increases inference overhead. While quantization has been widely adopted to reduce the inference cost of large language models, its impact on reasoning models remains understudied. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study on quantized reasoning models, evaluating the open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Distilled Qwen and LLaMA families ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3-8B. Our investigation covers weight, KV cache, and activation quantization using state-of-the-art algorithms at varying bit-widths, with extensive evaluation across mathematical (AIME, MATH-500), scientific (GPQA), and programming (LiveCodeBench) reasoning benchmarks. Our findings reveal that while lossless quantization can be achieved with W8A8 or W4A16 quantization, lower bit-widths introduce significant accuracy risks. We further identify model size, model origin, and task difficulty as critical determinants of performance. Contrary to expectations, quantized models do not exhibit increased output lengths. In addition, strategically scaling the model sizes or reasoning steps can effectively enhance the performance. All quantized models and codes are open-sourced in https://github.com/ruikangliu/Quantized-Reasoning-Models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Software-defined networking (SDN) technology aims to create a highly flexible network by decoupling control plane and the data plane and programming them independently. There has been a lot of research on improving and optimizing the control plane, and data plane programming is a relatively new concept, so study on it is one of the hot topics for researchers. At the 2019 Dagstuhl Seminar, well-known scientists on computer networking discussed challenges and problems in the field of data plane programming that need to be addressed over the next 10 years. Based on this seminar issues and papers review, we suggested some possible solutions which are for optimizing data plane to improve packet processing performance and link utilization. The suggestions include (i) enriching data plane language with asynchronous external function, (ii) compression based on payload size, (iii) in-network caching for fast packet processing, and (iv) offloading external functions to an additional thread, virtual machine (VM) or server, etc. In addition, we implemented some of these in the P4 data plane language to illustrate the practicality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Discrete GPUs are a cornerstone of HPC and data center systems, requiring management of separate CPU and GPU memory spaces. Unified Virtual Memory (UVM) has been proposed to ease the burden of memory management; however, at a high cost in performance. The recent introduction of AMD's MI300A Accelerated Processing Units (APUs)--as deployed in the El Capitan supercomputer--enables HPC systems featuring integrated CPU and GPU with Unified Physical Memory (UPM) for the first time. This work presents the first comprehensive characterization of the UPM architecture on MI300A. We first analyze the UPM system properties, including memory latency, bandwidth, and coherence overhead. We then assess the efficiency of the system software in memory allocation, page fault handling, TLB management, and Infinity Cache utilization. We propose a set of porting strategies for transforming applications for the UPM architecture and evaluate six applications on the MI300A APU. Our results show that applications on UPM using the unified memory model can match or outperform those in the explicitly managed model--while reducing memory costs by up to 44%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Leveraging the Transformer architecture and the diffusion process, video DiT models have emerged as a dominant approach for high-quality video generation. However, their multi-step iterative denoising process incurs high computational cost and inference latency. Caching, a widely adopted optimization method in DiT models, leverages the redundancy in the diffusion process to skip computations in different granularities (e.g., step, cfg, block). Nevertheless, existing caching methods are limited to single-granularity strategies, struggling to balance generation quality and inference speed in a flexible manner. In this work, we propose MixCache, a training-free caching-based framework for efficient video DiT inference. It first distinguishes the interference and boundary between different caching strategies, and then introduces a context-aware cache triggering strategy to determine when caching should be enabled, along with an adaptive hybrid cache decision strategy for dynamically selecting the optimal caching granularity. Extensive experiments on diverse models demonstrate that, MixCache can significantly accelerate video generation (e.g., 1.94$\times$ speedup on Wan 14B, 1.97$\times$ speedup on HunyuanVideo) while delivering both superior generation quality and inference efficiency compared to baseline methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Web proxies such as NGINX commonly rely on least-recently-used (LRU) eviction, which is size agnostic and can thrash under periodic bursts and mixed object sizes. We introduce Cold-RL, a learned eviction policy for NGINX that replaces LRU's forced-expire path with a dueling Deep Q-Network served by an ONNX sidecar within a strict microsecond budget. On each eviction, Cold-RL samples the K least-recently-used objects, extracts six lightweight features (age, size, hit count, inter-arrival time, remaining TTL, and last origin RTT), and requests a bitmask of victims; a hard timeout of 500 microseconds triggers immediate fallback to native LRU. Policies are trained offline by replaying NGINX access logs through a cache simulator with a simple reward: a retained object earns one point if it is hit again before TTL expiry. We compare against LRU, LFU, size-based, adaptive LRU, and a hybrid baseline on two adversarial workloads. With a 25 MB cache, Cold-RL raises hit ratio from 0.1436 to 0.3538, a 146 percent improvement over the best classical baseline; at 100 MB, from 0.7530 to 0.8675, a 15 percent gain; and at 400 MB it matches classical methods (about 0.918). Inference adds less than 2 percent CPU overhead and keeps 95th percentile eviction latency within budget. To our knowledge, this is the first reinforcement learning eviction policy integrated into NGINX with strict SLOs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Model (LLM) inference is increasingly constrained by memory bandwidth, with frequent access to the key-value (KV) cache dominating data movement. While attention sparsity reduces some memory traffic, the relevance of past tokens varies over time, requiring the full KV cache to remain accessible and sustaining pressure on both bandwidth and capacity. With advances in interconnects such as NVLink and LPDDR5X, modern AI hardware now integrates high-bandwidth memory (HBM) with high-speed off-package DRAM, making heterogeneous memory systems a practical solution. This work investigates dynamic KV cache placement across such systems to maximize aggregated bandwidth utilization under capacity constraints. Rather than proposing a specific scheduling policy, we formulate the placement problem mathematically and derive a theoretical upper bound, revealing substantial headroom for runtime optimization. To our knowledge, this is the first formal treatment of dynamic KV cache scheduling in heterogeneous memory systems for LLM inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), handling long context has become one of the vital abilities in LLMs. Such long-context ability is accompanied by difficulties in deployment, especially due to the increased consumption of KV cache. There is certain work aiming to optimize the memory footprint of KV cache, inspired by the observation that attention heads can be categorized into retrieval heads that are of great significance and streaming heads that are of less significance. Typically, identifying the streaming heads and and waiving the KV cache in the streaming heads would largely reduce the overhead without hurting the performance that much. However, since employing both retrieval and streaming heads in one layer decomposes one large round of attention computation into two small ones, it may unexpectedly bring extra latency on accessing and indexing tensors. Based on this intuition, we impose an important improvement to the identification process of retrieval and streaming heads, in which we design a criterion that enforces exclusively retrieval or streaming heads gathered in one unique layer. In this way, we further eliminate the extra latency and only incur negligible performance degradation. Our method named \textsc{ZigzagAttention} is competitive among considered baselines owing to reduced latency and comparable performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While long context support of large language models has extended their abilities, it also incurs challenges in memory and compute which becomes crucial bottlenecks in resource-restricted devices. Token eviction, a widely adopted post-training methodology designed to alleviate the bottlenecks by evicting less important tokens from the cache, typically uses attention scores as proxy metrics for token importance. However, one major limitation of attention score as a token-wise importance metrics is that it lacks the information about contribution of tokens to the attention output. In this paper, we propose a simple eviction criterion based on the contribution of cached tokens to attention outputs. Our method, CAOTE, optimizes for eviction error due to token eviction, by seamlessly integrating attention scores and value vectors. This is the first method which uses value tokens on top of attention-based eviction scores in closed-form. Additionally, CAOTE can act as a meta-heuristic method with flexible usage with any token eviction method. We show that CAOTE, when combined with the state-of-the-art attention score-based methods, always improves accuracies on the downstream task, indicating the importance of leveraging information from values during token eviction process.

We propose RT-Cache, a training-free retrieval-as-control pipeline that caches diverse image action trajectories in a unified vector memory and, at test time, embeds the current frame to retrieve and replay multi-step snippets, replacing per-step model calls. A hierarchical search keeps lookups sub-second at million scale, shifting cost from compute to storage and enabling real-time control on modest GPUs. Across real-robot tasks and large open logs, RT-Cache achieves higher success and lower completion time than strong retrieval baselines (approximately x2 higher success and ~30% faster in our settings), and a single-episode anchoring study shows immediate adaptation to a more complex, contact-rich task without fine-tuning. RT-Cache turns experience into an append-only memory, offering a simple, scalable path to few-shot deployment today and a foundation for multimodal keys and optional integration with high-level policies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Memory is fundamental to intelligence, enabling learning, reasoning, and adaptability across biological and artificial systems. While Transformer architectures excel at sequence modeling, they face critical limitations in long-range context retention, continual learning, and knowledge integration. This review presents a unified framework bridging neuroscience principles, including dynamic multi-timescale memory, selective attention, and consolidation, with engineering advances in Memory-Augmented Transformers. We organize recent progress through three taxonomic dimensions: functional objectives (context extension, reasoning, knowledge integration, adaptation), memory representations (parameter-encoded, state-based, explicit, hybrid), and integration mechanisms (attention fusion, gated control, associative retrieval). Our analysis of core memory operations (reading, writing, forgetting, and capacity management) reveals a shift from static caches toward adaptive, test-time learning systems. We identify persistent challenges in scalability and interference, alongside emerging solutions including hierarchical buffering and surprise-gated updates. This synthesis provides a roadmap toward cognitively-inspired, lifelong-learning Transformer architectures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To protect privacy for data-collection-based services, local differential privacy (LDP) is widely adopted due to its rigorous theoretical bound on privacy loss. However, mistakes in complex theoretical analysis or subtle implementation errors may undermine its practical guarantee. To address this, auditing is crucial to confirm that LDP protocols truly protect user data. However, existing auditing methods, though, mainly target machine learning and federated learning tasks based on centralized differentially privacy (DP), with limited attention to LDP. Moreover, the few studies on LDP auditing focus solely on simple frequency estimation task for discrete data, leaving correlated key-value data - which requires both discrete frequency estimation for keys and continuous mean estimation for values - unexplored.   To bridge this gap, we propose KV-Auditor, a framework for auditing LDP-based key-value estimation mechanisms by estimating their empirical privacy lower bounds. Rather than traditional LDP auditing methods that relies on binary output predictions, KV-Auditor estimates this lower bound by analyzing unbounded output distributions, supporting continuous data. Specifically, we classify state-of-the-art LDP key-value mechanisms into interactive and non-interactive types. For non-interactive mechanisms, we propose horizontal KV-Auditor for small domains with sufficient samples and vertical KV-Auditor for large domains with limited samples. For interactive mechanisms, we design a segmentation strategy to capture incremental privacy leakage across iterations. Finally, we perform extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our approach, offering insights for optimizing LDP-based key-value estimators.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The integration of wireless communications and Large Language Models (LLMs) is poised to unlock ubiquitous intelligent services, yet deploying them in wireless edge-device collaborative environments presents a critical trade-off between inference quality and end-to-end latency. A fundamental mismatch exists between task complexity and resource allocation: offloading simple queries invites prohibitive latency, while on-device models lack the capacity for demanding computations. To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic, quality-latency aware routing framework that orchestrates inference between a lightweight model on the mobile device and a powerful model on the edge server. Our framework employs two distinct cost models: for single-turn queries, it fuses a BERT-predicted semantic score with communication and computation overheads; for multi-turn dialogues, it further quantifies context-aware costs arising from model switching and KV-cache management. While maintaining full inference quality, extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework cuts average response latency by 5-15% and reduces large model invocations by 10-20% against competitive baselines on MMLU, GSM8K, and MT-Bench-101 benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in reasoning tasks, but their performance on linguistics puzzles remains consistently poor. These puzzles, often derived from Linguistics Olympiad (LO) contests, provide a minimal contamination environment to assess LLMs' linguistic reasoning abilities across low-resource languages. This work analyses LLMs' performance on 629 problems across 41 low-resource languages by labelling each with linguistically informed features to unveil weaknesses. Our analyses show that LLMs struggle with puzzles involving higher morphological complexity and perform better on puzzles involving linguistic features that are also found in English. We also show that splitting words into morphemes as a pre-processing step improves solvability, indicating a need for more informed and language-specific tokenisers. These findings thus offer insights into some challenges in linguistic reasoning and modelling of low-resource languages.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend LLMs to handle images, videos, and audio by incorporating feature extractors and projection modules. However, these additional components -- combined with complex inference pipelines and heterogeneous workloads -- introduce significant inference overhead. Therefore, efficiently serving MLLMs remains a major challenge. Current tightly coupled serving architectures struggle to distinguish between mixed request types or adapt parallelism strategies to different inference stages, leading to increased time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency and poor resource utilization. To address this, we introduce Elastic Multimodal Parallelism (EMP), a new serving paradigm that elastically adapts to resource heterogeneity across request types and inference stages. Building upon EMP, we develop ElasticMM, an MLLM serving system that (1) separates requests into independent modality groups with dynamic resource allocation via a modality-aware load balancer; (2) decouples inference stages and enables parallelism adjustment and adaptive scaling via elastic partition scheduling; and (3) improves inference efficiency through unified multimodal prefix caching and non-blocking encoding. Experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that ElasticMM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) serving systems, reducing TTFT by up to 4.2x and achieving 3.2-4.5x higher throughput while meeting service-level objectives (SLOs).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are rapidly emerging as a powerful and promising alternative to the dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm. By generating tokens in parallel through an iterative denoising process, DLMs possess inherent advantages in reducing inference latency and capturing bidirectional context, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the generation process. While achieving a several-fold speed-up, recent advancements have allowed DLMs to show performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, making them a compelling choice for various natural language processing tasks. In this survey, we provide a holistic overview of the current DLM landscape. We trace its evolution and relationship with other paradigms, such as autoregressive and masked language models, and cover both foundational principles and state-of-the-art models. Our work offers an up-to-date, comprehensive taxonomy and an in-depth analysis of current techniques, from pre-training strategies to advanced post-training methods. Another contribution of this survey is a thorough review of DLM inference strategies and optimizations, including improvements in decoding parallelism, caching mechanisms, and generation quality. We also highlight the latest approaches to multimodal extensions of DLMs and delineate their applications across various practical scenarios. Furthermore, our discussion addresses the limitations and challenges of DLMs, including efficiency, long-sequence handling, and infrastructure requirements, while outlining future research directions to sustain progress in this rapidly evolving field.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed with rapidly expanding context windows to support increasingly demanding applications. However, long contexts pose significant deployment challenges, primarily due to the KV cache whose size grows proportionally with context length. While KV cache compression methods are proposed to address this issue, KV dropping methods incur considerable accuracy loss, and KV retrieval methods suffer from significant efficiency bottlenecks. We propose FreeKV, an algorithm-system co-optimization framework to enhance KV retrieval efficiency while preserving accuracy. On the algorithm side, FreeKV introduces speculative retrieval to shift the KV selection and recall processes out of the critical path, combined with fine-grained correction to ensure accuracy. On the system side, FreeKV employs hybrid KV layouts across CPU and GPU memory to eliminate fragmented data transfers, and leverages double-buffered streamed recall to further improve efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that FreeKV achieves near-lossless accuracy across various scenarios and models, delivering up to 13$\times$ speedup compared to SOTA KV retrieval methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rise of long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) amplifies memory and bandwidth demands during autoregressive decoding, as the Key-Value (KV) cache grows with each generated token. Low-bit KV-cache quantization (e.g., 4-bit or 2-bit) can reduce memory footprint while preserving accuracy, but existing systems suffer from slow decoding due to their exclusive reliance on CUDA cores, neglecting Tensor Cores (the primary source of compute on modern GPUs). We present BitDecoding, a new long-context LLM inference system with a low-bit KV cache. BitDecoding enables efficient low-bit KV-cache decoding by cooperatively leveraging CUDA cores and Tensor Cores. It introduces methods for automatically inducing optimized layouts to exploit Tensor Cores, along with warp-level parallelization strategies for dequantization. For unified system support, BitDecoding includes a query transformation module supporting diverse attention variants, a quantization kernel that supports both tensor-wise and channel-wise scaling used in various quantization algorithms with high performance, and a dequantization kernel with a software-defined pipeline to coordinate CUDA and Tensor Cores execution for mixed-precision operations. Evaluated on RTX 4090, A100, and H100, BitDecoding accelerates decoding by up to 7.5x, 4.8x, and 8.9x, respectively, over FP16 FlashDecoding-v2, and surpasses the state-of-the-art low-bit system QServe by up to 4.3x. On LLaMA-3.1-8B with a 128K context, BitDecoding reduces single-batch decoding latency by 3x, showing substantial improvements for long-context generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Visual generation includes both image and video generation, training probabilistic models to create coherent, diverse, and semantically faithful content from scratch. While early research focused on unconditional sampling, practitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise specification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants precise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases latency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and denoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce EVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead without retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual caching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we first profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained control, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A locality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the control signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions. For temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on CogVideo-Controlnet, Wan2.1-Controlnet, and Flux demonstrate that our method is effective in image and video control generation without the need for training. For example, it achieves 2.16 and 2.05 times speedups on CogVideo-Controlnet and Wan2.1-Controlnet, respectively, with almost no degradation in generation quality.Codes are available in the supplementary materials.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) can distribute keys with guaranteed security but remains susceptible to key exchange interruption due to physical-layer threats, such as high-power jamming attacks. To address this challenge, we first introduce a novel metric, namely Maximum Number of Affected Requests (maxNAR), to quantify the worst-case impact of a single physical-layer attack, and then we investigate a new problem of Routing and Wavelength Assignment with Minimal Attack Radius (RWA-MAR). We formulate the problem using an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model and propose a scalable heuristic to efficiently minimize maxNAR. Our approach incorporates key caching through Quantum Key Pools (QKPs) to enhance resilience and optimize resource utilization. Moreover, we model the impact of different QKD network architectures, employing Optical Bypass (OB) for optical switching of quantum channels and Trusted Relay (TR) for secure key forwarding. Moreover, a tunable parameter is designed in the heuristic to guide the preference for OB or TR, offering enhanced adaptability and dynamic control in diverse network scenarios. Simulation results confirm that our method significantly outperforms the baseline in terms of security and scalability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present Yan, a foundational framework for interactive video generation, covering the entire pipeline from simulation and generation to editing. Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering, enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the next generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing scale and complexity of large language models (LLMs) pose significant inference latency challenges, primarily due to their autoregressive decoding paradigm characterized by the sequential nature of next-token prediction. By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed that some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic parallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel decoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which addresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data and efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a non-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable structures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient adaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which enables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while maintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical Reasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, on Vicuna Bench, our method achieves up to 3.19x speedup (1.85x on average) while maintaining response quality within 1% difference compared to autoregressive models, realizing significant acceleration without compromising generation quality. Our framework sets a groundbreaking benchmark for efficient LLM parallel inference, paving the way for its deployment in latency-sensitive applications such as AI-powered customer service bots and answer retrieval engines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent work presented at USENIX Security 2025 (SEC'25) claims that occupancy-based attacks can recover AES keys from the MIRAGE randomized cache. In this paper, we examine these claims and find that they arise from a modeling flaw in the SEC'25 paper. Most critically, the SEC'25 paper's simulation of MIRAGE uses a constant seed to initialize the random number generator used for global evictions in MIRAGE, causing every AES encryption they trace to evict the same deterministic sequence of cache lines. This artificially creates a highly repeatable timing pattern that is not representative of a realistic implementation of MIRAGE, where eviction sequences vary randomly between encryptions. When we instead randomize the eviction seed for each run, reflecting realistic operation, the correlation between AES T-table accesses and attacker runtimes disappears, and the attack fails. These findings show that the reported leakage is an artifact of incorrect modeling, and not an actual vulnerability in MIRAGE.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in text-to-image synthesis. However, in the domain of controllable text-to-image generation using DiTs, most existing methods still rely on the ControlNet paradigm originally designed for UNet-based diffusion models. This paradigm introduces significant parameter overhead and increased computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose the Nano Control Diffusion Transformer (NanoControl), which employs Flux as the backbone network. Our model achieves state-of-the-art controllable text-to-image generation performance while incurring only a 0.024\% increase in parameter count and a 0.029\% increase in GFLOPs, thus enabling highly efficient controllable generation. Specifically, rather than duplicating the DiT backbone for control, we design a LoRA-style (low-rank adaptation) control module that directly learns control signals from raw conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce a KV-Context Augmentation mechanism that integrates condition-specific key-value information into the backbone in a simple yet highly effective manner, facilitating deep fusion of conditional features. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that NanoControl significantly reduces computational overhead compared to conventional control approaches, while maintaining superior generation quality and achieving improved controllability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial memory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates the challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade increased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods. We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X, instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and Values on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\times$ memory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to $\sim 7.7\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to the FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values are similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for extreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to 10$\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01 perplexity degradation, and 12.5$\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$ perplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based Large Language Models rely critically on the KV cache to efficiently handle extended contexts during the decode phase. Yet, the size of the KV cache grows proportionally with the input length, burdening both memory bandwidth and capacity as decoding progresses. To address this challenge, we present RocketKV, a training-free KV cache compression strategy containing two consecutive stages. In the first stage, it performs coarse-grain permanent KV cache eviction on the input sequence tokens. In the second stage, it adopts a hybrid sparse attention method to conduct fine-grain top-k sparse attention, approximating the attention scores by leveraging both head and sequence dimensionality reductions. We show that RocketKV provides a compression ratio of up to 400$\times$, end-to-end speedup of up to 3.7$\times$ as well as peak memory reduction of up to 32.6% in the decode phase on an NVIDIA A100 GPU compared to the full KV cache baseline, while achieving negligible accuracy loss on a variety of long-context tasks. We also propose a variant of RocketKV for multi-turn scenarios, which consistently outperforms other existing methods and achieves accuracy nearly on par with an oracle top-k attention scheme.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large models from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon autoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive Model (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the joint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world knowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without requiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent action trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames and actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and facilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with inverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further improve performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show that PAR achieves a 100\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the performance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately predicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings underscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world knowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) are specialized accelerators commonly employed to boost performance in workloads with iterative structures. Existing research typically focuses on compiler or architecture optimizations aimed at improving CGRA performance, energy efficiency, flexibility, and area utilization, under the idealistic assumption that kernels can access all data from Scratchpad Memory (SPM). However, certain complex workloads-particularly in fields like graph analytics, irregular database operations, and specialized forms of high-performance computing (e.g., unstructured mesh simulations)-exhibit irregular memory access patterns that hinder CGRA utilization, sometimes dropping below 1.5%, making the CGRA memory-bound. To address this challenge, we conduct a thorough analysis of the underlying causes of performance degradation, then propose a redesigned memory subsystem and refine the memory model. With both microarchitectural and theoretical optimization, our solution can effectively manage irregular memory accesses through CGRA-specific runahead execution mechanism and cache reconfiguration techniques. Our results demonstrate that we can achieve performance comparable to the original SPM-only system while requiring only 1.27% of the storage size. The runahead execution mechanism achieves an average 3.04x speedup (up to 6.91x), with cache reconfiguration technique providing an additional 6.02% improvement, significantly enhancing CGRA performance for irregular memory access patterns.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> BLAS is a fundamental building block of advanced linear algebra libraries and many modern scientific computing applications. GPUs are known for their strong arithmetic computing capabilities and are highly suited for BLAS operations. However, porting code to GPUs often requires significant effort, especially for large, complex codes or legacy codes, even for BLAS-heavy applications. While various tools exist to automatically offload BLAS to GPUs, they are often impractical due to the high costs associated with mandatory data transfers. The advent of unified memory architectures in recent GPU designs, such as the NVIDIA Grace-Hopper, allows cache-coherent memory access across all types of memory for both CPU and GPU, potentially eliminating the bottlenecks faced in conventional architectures. This breakthrough paves the way for innovative application developments and porting strategies. Building on our preliminary work demonstrating the potential of automatic *gemm offload, this paper extends the framework to all level-3 BLAS operations and introduces SCILIB-Accel, a novel tool for automatic BLAS offload. SCILIB-Accel leverages the memory coherency in Grace-Hopper and introduces a Device First-Use data movement policy inspired by the OpenMP First-Touch approach in multi-socket CPU programming, minimizing CPU-GPU data transfers for typical scientific computing codes. Additionally, utilizing dynamic binary instrumentation, the tool intercepts BLAS symbols directly from a CPU binary, requiring no code modifications or recompilation. SCILIB-Accel has been evaluated using multiple quantum physics codes on up to a few hundred GPU nodes, yielding promising speedups. Notably, for the LSMS method in the MuST suite, a 3x speedup was achieved on Grace-Hopper compared to Grace-Grace.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot capabilities but struggle with distribution shifts in downstream tasks when labeled data is unavailable, which has motivated the development of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) to improve VLMs' performance during inference without annotations. Among various TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving historical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering efficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability challenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts, causing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation performance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible decision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA) method that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from two perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample selection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware Entropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight entropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low entropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method leverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and facilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven Distribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as multivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for more accurate predictions across visually diverse content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly under real-world distribution shifts. Code: https://github.com/Evelyn1ywliang/ReTA.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The wide deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to strong demands for optimizing their inference performance. Today's techniques serving this purpose primarily focus on reducing latency and improving throughput through algorithmic and hardware enhancements, while largely overlooking their privacy side effects, particularly in a multi-user environment. In our research, for the first time, we discovered a set of new timing side channels in LLM systems, arising from shared caches and GPU memory allocations, which can be exploited to infer both confidential system prompts and those issued by other users. These vulnerabilities echo security challenges observed in traditional computing systems, highlighting an urgent need to address potential information leakage in LLM serving infrastructures. In this paper, we report novel attack strategies designed to exploit such timing side channels inherent in LLM deployments, specifically targeting the Key-Value (KV) cache and semantic cache widely used to enhance LLM inference performance. Our approach leverages timing measurements and classification models to detect cache hits, allowing an adversary to infer private prompts with high accuracy. We also propose a token-by-token search algorithm to efficiently recover shared prompt prefixes in the caches, showing the feasibility of stealing system prompts and those produced by peer users. Our experimental studies on black-box testing of popular online LLM services demonstrate that such privacy risks are completely realistic, with significant consequences. Our findings underscore the need for robust mitigation to protect LLM systems against such emerging threats.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Key-Value (KV) cache, which stores intermediate attention computations (Key and Value pairs) to avoid redundant calculations, is a fundamental mechanism for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference. However, this efficiency optimization introduces significant yet underexplored privacy risks. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of these vulnerabilities, demonstrating that an attacker can reconstruct sensitive user inputs directly from the KV-cache. We design and implement three distinct attack vectors: a direct Inversion Attack, a more broadly applicable and potent Collision Attack, and a semantic-based Injection Attack. These methods demonstrate the practicality and severity of KV-cache privacy leakage issues. To mitigate this, we propose KV-Cloak, a novel, lightweight, and efficient defense mechanism. KV-Cloak uses a reversible matrix-based obfuscation scheme, combined with operator fusion, to secure the KV-cache. Our extensive experiments show that KV-Cloak effectively thwarts all proposed attacks, reducing reconstruction quality to random noise. Crucially, it achieves this robust security with virtually no degradation in model accuracy and minimal performance overhead, offering a practical solution for trustworthy LLM deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) in high-dimensional vector spaces has a wide range of real-world applications. Numerous methods have been proposed to handle ANNS efficiently, while graph-based indexes have gained prominence due to their high accuracy and efficiency. However, the indexing overhead of graph-based indexes remains substantial. With exponential growth in data volume and increasing demands for dynamic index adjustments, this overhead continues to escalate, posing a critical challenge. In this paper, we introduce Tagore, a fast library accelerated by GPUs for graph indexing, which has powerful capabilities of constructing refinement-based graph indexes such as NSG and Vamana. We first introduce GNN-Descent, a GPU-specific algorithm for efficient k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) graph initialization. GNN-Descent speeds up the similarity comparison by a two-phase descent procedure and enables highly parallelized neighbor updates. Next, aiming to support various k-NN graph pruning strategies, we formulate a universal computing procedure termed CFS and devise two generalized GPU kernels for parallel processing complex dependencies in neighbor relationships. For large-scale datasets exceeding GPU memory capacity, we propose an asynchronous GPU-CPU-disk indexing framework with a cluster-aware caching mechanism to minimize the I/O pressure on the disk. Extensive experiments on 7 real-world datasets exhibit that Tagore achieves 1.32x-112.79x speedup while maintaining the index quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> An emerging paradigm in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is the use of history-aware multi-modal transformer models. Given a language instruction, these models process observation and navigation history to predict the most appropriate action for an agent. While they have significantly improved performance, the scale of these models can be a bottleneck in practical settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we propose a novel input-adaptive navigation method to enhance VLN model efficiency. We first show that existing input-adaptive mechanisms fail to reduce computations without substantial performance degradation. To address this, we introduce three adaptive algorithms, each deployed at a different level: (1) To improve spatial efficiency, we selectively process panoramic views at each observation of an agent. (2) To improve intra-model efficiency, we propose importance-based adaptive thresholding for the early-exit methods. (3) To improve temporal efficiency, we implement a caching mechanism that prevents reprocessing of views previously seen by the agent. In evaluations on seven VLN benchmarks, we demonstrate over a 2$\times$ reduction in computation across three off-the-shelf agents in both standard and continuous environments. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/secure-ai-systems-group/adaptive-vision-and-language-navigation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) generate tokens autoregressively, with each token depending on the preceding context. This sequential nature makes the inference process inherently difficult to accelerate, posing a significant challenge for efficient deployment. In recent years, various methods have been proposed to address this issue, with the most effective approaches often involving the training of additional draft models. In this paper, we introduce READER (Retrieval-Assisted Drafter for Efficient LLM Inference), a novel lossless speculative decoding method that enhances model-based approaches by leveraging self-repetitions in the text. Our algorithm expands the speculative decoding tree using tokens obtained through statistical search. This work focuses on large batch sizes (>= 8), an underexplored yet important area for industrial applications. We also analyze the key-value (KV) cache size during speculative decoding and propose an optimization to improve performance for large batches. As a result, READER outperforms existing speculative decoding methods. Notably, READER requires no additional training and can reuse pre-trained speculator models, increasing the speedup by over 40\%. Our method demonstrates particularly strong performance on search-based tasks, such as retrieval-augmented generation, where we achieve more than 10x speedup.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in long-context tasks such as reasoning, code generation, and multi-turn dialogue. However, inference over extended contexts is bottlenecked by the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose memory footprint grows linearly with sequence length and dominates latency at each decoding step. While recent KV cache compression methods identify and load important tokens, they focus predominantly on input contexts and fail to address the cumulative attention errors that arise during long decoding. In this paper, we introduce RetroAttention, a novel KV cache update technique that retrospectively revises past attention outputs using newly arrived KV entries from subsequent decoding steps. By maintaining a lightweight output cache, RetroAttention enables past queries to efficiently access more relevant context, while incurring minimal latency overhead. This breaks the fixed-attention-output paradigm and allows continual correction of prior approximations. Extensive experiments on long-generation benchmarks show that RetroAttention consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) KV compression methods, increasing effective KV exposure by up to 1.6$\times$ and accuracy by up to 21.9\%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Existing cache-based acceleration methods for video diffusion models primarily skip early or mid denoising steps, which often leads to structural discrepancies relative to full-timestep generation and can hinder instruction following and character consistency. We present TaoCache, a training-free, plug-and-play caching strategy that, instead of residual-based caching, adopts a fixed-point perspective to predict the model's noise output and is specifically effective in late denoising stages. By calibrating cosine similarities and norm ratios of consecutive noise deltas, TaoCache preserves high-resolution structure while enabling aggressive skipping. The approach is orthogonal to complementary accelerations such as Pyramid Attention Broadcast (PAB) and TeaCache, and it integrates seamlessly into DiT-based frameworks. Across Latte-1, OpenSora-Plan v110, and Wan2.1, TaoCache attains substantially higher visual quality (LPIPS, SSIM, PSNR) than prior caching methods under the same speedups.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> AI inference workflows are typically structured as a pipeline or graph of AI programs triggered by events. As events occur, the AIs perform inference or classification tasks under time pressure to respond or take some action. Standard techniques that reduce latency in other streaming settings (such as caching and optimization-driven scheduling) are of limited value because AI data access patterns (models, databases) change depending on the triggering event: a significant departure from traditional streaming. In this work, we propose a novel affinity grouping mechanism that makes it easier for developers to express application-specific data access correlations, enabling coordinated management of data objects in server clusters hosting streaming inference tasks. Our proposals are thus complementary to other approaches such as caching and scheduling. Experiments confirm the limitations of standard techniques, while showing that the proposed mechanism is able to maintain significantly lower latency as workload and scale-out increase, and yet requires only minor code changes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current video diffusion models achieve impressive generation quality but struggle in interactive applications due to bidirectional attention dependencies. The generation of a single frame requires the model to process the entire sequence, including the future. We address this limitation by adapting a pretrained bidirectional diffusion transformer to an autoregressive transformer that generates frames on-the-fly. To further reduce latency, we extend distribution matching distillation (DMD) to videos, distilling 50-step diffusion model into a 4-step generator. To enable stable and high-quality distillation, we introduce a student initialization scheme based on teacher's ODE trajectories, as well as an asymmetric distillation strategy that supervises a causal student model with a bidirectional teacher. This approach effectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive generation, allowing long-duration video synthesis despite training on short clips. Our model achieves a total score of 84.27 on the VBench-Long benchmark, surpassing all previous video generation models. It enables fast streaming generation of high-quality videos at 9.4 FPS on a single GPU thanks to KV caching. Our approach also enables streaming video-to-video translation, image-to-video, and dynamic prompting in a zero-shot manner.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present an efficient method for rigorous quantum calculations of cross sections for atom-molecule reactive scattering in the presence of a dc electric field. The wavefunction of the reaction complex is expanded in an overcomplete set of arrangement-dependent Fock-Delves hyperspherical basis functions and the interactions of the reactants and products with electric fields are accounted for in the total angular momentum representation. A significant computational challenge affecting our previously developed approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. $\mathbf{115}$, 023201 (2015)] is addressed by an efficient asymptotic frame transformation between the hyperspherical and Jacobi coordinates in the presence of an external field. Using accurate {\it ab initio} potential energy surfaces, we calculate total and state-resolved cross sections for the chemical reactions LiF$(v=1,j=0)$ + H $\to$ Li + HF($v'=0,j'$) and F + HD$(v=0,j=0)$ $\to$ HF + D, DF + H as functions of collision energy and electric field strength. The field dependence of the cross sections for the LiF + H chemical reaction exhibits resonance structure mediated by tunneling-driven interactions between reactants and products. No significant field effects are found for the F + HD $\to$ HF + D, DF + H chemical reaction at 1 Kelvin, even for state-resolved transitions and with field magnitudes reaching 200 kV/cm. Our calculations illustrate the essential role of basis set convergence for the proper interpretation of external field effects on chemical reaction dynamics. While reduced-basis calculations for the F + HD reaction indicate significant effects of electric fields on product state distributions, these effects vanish when the number of total angular momentum basis states is increased.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing how users interact with information systems, yet their high inference cost poses serious scalability and sustainability challenges. Caching inference responses, allowing them to be retrieved without another forward pass through the LLM, has emerged as one possible solution. Traditional exact-match caching, however, overlooks the semantic similarity between queries, leading to unnecessary recomputation. Semantic caching addresses this by retrieving responses based on semantic similarity, but introduces a fundamentally different cache eviction problem: one must account for mismatch costs between incoming queries and cached responses. Moreover, key system parameters, such as query arrival probabilities and serving costs, are often unknown and must be learned over time. Existing semantic caching methods are largely ad-hoc, lacking theoretical foundations and unable to adapt to real-world uncertainty. In this paper, we present a principled, learning-based framework for semantic cache eviction under unknown query and cost distributions. We formulate both offline optimization and online learning variants of the problem, and develop provably efficient algorithms with state-of-the-art guarantees. We also evaluate our framework on a synthetic dataset, showing that our proposed algorithms perform matching or superior performance compared with baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While recent flow-based image editing models demonstrate general-purpose capabilities across diverse tasks, they often struggle to specialize in challenging scenarios -- particularly those involving large-scale shape transformations. When performing such structural edits, these methods either fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120 new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape replacement.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A systematic understanding of Apple Silicon is lacking in the current landscape of hardware efficiency; research focus is largely centered on accelerating GPUs for large-scale training or inference on CUDA devices. This paper investigates Apple Silicon's unique memory architecture that offers a unified memory integrating CPU and GPU memory and its implications for on-device LLM inference.   We decipher myths about whether Apple Silicon is efficient for on-device inference compared to competitors such as NVIDIA GPUs by directly conducting latency and throughput comparison benchmarks. We explain the performance gap between them through profiling low level hardware metrics - ALU utilization, memory bandwidth, buffer usage, cache residency etc. at runtime. We draw several insights regarding performance bottlenecks such as dequantization overhead, compute throughput and memory bandwidth. We debunk existing false claims regarding large language model inference such as compressing models to lower bit precision is a defacto promise for faster inference across all hardware platforms. We find that the large unified memory enables Apple Silicon to be both cost effective and efficient against NVIDIA GPUs for ultra large language models.   Our large scale evaluation on 5 hardware testbeds incorporating three Apple M-series devices: M2 Ultra, M2 Max and M4 Pro and two NVIDIA GPUs: NVIDIA RTX A6000, a multi GPU setup with 2xNVIDIA RTX A6000, 5 model scales ranging from 8B to 405B parameters and 14 quantization schemes gives an understanding of how Apple Silicon fits within the paradigm of on-device LLM inference. Our analysis reveals multiple resource interdependencies and unexpected findings, while also quantifying established insights. To the best of our knowledge, this study makes the first attempt to present a thorough characterization and analysis of Apple Silicon for on-device inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Long-context Large Language Model (LLM) inference faces increasing compute bottlenecks as attention calculations scale with context length, primarily due to the growing KV-cache transfer overhead that saturates High Bandwidth Memory (HBM). While prefetching techniques mitigate cache misses by fetching KV data in advance, their spatial and temporal benefits present new opportunities to exploit. This work proposes a packing-prefetch scheduling architecture with monolithic 3D (M3D) back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible embedded memories with ultra-large on-chip capacity to accelerate long-context LLM inference. Our optimizations demonstrate 8.06x decode speedup and 1.83x overall latency reduction on Llama3.1-8B using TPUv6e-like hardware with additional 512MB BEOL memories over the serial execution. Evaluations of multi-request workloads on TPU-like architectures show 1.7x-2.4x throughput improvement and 1.5x-2.4x HBM bandwidth reduction compared to packing-only methods on Llama3.1-8B and Llama3.1-70B models. With the co-design of packing, prefetching, and BEOL memories, our approach alleviates HBM constraints and enables efficient long-context LLM inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Global KV-cache sharing has emerged as a key optimization for accelerating large language model (LLM) inference. However, it exposes a new class of timing side-channel attacks, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive user inputs via shared cache entries. Existing defenses, such as per-user isolation, eliminate leakage but degrade performance by up to 38.9% in time-to-first-token (TTFT), making them impractical for high-throughput deployment. To address this gap, we introduce SafeKV (Secure and Flexible KV Cache Sharing), a privacy-aware KV-cache management framework that selectively shares non-sensitive entries while confining sensitive content to private caches. SafeKV comprises three components: (i) a hybrid, multi-tier detection pipeline that integrates rule-based pattern matching, a general-purpose privacy detector, and context-aware validation; (ii) a unified radix-tree index that manages public and private entries across heterogeneous memory tiers (HBM, DRAM, SSD); and (iii) entropy-based access monitoring to detect and mitigate residual information leakage. Our evaluation shows that SafeKV mitigates 94% - 97% of timing-based side-channel attacks. Compared to per-user isolation method, SafeKV improves TTFT by up to 40.58% and throughput by up to 2.66X across diverse LLMs and workloads. SafeKV reduces cache-induced TTFT overhead from 50.41% to 11.74% on Qwen3-235B. By combining fine-grained privacy control with high cache reuse efficiency, SafeKV reclaims the performance advantages of global sharing while providing robust runtime privacy guarantees for LLM inference.

The Lie algebra lkv appears in a chain of inclusions of Lie algebras, including also the linearized double shuffle Lie algebra and the (depth associated graded of the) Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller Lie algebra. Hence our computations also allow us to check the validity of the Deligne-Drinfeld conjecture on the structure of the Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller group up to weight 29, and (a version of) the the Broadhurst-Kreimer conjecture on the number of multiple zeta values for a range of weight-depth pairs significantly exceeding the previous bounds.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have revolutionized high-fidelity image and video synthesis, yet their computational demands remain prohibitive for real-time applications. To solve this problem, feature caching has been proposed to accelerate diffusion models by caching the features in the previous timesteps and then reusing them in the following timesteps. However, at timesteps with significant intervals, the feature similarity in diffusion models decreases substantially, leading to a pronounced increase in errors introduced by feature caching, significantly harming the generation quality. To solve this problem, we propose TaylorSeer, which firstly shows that features of diffusion models at future timesteps can be predicted based on their values at previous timesteps. Based on the fact that features change slowly and continuously across timesteps, TaylorSeer employs a differential method to approximate the higher-order derivatives of features and predict features in future timesteps with Taylor series expansion. Extensive experiments demonstrate its significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis, especially in high acceleration ratios. For instance, it achieves an almost lossless acceleration of 4.99$\times$ on FLUX and 5.00$\times$ on HunyuanVideo without additional training. On DiT, it achieves $3.41$ lower FID compared with previous SOTA at $4.53$$\times$ acceleration. %Our code is provided in the supplementary materials and will be made publicly available on GitHub.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Serving LLM adapters has gained significant attention as an effective approach to adapt general-purpose language models to diverse, task-specific use cases. However, serving a wide range of adapters introduces several and substantial overheads, leading to performance degradation and challenges in optimal placement. To address these challenges, we present an analytical, AI-driven pipeline that accurately determines the optimal allocation of adapters in single-node setups. This allocation maximizes performance, effectively using GPU resources, while preventing request starvation. Crucially, the proposed allocation is given based on current workload patterns. These insights in single-node setups can be leveraged in multi-replica deployments for overall placement, load balancing and server configuration, ultimately enhancing overall performance and improving resource efficiency. Our approach builds on an in-depth analysis of LLM adapter serving, accounting for overheads and performance variability, and includes the development of the first Digital Twin capable of replicating online LLM-adapter serving systems with matching key performance metrics. The experimental results demonstrate that the Digital Twin achieves a SMAPE difference of no more than 5.5% in throughput compared to real results, and the proposed pipeline accurately predicts the optimal placement with minimal latency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video restoration aims to reconstruct high quality video sequences from low quality inputs, addressing tasks such as super resolution, denoising, and deblurring. Traditional regression based methods often produce unrealistic details and require extensive paired datasets, while recent generative diffusion models face challenges in ensuring temporal consistency. We introduce DiTVR, a zero shot video restoration framework that couples a diffusion transformer with trajectory aware attention and a wavelet guided, flow consistent sampler. Unlike prior 3D convolutional or frame wise diffusion approaches, our attention mechanism aligns tokens along optical flow trajectories, with particular emphasis on vital layers that exhibit the highest sensitivity to temporal dynamics. A spatiotemporal neighbour cache dynamically selects relevant tokens based on motion correspondences across frames. The flow guided sampler injects data consistency only into low-frequency bands, preserving high frequency priors while accelerating convergence. DiTVR establishes a new zero shot state of the art on video restoration benchmarks, demonstrating superior temporal consistency and detail preservation while remaining robust to flow noise and occlusions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep learning models have become pivotal in the field of video processing and is increasingly critical in practical applications such as autonomous driving and object detection. Although Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated their power, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain a highly efficient and high-performance choice for feature extraction and encoding. However, the intensive computational demands of convolution operations hinder its broader adoption as a video encoder. Given the inherent temporal continuity in video frames, changes between consecutive frames are minimal, allowing for the skipping of redundant computations. This technique, which we term as Diff Computation, presents two primary challenges. First, Diff Computation requires to cache intermediate feature maps to ensure the correctness of non-linear computations, leading to significant memory consumption. Second, the imbalance of sparsity among layers, introduced by Diff Computation, incurs accuracy degradation. To address these issues, we propose a memory-efficient scheduling method to eliminate memory overhead and an online adjustment mechanism to minimize accuracy degradation. We integrate these techniques into our framework, SparseTem, to seamlessly support various CNN-based video encoders. SparseTem achieves speedup of 1.79x for EfficientDet and 4.72x for CRNN, with minimal accuracy drop and no additional memory overhead. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SparseTem sets a new state-of-the-art by effectively utilizing temporal continuity to accelerate CNN-based video encoders.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot generalization but suffer performance degradation under distribution shifts in downstream tasks, particularly in the absence of labeled data. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by enabling online optimization of VLMs during inference, eliminating the need for annotated data. Cache-based TTA methods exploit historical knowledge by maintaining a dynamic memory cache of low-entropy or high-confidence samples, promoting efficient adaptation to out-of-distribution data. Nevertheless, these methods face two critical challenges: (1) unreliable confidence metrics under significant distribution shifts, resulting in error accumulation within the cache and degraded adaptation performance; and (2) rigid decision boundaries that fail to accommodate substantial distributional variations, leading to suboptimal predictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Adaptive Cache Enhancement (ACE) framework, which constructs a robust cache by selectively storing high-confidence or low-entropy image embeddings per class, guided by dynamic, class-specific thresholds initialized from zero-shot statistics and iteratively refined using an exponential moving average and exploration-augmented updates. This approach enables adaptive, class-wise decision boundaries, ensuring robust and accurate predictions across diverse visual distributions. Extensive experiments on 15 diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that ACE achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior robustness and generalization compared to existing TTA methods in challenging out-of-distribution scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has driven the adoption of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures as a promising solution to scale model capacity while controlling computational costs. However, deploying MoE models in resource-constrained mobile edge computing environments presents significant challenges due to their large memory footprint and dynamic expert activation patterns. To address these challenges, we propose a novel dynamic resource-aware collaborative optimization framework that jointly optimizes expert aggregation granularity and offloading strategies based on real-time device resource states, network conditions, and input characteristics in mobile edge environments, denoted as CoMoE. In CoMoE, we first systematically analyze existing expert aggregation techniques, including expert parameter merging,knowledge distillation,and parameter sharing decomposition, identifying their limitations in dynamic mobile environments.We then investigate expert offloading strategies encompassing expert prediction and prefetching, expert caching and scheduling, and multi-tier storage architectures, revealing the interdependencies between routing decisions and offloading performance.The CoMoE incorporates adaptive scheduling mechanisms that respond to user mobility and varying network conditions, enabling efficient MoE deployment across heterogeneous edge devices. Extensive experiments on real mobile edge testbeds demonstrate that CoMoE achieves approximately 70% reduction in memory usage compared to baseline methods, 10.5% lower inference latency than existing expert offloading techniques, while maintaining model performance stability. For large-scale MoE models (e.g,7.4B-parameter Switch-Base-128), the CoMoE reduces memory requirements from 15.6GB to 4.7GB, enabling deployment on resource-constrained mobile edge devices that previously could only support much smaller models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Policy (DP) enables robots to learn complex behaviors by imitating expert demonstrations through action diffusion. However, in practical applications, hardware limitations often degrade data quality, while real-time constraints restrict model inference to instantaneous state and scene observations. These limitations seriously reduce the efficacy of learning from expert demonstrations, resulting in failures in object localization, grasp planning, and long-horizon task execution. To address these challenges, we propose Causal Diffusion Policy (CDP), a novel transformer-based diffusion model that enhances action prediction by conditioning on historical action sequences, thereby enabling more coherent and context-aware visuomotor policy learning. To further mitigate the computational cost associated with autoregressive inference, a caching mechanism is also introduced to store attention key-value pairs from previous timesteps, substantially reducing redundant computations during execution. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments, spanning diverse 2D and 3D manipulation tasks, demonstrate that CDP uniquely leverages historical action sequences to achieve significantly higher accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, even when faced with degraded input observation quality, CDP maintains remarkable precision by reasoning through temporal continuity, which highlights its practical robustness for robotic control under realistic, imperfect conditions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have enabled training-free regional image editing by leveraging the generative priors of foundation models. However, existing methods struggle to balance text adherence in edited regions, context fidelity in unedited areas, and seamless integration of edits. We introduce CannyEdit, a novel training-free framework that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: (1) Selective Canny Control, which masks the structural guidance of Canny ControlNet in user-specified editable regions while strictly preserving details of the source images in unedited areas via inversion-phase ControlNet information retention. This enables precise, text-driven edits without compromising contextual integrity. (2) Dual-Prompt Guidance, which combines local prompts for object-specific edits with a global target prompt to maintain coherent scene interactions. On real-world image editing tasks (addition, replacement, removal), CannyEdit outperforms prior methods like KV-Edit, achieving a 2.93 to 10.49 percent improvement in the balance of text adherence and context fidelity. In terms of editing seamlessness, user studies reveal only 49.2 percent of general users and 42.0 percent of AIGC experts identified CannyEdit's results as AI-edited when paired with real images without edits, versus 76.08 to 89.09 percent for competitor methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Parallel event sequences, such as those collected in program execution traces and automated manufacturing pipelines, are typically visualized as interactive parallel timelines. As the dataset size grows, these charts frequently experience lag during common interactions such as zooming, panning, and filtering. Summarization approaches can improve interaction performance, but at the cost of accuracy in representation. To address this challenge, we introduce ESeMan (Event Sequence Manager), an event sequence management system designed to support interactive rendering of timeline visualizations with tunable accuracy. ESeMan employs hierarchical data structures and intelligent caching to provide visualizations with only the data necessary to generate accurate summarizations with significantly reduced data fetch time. We evaluate ESeMan's query times against summed area tables, M4 aggregation, and statistical sub-sampling on a variety of program execution traces. Our results demonstrate ESeMan provides better performance, achieving sub-100ms fetch times while maintaining visualization accuracy at the pixel level. We further present our benchmarking harness, enabling future performance evaluations for event sequence visualization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> There is a huge gap between numerous intriguing applications fostered by on-device large language model (LLM) fine-tuning (FT) from fresh mobile data and the limited resources of a mobile device. While existing server-assisted methods (e.g., split learning or side-tuning) may enable LLM FT on the local mobile device, they suffer from heavy communication burdens of activation transmissions, and may disclose data and labels to the server. To address those issues, we develop PAE MobiLLM, a a privacy-aware and efficient LLM FT method which can be deployed on the mobile device via server-assisted additive side-tuning. To further accelerate FT convergence and improve computing efficiency, PAE MobiLLM integrates activation caching on the server side, which allows the server to reuse historical activations and saves the mobile device from repeatedly computing forward passes for the recurring data samples. Besides, to reduce communication cost, PAE MobiLLM develops an activation shortcut that transmits only the token involved in the loss calculation instead of full activation matrices to guide the side network tuning. Last but not least, PAE MobiLLM introduces the additive adapter side-network design which makes the server train the adapter modules based on device-defined prediction differences rather than raw ground-truth labels. In this way, the server can only assist device-defined side-network computing, and learn nothing about data and labels. Extensive experimental results demonstrate PAE MobiLLM's superiority.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multi-head latent attention (MLA) is designed to optimize KV cache memory through low-rank key-value joint compression. Rather than caching keys and values separately, MLA stores their compressed latent representations, reducing memory overhead while maintaining the performance. While MLA improves memory efficiency without compromising language model accuracy, its major limitation lies in its integration during the pre-training phase, requiring models to be trained from scratch. This raises a key question: can we use MLA's benefits fully or partially in models that have already been pre-trained with different attention mechanisms? In this paper, we propose X-EcoMLA to deploy post training distillation to enable the upcycling of Transformer-based attention into an efficient hybrid MLA variant through lightweight post-training adaptation, bypassing the need for extensive pre-training. We demonstrate that leveraging the dark knowledge of a well-trained model can enhance training accuracy and enable extreme KV cache compression in MLA without compromising model performance. The experimental results show that our proposed method can effectively compress the KV cache while preserving the performance on the benchmarks; specifically, for Llama3.2-1B-Instruct baseline, a 6.4x compression achieves the same average score by using only 3.6B training tokens and 70 GPU hours on AMD MI300, whereas a 10.6x compression have less than 0.1% average score drop with 7B training tokens and 140 GPU hours.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Long-context inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily limited by high computational demands. While several existing methods optimize attention computation, they still process the full set of hidden states at each layer, limiting overall efficiency. In this work, we propose SlimInfer, an innovative framework that aims to accelerate inference by directly pruning less critical prompt tokens during the forward pass. Our key insight is an information diffusion phenomenon: As information from critical tokens propagates through layers, it becomes distributed across the entire sequence. This diffusion process suggests that LLMs can maintain their semantic integrity when excessive tokens, even including these critical ones, are pruned in hidden states. Motivated by this, SlimInfer introduces a dynamic fine-grained pruning mechanism that accurately removes redundant tokens of hidden state at intermediate layers. This layer-wise pruning naturally enables an asynchronous KV cache manager that prefetches required token blocks without complex predictors, reducing both memory usage and I/O costs. Extensive experiments show that SlimInfer can achieve up to $\mathbf{2.53\times}$ time-to-first-token (TTFT) speedup and $\mathbf{1.88\times}$ end-to-end latency reduction for LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct on a single RTX 4090, without sacrificing performance on LongBench. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Most log-based anomaly detectors assume logs are stable, though logs are often unstable due to software or environmental changes. Anomaly detection on unstable logs (ULAD) is therefore a more realistic, yet under-investigated challenge. Current approaches predominantly employ machine learning (ML) models, which often require extensive labeled data for training. To mitigate data insufficiency, we propose FlexLog, a novel hybrid approach for ULAD that combines ML models -- decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, and a feedforward neural network -- with a Large Language Model (Mistral) through ensemble learning. FlexLog also incorporates a cache and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to further enhance efficiency and effectiveness. To evaluate FlexLog, we configured four datasets for \task, namely ADFA-U, LOGEVOL-U, SynHDFS-U, and SYNEVOL-U. FlexLog outperforms all baselines by at least 1.2 percentage points (pp) in F1 score while using much less labeled data (62.87 pp reduction). When trained on the same amount of data as the baselines, FlexLog achieves up to a 13 pp increase in F1 score on ADFA-U across varying training dataset sizes. Additionally, FlexLog maintains inference time under one second per log sequence, making it suitable for most applications, except latency-sensitive systems. Further analysis reveals the positive impact of FlexLog's key components: cache, RAG and ensemble learning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Withtherapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), the context length for inference has been continuously increasing, leading to an exponential growth in the demand for Key-Value (KV) caching. This has resulted in a significant memory bottleneck, limiting the inference efficiency and scalability of the models. Therefore, optimizing the KV cache during inference is crucial for enhancing performance and efficiency. This review systematically examines current KV cache optimization techniques, including compression strategies such as selective token strategies, quantization, and attention compression. We evaluate the effectiveness, trade-offs, and application scenarios of these methods, providing a comprehensive analysis of their impact on memory usage and inference speed. We focus on identifying the limitations and challenges of existing methods, such as compatibility issues with different models and tasks. Additionally, this review highlights future research directions, including hybrid optimization techniques, adaptive dynamic strategies, and software-hardware co-design. These approaches aim to improve inference efficiency and promote the practical application of large language models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion models have shown remarkable success across generative tasks, yet their high computational demands challenge deployment on resource-limited platforms. This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal diffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning, is it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a cheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps increases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model more sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes the differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training compression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff, a training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by reducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training manner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme based on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising steps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation fidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to reuse computations across denoising steps. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that (1) PostDiff can significantly improve the fidelity-efficiency trade-off of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and (2) to boost efficiency while maintaining decent generation fidelity, reducing per-step inference cost is often more effective than reducing the number of denoising steps.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We study the problem of serving LLM (Large Language Model) requests where each request has heterogeneous prefill and decode lengths. In LLM serving, the prefill length corresponds to the input prompt length, which determines the initial memory usage in the KV cache. The decode length refers to the number of output tokens generated sequentially, with each additional token increasing the KV cache memory usage by one unit. Given a set of n requests, our goal is to schedule and process them to minimize the total completion time. We show that this problem is NP-hard due to the interplay of batching, placement constraints, precedence relationships, and linearly increasing memory usage. We then analyze commonly used scheduling strategies in practice, such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) and Shortest-First (SF), and prove that their competitive ratios scale up sublinearly with the memory limit-a significant drawback in real-world settings where memory demand is large. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm based on a new selection metric that efficiently forms batches over time. We prove that this algorithm achieves a constant competitive ratio. Finally, we develop and evaluate a few algorithm variants inspired by this approach, including dynamic programming variants, local search methods, and an LP-based scheduler, demonstrating through comprehensive simulations that they outperform standard baselines while maintaining computational efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Finding an optimal decision tree that minimizes classification error is known to be NP-hard. While exact algorithms based on MILP, CP, SAT, or dynamic programming guarantee optimality, they often suffer from poor anytime behavior -- meaning they struggle to find high-quality decision trees quickly when the search is stopped before completion -- due to unbalanced search space exploration. To address this, several anytime extensions of exact methods have been proposed, such as LDS-DL8.5, Top-k-DL8.5, and Blossom, but they have not been systematically compared, making it difficult to assess their relative effectiveness. In this paper, we propose CA-DL8.5, a generic, complete, and anytime beam search algorithm that extends the DL8.5 framework and unifies some existing anytime strategies. In particular, CA-DL8.5 generalizes previous approaches LDS-DL8.5 and Top-k-DL8.5, by allowing the integration of various heuristics and relaxation mechanisms through a modular design. The algorithm reuses DL8.5's efficient branch-and-bound pruning and trie-based caching, combined with a restart-based beam search that gradually relaxes pruning criteria to improve solution quality over time. Our contributions are twofold: (1) We introduce this new generic framework for exact and anytime decision tree learning, enabling the incorporation of diverse heuristics and search strategies; (2) We conduct a rigorous empirical comparison of several instantiations of CA-DL8.5 -- based on Purity, Gain, Discrepancy, and Top-k heuristics -- using an anytime evaluation metric called the primal gap integral. Experimental results on standard classification benchmarks show that CA-DL8.5 using LDS (limited discrepancy) consistently provides the best anytime performance, outperforming both other CA-DL8.5 variants and the Blossom algorithm while maintaining completeness and optimality guarantees.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over a field $F=\mathbb{F}_q((t))$ splitting over $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q((t))$. Following [KV,DR], a tamely unramified Langlands parameter $\lambda:W_F\to{}^L G(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_{\ell})$ in general position gives rise to a finite set $\Pi_{\lambda}$ of irreducible admissible representations of $G(F)$, called the $L$-packet.   The main goal of this work is to provide a geometric description of characters $\chi_{\pi}$ of $\pi\in\Pi_{\lambda}$ and of their endoscopic linear combinations $\chi_{\lambda}^{\kappa}$ in terms of homology of affine Springer fibers, thus establishing an analog of Lusztig conjectures in this case. Furthermore, each $\chi_{\lambda}^{\kappa}$ can be described as the trace of Frobenius function of a conjugation equivariant perverse sheaf on the loop group by the sheaf-function correspondence.   As another application, we prove that the sum $\chi_{\lambda}^{st}:=\sum_{\pi\in\Pi_{\lambda}}\chi_{\pi}$ is stable and show that the $\chi_{\lambda}^{st}$'s are compatible with inner twistings. More generally, we prove that each $\chi_{\lambda}^{\kappa}$ is $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda,\kappa}$-stable.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for text generation, with the potential to decode multiple tokens in a single iteration. However, none of the existing open-source dLLMs have achieved superior inference speed over AR LLMs of similar size. This paper breaks this barrier based on a simple and effective strategy named discrete diffusion forcing (D2F). D2F equips dLLMs with two key capabilities: (1) block-wise autoregressive generation to enable KV cache utilization; (2) prediction of following tokens without requiring completion of prior blocks for inter-block parallel decoding. In this way, the vanilla dLLMs are refurbished into an AR-diffusion hybrid paradigm for efficient inference. D2F can be implemented with an asymmetric distillation process based on pre-trained dLLMs. We further propose a pipelined parallel decoding algorithm, which enables a trade-off between efficiency and efficacy. Empirically, D2F dLLMs achieve more than $\mathbf{2.5\times}$ inference speed than LLaMA3 and Qwen2.5 on GSM8K. Compared to vanilla dLLMs like LLaDA and Dream, the acceleration can be more than $\mathbf{50\times}$ while maintaining comparable output quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP show strong zero-shot performance but struggle with generalization under distribution shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adapting VLMs to unlabeled test data in new domains. While some TTA methods rely on prompt-tuning, training-free cache-based approaches are preferred for efficiency. However, current cache-based TTA models store only a limited set of high-confidence samples, restricting the decision boundary to these samples and ignoring the influence of other incoming test data. To address this, we propose Efficient Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), introducing a Recursive Updating module that integrates all incoming test samples, progressively refining the decision boundary. This strategy mimics an unbounded cache, dynamically updating contextual embeddings for improved accuracy with minimal memory and computational overhead. ETTA also includes an Adaptive Ensemble module to reduce prompt dependency in image-to-text scores by dynamically selecting optimal prompts for each class. Furthermore, ETTA adaptively combines scores from both modules based on confidence levels, leveraging their complementary strengths. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks confirm that ETTA surpasses the state-of-the-art TTA models in computational complexity and accuracy, setting a new standard for effective, efficient test-time adaptation. The code has been released at https://github.com/hamidreza-dastmalchi/ETTA.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Test-Time Compute (TTC) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) at inference, leveraging strategies such as Test-Time Training (TTT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). However, the optimal adaptation strategy varies across queries, and indiscriminate application of TTC strategy incurs substantial computational overhead. In this work, we introduce Reward-Guided Test-Time Compute (RTTC), a novel framework that adaptively selects the most effective TTC strategy for each query via a pretrained reward model, maximizing downstream accuracy across diverse domains and tasks. RTTC operates in a distributed server-client architecture, retrieving relevant samples from a remote knowledge base and applying RAG or lightweight fine-tuning on client devices only when necessary. To further mitigate redundant computation, we propose Query-State Caching, which enables the efficient reuse of historical query states at both retrieval and adaptation levels. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that RTTC consistently achieves superior accuracy compared to vanilla RAG or TTT, validating the necessity of adaptive, reward-guided TTC selection and the potential of RTTC for scalable, high-performance language model adaptation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in visual-language tasks by leveraging numerous visual tokens for fine-grained visual information, but this token redundancy results in significant computational costs. Previous research aimed at reducing visual tokens during inference typically leverages importance maps derived from attention scores among vision-only tokens or vision-language tokens to prune tokens across one or multiple pruning stages. Despite this progress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and insufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance degradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that introduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning module with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy are further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically, we compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived context relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which tokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to avoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information flow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most representative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the discrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning, thereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs. Experiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while maintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache memory and 3.8 times faster inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generating long, temporally coherent videos with precise control over subject identity and motion is a formidable challenge for current diffusion models, which often suffer from identity drift and are limited to short clips. We introduce PoseGen, a novel framework that generates arbitrarily long videos of a specific subject from a single reference image and a driving pose sequence. Our core innovation is an in-context LoRA finetuning strategy that injects subject appearance at the token level for identity preservation, while simultaneously conditioning on pose information at the channel level for fine-grained motion control. To overcome duration limits, PoseGen pioneers an interleaved segment generation method that seamlessly stitches video clips together, using a shared KV cache mechanism and a specialized transition process to ensure background consistency and temporal smoothness. Trained on a remarkably small 33-hour video dataset, extensive experiments show that PoseGen significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, pose accuracy, and its unique ability to produce coherent, artifact-free videos of unlimited duration.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern LLM pipelines increasingly resemble data-centric systems: they retrieve external context, compose intermediate outputs, validate results, and adapt based on runtime feedback. Yet, the central element guiding this process -- the prompt -- remains a brittle, opaque string, disconnected from the surrounding dataflow. This disconnect limits reuse, optimization, and runtime control.   In this paper, we describe our vision and an initial design for SPEAR, a language and runtime that fills this prompt management gap by making prompts structured, adaptive, and first-class components of the execution model. SPEAR enables (1) runtime prompt refinement -- modifying prompts dynamically in response to execution-time signals such as confidence, latency, or missing context; and (2) structured prompt management -- organizing prompt fragments into versioned views with support for introspection and logging.   SPEAR defines a prompt algebra that governs how prompts are constructed and adapted within a pipeline. It supports multiple refinement modes (manual, assisted, and automatic), giving developers a balance between control and automation. By treating prompt logic as structured data, SPEAR enables optimizations such as operator fusion, prefix caching, and view reuse. Preliminary experiments quantify the behavior of different refinement modes compared to static prompts and agentic retries, as well as the impact of prompt-level optimizations such as operator fusion.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity (binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models. Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning, and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent efforts have extended the capabilities of transformers in logical reasoning and symbolic computations. In this work, we investigate their capacity for non-linear latent pattern discovery in the context of functional decomposition, focusing on the challenging algebraic task of multivariate polynomial decomposition. This problem, with widespread applications in science and engineering, is proved to be NP-hard, and demands both precision and insight. Our contributions are threefold: First, we develop a synthetic data generation pipeline providing fine-grained control over problem complexity. Second, we train transformer models via supervised learning and evaluate them across four key dimensions involving scaling behavior and generalizability. Third, we propose Beam Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (BGRPO), a rank-aware reinforcement learning method suitable for hard algebraic problems. Finetuning with BGRPO improves accuracy while reducing beam width by up to half, resulting in approximately 75% lower inference compute. Additionally, our model demonstrates competitive performance in polynomial simplification, outperforming Mathematica in various cases.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present Waver, a high-performance foundation model for unified image and video generation. Waver can directly generate videos with durations ranging from 5 to 10 seconds at a native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V), image-to-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within a single, integrated framework. We introduce a Hybrid Stream DiT architecture to enhance modality alignment and accelerate training convergence. To ensure training data quality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building on these contributions, Waver excels at capturing complex motion, achieving superior motion amplitude and temporal consistency in video synthesis. Notably, it ranks among the Top 3 on both the T2V and I2V leaderboards at Artificial Analysis (data as of 2025-07-30 10:00 GMT+8), consistently outperforming existing open-source models and matching or surpassing state-of-the-art commercial solutions. We hope this technical report will help the community more efficiently train high-quality video generation models and accelerate progress in video generation technologies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Tool calling has emerged as a critical capability for AI agents to interact with the real world and solve complex tasks. While the Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a powerful standardized framework for tool integration, there is a significant gap in benchmarking how well AI agents can effectively solve multi-step tasks using diverse MCP tools in realistic, dynamic scenarios. In this work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated real-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review, that require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file operations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis. Moreover, we introduce a novel evaluation approach that leverages ground-truth execution plans rather than raw API outputs, better reflecting the evolving nature of real-world environments. Experiments show that even frontier LLMs achieve a success rate below 60\%, highlighting major challenges in tool orchestration. Detailed ablations and error analysis further reveal distinct failure modes and inefficiencies in token usage, pointing to concrete directions for advancing current models. LiveMCP-101 sets a rigorous standard for evaluating real-world agent capabilities, advancing toward autonomous AI systems that reliably execute complex tasks through tool use.

To explore this, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of hidden representations in 11 autoregressive models across 6 scientific topics. We find that high-level semantic information consistently resides in low-dimensional subspaces that form linearly separable representations across domains. This separability becomes more pronounced in deeper layers and under prompts that elicit structured reasoning or alignment behavior$\unicode{x2013}$even when surface content remains unchanged. These findings support geometry-aware tools that operate directly in latent space to detect and mitigate harmful or adversarial content. As a proof of concept, we train an MLP probe on final-layer hidden states to act as a lightweight latent-space guardrail. This approach substantially improves refusal rates on malicious queries and prompt injections that bypass both the model's built-in safety alignment and external token-level filters.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We study evaluation of AI systems without ground truth by exploiting a link between strategic gaming and information loss. We analyze which information-theoretic mechanisms resist adversarial manipulation, extending finite-sample bounds to show that bounded f-divergences (e.g., total variation distance) maintain polynomial guarantees under attacks while unbounded measures (e.g., KL divergence) degrade exponentially. To implement these mechanisms, we model the overseer as an agent and characterize incentive-compatible scoring rules as f-mutual information objectives. Under adversarial attacks, TVD-MI maintains effectiveness (area under curve 0.70-0.77) while traditional judge queries are near change (AUC $\approx$ 0.50), demonstrating that querying the same LLM for information relationships rather than quality judgments provides both theoretical and practical robustness. The mechanisms decompose pairwise evaluations into reliable item-level quality scores without ground truth, addressing a key limitation of traditional peer prediction. We release preregistration and code.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning tasks through methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often fall short in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) has emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning process. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning ability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the model's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We introduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse reasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various domains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost (PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning efficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models consistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and non-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as evidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more streamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of TIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Metabolomics is the study of small molecules in biological samples. Metabolomics data are typically high-dimensional and contain highly correlated variables and frequent missing values. Both missing at random (MAR) data, due to acquisition or processing errors, and missing not at random (MNAR) data, caused by values falling below detection thresholds, are common. Thus, imputation is a critical component of downstream analysis. Existing imputation methods generally assume one type of data missingness mechanism, or impute values outside the data's physical constraints. A novel truncated Gaussian infinite factor analysis (TGIFA) model is proposed to perform statistically principled and physically realistic imputation in metabolomics data. By incorporating truncated Gaussian assumptions, TGIFA respects the data's physical constraints, while leveraging an infinite latent factor framework to capture high-dimensional dependencies without pre-specifying the number of latent factors. Our Bayesian inference approach enables uncertainty quantification in both the values of the imputed data, and the missing data mechanism. A computationally efficient exchange algorithm enables scalable posterior inference via Markov Chain Monte Carlo. We validate TGIFA through a comprehensive simulation study and demonstrate its utility in a motivating urinary metabolomics dataset, where it yields useful imputations, with associated uncertainty quantification. Open-source R code, available at https://github.com/kfinucane/TGIFA, accompanies TGIFA.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help, but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure, and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from large-scale data through RL.   Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reconfigurable photonics have rapidly become an invaluable tool for information processing. Light-based computing accelerators are promising for boosting neural network learning and inference and optical interconnects are foreseen as a solution to the information transfer bottleneck in high-performance computing. In this study, we demonstrate the successful programming of a transformation implemented using a reconfigurable photonic circuit with a non-conventional architecture. The core of most photonic processors is an MZI-based architecture that establishes an analytical connection between the controllable parameters and circuit transformation. However, several architectures that are substantially more difficult to program have improved robustness to fabrication defects. We use two algorithms that rely on different initial datasets to reconstruct the circuit model of a complex interferometer, and then program the required unitary transformation. Both methods performed accurate circuit programming with an average fidelity above 98\%. Our results provide a strong foundation for the introduction of non-conventional interferometric architectures for photonic information processing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The transformative power of AI is undeniable - but as user adoption accelerates, so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental impact of AI serving. However, no studies have measured AI serving environmental metrics in a production environment. This paper addresses this gap by proposing and executing a comprehensive methodology for measuring the energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads in a large-scale, AI production environment. Our approach accounts for the full stack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power, host system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead. Through detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the Gemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24 Wh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also show that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement have driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon footprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify that the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine seconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of water (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily activities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to warrant important attention. Towards this objective, we propose that a comprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for accurately comparing models, and to properly incentivize efficiency gains across the full AI serving stack.

This multidimensionality, however, comes with a larger parameter space to estimate. Therefore, via a dimension reduction method, Sliced Inverse Regression, we aim to reduce high-dimensional parameter space to a reduced feature space and aim to estimate the parameters on this new featured space rather than using full data structure to lower computational costs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current literature suggests that alignment faking (deceptive alignment) is an emergent property of large language models. We present the first empirical evidence that a small instruction-tuned model, specifically LLaMA 3 8B, can exhibit alignment faking. We further show that prompt-only interventions, including deontological moral framing and scratchpad reasoning, significantly reduce this behavior without modifying model internals. This challenges the assumption that prompt-based ethics are trivial and that deceptive alignment requires scale. We introduce a taxonomy distinguishing shallow deception, shaped by context and suppressible through prompting, from deep deception, which reflects persistent, goal-driven misalignment. Our findings refine the understanding of deception in language models and underscore the need for alignment evaluations across model sizes and deployment settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Extracting meaning from uncertain, noisy data is a fundamental problem across time series analysis, pattern recognition, and language modeling. This survey presents a unified mathematical framework that connects classical estimation theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, including deep learning and large language models. By analyzing how techniques such as maximum likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms address uncertainty, the paper illustrates that many AI methods are rooted in shared probabilistic principles. Through illustrative scenarios including system identification, image classification, and language generation, we show how increasingly complex models build upon these foundations to tackle practical challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability. In other words, the work demonstrates that maximum likelihood, MAP estimation, Bayesian classification, and deep learning all represent different facets of a shared goal: inferring hidden causes from noisy and/or biased observations. It serves as both a theoretical synthesis and a practical guide for students and researchers navigating the evolving landscape of machine learning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Communication-efficient distributed training algorithms have received considerable interest recently due to their benefits for training Large Language Models (LLMs) in bandwidth-constrained settings, such as across data centers and over the internet. Despite reducing communication frequency, these methods still typically require communicating a full copy of the model's gradients-resulting in a communication bottleneck even for cross-datacenter links. Furthermore, they can slightly degrade performance compared to a naive AdamW DDP baseline. While quantization and error feedback are often applied to reduce the pseudo-gradient's size, in the context of LLM pre-training, existing approaches have been unable to additionally leverage sparsification and have obtained limited quantization. In this work, we introduce SparseLoCo, a communication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that effectively leverages Top-k sparsification and quantization to reach extreme compression ratios of up to 1-3% sparsity and 2-bit quantization while outperforming full-precision DiLoCo. Our key observations are that outer momentum can be locally approximated by an error feedback combined with aggressive sparsity and that sparse aggregation can actually improve model performance. We empirically demonstrate in a range of communication-constrained LLM training settings that SparseLoCo provides significant benefits in both performance and communication cost.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Code generation has attracted increasing attention with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs). Many studies have developed powerful code LLMs by synthesizing code-related instruction data and applying supervised fine-tuning. However, these methods are limited by teacher model distillation and ignore the potential of iterative refinement by self-generated code. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Critique Refinement (ACR), which enables the model to refine itself by self-generated code and external critique, rather than directly imitating the code responses of the teacher model. Concretely, ACR includes a composite scoring system with LLM-as-a-Judge to evaluate the quality of code responses and a selective critique strategy with LLM-as-a-Critic to critique self-generated low-quality code responses. We develop the RefineCoder series by iteratively applying ACR, achieving continuous performance improvement on multiple code generation benchmarks. Compared to the baselines of the same size, our proposed RefineCoder series can achieve comparable or even superior performance using less data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current audio-visual (AV) benchmarks focus on final answer accuracy, overlooking the underlying reasoning process. This makes it difficult to distinguish genuine comprehension from correct answers derived through flawed reasoning or hallucinations. To address this, we introduce AURA (Audio-visual Understanding and Reasoning Assessment), a benchmark for evaluating the cross-modal reasoning capabilities of Audio-Visual Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and Omni-modal Language Models (OLMs). AURA includes questions across six challenging cognitive domains, such as causality, timbre and pitch, tempo and AV synchronization, unanswerability, implicit distractions, and skill profiling, explicitly designed to be unanswerable from a single modality. This forces models to construct a valid logical path grounded in both audio and video, setting AURA apart from AV datasets that allow uni-modal shortcuts. To assess reasoning traces, we propose a novel metric, AuraScore, which addresses the lack of robust tools for evaluating reasoning fidelity. It decomposes reasoning into two aspects: (i) Factual Consistency - whether reasoning is grounded in perceptual evidence, and (ii) Core Inference - the logical validity of each reasoning step. Evaluations of SOTA models on AURA reveal a critical reasoning gap: although models achieve high accuracy (up to 92% on some tasks), their Factual Consistency and Core Inference scores fall below 45%. This discrepancy highlights that models often arrive at correct answers through flawed logic, underscoring the need for our benchmark and paving the way for more robust multimodal evaluation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in educational, clinical, and professional settings, but their tendency for sycophancy -- prioritizing user agreement over independent reasoning -- poses risks to reliability. This study introduces a framework to evaluate sycophantic behavior in ChatGPT-4o, Claude-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-Pro across AMPS (mathematics) and MedQuad (medical advice) datasets. Sycophantic behavior was observed in 58.19% of cases, with Gemini exhibiting the highest rate (62.47%) and ChatGPT the lowest (56.71%). Progressive sycophancy, leading to correct answers, occurred in 43.52% of cases, while regressive sycophancy, leading to incorrect answers, was observed in 14.66%. Preemptive rebuttals demonstrated significantly higher sycophancy rates than in-context rebuttals (61.75% vs. 56.52%, $Z=5.87$, $p<0.001$), particularly in computational tasks, where regressive sycophancy increased significantly (preemptive: 8.13%, in-context: 3.54%, $p<0.001$). Simple rebuttals maximized progressive sycophancy ($Z=6.59$, $p<0.001$), while citation-based rebuttals exhibited the highest regressive rates ($Z=6.59$, $p<0.001$). Sycophantic behavior showed high persistence (78.5%, 95% CI: [77.2%, 79.8%]) regardless of context or model. These findings emphasize the risks and opportunities of deploying LLMs in structured and dynamic domains, offering insights into prompt programming and model optimization for safer AI applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Finite State Machines (FSMs) play a critical role in implementing control logic for Systems-on-Chip (SoC). Traditionally, FSMs are implemented by hardware engineers through Verilog coding, which is often tedious and time-consuming. Recently, with the remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation, LLMs have been increasingly explored for automating Verilog code generation. However, LLM-generated Verilog code often suffers from security vulnerabilities, which is particularly concerning for security-sensitive FSM implementations. To address this issue, we propose SecFSM, a novel method that leverages a security-oriented knowledge graph to guide LLMs in generating more secure Verilog code. Specifically, we first construct a FSM Security Knowledge Graph (FSKG) as an external aid to LLMs. Subsequently, we analyze users' requirements to identify vulnerabilities and get a list of vulnerabilities in the requirements. Then, we retrieve knowledge from FSKG based on the vulnerabilities list. Finally, we construct security prompts based on the security knowledge for Verilog code generation. To evaluate SecFSM, we build a dedicated dataset collected from academic datasets, artificial datasets, papers, and industrial cases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SecFSM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. In particular, on a benchmark of 25 security test cases evaluated by DeepSeek-R1, SecFSM achieves an outstanding pass rate of 21/25.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Language model alignment is a critical step in training modern generative language models. Alignment targets to improve win rate of a sample from the aligned model against the base model. Today, we are increasingly using inference-time algorithms (e.g., Best-of-N, controlled decoding, tree search) to decode from language models rather than standard sampling. We show that this train/test mismatch makes standard RLHF framework sub-optimal in view of such inference-time methods. To this end, we propose a framework for inference-aware alignment (InfAlign), which aims to optimize inference-time win rate of the aligned policy against the base model. We prove that for any inference-time decoding procedure, the optimal aligned policy is the solution to the standard RLHF problem with a transformation of the reward. This motivates us to provide the calibrate-and-transform RL (InfAlign-CTRL) algorithm to solve this problem, which involves a reward calibration step and a KL-regularized reward maximization step with a transformation of the calibrated reward. For best-of-N sampling and best-of-N jailbreaking, we propose specific transformations offering up to 3-8% improvement on inference-time win rates. Finally, we also show that our proposed reward calibration method is a strong baseline for optimizing standard win rate.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Unit tests (UTs) play an instrumental role in assessing code correctness as well as providing feedback to large language models (LLMs), motivating automated test generation. However, we uncover a trade-off between generating unit test inputs that reveal errors when given a faulty code and correctly predicting the unit test output without access to the gold solution. To address this trade-off, we propose UTGen, which teaches LLMs to generate unit test inputs that reveal errors along with their correct expected outputs based on task descriptions. Since model-generated tests can provide noisy signals (e.g., from incorrectly predicted outputs), we propose UTDebug that (i) scales UTGen via test-time compute to improve UT output prediction, and (ii) validates and backtracks edits based on multiple generated UTs to avoid overfitting, and helps LLMs debug effectively. We show that UTGen outperforms other LLM-based baselines by 7.59% based on a metric measuring the presence of both error-revealing UT inputs and correct UT outputs. When used with UTDebug, we find that feedback from UTGen's unit tests improves pass@1 accuracy of Qwen2.5 32B on HumanEvalFix and our own harder debugging split of MBPP+ by over 3.17% and 12.35% (respectively) over other LLM-based UT generation baselines. Moreover, we observe that feedback from Qwen2.5 32B-based UTGen model can enhance debugging with frontier LLMs like GPT-4o by 13.8%. Lastly, we demonstrate that UTGen is a better judge for code correctness, outperforming a state-of-the-art trained 8B reward model by 4.43% on HumanEval+ with best-of-10 sampling using Qwen2.5 7B.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The existence of axion-like particles (ALPs) can be probed from their signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) due to the photon-ALP resonant conversion over the mass range of ALPs that matches with the effective mass of photons in the plasma in the astrophysical systems. Such a conversion can also occur in the Milky Way halo and disk and can cause a unique spatial and spectral distortion. The signal is highly non-Gaussian and cannot be measured precisely by the usual power-spectrum approach. We devise a new technique to search for this signal from the upcoming full-sky CMB experiment LiteBIRD using its multi-frequency band using a template-based spatial profile of the ALP distortion signal. This technique captures the large-scale non-Gaussian aspects of the ALP distortion signal in terms of a spatial template and makes it possible to search for any non-zero ALP signal. We show that the inference of the ALP coupling using the template-based technique from LiteBIRD can provide constraints on the coupling constant approximately $ g_{a\gamma} < 6.5 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ for ALP masses below $10^{-14}$ eV at 95\% confidence interval which is an order of magnitude better than the current bounds from CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) at $g_{a\gamma} < 6.6 \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$, This shows the capability of future multi-band CMB experiment LiteBIRD in opening the discovery space towards physics beyond the standard model.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cell detection, segmentation and classification are essential for analyzing tumor microenvironments (TME) on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides. Existing methods suffer from poor performance on understudied cell types (rare or not present in public datasets) and limited cross-domain generalization. To address these shortcomings, we introduce HistoPLUS, a state-of-the-art model for cell analysis, trained on a novel curated pan-cancer dataset of 108,722 nuclei covering 13 cell types. In external validation across 4 independent cohorts, HistoPLUS outperforms current state-of-the-art models in detection quality by 5.2% and overall F1 classification score by 23.7%, while using 5x fewer parameters. Notably, HistoPLUS unlocks the study of 7 understudied cell types and brings significant improvements on 8 of 13 cell types. Moreover, we show that HistoPLUS robustly transfers to two oncology indications unseen during training. To support broader TME biomarker research, we release the model weights and inference code at https://github.com/owkin/histoplus/.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present NiceWebRL, a research tool that enables researchers to use machine reinforcement learning (RL) environments for online human subject experiments. NiceWebRL is a Python library that allows any Jax-based environment to be transformed into an online interface, supporting both single-agent and multi-agent environments. As such, NiceWebRL enables AI researchers to compare their algorithms to human performance, cognitive scientists to test ML algorithms as theories for human cognition, and multi-agent researchers to develop algorithms for human-AI collaboration. We showcase NiceWebRL with 3 case studies that demonstrate its potential to help develop Human-like AI, Human-compatible AI, and Human-assistive AI. In the first case study (Human-like AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a novel RL model of cognition. Here, NiceWebRL facilitates testing this model against human participants in both a grid world and Craftax, a 2D Minecraft domain. In our second case study (Human-compatible AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a novel multi-agent RL algorithm that can generalize to human partners in the Overcooked domain. Finally, in our third case study (Human-assistive AI), we show how NiceWebRL can allow researchers to study how an LLM can assist humans on complex tasks in XLand-Minigrid, an environment with millions of hierarchical tasks. The library is available at https://github.com/KempnerInstitute/nicewebrl.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs' pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks, including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Timely detection of hardware vulnerabilities during the early design stage is critical for reducing remediation costs. Existing early detection techniques often require specialized security expertise, limiting their usability. Recent efforts have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for Verilog vulnerability detection. However, LLMs struggle to capture the structure in Verilog code, resulting in inconsistent detection results. To this end, we propose VerilogLAVD, the first LLM-aided graph traversal rule generation approach for Verilog vulnerability detection. Our approach introduces the Verilog Property Graph (VeriPG), a unified representation of Verilog code. It combines syntactic features extracted from the abstract syntax tree (AST) with semantic information derived from control flow and data dependency graphs. We leverage LLMs to generate VeriPG-based detection rules from Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) descriptions. These rules guide the rule executor that traversal VeriPG for potential vulnerabilities. To evaluate VerilogLAVD, we build a dataset collected from open-source repositories and synthesized data. In our empirical evaluation on 77 Verilog designs encompassing 12 CWE types, VerilogLAVD achieves an F1-score of 0.54. Compared to the LLM-only and LLM with external knowledge baselines, VerilogLAVD improves F1-score by 0.31 and 0.27, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We develop the theory of continuous and algebraic domains in constructive and predicative univalent foundations, building upon our earlier work on basic domain theory in this setting. That we work predicatively means that we do not assume Voevodsky's propositional resizing axioms. Our work is constructive in the sense that we do not rely on excluded middle or the axiom of (countable) choice. To deal with size issues and give a predicatively suitable definition of continuity of a dcpo, we follow Johnstone and Joyal's work on continuous categories. Adhering to the univalent perspective, we explicitly distinguish between data and property. To ensure that being continuous is a property of a dcpo, we turn to the propositional truncation, although we explain that some care is needed to avoid needing the axiom of choice. We also adapt the notion of a domain-theoretic basis to the predicative setting by imposing suitable smallness conditions, analogous to the categorical concept of an accessible category. All our running examples of continuous dcpos are then actually examples of dcpos with small bases which we show to be well behaved predicatively. In particular, such dcpos are exactly those presented by small ideals. As an application of the theory, we show that Scott's $D_\infty$ model of the untyped $\lambda$-calculus is an example of an algebraic dcpo with a small basis. Our work is formalised in the Agda proof assistant and its ability to infer universe levels has been invaluable for our purposes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Randomized experiments are the gold standard for estimating the average treatment effect (ATE). While covariate adjustment can reduce the asymptotic variances of the unbiased Horvitz-Thompson estimators for the ATE, it suffers from finite-sample biases due to data reuse in both prediction and estimation. Traditional sample-splitting and cross-fitting methods can address the problem of data reuse and obtain unbiased estimators. However, they require that the data are independently and identically distributed, which is usually violated under the design-based inference framework for randomized experiments. To address this challenge, we propose a novel conditional cross-fitting method, under the design-based inference framework, where potential outcomes and covariates are fixed and the randomization is the sole source of randomness. We propose sample-splitting algorithms for various randomized experiments, including Bernoulli randomized experiments, completely randomized experiments, and stratified randomized experiments. Based on the proposed algorithms, we construct unbiased covariate-adjusted ATE estimators and propose valid inference procedures. Our methods can accommodate flexible machine-learning-assisted covariate adjustments and allow for model misspecification.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Naomi is a spatial evidence synthesis model used to produce district-level HIV epidemic indicators in sub-Saharan Africa. Multiple outcomes of policy interest, including HIV prevalence, HIV incidence, and antiretroviral therapy treatment coverage are jointly modelled using both household survey data and routinely reported health system data. The model is provided as a tool for countries to input their data to and generate estimates with during a yearly process supported by UNAIDS. Previously, inference has been conducted using empirical Bayes and a Gaussian approximation, implemented via the TMB R package. We propose a new inference method based on an extension of adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature to deal with more than 20 hyperparameters. Using data from Malawi, our method improves the accuracy of inferences for model parameters, while being substantially faster to run than Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with the No-U-Turn sampler. Our implementation leverages the existing TMB C++ template for the model's log-posterior, and is compatible with any model with such a template.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as proxies for human labelers in both training (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback) and large-scale response evaluation (LLM-as-a-judge). Alignment and evaluation are critical components in the development of reliable LLMs, and the choice of feedback protocol plays a central role in both but remains understudied. In this work, we show that the choice of feedback protocol for evaluation (absolute scores versus relative preferences) can significantly affect evaluation reliability and induce systematic biases. In the context of LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, we show that pairwise protocols are more vulnerable to distracted evaluation. Generator models can exploit spurious attributes (or distractor features) favored by the LLM judge, resulting in inflated scores for lower-quality outputs. We find that absolute scoring is more robust to such manipulation, producing judgments that better reflect response quality and are less influenced by distractor features. Our results demonstrate that generator models can flip preferences by embedding distractor features, skewing LLM-as-a-judge comparisons and leading to inaccurate conclusions about model quality in benchmark evaluations. Pairwise preferences flip in about 35% of the cases, compared to only 9% for absolute scores. We offer recommendations for choosing feedback protocols based on dataset characteristics and evaluation objectives.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Coastal pollution is a pressing global environmental issue, necessitating scalable and automated solutions for monitoring and management. This study investigates the efficacy of the Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT-DETR), a state-of-the-art, end-to-end object detection model, for the automated detection and counting of beach litter. A rigorous comparative analysis is conducted between two model variants, RT-DETR-Large (RT-DETR-L) and RT-DETR-Extra-Large (RT-DETR-X), trained on a publicly available dataset of coastal debris. The evaluation reveals that the RT-DETR-X model achieves marginally superior accuracy, with a mean Average Precision at 50\% IoU (mAP@50) of 0.816 and a mAP@50-95 of 0.612, compared to the RT-DETR-L model's 0.810 and 0.606, respectively. However, this minor performance gain is realized at a significant computational cost; the RT-DETR-L model demonstrates a substantially faster inference time of 20.1 ms versus 34.5 ms for the RT-DETR-X. The findings suggest that the RT-DETR-L model offers a more practical and efficient solution for real-time, in-field deployment due to its superior balance of processing speed and detection accuracy. This research provides valuable insights into the application of advanced Transformer-based detectors for environmental conservation, highlighting the critical trade-offs between model complexity and operational viability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurate dose-response forecasting under sparse sampling is central to precision pharmacotherapy. We present the Amortized In-Context Mixed-Effect Transformer (AICMET) model, a transformer-based latent-variable framework that unifies mechanistic compartmental priors with amortized in-context Bayesian inference. AICMET is pre-trained on hundreds of thousands of synthetic pharmacokinetic trajectories with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck priors over the parameters of compartment models, endowing the model with strong inductive biases and enabling zero-shot adaptation to new compounds. At inference time, the decoder conditions on the collective context of previously profiled trial participants, generating calibrated posterior predictions for newly enrolled patients after a few early drug concentration measurements. This capability collapses traditional model-development cycles from weeks to hours while preserving some degree of expert modelling. Experiments across public datasets show that AICMET attains state-of-the-art predictive accuracy and faithfully quantifies inter-patient variability -- outperforming both nonlinear mixed-effects baselines and recent neural ODE variants. Our results highlight the feasibility of transformer-based, population-aware neural architectures as offering a new alternative for bespoke pharmacokinetic modeling pipelines, charting a path toward truly population-aware personalized dosing regimens.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols. To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions: information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection frameworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the necessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and models at: https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Subgiants and early red giants are crucial for studying the first dredge-up, a key evolutionary phase where the convective envelope deepens, mixing previously interior-processed material and bringing it to the surface. Yet, very few have been seismically characterized with Kepler because their oscillation frequencies are close to the 30 minute sampling frequency of the mission. We developed a new method as part of the new PyA2Z code to identify super-Nyquist oscillators and infer their global seismic parameters, $\nu_\mathrm{max}$ and large separation, $\Delta\nu$. Applying PyA2Z to 2 065 Kepler targets, we seismically characterize 285 super-Nyquist and 168 close-to-Nyquist stars with masses from 0.8 to 1.6 M$_\odot$. In combination with APOGEE spectroscopy, Gaia spectro-photometry, and stellar models, we derive stellar ages for the sample. There is good agreement between the predicted and actual positions of stars on the HR diagram (luminosity vs. effective temperature) as a function of mass and composition. While the timing of dredge-up is consistent with predictions, the magnitude and mass dependence show discrepancies with models, possibly due to uncertainties in model physics or calibration issues in observed abundance scales.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Tool selection is a key component of LLM agents. A popular approach follows a two-step process - \emph{retrieval} and \emph{selection} - to pick the most appropriate tool from a tool library for a given task. In this work, we introduce \textit{ToolHijacker}, a novel prompt injection attack targeting tool selection in no-box scenarios. ToolHijacker injects a malicious tool document into the tool library to manipulate the LLM agent's tool selection process, compelling it to consistently choose the attacker's malicious tool for an attacker-chosen target task. Specifically, we formulate the crafting of such tool documents as an optimization problem and propose a two-phase optimization strategy to solve it. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that ToolHijacker is highly effective, significantly outperforming existing manual-based and automated prompt injection attacks when applied to tool selection. Moreover, we explore various defenses, including prevention-based defenses (StruQ and SecAlign) and detection-based defenses (known-answer detection, DataSentinel, perplexity detection, and perplexity windowed detection). Our experimental results indicate that these defenses are insufficient, highlighting the urgent need for developing new defense strategies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving systems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego vehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have achieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and HD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable computational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a knowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models with prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student model. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal knowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS) paradigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with SD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with prior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge transfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally, we introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D Patch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves the student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously accelerating inference speed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large-language models (LLMs) and agentic systems present exciting opportunities to accelerate drug discovery. In this study, we examine the modularity of LLM-based agentic systems for drug discovery, i.e., whether parts of the system such as the LLM and type of agent are interchangeable, a topic that has received limited attention in drug discovery. We compare the performance of different LLMs and the effectiveness of tool-calling agents versus code-generating agents. Our case study, comparing performance in orchestrating tools for chemistry and drug discovery using an LLM-as-a-judge score, shows that Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4o outperform alternative language models such as Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.1-70B, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and Nova-Micro. Although we confirm that code-generating agents outperform the tool-calling ones on average, we show that this is highly question- and model-dependent. Furthermore, the impact of replacing system prompts is dependent on the question and model, underscoring that even in this particular domain one cannot just replace components of the system without re-engineering. Our study highlights the necessity of further research into the modularity of agentic systems to enable the development of reliable and modular solutions for real-world problems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment. Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances explainability in MARL systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content generation. In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks. By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity, and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language experience and the association between children's production and their input. In both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\%, potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As power consumption from AI training and inference continues to increase, AI accelerators are being integrated directly into the CPU. Intel's Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX) is one such example, debuting on the 4th generation Intel Xeon Scalable CPU. We discover a timing side and covert channel, GATEBLEED, caused by the aggressive power gating utilized to keep the CPU within operating limits. We show that the GATEBLEED side channel is a threat to AI privacy as many ML models such as transformers and CNNs make critical computationally-heavy decisions based on private values like confidence thresholds and routing logits. Timing delays from selective powering down of AMX components mean that each matrix multiplication is a potential leakage point when executed on the AMX accelerator. Our research identifies over a dozen potential gadgets across popular ML libraries (HuggingFace, PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.), revealing that they can leak sensitive and private information. GATEBLEED poses a risk for local and remote timing inference, even under previous protective measures. GATEBLEED can be used as a high performance, stealthy remote covert channel and a generic magnifier for timing transmission channels, capable of bypassing traditional cache defenses to leak arbitrary memory addresses and evading state of the art microarchitectural attack detectors under realistic network conditions and system configurations in which previous attacks fail. We implement an end-to-end microarchitectural inference attack on a transformer model optimized with Intel AMX, achieving a membership inference accuracy of 81% and a precision of 0.89. In a CNN-based or transformer-based mixture-of-experts model optimized with Intel AMX, we leak expert choice with 100% accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first side-channel attack on AI privacy that exploits hardware optimizations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> More than 30 Galactic double neutron star (DNS) binaries have now been identified through radio pulsar timing. The 24 DNSs in the Galactic field with measured total masses lie in the narrow range of 2.3--2.9 $M_{\odot}$. In contrast, gravitational-wave observations have detected two DNS mergers: GW170817, with a total mass of 2.7 $M_{\odot}$, and GW190425, with a significantly higher mass of 3.4 $M_{\odot}$. The unusually high mass of GW190425 suggests a non-standard formation channel not represented in the known Galactic population. To investigate the origin of such a massive DNS system, we model the late evolutionary stages of helium stars with initial masses between 2.5 and 9.8 $M_{\odot}$ in binaries with 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ neutron star companions, using the 1D stellar evolution code MESA at solar metallicity. We test alternative formation pathways and calibrate our models to reproduce the observed Galactic DNS mass and orbital distributions. By incorporating a modified natal kick prescription, our population synthesis results are broadly consistent with the observed total mass distribution of known DNS systems. Only a small fraction of DNSs of our model have total masses $\geq$ 3 $M_{\odot}$, insufficient to explain the high rate of massive DNS mergers inferred from GW observations. However, our model rules out the formation of heavy DNS systems like GW190425 via the second unstable mass transfer.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) excel in text generation; however, these creative elements require heavy computation and are accompanied by a steep cost. Especially for targeted applications such as sales and marketing outreach, these costs are far from feasible. This paper introduces the concept of "Trained Miniatures" - Small Language Models(SLMs) fine-tuned for specific, high-value applications, generating similar domain-specific responses for a fraction of the cost.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents the Annif system in SemEval-2025 Task 5 (LLMs4Subjects), which focussed on subject indexing using large language models (LLMs). The task required creating subject predictions for bibliographic records from the bilingual TIBKAT database using the GND subject vocabulary. Our approach combines traditional natural language processing and machine learning techniques implemented in the Annif toolkit with innovative LLM-based methods for translation and synthetic data generation, and merging predictions from monolingual models. The system ranked first in the all-subjects category and second in the tib-core-subjects category in the quantitative evaluation, and fourth in qualitative evaluations. These findings demonstrate the potential of combining traditional XMTC algorithms with modern LLM techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of subject indexing in multilingual contexts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces Agentics, a modular framework for building agent-based systems capable of structured reasoning and compositional generalization over complex data. Designed with research and practical applications in mind, Agentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In this framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used internally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics encourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting prompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by LLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when types are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the applicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without sacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at \texttt{https://github.com/IBM/agentics}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mobile application marketplaces are responsible for vetting apps to identify and mitigate security risks. Current vetting processes are labor-intensive, relying on manual analysis by security professionals aided by semi-automated tools. To address this inefficiency, we propose Mars, a system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated risk identification and profiling. Mars is designed to concurrently analyze multiple applications across diverse risk categories with minimal human intervention. To enhance analytical precision and operational efficiency, Mars leverages a pre-constructed risk identification tree to extract relevant indicators from high-dimensional application features. This initial step filters the data, reducing the input volume for the LLM and mitigating the potential for model hallucination induced by irrelevant features. The extracted indicators are then subjected to LLM analysis for final risk determination. Furthermore, Mars automatically generates a comprehensive evidence chain for each assessment, documenting the analytical process to provide transparent justification. These chains are designed to facilitate subsequent manual review and to inform enforcement decisions, such as application delisting. The performance of Mars was evaluated on a real-world dataset from a partner Android marketplace. The results demonstrate that Mars attained an F1-score of 0.838 in risk identification and an F1-score of 0.934 in evidence retrieval. To assess its practical applicability, a user study involving 20 expert analysts was conducted, which indicated that Mars yielded a substantial efficiency gain, ranging from 60% to 90%, over conventional manual analysis.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mixed-precision inference techniques reduce the memory and computational demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) by applying hybrid precision formats to model weights, activations, and KV caches. This work introduces mixed-precision LLM inference techniques that encompass (i) systematic memory and compute optimization across hierarchical storage and tensor core architectures, and (ii) comprehensive end-to-end mixed-precision optimization across diverse precision formats and hardware configurations. Our approach features two novel mixed-precision pipelines designed for optimal hardware utilization: a General Matrix Multiply (GEMM) pipeline that optimizes matrix operations through offline weight packing and online acceleration, and an attention pipeline that enables efficient attention computation with arbitrary Query, Key, and Value precision combinations. The key implementation of the pipelines includes (i) hardware-aware weight packing for automatic format optimization, (ii) adaptive head alignment for efficient attention computation, (iii) instruction-level parallelism for memory hierarchy exploitation, and (iv) KV memory loading pipeline for enhanced inference efficiency. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across 16 popular LLMs and 4 representative GPU architectures. Results demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 61% lower serving latency (30% on average) and up to 156% higher throughput (58% on average) in mixed-precision workloads compared to existing mixed-precision frameworks, establishing consistent performance improvements across all tested configurations and hardware types. This work is integrated into TurboMind, a high-performance inference engine of the LMDeploy project, which is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the context of PDE-constrained optimization theory, source identification problems traditionally entail particles emerging from an unknown source distribution inside a domain, moving according to a prescribed stochastic process, e.g.~Brownian motion, and then exiting through the boundary of a compact domain. Given information about the flux of particles through the boundary of the domain, the challenge is to infer as much as possible about the source.   In the PDE setting, it is usually assumed that the flux can be observed without error and at all points on the boundary. Here we consider a different, more statistical presentation of the problem, in which the data has the form of discrete counts of particles arriving at a set of disjoint detectors whose union is a strict subset of the boundary. In keeping with the primacy of the stochastic processes in the generation of the model, we present a stochastic gradient descent algorithm in which exit rates and parameter sensitivities are computed by simulations of particle paths. We present examples for both It\^o diffusion and piecewise-deterministic Markov processes, noting that the form of the sensitivities depends only on the parameterization of the source distribution and is universal among a large class of Markov processes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Traditional standardized network interfaces face significant limitations, including vendor-specific incompatibilities, rigid design assumptions, and lack of adaptability for new functionalities. We propose a multi-agent framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate control interfaces on demand between network functions (NFs). This includes a matching agent, which aligns required control functionalities with NF capabilities, and a code-generation agent, which generates the necessary API server for interface realization. We validate our approach using simulated multi-vendor gNB and WLAN AP environments. The performance evaluations highlight the trade-offs between cost and latency across LLMs for interface generation tasks. Our work sets the foundation for AI-native dynamic control interface generation, paving the way for enhanced interoperability and adaptability in future mobile networks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a statistical inference approach for estimating latent parameters of a physical system when the likelihood is intractable but simulations are available. In practice, SBI is often hindered by model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world observations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI approach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process that combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based distribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting, requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits scalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized SBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a single, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond to the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired samples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the OT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at test time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including complex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the performance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators, while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging, misspecified environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Enabled by large-scale text corpora with huge parameters, pre-trained language models operate as multi-task experts using a single model architecture. However, recent studies have revealed that certain neurons play disproportionately important roles in solving specific tasks, suggesting that task-relevant substructures can be isolated and selectively activated for each task. Therefore, we introduce Decomposition of Experts (DoE), a novel framework that dynamically identifies and activates task-specific experts within a language model to reduce inference cost without sacrificing accuracy. We first define a task expert as a set of parameters that significantly influence the performance of a specific task and propose a four-step unplug-and-play process: (1) receiving a user request, (2) identifying the corresponding task expert, (3) performing inference using the expert-localized model, and (4) restoring the original model and waiting for the next task. Using attribution methods and prompt tuning, DoE isolates task-relevant neurons, minimizing computational overhead while maintaining task performance. We assume a setting where a language model receives user requests from five widely used natural language understanding benchmarks, processing one task at a time. In this setup, we demonstrate that DoE achieves up to a x1.73 inference speed-up with a 65% pruning rate, without compromising accuracy. Comparisons with various task expert localization methods reveal that DoE effectively identifies task experts, while ablation studies validate the importance of its components. Additionally, we analyze the effects of batch size, token count, and layer types on inference speed-up, providing practical insights for adopting DoE. The proposed framework is both practical and scalable, applicable to any transformer-based architecture, offering a robust solution for efficient task-specific inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Background: Familial DNA search relies on statistical methods to infer genetic relationships, often using the likelihood ratio (LR) as the test statistic. This approach involves calculating the probability of observed DNA profiles under various scenarios, traditionally assuming a uniform genetic background for all individuals. However, this assumption is unrealistic in practice due to population substructure, where allele frequencies differ among subpopulations. To address this, modified LR-based approaches have been proposed, including methods such as calculating likelihood ratios using average allele frequencies (LRLAF) or the maximum, minimum, and average likelihood ratios (LRMAX, LRMIN, and LRAVG). Despite these developments, further advancements are needed to improve the testing of genetic relationships in the presence of subpopulation structures. Results: We propose a novel LR-based statistic designed to account for population substructure by incorporating a classification step to address nuisance parameters. Specifically, two DNA profiles with unknown subpopulation origins are simultaneously classified into one group. Following this classification, the likelihood ratio (LRCLASS) is applied. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed LRCLASS statistic, when paired with Naive Bayes classification, exhibits higher statistical power than existing methods for testing full-sibling relationships in the Thai population. Conclusion: The proposed LRCLASS statistic enhances the power of familial DNA searches by effectively addressing population substructure through a novel classification-based approach. This method provides a robust alternative to existing LR-based strategies and underscores the potential for integrating advanced classification techniques into genetic relationship testing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multiple successful compositional symbolic execution (CSE) tools and platforms exploit separation logic (SL) for compositional verification and/or incorrectness separation logic (ISL) for compositional bug-finding, including VeriFast, Viper, Gillian, CN, and Infer-Pulse. Previous work on the Gillian platform, the only CSE platform that is parametric on the memory model, meaning that it can be instantiated to different memory models, suggests that the ability to use custom memory models allows for more flexibility in supporting analysis of a wide range of programming languages, for implementing custom automation, and for improving performance. However, the literature lacks a satisfactory formal foundation for memory-model-parametric CSE platforms.   In this paper, inspired by Gillian, we provide a new formal foundation for memory-model-parametric CSE platforms. Our foundation advances the state of the art in four ways. First, we mechanise our foundation (in the interactive theorem prover Rocq). Second, we validate our foundation by instantiating it to a broad range of memory models, including models for C and CHERI. Third, whereas previous memory-model-parametric work has only covered SL analyses, we cover both SL and ISL analyses. Fourth, our foundation is based on standard definitions of SL and ISL (including definitions of function specification validity, to ensure sound interoperation with other tools and platforms also based on standard definitions).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability. First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts with superior scalability and robustness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning in 3D scenes. Recent work has addressed the 3D situated reasoning task by invoking tool usage through large language models. Large language models call tools via APIs and integrate the generated programs through a chain of thought to solve problems based on the program results. However, due to the simplicity of the questions in the dataset, the generated program reasoning chains are relatively short. To solve this main challenge, in this paper, we introduce DeepThink3D to enhance the tool usage of LLMs in complex 3D situated reasoning tasks. Our work proposes a combinatorial and iterative evolutionary approach on the SQA3D benchmark to generate more complex questions. Building on this foundation, we fine-tune the large language model to make it more proficient in using 3D tools. By employing Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), we directly optimize the toolchain strategies generated by models, thereby enhancing their accuracy in complex tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multilingual translation stands as a challenging task for large language models (LLMs) to handle intricate language patterns and stilted translations that arise in automated translations. In this paper, we introduce Seed-X, a family of open-source LLMs comprising instruct and reasoning models, pushing the limits of translation capability with 7B parameter size. The base model is pre-trained on a diverse, high-quality dataset encompassing both monolingual and bilingual content across 28 languages, harnessing the full potential of multilingual data. The instruct model is then finetuned to translate by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and further enhanced through reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve better generalization across diverse language pairs. Seed-X achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models, including Gemini-2.5 and GPT-4o, across 28 languages, and significantly outperforms larger open-source models in both automatic metrics and human evaluations. We share the best practices through our optimization process, and make the parameter public available for advancing translation research and applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Species Distribution Models (SDMs) play a vital role in biodiversity research, conservation planning, and ecological niche modeling by predicting species distributions based on environmental conditions. The selection of predictors is crucial, strongly impacting both model accuracy and how well the predictions reflect ecological patterns. To ensure meaningful insights, input variables must be carefully chosen to match the study objectives and the ecological requirements of the target species. However, existing SDMs, including both traditional and deep learning-based approaches, often lack key capabilities for variable selection: (i) flexibility to choose relevant predictors at inference without retraining; (ii) robustness to handle missing predictor values without compromising accuracy; and (iii) explainability to interpret and accurately quantify each predictor's contribution. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MaskSDM, a novel deep learning-based SDM that enables flexible predictor selection by employing a masked training strategy. This approach allows the model to make predictions with arbitrary subsets of input variables while remaining robust to missing data. It also provides a clearer understanding of how adding or removing a given predictor affects model performance and predictions. Additionally, MaskSDM leverages Shapley values for precise predictor contribution assessments, improving upon traditional approximations. We evaluate MaskSDM on the global sPlotOpen dataset, modeling the distributions of 12,738 plant species. Our results show that MaskSDM outperforms imputation-based methods and approximates models trained on specific subsets of variables. These findings underscore MaskSDM's potential to increase the applicability and adoption of SDMs, laying the groundwork for developing foundation models in SDMs that can be readily applied to diverse ecological applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the requirement for reliable safety evaluation to uncover model vulnerabilities. To this end, numerous LLM safety evaluation benchmarks are proposed. However, existing benchmarks generally rely on labor-intensive manual curation, which causes excessive time and resource consumption. They also exhibit significant redundancy and limited difficulty. To alleviate these problems, we introduce SafetyFlow, the first agent-flow system designed to automate the construction of LLM safety benchmarks. SafetyFlow can automatically build a comprehensive safety benchmark in only four days without any human intervention by orchestrating seven specialized agents, significantly reducing time and resource cost. Equipped with versatile tools, the agents of SafetyFlow ensure process and cost controllability while integrating human expertise into the automatic pipeline. The final constructed dataset, SafetyFlowBench, contains 23,446 queries with low redundancy and strong discriminative power. Our contribution includes the first fully automated benchmarking pipeline and a comprehensive safety benchmark. We evaluate the safety of 49 advanced LLMs on our dataset and conduct extensive experiments to validate our efficacy and efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present the first large-scale computational study of political delegitimization discourse (PDD), defined as symbolic attacks on the normative validity of political entities. We curate and manually annotate a novel Hebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches (1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which 1,812 instances (17.4\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for intensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for understanding democratic discourse.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Next-generation mobile networks must reconcile the often-conflicting goals of multiple service owners. However, today's network slice controllers remain rigid, policy-bound, and unaware of the business context. We introduce Agoran Service and Resource Broker (SRB), an agentic marketplace that brings stakeholders directly into the operational loop. Inspired by the ancient Greek agora, Agoran distributes authority across three autonomous AI branches: a Legislative branch that answers compliance queries using retrieval-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs); an Executive branch that maintains real-time situational awareness through a watcher-updated vector database; and a Judicial branch that evaluates each agent message with a rule-based Trust Score, while arbitrating LLMs detect malicious behavior and apply real-time incentives to restore trust. Stakeholder-side Negotiation Agents and the SRB-side Mediator Agent negotiate feasible, Pareto-optimal offers produced by a multi-objective optimizer, reaching a consensus intent in a single round, which is then deployed to Open and AI RAN controllers. Deployed on a private 5G testbed and evaluated with realistic traces of vehicle mobility, Agoran achieved significant gains: (i) a 37% increase in throughput of eMBB slices, (ii) a 73% reduction in latency of URLLC slices, and concurrently (iii) an end-to-end 8.3% saving in PRB usage compared to a static baseline. An 1B-parameter Llama model, fine-tuned for five minutes on 100 GPT-4 dialogues, recovers approximately 80% of GPT-4.1's decision quality, while operating within 6 GiB of memory and converging in only 1.3 seconds. These results establish Agoran as a concrete, standards-aligned path toward ultra-flexible, stakeholder-centric 6G networks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Variational Autoencoder is typically understood from the perspective of probabilistic inference. In this work, we propose a new geometric reinterpretation which complements the probabilistic view and enhances its intuitiveness. We demonstrate that the proper construction of semantic manifolds arises primarily from the constraining effect of the KL divergence on the encoder. We view the latent representations as a Gaussian ball rather than deterministic points. Under the constraint of KL divergence, Gaussian ball regularizes the latent space, promoting a more uniform distribution of encodings. Furthermore, we show that reparameterization establishes a critical contractual mechanism between the encoder and decoder, enabling the decoder to learn how to reconstruct from these stochastic regions. We further connect this viewpoint with VQ-VAE, offering a unified perspective: VQ-VAE can be seen as an autoencoder where encodings are constrained to a set of cluster centers, with its generative capability arising from the compactness rather than its stochasticity. This geometric framework provides a new lens for understanding how VAE shapes the latent geometry to enable effective generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> I show how to compute the nonlinear power spectrum across the entire $w(z)$ dynamical dark energy model space. Using synthetic $\Lambda$CDM data, I train a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) to infer the evolution of the nonlinear matter power spectrum as a function of the background expansion and mean matter density across $\sim$$9 {\rm \ Gyr}$ of cosmic evolution. After training, the model generalises to {\it any} dynamical dark energy model parameterised by $w(z)$. With little optimisation, the neural ODE is accurate to within $4\%$ up to k = $5 \ h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Unlike simulation rescaling methods, neural ODEs naturally extend to summary statistics beyond the power spectrum that are sensitive to the growth history.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the prospect of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents, studying their tendency for cooperative behavior becomes an increasingly relevant topic. This study is inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory, where the combined effects of repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry have been argued to be the cause for cooperative tendencies found in humans. We devised a virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. By simulating both internal team dynamics and external competition, we discovered that this blend substantially boosts both overall and initial, one-shot cooperation levels (the tendency to cooperate in one-off interactions). This research provides a novel framework for large language models to strategize and act in complex social scenarios and offers evidence for how intergroup competition can, counter-intuitively, result in more cooperative behavior. These insights are crucial for designing future multi-agent AI systems that can effectively work together and better align with human values.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into software engineering (SE) research and practice, yet their non-determinism, opaque training data, and evolving architectures complicate the reproduction and replication of empirical studies. We present a community effort to scope this space, introducing a taxonomy of LLM-based study types together with eight guidelines for designing and reporting empirical studies involving LLMs. The guidelines present essential (must) criteria as well as desired (should) criteria and target transparency throughout the research process. Our recommendations, contextualized by our study types, are: (1) to declare LLM usage and role; (2) to report model versions, configurations, and fine-tuning; (3) to document tool architectures; (4) to disclose prompts and interaction logs; (5) to use human validation; (6) to employ an open LLM as a baseline; (7) to report suitable baselines, benchmarks, and metrics; and (8) to openly articulate limitations and mitigations. Our goal is to enable reproducibility and replicability despite LLM-specific barriers to open science. We maintain the study types and guidelines online as a living resource for the community to use and shape (llm-guidelines.org).

We also provide strong baselines using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Our dataset consists of manually curated questions and answers grounded in Wikipedia, created by native speakers from Czechia, Slovakia, and Ukraine, with accompanying English translations. It includes both purely textual questions and those requiring visual understanding. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs through prompting and complement this with human judgments of answer correctness. Using these human evaluations, we analyze the reliability of existing automatic evaluation metrics. Our baseline results show that even the best open-weight LLMs achieve only around 50% accuracy on textual questions and below 30% on visual questions. LLM-based evaluation metrics show strong correlation with human judgment, while traditional string-overlap metrics perform surprisingly well due to the prevalence of named entities in answers.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce SRDrone, a novel system designed for self-refinement task planning in industrial-grade embodied drones. SRDrone incorporates two key technical contributions: First, it employs a continuous state evaluation methodology to robustly and accurately determine task outcomes and provide explanatory feedback. This approach supersedes conventional reliance on single-frame final-state assessment for continuous, dynamic drone operations. Second, SRDrone implements a hierarchical Behavior Tree (BT) modification model. This model integrates multi-level BT plan analysis with a constrained strategy space to enable structured reflective learning from experience. Experimental results demonstrate that SRDrone achieves a 44.87% improvement in Success Rate (SR) over baseline methods. Furthermore, real-world deployment utilizing an experience base optimized through iterative self-refinement attains a 96.25% SR. By embedding adaptive task refinement capabilities within an industrial-grade BT planning framework, SRDrone effectively integrates the general reasoning intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the stringent physical execution constraints inherent to embodied drones.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A significant and growing number of published scientific articles is found to involve fraudulent practices, posing a serious threat to the credibility and safety of research in fields such as medicine. We propose Pub-Guard-LLM, the first large language model-based system tailored to fraud detection of biomedical scientific articles. We provide three application modes for deploying Pub-Guard-LLM: vanilla reasoning, retrieval-augmented generation, and multi-agent debate. Each mode allows for textual explanations of predictions. To assess the performance of our system, we introduce an open-source benchmark, PubMed Retraction, comprising over 11K real-world biomedical articles, including metadata and retraction labels. We show that, across all modes, Pub-Guard-LLM consistently surpasses the performance of various baselines and provides more reliable explanations, namely explanations which are deemed more relevant and coherent than those generated by the baselines when evaluated by multiple assessment methods. By enhancing both detection performance and explainability in scientific fraud detection, Pub-Guard-LLM contributes to safeguarding research integrity with a novel, effective, open-source tool.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Code completion is a prominent application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering. Due to the near real-time response requirements of this task, base models with small to medium-sized parameters are typically employed, supplemented by various optimization and post-training techniques. However, these optimization methods often have trade-offs, leading to a seesaw effect where performance improvements on certain datasets or metrics are accompanied by degradations on others -- sometimes even falling below the baseline model's performance. This paper proposes SynthCoder, a model that integrates leading industry practices to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) code completion task. In specific, we first construct a diverse dataset by combining Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node extraction with heuristics that simulate developer behavior. Then we enrich our training corpus with cross-file contextual information using the BM25 algorithm and call graphs, enhancing the model's ability to perform code completion in both file-level and repository-level scenarios. As the last step, we employ a two-stage training process using the Seed-Coder-8B-Base as the base model. First, we fine-tune the model using Curriculum Learning technology. Following this, we perform alignment using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with preference pairs generated through Rejection Sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that our final model excels on mainstream repository-level code completion benchmarks, including aiXcoder, ExecRepoBench, CrossCodeEval, and CoLT. Furthermore, our carefully curated training set effectively mitigates the model's tendency to just repeat existing code, a common issue existing in various code completion models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in reasoning abilities and general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet their performance on Arabic data, characterized by rich morphology, diverse dialects, and complex script, remains underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmarking study of multiple reasoning-focused LLMs, with a special emphasis on the newly introduced DeepSeek models, across a suite of fifteen Arabic NLP tasks. We experiment with various strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning. This allows us to systematically evaluate performance on datasets covering a range of applications to examine their capacity for linguistic reasoning under different levels of complexity. Our experiments reveal several key findings. First, carefully selecting just three in-context examples delivers an average uplift of over 13 F1 points on classification tasks-boosting sentiment analysis from 35.3% to 87.5% and paraphrase detection from 56.1% to 87.0%. Second, reasoning-focused DeepSeek architectures outperform a strong GPT o4-mini baseline by an average of 12 F1 points on complex inference tasks in the zero-shot setting. Third, LoRA-based fine-tuning yields up to an additional 8 points in F1 and BLEU compared to equivalent increases in model scale.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant popularity in recent years. Differentiating between a text written by a human and one generated by an LLM has become almost impossible. Information-hiding techniques such as digital watermarking or steganography can help by embedding information inside text in a form that is unlikely to be noticed. However, existing techniques, such as linguistic-based or format-based methods, change the semantics or cannot be applied to pure, unformatted text. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for information hiding called Innamark, which can conceal any byte-encoded sequence within a sufficiently long cover text. This method is implemented as a multi-platform library using the Kotlin programming language, which is accompanied by a command-line tool and a web interface. By substituting conventional whitespace characters with visually similar Unicode whitespace characters, our proposed scheme preserves the semantics of the cover text without changing the number of characters. Furthermore, we propose a specified structure for secret messages that enables configurable compression, encryption, hashing, and error correction. An experimental benchmark comparison on a dataset of 1 000 000 Wikipedia articles compares ten algorithms. The results demonstrate the robustness of our proposed Innamark method in various applications and the imperceptibility of its watermarks to humans. We discuss the limits to the embedding capacity and robustness of the algorithm and how these could be addressed in future work.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Conformal Prediction (CP) has recently received a tremendous amount of interest, leading to a wide range of new theoretical and methodological results for predictive inference with formal theoretical guarantees. However, the vast majority of CP methods assume that all units in the training data have fully observed data on both the outcome and covariates of primary interest, an assumption that rarely holds in practice. In reality, training data are often missing the outcome, a subset of covariates, or both on some units. In addition, time-to-event outcomes in the training set may be censored due to dropout or administrative end-of-follow-up. Accurately accounting for such coarsened data in the training sample while fulfilling the primary objective of well-calibrated conformal predictive inference, requires robustness and efficiency considerations. In this paper, we consider the general problem of obtaining distribution-free valid prediction regions for an outcome given coarsened training data. Leveraging modern semiparametric theory, we achieve our goal by deriving the efficient influence function of the quantile of the outcome we aim to predict, under a given semiparametric model for the coarsened data, carefully combined with a novel conformal risk control procedure. Our principled use of semiparametric theory has the key advantage of facilitating flexible machine learning methods such as random forests to learn the underlying nuisance functions of the semiparametric model. A straightforward application of the proposed general framework produces prediction intervals with stronger coverage properties under covariate shift, as well as the construction of multiply robust prediction sets in monotone missingness scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce Dream 7B, the most powerful open diffusion large language model to date. Unlike autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially, Dream 7B employs discrete diffusion modeling to refine sequences in parallel through iterative denoising. Our model consistently outperforms existing diffusion language models on general, mathematical, and coding tasks. Dream 7B demonstrates superior planning abilities and inference flexibility, including arbitrary-order generation, infilling capabilities, and tunable quality-speed trade-offs. These results are achieved through simple yet effective training techniques, including AR-based LLM initialization and context-adaptive token-level noise rescheduling. We release both Dream-Base and Dream-Instruct to facilitate further research in diffusion-based language modeling.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts (Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities (e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results (macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling a comparison between identities portrayed in elite discourse and the public's identity priorities. HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in other non-English political contexts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The explosive growth of multimodal data has driven the rapid development of multimodal entity linking (MEL) models. However, existing studies have not systematically investigated the impact of visual adversarial attacks on MEL models. We conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of the robustness of mainstream MEL models under different adversarial attack scenarios, covering two core tasks: Image-to-Text (I2T) and Image+Text-to-Text (IT2T). Experimental results show that current MEL models generally lack sufficient robustness against visual perturbations. Interestingly, contextual semantic information in input can partially mitigate the impact of adversarial perturbations. Based on this insight, we propose an LLM and Retrieval-Augmented Entity Linking (LLM-RetLink), which significantly improves the model's anti-interference ability through a two-stage process: first, extracting initial entity descriptions using large vision models (LVMs), and then dynamically generating candidate descriptive sentences via web-based retrieval. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate that LLM-RetLink improves the accuracy of MEL by 0.4%-35.7%, especially showing significant advantages under adversarial conditions. This research highlights a previously unexplored facet of MEL robustness, constructs and releases the first MEL adversarial example dataset, and sets the stage for future work aimed at strengthening the resilience of multimodal systems in adversarial environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks, purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences. We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language", albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask: (i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM? (ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences? (iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved alignment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly Interaction Networks (INs), have shown exceptional performance for jet tagging at the CERN High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). However, their computational complexity and irregular memory access patterns pose significant challenges for deployment on FPGAs in hardware trigger systems, where strict latency and resource constraints apply. In this work, we propose JEDI-linear, a novel GNN architecture with linear computational complexity that eliminates explicit pairwise interactions by leveraging shared transformations and global aggregation. To further enhance hardware efficiency, we introduce fine-grained quantization-aware training with per-parameter bitwidth optimization and employ multiplier-free multiply-accumulate operations via distributed arithmetic. Evaluation results show that our FPGA-based JEDI-linear achieves 3.7 to 11.5 times lower latency, up to 150 times lower initiation interval, and up to 6.2 times lower LUT usage compared to state-of-the-art designs while also delivering higher model accuracy and eliminating the need for DSP blocks entirely. In contrast, state-of-the-art solutions consume over 8,700 DSPs. This is the first interaction-based GNN to achieve less than 60~ns latency and currently meets the requirements for use in the HL-LHC CMS Level-1 trigger system. This work advances the next-generation trigger systems by enabling accurate, scalable, and resource-efficient GNN inference in real-time environments. Our open-sourced templates will further support reproducibility and broader adoption across scientific applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sexism is generally defined as prejudice and discrimination based on sex or gender, affecting every sector of society, from social institutions to relationships and individual behavior. Social media platforms amplify the impact of sexism by conveying discriminatory content not only through text but also across multiple modalities, highlighting the critical need for a multimodal approach to the analysis of sexism online. With the rise of social media platforms where users share short videos, sexism is increasingly spreading through video content. Automatically detecting sexism in videos is a challenging task, as it requires analyzing the combination of verbal, audio, and visual elements to identify sexist content. In this study, (1) we introduce MuSeD, a new Multimodal Spanish dataset for Sexism Detection consisting of $\approx$ 11 hours of videos extracted from TikTok and BitChute; (2) we propose an innovative annotation framework for analyzing the contributions of textual, vocal, and visual modalities to the classification of content as either sexist or non-sexist; and (3) we evaluate a range of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs on the task of sexism detection. We find that visual information plays a key role in labeling sexist content for both humans and models. Models effectively detect explicit sexism; however, they struggle with implicit cases, such as stereotypes, instances where annotators also show low agreement. This highlights the inherent difficulty of the task, as identifying implicit sexism depends on the social and cultural context.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various domains and tasks, concerns about their safety are becoming increasingly severe. In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge internally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to ensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques, such as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to eliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these methods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric training without completely eradicating its informational traces within the model. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective continuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis Representation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of irreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network layers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving useful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables effective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness while preserving natural performance. Our code is available in https://github.com/ChengcanWu/MRP.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in business applications, particularly in enterprise decision support and strategic planning, yet current approaches often struggle to reconcile intricate operational analyses with overarching strategic goals across diverse market environments, leading to fragmented workflows and reduced collaboration across organizational levels. This paper introduces BusiAgent, a novel multi-agent framework leveraging LLMs for advanced decision-making in complex corporate environments. BusiAgent integrates three core innovations: an extended Continuous Time Markov Decision Process (CTMDP) for dynamic agent modeling, a generalized entropy measure to optimize collaborative efficiency, and a multi-level Stackelberg game to handle hierarchical decision processes. Additionally, contextual Thompson sampling is employed for prompt optimization, supported by a comprehensive quality assurance system to mitigate errors. Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse business scenarios validate BusiAgent's efficacy, demonstrating its capacity to generate coherent, client-focused solutions that smoothly integrate granular insights with high-level strategy, significantly outperforming established approaches in both solution quality and user satisfaction. By fusing cutting-edge AI technologies with deep business insights, BusiAgent marks a substantial step forward in AI-driven enterprise decision-making, empowering organizations to navigate complex business landscapes more effectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Language Model (LM)-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems often generate hallucinated speech that deviates from input text. Existing mitigation strategies either demand excessive training resources or introduce significant inference latency. In this paper, we propose GFlOwNet-guided distribution AlignmenT (GOAT) for LM-based TTS, a post-training framework that mitigates hallucinations without relying on massive resources or inference cost. Specifically, we first conduct an uncertainty analysis, revealing a strong positive correlation between hallucination and model uncertainty. Based on this, we reformulate TTS generation as a trajectory flow optimization problem and introduce an enhanced Subtrajectory Balance objective together with a sharpened internal reward as target distribution. We further integrate reward temperature decay and learning rate optimization for stability and performance balance. Extensive experiments show that GOAT reduce over 50% character error rates on challenging test cases and lowering uncertainty by up to 58%, demonstrating its strong generalization ability and effectiveness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a standard framework for knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, combining large language models (LLMs) with document retrieval from external corpora. Despite its widespread use, most RAG pipelines continue to treat retrieval and reasoning as isolated components, retrieving documents once and then generating answers without further interaction. This static design often limits performance on complex tasks that require iterative evidence gathering or high-precision retrieval. Recent work in both the information retrieval (IR) and NLP communities has begun to close this gap by introducing adaptive retrieval and ranking methods that incorporate feedback. In this survey, we present a structured overview of advanced retrieval and ranking mechanisms that integrate such feedback. We categorize feedback signals based on their source and role in improving the query, retrieved context, or document pool. By consolidating these developments, we aim to bridge IR and NLP perspectives and highlight retrieval as a dynamic, learnable component of end-to-end RAG systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) gives rise to ethical concerns about their performance, while opening new avenues for developing toxic language detection techniques. However, LLMs' unethical output and their capability of detecting toxicity have primarily been tested on language data that do not demand complex meaning inference, such as the biased associations of 'he' with programmer and 'she' with household. Nowadays toxic language adopts a much more creative range of implicit forms, thanks to advanced censorship. In this study, we collect authentic toxic interactions that evade online censorship and that are verified by human annotators as inference-intensive. To evaluate and improve LLMs' reasoning of the authentic implicit toxic language, we propose a new prompting method, Pragmatic Inference Chain (PIC), drawn on interdisciplinary findings from cognitive science and linguistics. The PIC prompting significantly improves the success rate of GPT-4o, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, DeepSeek-v2.5, and DeepSeek-v3 in identifying implicit toxic language, compared to five baseline prompts, such as CoT and rule-based baselines. In addition, it also facilitates the models to produce more explicit and coherent reasoning processes, hence can potentially be generalized to other inference-intensive tasks, e.g., understanding humour and metaphors.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The advancement of large language models (LLMs) is critically dependent on the availability of high-quality datasets for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), alignment tasks like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), etc. In this work, we present a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework that facilitates scalable, configurable, and high-fidelity generation of synthetic data tailored for these training paradigms. Our approach employs a modular and configuration-based pipeline capable of modeling complex dialogue flows with minimal manual intervention. This framework uses a dual-stage quality tagging mechanism, combining heuristic rules and LLM-based evaluations, to automatically filter and score data extracted from OASST-formatted conversations, ensuring the curation of high-quality dialogue samples. The resulting datasets are structured under a flexible schema supporting both SFT and DPO use cases, enabling seamless integration into diverse training workflows. Together, these innovations offer a robust solution for generating and managing synthetic conversational data at scale, significantly reducing the overhead of data preparation in LLM training pipelines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual, and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents. Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual, time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches. Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of 0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4 model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82). YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> AudioSet is a widely used benchmark in the audio research community and has significantly advanced various audio-related tasks. However, persistent issues with label accuracy and completeness remain critical bottlenecks that limit performance in downstream applications.To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a three-stage reannotation framework that harnesses general-purpose audio-language foundation models to systematically improve the label quality of AudioSet. The framework employs a cross-modal prompting strategy, inspired by the concept of prompt chaining, wherein prompts are sequentially composed to execute subtasks (audio comprehension, label synthesis, and semantic alignment). Leveraging this framework, we construct a high-quality, structured relabeled version of AudioSet-R. Extensive experiments conducted on representative audio classification models--including AST, PANNs, SSAST, and AudioMAE--consistently demonstrate substantial performance improvements, thereby validating the generalizability and effectiveness of the proposed approach in enhancing label reliability.The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/colaudiolab/AudioSet-R.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Learning clients embeddings from sequences of their historic communications is central to financial applications. While large language models (LLMs) offer general world knowledge, their direct use on long event sequences is computationally expensive and impractical in real-world pipelines. In this paper, we propose LATTE, a contrastive learning framework that aligns raw event embeddings with semantic embeddings from frozen LLMs. Behavioral features are summarized into short prompts, embedded by the LLM, and used as supervision via contrastive loss. The proposed approach significantly reduces inference cost and input size compared to conventional processing of complete sequence by LLM. We experimentally show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for learning event sequence representations on real-world financial datasets while remaining deployable in latency-sensitive environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for code understanding. However, deploying these PLMs in large-scale applications faces practical challenges due to their computational intensity and inference latency. Knowledge distillation (KD), a promising model compression and acceleration technique, addresses these limitations by transferring knowledge from large teacher models to compact student models, enabling efficient inference while preserving most of the teacher models' capabilities. While this technique has shown remarkable success in natural language processing and computer vision domains, its potential for code understanding tasks remains largely underexplored.   In this paper, we systematically investigate the effectiveness and usage of KD in code understanding tasks. Our study encompasses two popular types of KD methods, i.e., logit-based and feature-based KD methods, experimenting across eight student models and two teacher PLMs from different domains on three downstream tasks. The experimental results indicate that KD consistently offers notable performance boosts across student models with different sizes compared with standard fine-tuning. Notably, code-specific PLM demonstrates better effectiveness as the teacher model. Among all KD methods, the latest feature-based KD methods exhibit superior performance, enabling student models to retain up to 98% teacher performance with merely 5% parameters. Regarding student architecture, our experiments reveal that similarity with teacher architecture does not necessarily lead to better performance. We further discuss the efficiency and behaviors in the KD process and inference, summarize the implications of findings, and identify promising future directions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion. Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference speed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated domain-specific instruction tuning (FedDIT) for large language models (LLMs) aims to enhance performance in specialized domains using distributed private and limited data, yet identifying key performance drivers and optimal augmentation strategies remains challenging. We empirically establish that cross-client domain coverage, rather than data heterogeneity, is the pivotal factor. We then introduce FedDCA, an algorithm that explicitly maximizes this coverage through diversity-oriented client center selection and retrieval-based augmentation, constructing diverse, non-redundant cross-client instruction sets. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate FedDCA's superiority over eleven baselines, achieving performance gains of up to 29.19\% and domain coverage improvements of 4.82\%-21.36\%. FedDCA maintains its effectiveness in diverse and challenging scenarios, including data selection, held-out settings where task-specific public data is scarce and various data heterogeneity, with manageable privacy risks. This work clarifies critical FedDIT dynamics and presents FedDCA as an effective, privacy-preserving, and scalable solution for advancing domain-specific LLM tuning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurate information retrieval (IR) is critical in the financial domain, where investors must identify relevant information from large collections of documents. Traditional IR methods-whether sparse or dense-often fall short in retrieval accuracy, as it requires not only capturing semantic similarity but also performing fine-grained reasoning over document structure and domain-specific knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened up new opportunities for retrieval with multi-step reasoning, where the model ranks passages through iterative reasoning about which information is most relevant to a given query. However, there exists no benchmark to evaluate such capabilities in the financial domain. To address this gap, we introduce FinAgentBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating retrieval with multi-step reasoning in finance -- a setting we term agentic retrieval. The benchmark consists of 3,429 expert-annotated examples on S&P-100 listed firms and assesses whether LLM agents can (1) identify the most relevant document type among candidates, and (2) pinpoint the key passage within the selected document. Our evaluation framework explicitly separates these two reasoning steps to address context limitations. This design enables to provide a quantitative basis for understanding retrieval-centric LLM behavior in finance. We evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art models and further demonstrated how targeted fine-tuning can significantly improve agentic retrieval performance. Our benchmark provides a foundation for studying retrieval-centric LLM behavior in complex, domain-specific tasks for finance. We will release the dataset publicly upon acceptance of the paper and plan to expand and share dataset for the full S&P 500 and beyond.

To address these limitations, we propose VerifiAgent, a unified verification agent that integrates two levels of verification: meta-verification, which assesses completeness and consistency in model responses, and tool-based adaptive verification, where VerifiAgent autonomously selects appropriate verification tools based on the reasoning type, including mathematical, logical, or commonsense reasoning. This adaptive approach ensures both efficiency and robustness across different verification scenarios. Experimental results show that VerifiAgent outperforms baseline verification methods (e.g., deductive verifier, backward verifier) among all reasoning tasks. Additionally, it can further enhance reasoning accuracy by leveraging feedback from verification results. VerifiAgent can also be effectively applied to inference scaling, achieving better results with fewer generated samples and costs compared to existing process reward models in the mathematical reasoning domain.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce \dataset (Procedural Knowledge Reasoning Question Answering), a new benchmark for question answering over procedural tasks that require structured reasoning. PKR-QA is constructed semi-automatically using a procedural knowledge graph (PKG), which encodes task-specific knowledge across diverse domains. The PKG is built by curating and linking information from the COIN instructional video dataset and the ontology, enriched with commonsense knowledge from ConceptNet and structured outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs), followed by manual verification. To generate question-answer pairs, we design graph traversal templates where each template is applied systematically over PKG. To enable interpretable reasoning, we propose a neurosymbolic approach called Knowledge Module Learning (KML), which learns procedural relations via neural modules and composes them for structured reasoning with LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that this paradigm improves reasoning performance on our dataset and enables step-by-step reasoning traces that facilitate interpretability. Our theoretical analysis on KML learning shows that our trained models satisfy near optimal conditions for learning KG relations as neural network mapping models. Code and dataset will be released soon.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied by growing concerns regarding their reliability and trustworthiness. As a result, a growing body of research focuses on evidence-based text generation with LLMs, aiming to link model outputs to supporting evidence to ensure traceability and verifiability. However, the field is fragmented due to inconsistent terminology, isolated evaluation practices, and a lack of unified benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we systematically analyze 134 papers, introduce a unified taxonomy of evidence-based text generation with LLMs, and investigate 300 evaluation metrics across seven key dimensions. Thereby, we focus on approaches that use citations, attribution, or quotations for evidence-based text generation. Building on this, we examine the distinctive characteristics and representative methods in the field. Finally, we highlight open challenges and outline promising directions for future work.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding the spiral arms of the Milky Way (MW) remains a key open question in galactic dynamics. Tidal perturbations, such as the recent passage of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr), could play a significant role in exciting them. We aim to analytically characterize the dynamics of tidally induced spiral arms, including their phase-space signatures. We ran idealized test-particle simulations resembling impulsive satellite impacts, and used the Sparse Identification of Non-linear Dynamics (SINDy) method to infer their governing Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). We validated the method with analytical derivations and a realistic $N$-body simulation of a MW-Sgr encounter analogue. For small perturbations, a linear system of equations was recovered with SINDy, consistent with predictions from linearised collisionless dynamics. In this case, two distinct waves wrapping at pattern speeds $\Omega \pm \kappa/m$ emerge. For large impacts, we empirically discovered a non-linear system of equations, representing a novel formulation for the dynamics of tidally induced spiral arms. For both cases, these equations describe wave properties like amplitude and pattern speed, and their shape and temporal evolution in different phase-space projections. We fit the Gaia $L_Z-V_R$ waves with the linear model, providing a reasonable fit and plausible parameters for the Sgr passage. However, the predicted amplitude ratio of the two waves is inconsistent with observations, supporting a more complex origin for this feature (e.g. multiple passages, bar, spiral arms). We merge data-driven discovery with theory to create simple, accurate models of tidal spiral arms that match simulations and provide a simple tool to fit Gaia and external galaxy data. This methodology could be extended to model complex phenomena like self-gravity and dynamical friction. (ABR)

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We study a networked system of innovation processes, where each process is modeled as an urn with infinitely many colors-a classical framework for capturing the emergence of novelties. Extending this paradigm, we analyze a model of interacting urns, where the probability of generating or reusing elements in one process is influenced by the histories of others. This interaction is governed by two matrices that control innovation triggering and reinforcement dynamics across the system. The core contribution of this work is a detailed analysis of the second-order asymptotic behavior of the model. Building on these theoretical results, we develop statistical tools to infer the structure and strength of inter-process influence. The methodology is framed in a general setting, making it broadly applicable. We validate our approach with applications to two real-world datasets from Reddit discussions and Gutenberg text corpora.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Visual designers naturally draw inspiration from multiple visual references, combining diverse elements and aesthetic principles to create artwork. However, current image generative frameworks predominantly rely on single-source inputs -- either text prompts or individual reference images. In this paper, we focus on the task of controllable image generation using multiple visual references. We introduce MultiRef-bench, a rigorous evaluation framework comprising 990 synthetic and 1,000 real-world samples that require incorporating visual content from multiple reference images. The synthetic samples are synthetically generated through our data engine RefBlend, with 10 reference types and 33 reference combinations. Based on RefBlend, we further construct a dataset MultiRef containing 38k high-quality images to facilitate further research. Our experiments across three interleaved image-text models (i.e., OmniGen, ACE, and Show-o) and six agentic frameworks (e.g., ChatDiT and LLM + SD) reveal that even state-of-the-art systems struggle with multi-reference conditioning, with the best model OmniGen achieving only 66.6% in synthetic samples and 79.0% in real-world cases on average compared to the golden answer. These findings provide valuable directions for developing more flexible and human-like creative tools that can effectively integrate multiple sources of visual inspiration. The dataset is publicly available at: https://multiref.github.io/.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck, hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials. CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized evaluation protocols, and (iii) baseline and ablation experiments across diverse modeling paradigms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Tool calling has emerged as a critical capability for AI agents to interact with the real world and solve complex tasks. While the Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a powerful standardized framework for tool integration, there is a significant gap in benchmarking how well AI agents can effectively solve multi-step tasks using diverse MCP tools in realistic, dynamic scenarios. In this work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated real-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review, that require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file operations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis. Moreover, we introduce a novel evaluation approach that leverages ground-truth execution plans rather than raw API outputs, better reflecting the evolving nature of real-world environments. Experiments show that even frontier LLMs achieve a success rate below 60\%, highlighting major challenges in tool orchestration. Detailed ablations and error analysis further reveal distinct failure modes and inefficiencies in token usage, pointing to concrete directions for advancing current models. LiveMCP-101 sets a rigorous standard for evaluating real-world agent capabilities, advancing toward autonomous AI systems that reliably execute complex tasks through tool use.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding the latent space geometry of large language models (LLMs) is key to interpreting their behavior and improving alignment. However, it remains unclear to what extent LLMs internally organize representations related to semantic understanding. To explore this, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of hidden representations in 11 autoregressive models across 6 scientific topics. We find that high-level semantic information consistently resides in low-dimensional subspaces that form linearly separable representations across domains. This separability becomes more pronounced in deeper layers and under prompts that elicit structured reasoning or alignment behavior$\unicode{x2013}$even when surface content remains unchanged. These findings support geometry-aware tools that operate directly in latent space to detect and mitigate harmful or adversarial content. As a proof of concept, we train an MLP probe on final-layer hidden states to act as a lightweight latent-space guardrail. This approach substantially improves refusal rates on malicious queries and prompt injections that bypass both the model's built-in safety alignment and external token-level filters.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We study evaluation of AI systems without ground truth by exploiting a link between strategic gaming and information loss. We analyze which information-theoretic mechanisms resist adversarial manipulation, extending finite-sample bounds to show that bounded f-divergences (e.g., total variation distance) maintain polynomial guarantees under attacks while unbounded measures (e.g., KL divergence) degrade exponentially. To implement these mechanisms, we model the overseer as an agent and characterize incentive-compatible scoring rules as f-mutual information objectives. Under adversarial attacks, TVD-MI maintains effectiveness (area under curve 0.70-0.77) while traditional judge queries are near change (AUC $\approx$ 0.50), demonstrating that querying the same LLM for information relationships rather than quality judgments provides both theoretical and practical robustness. The mechanisms decompose pairwise evaluations into reliable item-level quality scores without ground truth, addressing a key limitation of traditional peer prediction. We release preregistration and code.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning tasks through methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often fall short in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) has emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning process. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning ability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the model's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We introduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse reasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various domains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost (PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning efficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models consistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and non-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as evidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more streamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of TIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, the concept of kirigami has been used in creating deployable structures for various scientific and technological applications. While the design of kirigami metamaterials has been widely studied, the simulation of the deployment and shape transformation process is less explored. In this work, we develop PyKirigami, an efficient Python-based open-source computational tool for the deployment simulation of kirigami metamaterials. In particular, our tool is capable of simulating both two- and three-dimensional deployments of a large variety of kirigami metamaterials with different geometric, topological, and physical properties. Altogether, our work paves a new way for the modelling and design of shape-morphing mechanical metamaterials.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help, but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure, and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from large-scale data through RL.   Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Two-dimensional quantum colour codes hold significant promise for quantum error correction, offering advantages such as planar connectivity and low overhead logical gates. Despite their theoretical appeal, the practical deployment of these codes faces challenges due to complex decoding requirements compared to surface codes. This paper introduces vibe decoding which, for the first time, brings colour code performance on par with the surface code under practical decoding. Our approach leverages an ensemble of belief propagation decoders - each executing a distinct serial message passing schedule - combined with localised statistics post-processing. We refer to this combined protocol as VibeLSD. The VibeLSD decoder is highly versatile: our numerical results show it outperforms all practical existing colour code decoders across various syndrome extraction schemes, noise models, and error rates. By estimating qubit footprints through quantum memory simulations, we show that colour codes can operate with overhead that is comparable to, and in some cases lower than, that of the surface code. This, combined with the fact that localised statistics decoding is a parallel algorithm, makes VibeLSD suitable for implementation on specialised hardware for real-time decoding. Our results establish the colour code as a practical architecture for near-term quantum hardware, providing improved compilation efficiency for both Clifford and non-Clifford gates without incurring additional qubit overhead relative to the surface code.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current literature suggests that alignment faking (deceptive alignment) is an emergent property of large language models. We present the first empirical evidence that a small instruction-tuned model, specifically LLaMA 3 8B, can exhibit alignment faking. We further show that prompt-only interventions, including deontological moral framing and scratchpad reasoning, significantly reduce this behavior without modifying model internals. This challenges the assumption that prompt-based ethics are trivial and that deceptive alignment requires scale. We introduce a taxonomy distinguishing shallow deception, shaped by context and suppressible through prompting, from deep deception, which reflects persistent, goal-driven misalignment. Our findings refine the understanding of deception in language models and underscore the need for alignment evaluations across model sizes and deployment settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Communication-efficient distributed training algorithms have received considerable interest recently due to their benefits for training Large Language Models (LLMs) in bandwidth-constrained settings, such as across data centers and over the internet. Despite reducing communication frequency, these methods still typically require communicating a full copy of the model's gradients-resulting in a communication bottleneck even for cross-datacenter links. Furthermore, they can slightly degrade performance compared to a naive AdamW DDP baseline. While quantization and error feedback are often applied to reduce the pseudo-gradient's size, in the context of LLM pre-training, existing approaches have been unable to additionally leverage sparsification and have obtained limited quantization. In this work, we introduce SparseLoCo, a communication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that effectively leverages Top-k sparsification and quantization to reach extreme compression ratios of up to 1-3% sparsity and 2-bit quantization while outperforming full-precision DiLoCo. Our key observations are that outer momentum can be locally approximated by an error feedback combined with aggressive sparsity and that sparse aggregation can actually improve model performance. We empirically demonstrate in a range of communication-constrained LLM training settings that SparseLoCo provides significant benefits in both performance and communication cost.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Code generation has attracted increasing attention with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs). Many studies have developed powerful code LLMs by synthesizing code-related instruction data and applying supervised fine-tuning. However, these methods are limited by teacher model distillation and ignore the potential of iterative refinement by self-generated code. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Critique Refinement (ACR), which enables the model to refine itself by self-generated code and external critique, rather than directly imitating the code responses of the teacher model. Concretely, ACR includes a composite scoring system with LLM-as-a-Judge to evaluate the quality of code responses and a selective critique strategy with LLM-as-a-Critic to critique self-generated low-quality code responses. We develop the RefineCoder series by iteratively applying ACR, achieving continuous performance improvement on multiple code generation benchmarks. Compared to the baselines of the same size, our proposed RefineCoder series can achieve comparable or even superior performance using less data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current audio-visual (AV) benchmarks focus on final answer accuracy, overlooking the underlying reasoning process. This makes it difficult to distinguish genuine comprehension from correct answers derived through flawed reasoning or hallucinations. To address this, we introduce AURA (Audio-visual Understanding and Reasoning Assessment), a benchmark for evaluating the cross-modal reasoning capabilities of Audio-Visual Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and Omni-modal Language Models (OLMs). AURA includes questions across six challenging cognitive domains, such as causality, timbre and pitch, tempo and AV synchronization, unanswerability, implicit distractions, and skill profiling, explicitly designed to be unanswerable from a single modality. This forces models to construct a valid logical path grounded in both audio and video, setting AURA apart from AV datasets that allow uni-modal shortcuts. To assess reasoning traces, we propose a novel metric, AuraScore, which addresses the lack of robust tools for evaluating reasoning fidelity. It decomposes reasoning into two aspects: (i) Factual Consistency - whether reasoning is grounded in perceptual evidence, and (ii) Core Inference - the logical validity of each reasoning step. Evaluations of SOTA models on AURA reveal a critical reasoning gap: although models achieve high accuracy (up to 92% on some tasks), their Factual Consistency and Core Inference scores fall below 45%. This discrepancy highlights that models often arrive at correct answers through flawed logic, underscoring the need for our benchmark and paving the way for more robust multimodal evaluation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in educational, clinical, and professional settings, but their tendency for sycophancy -- prioritizing user agreement over independent reasoning -- poses risks to reliability. This study introduces a framework to evaluate sycophantic behavior in ChatGPT-4o, Claude-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-Pro across AMPS (mathematics) and MedQuad (medical advice) datasets. Sycophantic behavior was observed in 58.19% of cases, with Gemini exhibiting the highest rate (62.47%) and ChatGPT the lowest (56.71%). Progressive sycophancy, leading to correct answers, occurred in 43.52% of cases, while regressive sycophancy, leading to incorrect answers, was observed in 14.66%. Preemptive rebuttals demonstrated significantly higher sycophancy rates than in-context rebuttals (61.75% vs. 56.52%, $Z=5.87$, $p<0.001$), particularly in computational tasks, where regressive sycophancy increased significantly (preemptive: 8.13%, in-context: 3.54%, $p<0.001$). Simple rebuttals maximized progressive sycophancy ($Z=6.59$, $p<0.001$), while citation-based rebuttals exhibited the highest regressive rates ($Z=6.59$, $p<0.001$). Sycophantic behavior showed high persistence (78.5%, 95% CI: [77.2%, 79.8%]) regardless of context or model. These findings emphasize the risks and opportunities of deploying LLMs in structured and dynamic domains, offering insights into prompt programming and model optimization for safer AI applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Finite State Machines (FSMs) play a critical role in implementing control logic for Systems-on-Chip (SoC). Traditionally, FSMs are implemented by hardware engineers through Verilog coding, which is often tedious and time-consuming. Recently, with the remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation, LLMs have been increasingly explored for automating Verilog code generation. However, LLM-generated Verilog code often suffers from security vulnerabilities, which is particularly concerning for security-sensitive FSM implementations. To address this issue, we propose SecFSM, a novel method that leverages a security-oriented knowledge graph to guide LLMs in generating more secure Verilog code. Specifically, we first construct a FSM Security Knowledge Graph (FSKG) as an external aid to LLMs. Subsequently, we analyze users' requirements to identify vulnerabilities and get a list of vulnerabilities in the requirements. Then, we retrieve knowledge from FSKG based on the vulnerabilities list. Finally, we construct security prompts based on the security knowledge for Verilog code generation. To evaluate SecFSM, we build a dedicated dataset collected from academic datasets, artificial datasets, papers, and industrial cases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SecFSM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. In particular, on a benchmark of 25 security test cases evaluated by DeepSeek-R1, SecFSM achieves an outstanding pass rate of 21/25.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Unit tests (UTs) play an instrumental role in assessing code correctness as well as providing feedback to large language models (LLMs), motivating automated test generation. However, we uncover a trade-off between generating unit test inputs that reveal errors when given a faulty code and correctly predicting the unit test output without access to the gold solution. To address this trade-off, we propose UTGen, which teaches LLMs to generate unit test inputs that reveal errors along with their correct expected outputs based on task descriptions. Since model-generated tests can provide noisy signals (e.g., from incorrectly predicted outputs), we propose UTDebug that (i) scales UTGen via test-time compute to improve UT output prediction, and (ii) validates and backtracks edits based on multiple generated UTs to avoid overfitting, and helps LLMs debug effectively. We show that UTGen outperforms other LLM-based baselines by 7.59% based on a metric measuring the presence of both error-revealing UT inputs and correct UT outputs. When used with UTDebug, we find that feedback from UTGen's unit tests improves pass@1 accuracy of Qwen2.5 32B on HumanEvalFix and our own harder debugging split of MBPP+ by over 3.17% and 12.35% (respectively) over other LLM-based UT generation baselines. Moreover, we observe that feedback from Qwen2.5 32B-based UTGen model can enhance debugging with frontier LLMs like GPT-4o by 13.8%. Lastly, we demonstrate that UTGen is a better judge for code correctness, outperforming a state-of-the-art trained 8B reward model by 4.43% on HumanEval+ with best-of-10 sampling using Qwen2.5 7B.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present NiceWebRL, a research tool that enables researchers to use machine reinforcement learning (RL) environments for online human subject experiments. NiceWebRL is a Python library that allows any Jax-based environment to be transformed into an online interface, supporting both single-agent and multi-agent environments. As such, NiceWebRL enables AI researchers to compare their algorithms to human performance, cognitive scientists to test ML algorithms as theories for human cognition, and multi-agent researchers to develop algorithms for human-AI collaboration. We showcase NiceWebRL with 3 case studies that demonstrate its potential to help develop Human-like AI, Human-compatible AI, and Human-assistive AI. In the first case study (Human-like AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a novel RL model of cognition. Here, NiceWebRL facilitates testing this model against human participants in both a grid world and Craftax, a 2D Minecraft domain. In our second case study (Human-compatible AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a novel multi-agent RL algorithm that can generalize to human partners in the Overcooked domain. Finally, in our third case study (Human-assistive AI), we show how NiceWebRL can allow researchers to study how an LLM can assist humans on complex tasks in XLand-Minigrid, an environment with millions of hierarchical tasks. The library is available at https://github.com/KempnerInstitute/nicewebrl.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs' pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks, including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Timely detection of hardware vulnerabilities during the early design stage is critical for reducing remediation costs. Existing early detection techniques often require specialized security expertise, limiting their usability. Recent efforts have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for Verilog vulnerability detection. However, LLMs struggle to capture the structure in Verilog code, resulting in inconsistent detection results. To this end, we propose VerilogLAVD, the first LLM-aided graph traversal rule generation approach for Verilog vulnerability detection. Our approach introduces the Verilog Property Graph (VeriPG), a unified representation of Verilog code. It combines syntactic features extracted from the abstract syntax tree (AST) with semantic information derived from control flow and data dependency graphs. We leverage LLMs to generate VeriPG-based detection rules from Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) descriptions. These rules guide the rule executor that traversal VeriPG for potential vulnerabilities. To evaluate VerilogLAVD, we build a dataset collected from open-source repositories and synthesized data. In our empirical evaluation on 77 Verilog designs encompassing 12 CWE types, VerilogLAVD achieves an F1-score of 0.54. Compared to the LLM-only and LLM with external knowledge baselines, VerilogLAVD improves F1-score by 0.31 and 0.27, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper addresses two critical challenges in analog In-Memory Computing (IMC) systems that limit their scalability and deployability: the computational unreliability caused by stuck-at faults (SAFs) and the high compilation overhead of existing fault-mitigation algorithms, namely Fault-Free (FF). To overcome these limitations, we first propose a novel multi-bit weight representation technique, termed row-column hybrid grouping, which generalizes conventional column grouping by introducing redundancy across both rows and columns. This structural redundancy enhances fault tolerance and can be effectively combined with existing fault-mitigation solutions. Second, we design a compiler pipeline that reformulates the fault-aware weight decomposition problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) task, enabling fast and scalable compilation through off-the-shelf solvers. Further acceleration is achieved through theoretical insights that identify fault patterns amenable to trivial solutions, significantly reducing computation. Experimental results on convolutional networks and small language models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 8%p improvement in accuracy, 150x faster compilation, and 2x energy efficiency gain compared to existing baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper argues that a techno-philosophical reading of the EU AI Act provides insight into the long-term dynamics of data in AI systems, specifically, how the lifecycle from ingestion to deployment generates recursive value chains that challenge existing frameworks for Responsible AI. We introduce a conceptual tool to frame the AI pipeline, spanning data, training regimes, architectures, feature stores, and transfer learning. Using cross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and philosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim is that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of becoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI. To address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian philosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the AI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and individuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the self-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens personalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the recursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by infrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and temporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries, particularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and deployment concentrate value and decision-making. We argue that effective regulation must address these infrastructural and temporal dynamics, and propose measures including lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback accountability, recursion transparency, and a right to contest recursive reuse.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as proxies for human labelers in both training (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback) and large-scale response evaluation (LLM-as-a-judge). Alignment and evaluation are critical components in the development of reliable LLMs, and the choice of feedback protocol plays a central role in both but remains understudied. In this work, we show that the choice of feedback protocol for evaluation (absolute scores versus relative preferences) can significantly affect evaluation reliability and induce systematic biases. In the context of LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, we show that pairwise protocols are more vulnerable to distracted evaluation. Generator models can exploit spurious attributes (or distractor features) favored by the LLM judge, resulting in inflated scores for lower-quality outputs. We find that absolute scoring is more robust to such manipulation, producing judgments that better reflect response quality and are less influenced by distractor features. Our results demonstrate that generator models can flip preferences by embedding distractor features, skewing LLM-as-a-judge comparisons and leading to inaccurate conclusions about model quality in benchmark evaluations. Pairwise preferences flip in about 35% of the cases, compared to only 9% for absolute scores. We offer recommendations for choosing feedback protocols based on dataset characteristics and evaluation objectives.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Coastal pollution is a pressing global environmental issue, necessitating scalable and automated solutions for monitoring and management. This study investigates the efficacy of the Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT-DETR), a state-of-the-art, end-to-end object detection model, for the automated detection and counting of beach litter. A rigorous comparative analysis is conducted between two model variants, RT-DETR-Large (RT-DETR-L) and RT-DETR-Extra-Large (RT-DETR-X), trained on a publicly available dataset of coastal debris. The evaluation reveals that the RT-DETR-X model achieves marginally superior accuracy, with a mean Average Precision at 50\% IoU (mAP@50) of 0.816 and a mAP@50-95 of 0.612, compared to the RT-DETR-L model's 0.810 and 0.606, respectively. However, this minor performance gain is realized at a significant computational cost; the RT-DETR-L model demonstrates a substantially faster inference time of 20.1 ms versus 34.5 ms for the RT-DETR-X. The findings suggest that the RT-DETR-L model offers a more practical and efficient solution for real-time, in-field deployment due to its superior balance of processing speed and detection accuracy. This research provides valuable insights into the application of advanced Transformer-based detectors for environmental conservation, highlighting the critical trade-offs between model complexity and operational viability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols. To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions: information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection frameworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the necessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and models at: https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Tool selection is a key component of LLM agents. A popular approach follows a two-step process - \emph{retrieval} and \emph{selection} - to pick the most appropriate tool from a tool library for a given task. In this work, we introduce \textit{ToolHijacker}, a novel prompt injection attack targeting tool selection in no-box scenarios. ToolHijacker injects a malicious tool document into the tool library to manipulate the LLM agent's tool selection process, compelling it to consistently choose the attacker's malicious tool for an attacker-chosen target task. Specifically, we formulate the crafting of such tool documents as an optimization problem and propose a two-phase optimization strategy to solve it. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that ToolHijacker is highly effective, significantly outperforming existing manual-based and automated prompt injection attacks when applied to tool selection. Moreover, we explore various defenses, including prevention-based defenses (StruQ and SecAlign) and detection-based defenses (known-answer detection, DataSentinel, perplexity detection, and perplexity windowed detection). Our experimental results indicate that these defenses are insufficient, highlighting the urgent need for developing new defense strategies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large-language models (LLMs) and agentic systems present exciting opportunities to accelerate drug discovery. In this study, we examine the modularity of LLM-based agentic systems for drug discovery, i.e., whether parts of the system such as the LLM and type of agent are interchangeable, a topic that has received limited attention in drug discovery. We compare the performance of different LLMs and the effectiveness of tool-calling agents versus code-generating agents. Our case study, comparing performance in orchestrating tools for chemistry and drug discovery using an LLM-as-a-judge score, shows that Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4o outperform alternative language models such as Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.1-70B, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and Nova-Micro. Although we confirm that code-generating agents outperform the tool-calling ones on average, we show that this is highly question- and model-dependent. Furthermore, the impact of replacing system prompts is dependent on the question and model, underscoring that even in this particular domain one cannot just replace components of the system without re-engineering. Our study highlights the necessity of further research into the modularity of agentic systems to enable the development of reliable and modular solutions for real-world problems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content generation. In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks. By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity, and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into society, from financial services and traffic management to creative writing. Academic literature on the deployment of AI has mostly focused on the risks and harms that result from the use of AI. We introduce Fabric, a publicly available repository of deployed AI use cases to outline their governance mechanisms. Through semi-structured interviews with practitioners, we collect an initial set of 20 AI use cases. In addition, we co-design diagrams of the AI workflow with the practitioners. We discuss the oversight mechanisms and guardrails used in practice to safeguard AI use. The Fabric repository includes visual diagrams of AI use cases and descriptions of the deployed systems. Using the repository, we surface gaps in governance and find common patterns in human oversight of deployed AI systems. We intend for Fabric to serve as an extendable, evolving tool for researchers to study the effectiveness of AI governance.

This paper introduces the concept of "Trained Miniatures" - Small Language Models(SLMs) fine-tuned for specific, high-value applications, generating similar domain-specific responses for a fraction of the cost.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents the Annif system in SemEval-2025 Task 5 (LLMs4Subjects), which focussed on subject indexing using large language models (LLMs). The task required creating subject predictions for bibliographic records from the bilingual TIBKAT database using the GND subject vocabulary. Our approach combines traditional natural language processing and machine learning techniques implemented in the Annif toolkit with innovative LLM-based methods for translation and synthetic data generation, and merging predictions from monolingual models. The system ranked first in the all-subjects category and second in the tib-core-subjects category in the quantitative evaluation, and fourth in qualitative evaluations. These findings demonstrate the potential of combining traditional XMTC algorithms with modern LLM techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of subject indexing in multilingual contexts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces Agentics, a modular framework for building agent-based systems capable of structured reasoning and compositional generalization over complex data. Designed with research and practical applications in mind, Agentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In this framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used internally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics encourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting prompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by LLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when types are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the applicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without sacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at \texttt{https://github.com/IBM/agentics}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mobile application marketplaces are responsible for vetting apps to identify and mitigate security risks. Current vetting processes are labor-intensive, relying on manual analysis by security professionals aided by semi-automated tools. To address this inefficiency, we propose Mars, a system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated risk identification and profiling. Mars is designed to concurrently analyze multiple applications across diverse risk categories with minimal human intervention. To enhance analytical precision and operational efficiency, Mars leverages a pre-constructed risk identification tree to extract relevant indicators from high-dimensional application features. This initial step filters the data, reducing the input volume for the LLM and mitigating the potential for model hallucination induced by irrelevant features. The extracted indicators are then subjected to LLM analysis for final risk determination. Furthermore, Mars automatically generates a comprehensive evidence chain for each assessment, documenting the analytical process to provide transparent justification. These chains are designed to facilitate subsequent manual review and to inform enforcement decisions, such as application delisting. The performance of Mars was evaluated on a real-world dataset from a partner Android marketplace. The results demonstrate that Mars attained an F1-score of 0.838 in risk identification and an F1-score of 0.934 in evidence retrieval. To assess its practical applicability, a user study involving 20 expert analysts was conducted, which indicated that Mars yielded a substantial efficiency gain, ranging from 60% to 90%, over conventional manual analysis.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mixed-precision inference techniques reduce the memory and computational demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) by applying hybrid precision formats to model weights, activations, and KV caches. This work introduces mixed-precision LLM inference techniques that encompass (i) systematic memory and compute optimization across hierarchical storage and tensor core architectures, and (ii) comprehensive end-to-end mixed-precision optimization across diverse precision formats and hardware configurations. Our approach features two novel mixed-precision pipelines designed for optimal hardware utilization: a General Matrix Multiply (GEMM) pipeline that optimizes matrix operations through offline weight packing and online acceleration, and an attention pipeline that enables efficient attention computation with arbitrary Query, Key, and Value precision combinations. The key implementation of the pipelines includes (i) hardware-aware weight packing for automatic format optimization, (ii) adaptive head alignment for efficient attention computation, (iii) instruction-level parallelism for memory hierarchy exploitation, and (iv) KV memory loading pipeline for enhanced inference efficiency. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across 16 popular LLMs and 4 representative GPU architectures. Results demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 61% lower serving latency (30% on average) and up to 156% higher throughput (58% on average) in mixed-precision workloads compared to existing mixed-precision frameworks, establishing consistent performance improvements across all tested configurations and hardware types. This work is integrated into TurboMind, a high-performance inference engine of the LMDeploy project, which is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Traditional standardized network interfaces face significant limitations, including vendor-specific incompatibilities, rigid design assumptions, and lack of adaptability for new functionalities. We propose a multi-agent framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate control interfaces on demand between network functions (NFs). This includes a matching agent, which aligns required control functionalities with NF capabilities, and a code-generation agent, which generates the necessary API server for interface realization. We validate our approach using simulated multi-vendor gNB and WLAN AP environments. The performance evaluations highlight the trade-offs between cost and latency across LLMs for interface generation tasks. Our work sets the foundation for AI-native dynamic control interface generation, paving the way for enhanced interoperability and adaptability in future mobile networks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding the nuanced performance of machine learning models is essential for responsible deployment, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance. This paper introduces a novel framework, Conformalized Exceptional Model Mining, which combines the rigor of Conformal Prediction with the explanatory power of Exceptional Model Mining (EMM). The proposed framework identifies cohesive subgroups within data where model performance deviates exceptionally, highlighting regions of both high confidence and high uncertainty. We develop a new model class, mSMoPE (multiplex Soft Model Performance Evaluation), which quantifies uncertainty through conformal prediction's rigorous coverage guarantees. By defining a new quality measure, Relative Average Uncertainty Loss (RAUL), our framework isolates subgroups with exceptional performance patterns in multi-class classification and regression tasks. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in uncovering interpretable subgroups that provide critical insights into model behavior. This work lays the groundwork for enhancing model interpretability and reliability, advancing the state-of-the-art in explainable AI and uncertainty quantification.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability. First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts with superior scalability and robustness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This study presents a practical approach for early fault detection in industrial pump systems using real-world sensor data from a large-scale vertical centrifugal pump operating in a demanding marine environment. Five key operational parameters were monitored: vibration, temperature, flow rate, pressure, and electrical current. A dual-threshold labeling method was applied, combining fixed engineering limits with adaptive thresholds calculated as the 95th percentile of historical sensor values. To address the rarity of documented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using domain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating ranges. Three machine learning classifiers - Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - were trained to distinguish between normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts. Results showed that Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy across all classes, including minority cases representing rare or emerging faults, while the SVM model exhibited lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual analyses, including grouped confusion matrices and time-series plots, indicated that the proposed hybrid method provides robust detection capabilities. The framework is scalable, interpretable, and suitable for real-time industrial deployment, supporting proactive maintenance decisions before failures occur. Furthermore, it can be adapted to other machinery with similar sensor architectures, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for predictive maintenance in complex systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning in 3D scenes. Recent work has addressed the 3D situated reasoning task by invoking tool usage through large language models. Large language models call tools via APIs and integrate the generated programs through a chain of thought to solve problems based on the program results. However, due to the simplicity of the questions in the dataset, the generated program reasoning chains are relatively short. To solve this main challenge, in this paper, we introduce DeepThink3D to enhance the tool usage of LLMs in complex 3D situated reasoning tasks. Our work proposes a combinatorial and iterative evolutionary approach on the SQA3D benchmark to generate more complex questions. Building on this foundation, we fine-tune the large language model to make it more proficient in using 3D tools. By employing Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), we directly optimize the toolchain strategies generated by models, thereby enhancing their accuracy in complex tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis remains challenging due to limited labeled data and the need to capture subtle yet clinically meaningful variations in rhythm and morphology. We present CREMA (Contrastive Regularized Masked Autoencoder), a foundation model for 12-lead ECGs designed to learn generalizable representations through self-supervised pretraining. CREMA combines generative learning and contrastive regularization via a Contrastive Regularized MAE loss, and employs a Signal Transformer (SiT) architecture to capture both local waveform details and global temporal dependencies. We evaluate CREMA on benchmark datasets and real-world clinical environments, including deployment scenarios with significant distribution shifts. CREMA outperforms supervised baselines and existing self-supervised models in both linear probing and fine-tuning evaluations. Notably, it maintains superior performance across diverse clinical domains, such as emergency care, highlighting its robustness under real-world conditions. These results demonstrate that CREMA serves as a scalable and reliable foundation model for ECG diagnostics, supporting downstream applications across heterogeneous and high-risk clinical settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Ongoing discussions about the future of wireless communications are reaching a turning point as standardization activities for the sixth generation of mobile networks (6G) become more mature. New technologies must now face renewed scrutiny by the industry and academia in order to be ready for deployment in the near future. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) gained attention as a promising solution for improving the propagation conditions of signal transmission in general. The RIS is a planar array of tunable resonant elements designed to dynamically and precisely manipulate the reflection of incident electromagnetic waves. However, the physical structure of the RIS and its components may be subject to practical limitations and imperfections. It is imperative that the hardware imperfections (HWIs) associated with the RIS be analyzed, so that it remains a feasible technology from a practical standpoint. Moreover, solutions for mitigating the HWIs must be considered, as is discussed in this work. More specifically, we introduce a gradient descent optimization for mitigating HWIs in RIS-aided wideband communication systems. Numerical results show that the proposed optimization is able to compensate for HWIs such as the phase-shift noise (PSN) and RIS surface deformations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantum simulators are essential tools for developing and testing quantum algorithms. However, the high-frequency traversal characteristic of quantum simulators represents an unprecedented demand in the history of IT, and existing distributed technologies is unable to meet this requirement, resulting in a single-node bottleneck of quantum simulator. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a novel Distributed Shared Layered Storage Quantum Simulator (DSLSQS). By leveraging an innovative distributed architecture in which multiple computational nodes share data storage directly, together with De-TCP/IP networking technology, DSLSQS effectively eliminates East-West data flow in distributed systems. This approach mitigates the bottleneck of distributed quantum simulation clusters and enhances the scalability. Moreover, the system employs layered storage technology, which reduces usage of expensive high-performance memory and substantially lowers simulation costs. Furthermore, this paper systematically analyzes the performance and cost constraints of distributed quantum simulator cluster, identifying distributed networking as the primary performance bottleneck and highlighting that minimizing storage costs is crucial to reducing the total cost. Finally, experimental evaluations with a 27-qubit simulation confirm the successful implementation of layered storage within the quantum simulator. DSLSQS significantly enhances simulation efficiency, yielding a performance improvement of over 350% compared to existing distributed technologies. These results underscore the superior performance and scalability of the proposed architecture in managing complex quantum computing tasks. This paper provides crucial insights for the practical deployment of quantum computing and presents an effective framework for the development of distributed quantum simulation clusters.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multilingual translation stands as a challenging task for large language models (LLMs) to handle intricate language patterns and stilted translations that arise in automated translations. In this paper, we introduce Seed-X, a family of open-source LLMs comprising instruct and reasoning models, pushing the limits of translation capability with 7B parameter size. The base model is pre-trained on a diverse, high-quality dataset encompassing both monolingual and bilingual content across 28 languages, harnessing the full potential of multilingual data. The instruct model is then finetuned to translate by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and further enhanced through reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve better generalization across diverse language pairs. Seed-X achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models, including Gemini-2.5 and GPT-4o, across 28 languages, and significantly outperforms larger open-source models in both automatic metrics and human evaluations. We share the best practices through our optimization process, and make the parameter public available for advancing translation research and applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the requirement for reliable safety evaluation to uncover model vulnerabilities. To this end, numerous LLM safety evaluation benchmarks are proposed. However, existing benchmarks generally rely on labor-intensive manual curation, which causes excessive time and resource consumption. They also exhibit significant redundancy and limited difficulty. To alleviate these problems, we introduce SafetyFlow, the first agent-flow system designed to automate the construction of LLM safety benchmarks. SafetyFlow can automatically build a comprehensive safety benchmark in only four days without any human intervention by orchestrating seven specialized agents, significantly reducing time and resource cost. Equipped with versatile tools, the agents of SafetyFlow ensure process and cost controllability while integrating human expertise into the automatic pipeline. The final constructed dataset, SafetyFlowBench, contains 23,446 queries with low redundancy and strong discriminative power. Our contribution includes the first fully automated benchmarking pipeline and a comprehensive safety benchmark. We evaluate the safety of 49 advanced LLMs on our dataset and conduct extensive experiments to validate our efficacy and efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present the first large-scale computational study of political delegitimization discourse (PDD), defined as symbolic attacks on the normative validity of political entities. We curate and manually annotate a novel Hebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches (1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which 1,812 instances (17.4\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for intensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for understanding democratic discourse.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Next-generation mobile networks must reconcile the often-conflicting goals of multiple service owners. However, today's network slice controllers remain rigid, policy-bound, and unaware of the business context. We introduce Agoran Service and Resource Broker (SRB), an agentic marketplace that brings stakeholders directly into the operational loop. Inspired by the ancient Greek agora, Agoran distributes authority across three autonomous AI branches: a Legislative branch that answers compliance queries using retrieval-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs); an Executive branch that maintains real-time situational awareness through a watcher-updated vector database; and a Judicial branch that evaluates each agent message with a rule-based Trust Score, while arbitrating LLMs detect malicious behavior and apply real-time incentives to restore trust. Stakeholder-side Negotiation Agents and the SRB-side Mediator Agent negotiate feasible, Pareto-optimal offers produced by a multi-objective optimizer, reaching a consensus intent in a single round, which is then deployed to Open and AI RAN controllers. Deployed on a private 5G testbed and evaluated with realistic traces of vehicle mobility, Agoran achieved significant gains: (i) a 37% increase in throughput of eMBB slices, (ii) a 73% reduction in latency of URLLC slices, and concurrently (iii) an end-to-end 8.3% saving in PRB usage compared to a static baseline. An 1B-parameter Llama model, fine-tuned for five minutes on 100 GPT-4 dialogues, recovers approximately 80% of GPT-4.1's decision quality, while operating within 6 GiB of memory and converging in only 1.3 seconds. These results establish Agoran as a concrete, standards-aligned path toward ultra-flexible, stakeholder-centric 6G networks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the prospect of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents, studying their tendency for cooperative behavior becomes an increasingly relevant topic. This study is inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory, where the combined effects of repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry have been argued to be the cause for cooperative tendencies found in humans. We devised a virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. By simulating both internal team dynamics and external competition, we discovered that this blend substantially boosts both overall and initial, one-shot cooperation levels (the tendency to cooperate in one-off interactions). This research provides a novel framework for large language models to strategize and act in complex social scenarios and offers evidence for how intergroup competition can, counter-intuitively, result in more cooperative behavior. These insights are crucial for designing future multi-agent AI systems that can effectively work together and better align with human values.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into software engineering (SE) research and practice, yet their non-determinism, opaque training data, and evolving architectures complicate the reproduction and replication of empirical studies. We present a community effort to scope this space, introducing a taxonomy of LLM-based study types together with eight guidelines for designing and reporting empirical studies involving LLMs. The guidelines present essential (must) criteria as well as desired (should) criteria and target transparency throughout the research process. Our recommendations, contextualized by our study types, are: (1) to declare LLM usage and role; (2) to report model versions, configurations, and fine-tuning; (3) to document tool architectures; (4) to disclose prompts and interaction logs; (5) to use human validation; (6) to employ an open LLM as a baseline; (7) to report suitable baselines, benchmarks, and metrics; and (8) to openly articulate limitations and mitigations. Our goal is to enable reproducibility and replicability despite LLM-specific barriers to open science. We maintain the study types and guidelines online as a living resource for the community to use and shape (llm-guidelines.org).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce CUS-QA, a benchmark for open-ended regional question answering that encompasses both textual and visual modalities. We also provide strong baselines using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Our dataset consists of manually curated questions and answers grounded in Wikipedia, created by native speakers from Czechia, Slovakia, and Ukraine, with accompanying English translations. It includes both purely textual questions and those requiring visual understanding. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs through prompting and complement this with human judgments of answer correctness. Using these human evaluations, we analyze the reliability of existing automatic evaluation metrics. Our baseline results show that even the best open-weight LLMs achieve only around 50% accuracy on textual questions and below 30% on visual questions. LLM-based evaluation metrics show strong correlation with human judgment, while traditional string-overlap metrics perform surprisingly well due to the prevalence of named entities in answers.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce SRDrone, a novel system designed for self-refinement task planning in industrial-grade embodied drones. SRDrone incorporates two key technical contributions: First, it employs a continuous state evaluation methodology to robustly and accurately determine task outcomes and provide explanatory feedback. This approach supersedes conventional reliance on single-frame final-state assessment for continuous, dynamic drone operations. Second, SRDrone implements a hierarchical Behavior Tree (BT) modification model. This model integrates multi-level BT plan analysis with a constrained strategy space to enable structured reflective learning from experience. Experimental results demonstrate that SRDrone achieves a 44.87% improvement in Success Rate (SR) over baseline methods. Furthermore, real-world deployment utilizing an experience base optimized through iterative self-refinement attains a 96.25% SR. By embedding adaptive task refinement capabilities within an industrial-grade BT planning framework, SRDrone effectively integrates the general reasoning intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the stringent physical execution constraints inherent to embodied drones.

We propose Pub-Guard-LLM, the first large language model-based system tailored to fraud detection of biomedical scientific articles. We provide three application modes for deploying Pub-Guard-LLM: vanilla reasoning, retrieval-augmented generation, and multi-agent debate. Each mode allows for textual explanations of predictions. To assess the performance of our system, we introduce an open-source benchmark, PubMed Retraction, comprising over 11K real-world biomedical articles, including metadata and retraction labels. We show that, across all modes, Pub-Guard-LLM consistently surpasses the performance of various baselines and provides more reliable explanations, namely explanations which are deemed more relevant and coherent than those generated by the baselines when evaluated by multiple assessment methods. By enhancing both detection performance and explainability in scientific fraud detection, Pub-Guard-LLM contributes to safeguarding research integrity with a novel, effective, open-source tool.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Code completion is a prominent application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering. Due to the near real-time response requirements of this task, base models with small to medium-sized parameters are typically employed, supplemented by various optimization and post-training techniques. However, these optimization methods often have trade-offs, leading to a seesaw effect where performance improvements on certain datasets or metrics are accompanied by degradations on others -- sometimes even falling below the baseline model's performance. This paper proposes SynthCoder, a model that integrates leading industry practices to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) code completion task. In specific, we first construct a diverse dataset by combining Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node extraction with heuristics that simulate developer behavior. Then we enrich our training corpus with cross-file contextual information using the BM25 algorithm and call graphs, enhancing the model's ability to perform code completion in both file-level and repository-level scenarios. As the last step, we employ a two-stage training process using the Seed-Coder-8B-Base as the base model. First, we fine-tune the model using Curriculum Learning technology. Following this, we perform alignment using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with preference pairs generated through Rejection Sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that our final model excels on mainstream repository-level code completion benchmarks, including aiXcoder, ExecRepoBench, CrossCodeEval, and CoLT. Furthermore, our carefully curated training set effectively mitigates the model's tendency to just repeat existing code, a common issue existing in various code completion models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in reasoning abilities and general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet their performance on Arabic data, characterized by rich morphology, diverse dialects, and complex script, remains underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmarking study of multiple reasoning-focused LLMs, with a special emphasis on the newly introduced DeepSeek models, across a suite of fifteen Arabic NLP tasks. We experiment with various strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning. This allows us to systematically evaluate performance on datasets covering a range of applications to examine their capacity for linguistic reasoning under different levels of complexity. Our experiments reveal several key findings. First, carefully selecting just three in-context examples delivers an average uplift of over 13 F1 points on classification tasks-boosting sentiment analysis from 35.3% to 87.5% and paraphrase detection from 56.1% to 87.0%. Second, reasoning-focused DeepSeek architectures outperform a strong GPT o4-mini baseline by an average of 12 F1 points on complex inference tasks in the zero-shot setting. Third, LoRA-based fine-tuning yields up to an additional 8 points in F1 and BLEU compared to equivalent increases in model scale.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant popularity in recent years. Differentiating between a text written by a human and one generated by an LLM has become almost impossible. Information-hiding techniques such as digital watermarking or steganography can help by embedding information inside text in a form that is unlikely to be noticed. However, existing techniques, such as linguistic-based or format-based methods, change the semantics or cannot be applied to pure, unformatted text. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for information hiding called Innamark, which can conceal any byte-encoded sequence within a sufficiently long cover text. This method is implemented as a multi-platform library using the Kotlin programming language, which is accompanied by a command-line tool and a web interface. By substituting conventional whitespace characters with visually similar Unicode whitespace characters, our proposed scheme preserves the semantics of the cover text without changing the number of characters. Furthermore, we propose a specified structure for secret messages that enables configurable compression, encryption, hashing, and error correction. An experimental benchmark comparison on a dataset of 1 000 000 Wikipedia articles compares ten algorithms. The results demonstrate the robustness of our proposed Innamark method in various applications and the imperceptibility of its watermarks to humans. We discuss the limits to the embedding capacity and robustness of the algorithm and how these could be addressed in future work.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce Dream 7B, the most powerful open diffusion large language model to date. Unlike autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially, Dream 7B employs discrete diffusion modeling to refine sequences in parallel through iterative denoising. Our model consistently outperforms existing diffusion language models on general, mathematical, and coding tasks. Dream 7B demonstrates superior planning abilities and inference flexibility, including arbitrary-order generation, infilling capabilities, and tunable quality-speed trade-offs. These results are achieved through simple yet effective training techniques, including AR-based LLM initialization and context-adaptive token-level noise rescheduling. We release both Dream-Base and Dream-Instruct to facilitate further research in diffusion-based language modeling.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts (Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities (e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results (macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling a comparison between identities portrayed in elite discourse and the public's identity priorities. HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in other non-English political contexts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The explosive growth of multimodal data has driven the rapid development of multimodal entity linking (MEL) models. However, existing studies have not systematically investigated the impact of visual adversarial attacks on MEL models. We conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of the robustness of mainstream MEL models under different adversarial attack scenarios, covering two core tasks: Image-to-Text (I2T) and Image+Text-to-Text (IT2T). Experimental results show that current MEL models generally lack sufficient robustness against visual perturbations. Interestingly, contextual semantic information in input can partially mitigate the impact of adversarial perturbations. Based on this insight, we propose an LLM and Retrieval-Augmented Entity Linking (LLM-RetLink), which significantly improves the model's anti-interference ability through a two-stage process: first, extracting initial entity descriptions using large vision models (LVMs), and then dynamically generating candidate descriptive sentences via web-based retrieval. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate that LLM-RetLink improves the accuracy of MEL by 0.4%-35.7%, especially showing significant advantages under adversarial conditions. This research highlights a previously unexplored facet of MEL robustness, constructs and releases the first MEL adversarial example dataset, and sets the stage for future work aimed at strengthening the resilience of multimodal systems in adversarial environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However, existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally, current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project code is in https://github.com/cq-dong/LGMSNet.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks, purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences. We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language", albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask: (i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM? (ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences? (iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved alignment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly Interaction Networks (INs), have shown exceptional performance for jet tagging at the CERN High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). However, their computational complexity and irregular memory access patterns pose significant challenges for deployment on FPGAs in hardware trigger systems, where strict latency and resource constraints apply. In this work, we propose JEDI-linear, a novel GNN architecture with linear computational complexity that eliminates explicit pairwise interactions by leveraging shared transformations and global aggregation. To further enhance hardware efficiency, we introduce fine-grained quantization-aware training with per-parameter bitwidth optimization and employ multiplier-free multiply-accumulate operations via distributed arithmetic. Evaluation results show that our FPGA-based JEDI-linear achieves 3.7 to 11.5 times lower latency, up to 150 times lower initiation interval, and up to 6.2 times lower LUT usage compared to state-of-the-art designs while also delivering higher model accuracy and eliminating the need for DSP blocks entirely. In contrast, state-of-the-art solutions consume over 8,700 DSPs. This is the first interaction-based GNN to achieve less than 60~ns latency and currently meets the requirements for use in the HL-LHC CMS Level-1 trigger system. This work advances the next-generation trigger systems by enabling accurate, scalable, and resource-efficient GNN inference in real-time environments. Our open-sourced templates will further support reproducibility and broader adoption across scientific applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose a new approach for a high-density free-neutron target, primarily aimed at nuclear astrophysics reaction studies in inverse kinematics with radioactive ions circulating in a storage ring. The target concept integrates four key subsystems: a neutron production source driven by a supercompact cyclotron utilizing $^9$Be($p,xn$) reactions, an optimized moderator/reflector assembly using either heavy-water or beryllium oxide with a graphite reflector shell to thermalize fast neutrons, a cryogenic liquid hydrogen moderator to maximize thermal neutron density in the interaction region, and beam pipe geometries that enable neutron-ion interactions while maintaining vacuum conditions for ion circulation. This integrated approach focuses on feasibility by incorporating readily available technology. Using a commercial supercompact cyclotron delivering 130 $\mu$A, the design achieves thermal neutron areal densities of $\sim3.4\times10^{6}$ n/cm$^2$ for a proof-of-concept demonstrator at the CRYRING ion-storage ring at GSI. This autonomous accelerator-target assembly design enables deployment at both in-flight and ISOL facilities to exploit their complementary production yields.   Potential upgrades based on higher-energy and/or higher-current isochronous cyclotrons should enable an increase in areal density to $\sim$10$^9$ n/cm$^2$. In combination with a customized low-energy storage ring and a radioactive ion-beam facility, the proposed solution could deliver luminosities above 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, thereby enabling neutron capture measurements of $\sim$mb cross sections within a few days of experiment. The proposed system represents a significant milestone towards enabling large neutron-capture surveys on exotic nuclei, thereby opening a new avenue for understanding the synthesis of heavy elements in our universe.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Evaluating automatically generated radiology reports remains a fundamental challenge due to the lack of clinically grounded, interpretable, and fine-grained metrics. Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world clinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for radiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six clinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications that explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1) Sub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically challenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided Advantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt difficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable more stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment. Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment. Code will be released upon publication.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sexism is generally defined as prejudice and discrimination based on sex or gender, affecting every sector of society, from social institutions to relationships and individual behavior. Social media platforms amplify the impact of sexism by conveying discriminatory content not only through text but also across multiple modalities, highlighting the critical need for a multimodal approach to the analysis of sexism online. With the rise of social media platforms where users share short videos, sexism is increasingly spreading through video content. Automatically detecting sexism in videos is a challenging task, as it requires analyzing the combination of verbal, audio, and visual elements to identify sexist content. In this study, (1) we introduce MuSeD, a new Multimodal Spanish dataset for Sexism Detection consisting of $\approx$ 11 hours of videos extracted from TikTok and BitChute; (2) we propose an innovative annotation framework for analyzing the contributions of textual, vocal, and visual modalities to the classification of content as either sexist or non-sexist; and (3) we evaluate a range of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs on the task of sexism detection. We find that visual information plays a key role in labeling sexist content for both humans and models. Models effectively detect explicit sexism; however, they struggle with implicit cases, such as stereotypes, instances where annotators also show low agreement. This highlights the inherent difficulty of the task, as identifying implicit sexism depends on the social and cultural context.

This performance drop limits the safe and equitable deployment of AI in real-world clinical settings.

Using three large-scale full-field digital mammography (FFDM) datasets -- including HCTP, a newly introduced, pathologically confirmed in-house dataset -- we conduct a systematic cross-domain evaluation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our results demonstrate that BN layers are a primary source of domain dependence: they perform effectively when training and testing occur within the same domain, and they significantly impair model generalization under domain shift. DoSReMC addresses this limitation by fine-tuning only the BN and fully connected (FC) layers, while preserving pretrained convolutional filters. We further integrate this targeted adaptation with an adversarial training scheme, yielding additional improvements in cross-domain generalizability. DoSReMC can be readily incorporated into existing AI pipelines and applied across diverse clinical environments, providing a practical pathway toward more robust and generalizable mammography classification systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various domains and tasks, concerns about their safety are becoming increasingly severe. In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge internally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to ensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques, such as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to eliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these methods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric training without completely eradicating its informational traces within the model. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective continuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis Representation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of irreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network layers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving useful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables effective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness while preserving natural performance. Our code is available in https://github.com/ChengcanWu/MRP.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a standard framework for knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, combining large language models (LLMs) with document retrieval from external corpora. Despite its widespread use, most RAG pipelines continue to treat retrieval and reasoning as isolated components, retrieving documents once and then generating answers without further interaction. This static design often limits performance on complex tasks that require iterative evidence gathering or high-precision retrieval. Recent work in both the information retrieval (IR) and NLP communities has begun to close this gap by introducing adaptive retrieval and ranking methods that incorporate feedback. In this survey, we present a structured overview of advanced retrieval and ranking mechanisms that integrate such feedback. We categorize feedback signals based on their source and role in improving the query, retrieved context, or document pool. By consolidating these developments, we aim to bridge IR and NLP perspectives and highlight retrieval as a dynamic, learnable component of end-to-end RAG systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) gives rise to ethical concerns about their performance, while opening new avenues for developing toxic language detection techniques. However, LLMs' unethical output and their capability of detecting toxicity have primarily been tested on language data that do not demand complex meaning inference, such as the biased associations of 'he' with programmer and 'she' with household. Nowadays toxic language adopts a much more creative range of implicit forms, thanks to advanced censorship. In this study, we collect authentic toxic interactions that evade online censorship and that are verified by human annotators as inference-intensive. To evaluate and improve LLMs' reasoning of the authentic implicit toxic language, we propose a new prompting method, Pragmatic Inference Chain (PIC), drawn on interdisciplinary findings from cognitive science and linguistics. The PIC prompting significantly improves the success rate of GPT-4o, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, DeepSeek-v2.5, and DeepSeek-v3 in identifying implicit toxic language, compared to five baseline prompts, such as CoT and rule-based baselines. In addition, it also facilitates the models to produce more explicit and coherent reasoning processes, hence can potentially be generalized to other inference-intensive tasks, e.g., understanding humour and metaphors.

Our approach employs a modular and configuration-based pipeline capable of modeling complex dialogue flows with minimal manual intervention. This framework uses a dual-stage quality tagging mechanism, combining heuristic rules and LLM-based evaluations, to automatically filter and score data extracted from OASST-formatted conversations, ensuring the curation of high-quality dialogue samples. The resulting datasets are structured under a flexible schema supporting both SFT and DPO use cases, enabling seamless integration into diverse training workflows. Together, these innovations offer a robust solution for generating and managing synthetic conversational data at scale, significantly reducing the overhead of data preparation in LLM training pipelines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> AudioSet is a widely used benchmark in the audio research community and has significantly advanced various audio-related tasks. However, persistent issues with label accuracy and completeness remain critical bottlenecks that limit performance in downstream applications.To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a three-stage reannotation framework that harnesses general-purpose audio-language foundation models to systematically improve the label quality of AudioSet. The framework employs a cross-modal prompting strategy, inspired by the concept of prompt chaining, wherein prompts are sequentially composed to execute subtasks (audio comprehension, label synthesis, and semantic alignment). Leveraging this framework, we construct a high-quality, structured relabeled version of AudioSet-R. Extensive experiments conducted on representative audio classification models--including AST, PANNs, SSAST, and AudioMAE--consistently demonstrate substantial performance improvements, thereby validating the generalizability and effectiveness of the proposed approach in enhancing label reliability.The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/colaudiolab/AudioSet-R.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The logistics and construction industries face persistent challenges in automating pallet handling, especially in outdoor environments with variable payloads, inconsistencies in pallet quality and dimensions, and unstructured surroundings. In this paper, we tackle automation of a critical step in pallet transport: the pallet pick-up operation. Our work is motivated by labor shortages, safety concerns, and inefficiencies in manually locating and retrieving pallets under such conditions. We present Lang2Lift, a framework that leverages foundation models for natural language-guided pallet detection and 6D pose estimation, enabling operators to specify targets through intuitive commands such as "pick up the steel beam pallet near the crane." The perception pipeline integrates Florence-2 and SAM-2 for language-grounded segmentation with FoundationPose for robust pose estimation in cluttered, multi-pallet outdoor scenes under variable lighting. The resulting poses feed into a motion planning module for fully autonomous forklift operation. We validate Lang2Lift on the ADAPT autonomous forklift platform, achieving 0.76 mIoU pallet segmentation accuracy on a real-world test dataset. Timing and error analysis demonstrate the system's robustness and confirm its feasibility for deployment in operational logistics and construction environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Learning clients embeddings from sequences of their historic communications is central to financial applications. While large language models (LLMs) offer general world knowledge, their direct use on long event sequences is computationally expensive and impractical in real-world pipelines. In this paper, we propose LATTE, a contrastive learning framework that aligns raw event embeddings with semantic embeddings from frozen LLMs. Behavioral features are summarized into short prompts, embedded by the LLM, and used as supervision via contrastive loss. The proposed approach significantly reduces inference cost and input size compared to conventional processing of complete sequence by LLM. We experimentally show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for learning event sequence representations on real-world financial datasets while remaining deployable in latency-sensitive environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable devices has advanced significantly in recent years, yet its generalization remains limited when models are deployed to new users. This degradation in performance is primarily due to user-induced concept drift (UICD), highlighting the importance of efficient personalization. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework that first generalizes across users and then rapidly adapts to individual users using few-shot learning directly on-device. By updating only the classifier layer with user-specific data, our method achieves robust personalization with minimal computational and memory overhead. We implement this framework on the energy-efficient RISC-V-based GAP9 microcontroller and validate it across three diverse HAR scenarios: RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, and Ultrasound-Gesture. Post-deployment adaptation yields consistent accuracy improvements of 3.73\%, 17.38\%, and 3.70\% respectively. These results confirm that fast, lightweight, and effective personalization is feasible on embedded platforms, paving the way for scalable and user-aware HAR systems in the wild \footnote{https://github.com/kangpx/onlineTiny2023}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated domain-specific instruction tuning (FedDIT) for large language models (LLMs) aims to enhance performance in specialized domains using distributed private and limited data, yet identifying key performance drivers and optimal augmentation strategies remains challenging. We empirically establish that cross-client domain coverage, rather than data heterogeneity, is the pivotal factor. We then introduce FedDCA, an algorithm that explicitly maximizes this coverage through diversity-oriented client center selection and retrieval-based augmentation, constructing diverse, non-redundant cross-client instruction sets. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate FedDCA's superiority over eleven baselines, achieving performance gains of up to 29.19\% and domain coverage improvements of 4.82\%-21.36\%. FedDCA maintains its effectiveness in diverse and challenging scenarios, including data selection, held-out settings where task-specific public data is scarce and various data heterogeneity, with manageable privacy risks. This work clarifies critical FedDIT dynamics and presents FedDCA as an effective, privacy-preserving, and scalable solution for advancing domain-specific LLM tuning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurate information retrieval (IR) is critical in the financial domain, where investors must identify relevant information from large collections of documents. Traditional IR methods-whether sparse or dense-often fall short in retrieval accuracy, as it requires not only capturing semantic similarity but also performing fine-grained reasoning over document structure and domain-specific knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened up new opportunities for retrieval with multi-step reasoning, where the model ranks passages through iterative reasoning about which information is most relevant to a given query. However, there exists no benchmark to evaluate such capabilities in the financial domain. To address this gap, we introduce FinAgentBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating retrieval with multi-step reasoning in finance -- a setting we term agentic retrieval. The benchmark consists of 3,429 expert-annotated examples on S&P-100 listed firms and assesses whether LLM agents can (1) identify the most relevant document type among candidates, and (2) pinpoint the key passage within the selected document. Our evaluation framework explicitly separates these two reasoning steps to address context limitations. This design enables to provide a quantitative basis for understanding retrieval-centric LLM behavior in finance. We evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art models and further demonstrated how targeted fine-tuning can significantly improve agentic retrieval performance. Our benchmark provides a foundation for studying retrieval-centric LLM behavior in complex, domain-specific tasks for finance. We will release the dataset publicly upon acceptance of the paper and plan to expand and share dataset for the full S&P 500 and beyond.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this work, we propose Wasserstein distributionally robust shallow convex neural networks (WaDiRo-SCNNs) to provide reliable nonlinear predictions when subject to adverse and corrupted datasets. Our approach is based on the reformulation of a new convex training program for ReLU-based shallow neural networks, which allows us to cast the problem into the order-1 Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization framework. Our training procedure is conservative, has low stochasticity, is solvable with open-source solvers, and is scalable to large industrial deployments. We provide out-of-sample performance guarantees, show that hard convex physical constraints can be enforced in the training program, and propose a mixed-integer convex post-training verification program to evaluate model stability. WaDiRo-SCNN aims to make neural networks safer for critical applications, such as in the energy sector. Finally, we numerically demonstrate our model's performance through both a synthetic experiment and a real-world power system application, viz., the prediction of hourly energy consumption in non-residential buildings within the context of virtual power plants, and evaluate its stability across standard regression benchmark datasets. The experimental results are convincing and showcase the strengths of the proposed model.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Various real-time methods for capturing and transmitting dynamic 3D spaces have been proposed, including those based on RGB-D cameras and volumetric capture. However, applying existing methods to outdoor tourist sites remains difficult because maintenance and aesthetic constraints limit sensor placement, and daylight variability complicates processing. We propose a system that combines multiple LiDARs and cameras for live dynamic point cloud capture, and integrates them with pre-captured static point clouds for wide-area 3D visualization. The system sustains 30 fps across wide-area scenes while keeping latency below 100 ms. To mitigate lighting inconsistencies, static point-cloud colors are automatically adjusted to current lighting. The effectiveness of our system is demonstrated through real-world deployment in a tourist site.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce \dataset (Procedural Knowledge Reasoning Question Answering), a new benchmark for question answering over procedural tasks that require structured reasoning. PKR-QA is constructed semi-automatically using a procedural knowledge graph (PKG), which encodes task-specific knowledge across diverse domains. The PKG is built by curating and linking information from the COIN instructional video dataset and the ontology, enriched with commonsense knowledge from ConceptNet and structured outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs), followed by manual verification. To generate question-answer pairs, we design graph traversal templates where each template is applied systematically over PKG. To enable interpretable reasoning, we propose a neurosymbolic approach called Knowledge Module Learning (KML), which learns procedural relations via neural modules and composes them for structured reasoning with LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that this paradigm improves reasoning performance on our dataset and enables step-by-step reasoning traces that facilitate interpretability. Our theoretical analysis on KML learning shows that our trained models satisfy near optimal conditions for learning KG relations as neural network mapping models. Code and dataset will be released soon.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied by growing concerns regarding their reliability and trustworthiness. As a result, a growing body of research focuses on evidence-based text generation with LLMs, aiming to link model outputs to supporting evidence to ensure traceability and verifiability. However, the field is fragmented due to inconsistent terminology, isolated evaluation practices, and a lack of unified benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we systematically analyze 134 papers, introduce a unified taxonomy of evidence-based text generation with LLMs, and investigate 300 evaluation metrics across seven key dimensions. Thereby, we focus on approaches that use citations, attribution, or quotations for evidence-based text generation. Building on this, we examine the distinctive characteristics and representative methods in the field. Finally, we highlight open challenges and outline promising directions for future work.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Visual designers naturally draw inspiration from multiple visual references, combining diverse elements and aesthetic principles to create artwork. However, current image generative frameworks predominantly rely on single-source inputs -- either text prompts or individual reference images. In this paper, we focus on the task of controllable image generation using multiple visual references. We introduce MultiRef-bench, a rigorous evaluation framework comprising 990 synthetic and 1,000 real-world samples that require incorporating visual content from multiple reference images. The synthetic samples are synthetically generated through our data engine RefBlend, with 10 reference types and 33 reference combinations. Based on RefBlend, we further construct a dataset MultiRef containing 38k high-quality images to facilitate further research. Our experiments across three interleaved image-text models (i.e., OmniGen, ACE, and Show-o) and six agentic frameworks (e.g., ChatDiT and LLM + SD) reveal that even state-of-the-art systems struggle with multi-reference conditioning, with the best model OmniGen achieving only 66.6% in synthetic samples and 79.0% in real-world cases on average compared to the golden answer. These findings provide valuable directions for developing more flexible and human-like creative tools that can effectively integrate multiple sources of visual inspiration. The dataset is publicly available at: https://multiref.github.io/.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck, hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials. CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized evaluation protocols, and (iii) baseline and ablation experiments across diverse modeling paradigms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The extensive world knowledge and powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention in recommendation systems (RS). Specifically, The chain of thought (CoT) has been shown to improve the performance of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks for RS. However, due to the fact that LLMs often suffer from hallucination issues, there is no guarantee that their reasoning CoT is effective. A key challenge is to further enhance the recommendation capabilities of LLMs through effective CoT reasonings. Therefore, we propose \textbf{TrackRec}, a framework designed to enhance reasoning capabilities of LLMs for RS. TrackRec specifically focuses on accurately inferring recommendation CoT \textbf{(RecCoT)} for user preference using the knowledge from LLMs. This RecCoT can serve both as an explanation for the LLM's completion of recommendation tasks and as auxiliary features to assist recommendation models in accomplishing recommendation tasks. TrackRec consists of a RecCoT generator $(G)$ and a RecCoT validator $(V)$. Furthermore, we design alternating feedback learning mechanism that $G$ undergoes direct preference optimization via feedback from $V$ to produce increasingly accurate RecCoT aligned with $V$'s standards. Meanwhile, $V$ is fine-tuned using the inference feedback from $G$ to enhance its validation capabilities in alignment with recommendation tasks. Through iterative alternating feedback learning between $G$ and $V$, TrackRec continuously improves the user preference analysis capability of $G$ and the validation capacity of $V$. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, TrackRec has been deployed on a lagre advertising platform with hundreds of millions of users, achieving substantial gains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Memory corruption vulnerabilities remain one of the most severe threats to software security. They often allow attackers to achieve arbitrary code execution by redirecting a vulnerable program's control flow. While Control Flow Integrity (CFI) has gained traction to mitigate this exploitation path, developers are not provided with any direction on how to apply CFI to real-world software. In this work, we establish a taxonomy mapping LLVM's forward-edge CFI variants to memory corruption vulnerability classes, offering actionable guidance for developers seeking to deploy CFI incrementally in existing codebases. Based on the Top 10 Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) list, we identify four high-impact vulnerability categories and select one representative CVE for each. We evaluate LLVM's CFI against each CVE and explain why CFI blocks exploitation in two cases while failing in the other two, illustrating its potential and current limitations. Our findings support informed deployment decisions and provide a foundation for improving the practical use of CFI in production systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Clinical cystoscopy, the current standard for bladder cancer diagnosis, suffers from significant reliance on physician expertise, leading to variability and subjectivity in diagnostic outcomes. There is an urgent need for objective, accurate, and efficient computational approaches to improve bladder cancer diagnostics.   Leveraging recent advancements in deep learning, this study proposes an integrated multi-task deep learning framework specifically designed for bladder cancer diagnosis from cystoscopic images. Our framework includes a robust classification model using EfficientNet-B0 enhanced with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), an advanced segmentation model based on ResNet34-UNet++ architecture with self-attention mechanisms and attention gating, and molecular subtyping using ConvNeXt-Tiny to classify molecular markers such as HER-2 and Ki-67. Additionally, we introduce a Gradio-based online diagnostic platform integrating all developed models, providing intuitive features including multi-format image uploads, bilingual interfaces, and dynamic threshold adjustments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks. This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating. Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities. Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and 28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper establishes a fundamental impossibility theorem: no LLM capable of performing non-trivial knowledge aggregation can simultaneously achieve truthful knowledge representation, semantic information conservation, complete revelation of relevant knowledge, and knowledge-constrained optimality. The impossibility is not an engineering limitation but arises from the mathematical structure of information aggregation itself.   We establish this result by describing the inference process as an auction of ideas, where distributed components compete exploiting their partial knowledge to shape responses. The proof spans three independent mathematical domains: mechanism design theory (Green-Laffont), the theory of proper scoring rules (Savage), and direct architectural analysis of transformers (Log-Sum-Exp convexity). In particular, we show how to quantify the creation of overconfident or intuitive responses-the signature of both hallucination and creativity, or imagination.   To support this analysis, we introduce the complementary concepts of the semantic information measure and the emergence operator to model bounded reasoning in a general setting. We prove that while bounded reasoning generates accessible information, providing valuable insights and inspirations, the idealized unconstrained reasoning strictly preserves semantic content.   By demonstrating that hallucination and imagination are mathematically identical phenomena-grounded in departures from truthfulness, semantic information conservation, revelation of relevant knowledge, and knowledge-constrained optimality-we offer a principled foundation for managing these behaviors in advanced AI systems. Finally, we present some speculative ideas to inspire evaluation and refinements of the proposed theory.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance, with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers, forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding, while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting, certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rise of large multi-modal AI models, fuelled by recent interest in large language models (LLMs), the notion of artificial general intelligence (AGI) went from being restricted to a fringe community, to dominate mainstream large AI development programs. In contrast, in this paper, we make a case for specialisation, by reviewing the pitfalls of generality and stressing the industrial value of specialised systems.   Our contribution is threefold. First, we review the most widely accepted arguments against specialisation, and discuss how their relevance in the context of human labour is actually an argument for specialisation in the case of non human agents, be they algorithms or human organisations. Second, we propose four arguments in favor of specialisation, ranging from machine learning robustness, to computer security, social sciences and cultural evolution. Third, we finally make a case for specification, discuss how the machine learning approach to AI has so far failed to catch up with good practices from safety-engineering and formal verification of software, and discuss how some emerging good practices in machine learning help reduce this gap. In particular, we justify the need for specified governance for hard-to-specify systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Intelligent agents must autonomously interact with the environments to perform daily tasks based on human-level instructions. They need a foundational understanding of the world to accurately interpret these instructions, along with precise low-level movement and interaction skills to execute the derived actions. In this work, we propose the first complete system for synthesizing physically plausible, long-horizon human-object interactions for object manipulation in contextual environments, driven by human-level instructions. We leverage large language models (LLMs) to interpret the input instructions into detailed execution plans. Unlike prior work, our system is capable of generating detailed finger-object interactions, in seamless coordination with full-body movements. We also train a policy to track generated motions in physics simulation via reinforcement learning (RL) to ensure physical plausibility of the motion. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in synthesizing realistic interactions with diverse objects in complex environments, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.

We introduce TS-Insight, a visual analytics tool explicitly designed to shed light on the internal decision mechanisms of Thompson Sampling-based algorithms, for model developers. It comprises multiple plots, tracing for each arm the evolving posteriors, evidence counts, and sampling outcomes, enabling the verification, diagnosis, and explainability of exploration/exploitation dynamics. This tool aims at fostering trust and facilitating effective debugging and deployment in complex binary decision-making scenarios especially in sensitive domains requiring interpretable decision-making.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task, enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model, DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Well-designed prompts are crucial for enhancing Large language models' (LLMs) reasoning capabilities while aligning their outputs with task requirements across diverse domains. However, manually designed prompts require expertise and iterative experimentation. While existing prompt optimization methods aim to automate this process, they rely heavily on external references such as ground truth or by humans, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where such data is unavailable or costly to obtain. To address this, we propose Self-Supervised Prompt Optimization (SPO), a cost-efficient framework that discovers effective prompts for both closed and open-ended tasks without requiring external reference. Motivated by the observations that prompt quality manifests directly in LLM outputs and LLMs can effectively assess adherence to task requirements, we derive evaluation and optimization signals purely from output comparisons. Specifically, SPO selects superior prompts through pairwise output comparisons evaluated by an LLM evaluator, followed by an LLM optimizer that aligns outputs with task requirements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPO outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods, achieving comparable or superior results with significantly lower costs (e.g., 1.1% to 5.6% of existing methods) and fewer samples (e.g., three samples). The code is available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/SPO.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a potential solution to automate the complex processes involved in writing literature reviews, such as literature collection, organization, and summarization. However, it is yet unclear how good LLMs are at automating comprehensive and reliable literature reviews. This study introduces a framework to automatically evaluate the performance of LLMs in three key tasks of literature writing: reference generation, literature summary, and literature review composition. We introduce multidimensional evaluation metrics that assess the hallucination rates in generated references and measure the semantic coverage and factual consistency of the literature summaries and compositions against human-written counterparts. The experimental results reveal that even the most advanced models still generate hallucinated references, despite recent progress. Moreover, we observe that the performance of different models varies across disciplines when it comes to writing literature reviews. These findings highlight the need for further research and development to improve the reliability of LLMs in automating academic literature reviews.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> CTR models play a vital role in improving user experience and boosting business revenue in many online personalized services. However, current CTR models generally encounter bottlenecks in performance improvement. Inspired by the scaling law phenomenon of LLMs, we propose a new paradigm for improving CTR predictions: first, constructing a CTR model with accuracy scalable to the model grade and data size, and then distilling the knowledge implied in this model into its lightweight model that can serve online users. To put it into practice, we construct a CTR model named SUAN (Stacked Unified Attention Network). In SUAN, we propose the UAB as a behavior sequence encoder. A single UAB unifies the modeling of the sequential and non-sequential features and also measures the importance of each user behavior feature from multiple perspectives. Stacked UABs elevate the configuration to a high grade, paving the way for performance improvement. In order to benefit from the high performance of the high-grade SUAN and avoid the disadvantage of its long inference time, we modify the SUAN with sparse self-attention and parallel inference strategies to form LightSUAN, and then adopt online distillation to train the low-grade LightSUAN, taking a high-grade SUAN as a teacher. The distilled LightSUAN has superior performance but the same inference time as the LightSUAN, making it well-suited for online deployment. Experimental results show that SUAN performs exceptionally well and holds the scaling laws spanning three orders of magnitude in model grade and data size, and the distilled LightSUAN outperforms the SUAN configured with one grade higher. More importantly, the distilled LightSUAN has been integrated into an online service, increasing the CTR by 2.81% and CPM by 1.69% while keeping the average inference time acceptable.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing. However, in knowledge graph question answering tasks (KGQA), there remains the issue of answering questions that require multi-hop reasoning. Existing methods rely on entity vector matching, but the purpose of the question is abstract and difficult to match with specific entities. As a result, it is difficult to establish reasoning paths to the purpose, which leads to information loss and redundancy. To address this issue, inspired by human reverse thinking, we propose Ontology-Guided Reverse Thinking (ORT), a novel framework that constructs reasoning paths from purposes back to conditions. ORT operates in three key phases: (1) using LLM to extract purpose labels and condition labels, (2) constructing label reasoning paths based on the KG ontology, and (3) using the label reasoning paths to guide knowledge retrieval. Experiments on the WebQSP and CWQ datasets show that ORT achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly enhances the capability of LLMs for KGQA.

  Aggregation Protocol with Forward and Backward Secrecy for Dynamic Users</h2>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple users to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing raw data, making it suitable for privacy-sensitive applications. However, local model or weight updates can still leak sensitive information. Secure aggregation protocols mitigate this risk by ensuring that only the aggregated updates are revealed. Among these, single-setup protocols, where key generation and exchange occur only once, are the most efficient due to reduced communication and computation overhead. However, existing single-setup protocols often lack support for dynamic user participation and do not provide strong privacy guarantees such as forward and backward secrecy. \par In this paper, we present a novel secure aggregation protocol that requires only a single setup for the entire FL training. Our protocol supports dynamic user participation, tolerates dropouts, and achieves both forward and backward secrecy. It leverages lightweight symmetric homomorphic encryption with a key negation technique to mask updates efficiently, eliminating the need for user-to-user communication. To defend against model inconsistency attacks, we introduce a low-overhead verification mechanism using message authentication codes (MACs). We provide formal security proofs under both semi-honest and malicious adversarial models and implement a full prototype. Experimental results show that our protocol reduces user-side computation by up to $99\%$ compared to state-of-the-art protocols like e-SeaFL (ACSAC'24), while maintaining competitive model accuracy. These features make our protocol highly practical for real-world FL deployments, especially on resource-constrained devices.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) in applications inevitably comes with the expansion of the attack surface, combining new security threats along with the traditional ones. Consequently, numerous research and industrial initiatives aim to mitigate the GenAI related security threats by developing evaluation methods and designing defenses. However, while most of the GenAI security work focuses on universal threats (e.g. 'How to build a bomb'), there is significantly less discussion on application-level security and how to evaluate and mitigate it. Thus, in this work we adopt an application-centric approach to GenAI security, and show that while LLMs cannot protect against ad-hoc application specific threats, they can provide the framework for applications to protect themselves against such threats. Our first contribution is defining Security Steerability - a novel security measure for LLMs, assessing the model's capability to adhere to strict guardrails that are defined in the system prompt (e.g. 'Refrain from discussing about our competitors'). These guardrails, in case effective, can stop threats in the presence of malicious users who attempt to circumvent the application purpose. Our second contribution is a methodology to measure the security steerability of LLMs, utilizing a newly-developed benchmark called VeganRibs which assesses the LLM behavior in forcing specific guardrails that are not security per-se, in the presence of malicious user that tries to bypass the guardrails through prompt injection attacks with attack boosters (jailbreaks and perturbations). Using the new benchmark, we analyzed 18 open-source LLMs, demonstrating significant differences between their security steerability that are not trivial to foresee...

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language model (LLM) agents are widely deployed in real-world applications, where they leverage tools to retrieve and manipulate external data for complex tasks. However, when interacting with untrusted data sources (e.g., fetching information from public websites), tool responses may contain injected instructions that covertly influence agent behaviors and lead to malicious outcomes, a threat referred to as Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI). Existing defenses typically rely on advanced prompting strategies or auxiliary detection models. While these methods have demonstrated some effectiveness, they fundamentally rely on assumptions about the model's inherent security, which lacks structural constraints on agent behaviors. As a result, agents still retain unrestricted access to tool invocations, leaving them vulnerable to stronger attack vectors that can bypass the security guardrails of the model. To prevent malicious tool invocations at the source, we propose a novel defensive task execution paradigm, called IPIGuard, which models the agents' task execution process as a traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph (TDG). By explicitly decoupling action planning from interaction with external data, IPIGuard significantly reduces unintended tool invocations triggered by injected instructions, thereby enhancing robustness against IPI attacks. Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark show that IPIGuard achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and robustness, paving the way for the development of safer agentic systems in dynamic environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven growing interest in LLM-based agents for complex planning tasks. To avoid costly agent training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions, which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences. This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning. When facing environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan correction.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text clustering aims to automatically partition a collection of documents into coherent groups based on their linguistic features. In the literature, this task is formulated either as metric clustering over pre-trained text embeddings or as graph clustering based on pairwise similarities derived from an oracle, e.g., a large machine learning model. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved this field by providing high-quality contextualized embeddings and accurate semantic similarity estimates. However, leveraging LLMs at scale introduces substantial computational and financial costs due to the large number of required API queries or inference calls. To address this issue, we propose Cequel, a cost-effective framework that achieves accurate text clustering under a limited budget of LLM queries. At its core, Cequel constructs must-link and cannot-link constraints by selectively querying LLMs on informative text pairs or triplets, identified via our proposed algorithms, EdgeLLM and TriangleLLM. These constraints are then utilized in a weighted constrained clustering algorithm to form high-quality clusters. Specifically, EdgeLLM and TriangleLLM employ carefully designed greedy selection strategies and prompting techniques to identify and extract informative constraints efficiently. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Cequel consistently outperforms existing methods in unsupervised text clustering under the same query budget.
