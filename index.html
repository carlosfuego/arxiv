                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their exceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent \textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.   Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its classification and analysis.   Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of \textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present CoSense-LLM, an edge-first framework that turns continuous multimodal sensor streams (for example Wi-Fi CSI, IMU, audio, RFID, and lightweight vision) into compact, verifiable semantic tokens and coordinates with large language models under explicit latency, energy, bandwidth, and privacy constraints. CoSense-LLM has four parts: (i) SenseFusion, a lightweight encoder that aligns sensor embeddings with language and compresses them into short discrete code sequences; (ii) Edge-RAG, a local hybrid retrieval layer that grounds generation in site specific policies and notes; (iii) PromptRouter, a cost and uncertainty aware policy that selects edge only generation, edge plus retrieval, or compact cloud escalation; and (iv) Secure Execution, an auditable redaction path that enforces data minimization so raw waveforms never leave the device. The system works with modern serving optimizations, including paged or streaming KV caches, FlashAttention style kernels, speculative decoding, and quantized LoRA adapters, and supports on device personalization and federated updates under non IID drift. Across home, office, and clinic deployments, CoSense-LLM delivers grounded explanations while meeting tight service level objectives: it sustains sub second (p95) end to end latency on edge dominant paths, reduces inter tier token and bandwidth costs by preferring local retrieval grounded responses, and preserves privacy by transmitting only discrete codes and redacted metadata. Ablations show that Edge-RAG improves factual consistency and reduces contradictions, calibrated uncertainty enables selective abstention and controlled escalations, and KV plus decoding accelerators lower energy per decision. The results support an edge first design that treats semantics, privacy, and predictable latency as co equal goals for large model deployments in interference prone environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, leveraging denoising-based generation to enable inherent parallelism. Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models emerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a standardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient and extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference pipeline into four modular components--model, diffusion iteration manager, decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager--and integrates novel algorithms for each component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination of algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial efficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE. At batch size 1, it surpasses 1,100 tokens per second on HumanEval and averages over 800 tokens per second across six benchmarks on $8\times$ H800 GPUs. Compared to prior systems, dInfer delivers a $10\times$ speedup over Fast-dLLM while maintaining similar model performance. Even compared to the AR model (with a comparable number of activation parameters and performance) QWen2.5-3B, which is highly optimized with the latest vLLM inference engine, dInfer still delivers a $2$-$3\times$ speedup. The implementation of dInfer is open-sourced at https://github.com/inclusionAI/dInfer.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the goal of improving the security of Internet protocols, we seek faster, semi-automatic methods to discover new vulnerabilities in protocols such as DNS, BGP, and others. To this end, we introduce the LLM-Assisted Protocol Attack Discovery (LAPRAD) methodology, enabling security researchers with some DNS knowledge to efficiently uncover vulnerabilities that would otherwise be hard to detect.   LAPRAD follows a three-stage process. In the first, we consult an LLM (GPT-o1) that has been trained on a broad corpus of DNS-related sources and previous DDoS attacks to identify potential exploits. In the second stage, a different LLM automatically constructs the corresponding attack configurations using the ReACT approach implemented via LangChain (DNS zone file generation). Finally, in the third stage, we validate the attack's functionality and effectiveness.   Using LAPRAD, we uncovered three new DDoS attacks on the DNS protocol and rediscovered two recently reported ones that were not included in the LLM's training data. The first new attack employs a bait-and-switch technique to trick resolvers into caching large, bogus DNSSEC RRSIGs, reducing their serving capacity to as little as 6%. The second exploits large DNSSEC encryption algorithms (RSA-4096) with multiple keys, thereby bypassing a recently implemented default RRSet limit. The third leverages ANY-type responses to produce a similar effect.   These variations of a cache-flushing DDoS attack, called SigCacheFlush, circumvent existing patches, severely degrade resolver query capacity, and impact the latest versions of major DNS resolver implementations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the growing use of embedded systems in various industries, the need for automated platforms for the development and deployment of customized Linux-based operating systems has become more important. This research was conducted with the aim of designing and implementing an integrated and reproducible infrastructure for the development, building, and testing of a Linux-based operating system using the Yocto Project. The proposed structure was implemented based on a three-layer architecture consisting of the main Yocto repositories, a custom layer (meta-custom), and a coordinating manifest layer to ensure version synchronization, scalability, and reproducibility. Three sample projects, including libhelloworld, helloworld, and the kernel module hello mod, were developed and integrated into the build process. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines were implemented with GitLab CI and combined with an isolated Docker environment to automate and streamline the build and testing workflows. Using a local cache server containing hashserv, downloads and sstate cache significantly reduced the build time. The functionality and stability of the system were verified through six boot test scenarios in the QEMU simulator. The results show that the proposed design not only ensures reproducibility but also can be extended to advanced applications such as continuous deployment of real-time Linux versions. Future recommendations include expanding automated tests, implementing system monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana, using distributed builds, optimizing with Docker multi-stage builds, and enabling continuous deployment of real-time Linux changes to provide a stable and scalable model for industrial and research projects in embedded systems with a rapid and reliable development cycle.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs nearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those specifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on several widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the effectiveness and superiority of our method. Our code will be publicly available.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multi-hop retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising strategy for complex reasoning, yet existing iterative prompting approaches remain inefficient. They often regenerate predictable token sequences at every step and rely on stochastic stopping, leading to excessive token usage and unstable termination. We propose TSSS (Think Straight, Stop Smart), a structured multi-hop RAG framework designed for efficiency. TSSS introduces (i) a template-based reasoning that caches recurring prefixes and anchors sub-queries to the main question, reducing token generation cost while promoting stable reasoning, and (ii) a retriever-based terminator, which deterministically halts reasoning once additional sub-queries collapse into repetition. This separation of structured reasoning and termination control enables both faster inference and more reliable answers. On HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHop, and MuSiQue, TSSS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and competitive efficiency among RAG-CoT approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in efficiency-constrained scenarios such as on-device inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Today's Internet infrastructure is centered around content retrieval over HTTP, with middleboxes (e.g., HTTP proxies) playing a crucial role in performance, security, and cost-effectiveness. We envision a future where Internet communication will be dominated by "prompts" sent to generative AI models. For this, we will need proxies that provide similar functions to HTTP proxies (e.g., caching, routing, compression) while dealing with unique challenges and opportunities of prompt-based communication. As a first step toward supporting prompt-based communication, we present LLMBridge, an LLM proxy designed for cost-conscious users, such as those in developing regions and education (e.g., students, instructors). LLMBridge supports three key optimizations: model selection (routing prompts to the most suitable model), context management (intelligently reducing the amount of context), and semantic caching (serving prompts using local models and vector databases). These optimizations introduce trade-offs between cost and quality, which applications navigate through a high-level, bidirectional interface. As case studies, we deploy LLMBridge in two cost-sensitive settings: a WhatsApp-based Q&A service and a university classroom environment. The WhatsApp service has been live for over twelve months, serving 100+ users and handling more than 14.7K requests. In parallel, we exposed LLMBridge to students across three computer science courses over a semester, where it supported diverse LLM-powered applications - such as reasoning agents and chatbots - and handled an average of 500 requests per day. We report on deployment experiences across both settings and use the collected workloads to benchmark the effectiveness of various cost-optimization strategies, analyzing their trade-offs in cost, latency, and response quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cloud platforms host thousands of tenants that demand POSIX semantics, high throughput, and rapid evolution from their storage layer. Kernel-native distributed file systems supply raw speed, but their privileged code base couples every release to the kernel, widens the blast radius of crashes, and slows innovation. FUSE-based distributed file systems flip those trade-offs: they run in user space for fast deployment and strong fault isolation, yet the FUSE interface disables the kernel's write-back page cache whenever strong consistency is required. Practitioners must therefore choose between (i) weak consistency with fast write-back caching or (ii) strong consistency with slow write-through I/O, a limitation that has kept FUSE distributed file systems out of write-intensive cloud workloads.   To this end, we present DFUSE, the first distributed FUSE file system that delivers write-back kernel caching and strong consistency. DFUSE achieves this by offloading userspace consistency control to the kernel driver, allowing coordinated access to the kernel's page cache across nodes. This design eliminates blind local cache updates and ensures cluster-wide strong consistency without compromising performance. In our evaluation, DFUSE achieves up to 68.0% higher throughput and 40.4% lower latency than the existing write-through design of FUSE-based distributed file systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Requests arriving at main memory are often different from what programmers can observe or estimate by using CPU-based monitoring. Hardware cache prefetching, memory request scheduling and interleaving cause a loss of observability that limits potential data movement and tiering optimizations. In response, memory-side telemetry hardware like page access heat map units (HMU) and page prefetchers were proposed to inform Operating Systems with accurate usage data. However, it is still hard to map memory activity to software program functions and objects because of the decoupled nature of host processors and memory devices. Valuable program context is stripped out from the memory bus, leaving only commands, addresses and data. Programmers have expert knowledge of future data accesses, priorities, and access to processor state, which could be useful hints for runtime memory device optimization. This paper makes context visible at memory devices by encoding any user-visible state as detectable packets in the memory read address stream, in a nondestructive manner without significant capacity overhead, drivers or special access privileges. We prototyped an end-to-end system with metadata injection that can be reliably detected and decoded from a memory address trace, either by a host processor, or a memory module. We illustrate a use case with precise code execution markers and object address range tracking. In the future, real time metadata decoding with near-memory computing (NMC) could provide customized telemetry and statistics to users, or act on application hints to perform functions like prioritizing requests, remapping data and reconfiguring devices.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Autoregressive image generation models like Janus-Pro produce high-quality images, but at the significant cost of high memory and ever-growing computational demands due to the large number of visual tokens. While KV cache compression has been extensively studied in language modeling, it still remains largely unexplored for the image generation domain. In this work, we begin by identifying a distinct and prominent attention phenomenon, which we term spatial locality and emergent semantic sink. To leverage this key insight, we introduce a novel KV cache compression framework. Specifically, we compress the KV cache for all visual tokens by adaptively decoupling attention heads into two separate types: for spatial-locality heads, our method maintains a short recent token window; for semantic-sink heads, it strategically preserves a compact set of highly-attended tokens. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a 5$\times$ reduction in memory usage and a notable 6.6$\times$ speedup in overall throughput with only minimal visual quality loss, thereby enabling highly efficient native autoregressive image generation on resource-constrained hardware.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Output-intensive scientific applications are highly sensitive to low storage throughput. While existing scientific application stacks are optimized for traditional High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments with high remote storage and network bandwidth, these assumptions often fail in modern settings like cloud deployment. This is because the existing scientific application I/O stack fails to leverage the available resources. At the same time, scientific applications exhibit special synchronization and data output requirements that are difficult to satisfy using traditional approaches such as block-level or filesystem-level caching. We introduce ParaLog, a distributed host-side logging approach designed to accelerate scientific applications transparently. ParaLog emphasizes deployability, enabling support for unmodified message passing interface (MPI) applications and implementations while preserving crash consistency semantics. We evaluate ParaLog across traditional HPC, cloud HPC, local clusters, and hybrid environments, demonstrating its capability to reduce end-to-end execution time by 13-26% for popular scientific applications in cloud settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The reasoning large language model (RLLM) has been proven competitive in solving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics, coding, compared to general LLM. However, the serving performance and behavior of RLLM remains unexplored, which may undermine the deployment and utilization of RLLM in real-world scenario. To close this gap, in this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of RLLM service. We first perform a pilot study on comparing the serving performance between RLLM and traditional LLM and reveal that there are several distinct differences regarding serving behavior: (1) significant memory usage and fluctuations; (2) straggler requests; (3) adaptive running time; (4) domain preference. Then we further investigate whether existing inference optimization techniques are valid for RLLM. Our main takeaways are that model quantization methods and speculative decoding can improve service system efficiency with small compromise to RLLM accuracy, while prefix caching, KV cache quantization may even degrade accuracy or serving performance for small RLLM. Lastly, we conduct evaluation under real world workload modeled by Gamma distribution to verify our findings. Empirical results of real world workload evaluation across different dataset are aligned with our main findings regarding RLLM serving. We hope our work can provide the research community and industry with insights to advance RLLM inference serving.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in complex multi-agent applications that use external function calls. This workload creates severe performance challenges for the KV Cache: space contention leads to the eviction of critical agents' caches and time underutilization leaves the cache of agents stalled on long-running tool calls idling in GPU memory. We present Tokencake, a KV-Cache-centric serving framework that co-optimizes scheduling and memory management with an agent-aware design. Tokencake's Space Scheduler uses dynamic memory partitioning to shield critical agents from contention, while its Time Scheduler employs a proactive offload and predictive upload mechanism to repurpose GPU memory during function call stalls. Our evaluation on representative multi-agent benchmarks shows that Tokencake can reduce end-to-end latency by over 47.06%, improve effective GPU memory utilization by up to 16.9% compared to vLLM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Object-goal navigation (ObjNav) tasks an agent with navigating to the location of a specific object in an unseen environment. Embodied agents equipped with large language models (LLMs) and online constructed navigation maps can perform ObjNav in a zero-shot manner. However, existing agents heavily rely on giant LLMs on the cloud, e.g., GPT-4, while directly switching to small LLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-11b, suffer from significant success rate drops due to limited model capacity for understanding complex navigation maps, which prevents deploying ObjNav on local devices. At the same time, the long prompt introduced by the navigation map description will cause high planning latency on local devices. In this paper, we propose EfficientNav to enable on-device efficient LLM-based zero-shot ObjNav. To help the smaller LLMs better understand the environment, we propose semantics-aware memory retrieval to prune redundant information in navigation maps. To reduce planning latency, we propose discrete memory caching and attention-based memory clustering to efficiently save and re-use the KV cache. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that EfficientNav achieves 11.1% improvement in success rate on HM3D benchmark over GPT-4-based baselines, and demonstrates 6.7x real-time latency reduction and 4.7x end-to-end latency reduction over GPT-4 planner. Our code will be released soon.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities, enabling direct action generation from visual perception and language instructions in an end-to-end manner. However, their substantial computational cost poses a challenge for real-time robotic control, where rapid decision-making is essential. This paper introduces VLA-Cache, a training-free inference acceleration method that reduces computational overhead by adaptively caching and reusing static visual tokens across frames. Exploiting the temporal continuity in robotic manipulation, VLA-Cache identifies minimally changed tokens between adjacent frames and reuses their cached key-value representations, thereby circumventing redundant computations. Additionally, to maintain action precision, VLA-Cache selectively re-computes task-relevant tokens that are environmentally sensitive, ensuring the fidelity of critical visual information. To further optimize efficiency, we introduce a layer adaptive token reusing strategy that dynamically adjusts the reuse ratio based on attention concentration across decoder layers, prioritizing critical tokens for recomputation. Extensive experiments on two simulation platforms (LIBERO and SIMPLER) and a real-world robotic system demonstrate that VLA-Cache achieves up to 1.7x speedup in CUDA latency and a 15% increase in control frequency, with negligible loss on task success rate.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) face persistent challenges when handling long-context tasks, most notably the lost in the middle issue, where information located in the middle of a long input tends to be underutilized. Some existing methods that reduce input have the risk of discarding key information, while others that extend context windows often lead to attention dispersion. To address these limitations, we propose Tree of Agents (TOA), a multi-agent reasoning framework that segments the input into chunks processed by independent agents. Each agent generates its local cognition, then agents dynamically exchange information for collaborative reasoning along tree-structured paths. TOA enables agents to probe different reasoning orders for multi-perspective understanding, effectively mitigating position bias and reducing hallucinations. To improve processing efficiency, we incorporate prefix-hash caching and adaptive pruning strategies, achieving significant performance improvements with comparable API overhead. Experiments show that TOA, powered by compact LLaMA3.1-8B, significantly outperforms multiple baselines and demonstrates comparable performance to the latest and much larger commercial models, such as Gemini1.5-pro, on various long-context tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion language models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to the long-dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm, offering a parallelable decoding process that could yield greater efficiency. Yet, in practice, current open-source DLMs often underperform their AR counterparts in speed, limiting their real-world utility. This work presents a systematic study of DLM efficiency, identifying key issues in prior evaluation methods. Through empirical benchmarking and a roofline-based theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that AR models generally achieve higher throughput, while DLMs consistently lag. We also investigate acceleration strategies, finding that techniques like dual cache and parallel decoding mainly offer gains at small batch sizes, with their benefits diminishing upon scaling. Our findings underscore the necessity of robust evaluation methods and improved acceleration strategies to advance research on DLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) now support context windows of hundreds of thousands to millions of tokens, enabling applications such as long-document summarization, large-scale code synthesis, multi-document question answering and persistent multi-turn dialogue. However, such extended contexts exacerbate the quadratic cost of self-attention, leading to severe latency in autoregressive decoding. Existing sparse attention methods alleviate these costs but rely on heuristic patterns that struggle to recall critical key-value (KV) pairs for each query, resulting in accuracy degradation. We introduce Adamas, a lightweight yet highly accurate sparse attention mechanism designed for long-context inference. Adamas applies the Hadamard transform, bucketization and 2-bit compression to produce compact representations, and leverages Manhattan-distance estimation for efficient top-k selections. Experiments show that Adamas matches the accuracy of full attention with only a 64-token budget, achieves near-lossless performance at 128, and supports up to 8x higher sparsity than prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while delivering up to 4.4x self-attention and 1.5x end-to-end speedups on 32K-length sequences. Remarkably, Adamas attains comparable or even lower perplexity than full attention, underscoring its effectiveness in maintaining accuracy under aggressive sparsity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The wide deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to strong demands for optimizing their inference performance. Today's techniques serving this purpose primarily focus on reducing latency and improving throughput through algorithmic and hardware enhancements, while largely overlooking their privacy side effects, particularly in a multi-user environment. In our research, for the first time, we discovered a set of new timing side channels in LLM systems, arising from shared caches and GPU memory allocations, which can be exploited to infer both confidential system prompts and those issued by other users. These vulnerabilities echo security challenges observed in traditional computing systems, highlighting an urgent need to address potential information leakage in LLM serving infrastructures. In this paper, we report novel attack strategies designed to exploit such timing side channels inherent in LLM deployments, specifically targeting the Key-Value (KV) cache and semantic cache widely used to enhance LLM inference performance. Our approach leverages timing measurements and classification models to detect cache hits, allowing an adversary to infer private prompts with high accuracy. We also propose a token-by-token search algorithm to efficiently recover shared prompt prefixes in the caches, showing the feasibility of stealing system prompts and those produced by peer users. Our experimental studies on black-box testing of popular online LLM services demonstrate that such privacy risks are completely realistic, with significant consequences. Our findings underscore the need for robust mitigation to protect LLM systems against such emerging threats.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Surrogate models can play a pivotal role in enhancing performance in contemporary High-Performance Computing applications. Cache-based surrogates use already calculated simulation results to interpolate or extrapolate further simulation output values. But this approach only pays off if the access time to retrieve the needed values is much faster than the actual simulation. While the most existing key-value stores use a Client-Server architecture with dedicated storage nodes, this is not the most suitable architecture for HPC applications. Instead, we propose a distributed architecture where the parallel processes offer a part of their available memory to build a shared distributed hash table based on MPI. This paper presents three DHT approaches with the special requirements of HPC applications in mind. The presented lock-free design outperforms both DHT versions which use explicit synchronization by coarse-grained resp. fine-grained locking. The lock-free DHT shows very good scaling regarding read and write performance. The runtime of a coupled reactive transport simulation was improved between 14% and 42% using the lock-free DHT as a surrogate model.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Unlike offline processing, streaming video vision-language models face two fundamental constraints: causality and accumulation. Causality prevents access to future frames that offline methods exploit, while accumulation causes tokens to grow unbounded, creating efficiency bottlenecks. However, existing approaches only regulate post-LLM kv-cache, leaving costly pre-LLM prefill unchanged. We introduce StreamingTOM, a training-free, plug-and-play two-stage framework that addresses both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks with predictable latency. Causal Temporal Reduction imposes a fixed per-frame budget and selects tokens based on adjacent-frame changes and token saliency, drastically reducing per-frame prefill cost by processing only a compact subset of visual tokens per frame instead of all visual tokens. Online Quantized Memory stores tokens in 4-bit format, retrieves relevant groups on demand, and dequantizes them, keeping the active kv-cache bounded regardless of stream length. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves $15.7\times$ kv-cache compression, $1.2\times$ lower peak memory and $2\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. StreamingTOM maintains state-of-the-art accuracy among training-free methods with an average of $63.8\%$ on offline benchmarks and $55.8\%/3.7$ on RVS. These results highlight the practical benefits of our two-stage approach for efficient streaming video understanding with bounded growth.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision Language Models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced in integrating visual and textual reasoning, powering applications across high-resolution image understanding, long-video analysis, and multi-turn conversation. However, their scalability remains limited by the growing number of visual tokens that dominate inference latency. We present SparseVILA, a new paradigm for efficient VLM inference that decouples visual sparsity across the prefilling and decoding stages. SparseVILA distributes sparsity across stages by pruning redundant visual tokens during prefill and retrieving only query-relevant tokens during decoding. This decoupled design matches leading prefill pruning methods while preserving multi-turn fidelity by retaining most of the visual cache so that query-aware tokens can be retrieved at each conversation round. Built on an AWQ-optimized inference pipeline, SparseVILA achieves up to 4.0 times faster prefilling, 2.5 times faster decoding, and an overall 2.6 times end-to-end speedup on long-context video tasks -- while improving accuracy on document-understanding and reasoning tasks. By decoupling query-agnostic pruning and query-aware retrieval, SparseVILA establishes a new direction for efficient multimodal inference, offering a training-free, architecture-agnostic framework for accelerating large VLMs without sacrificing capability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in chain of thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the current LLM reasoning paradigm initiates thinking only after the entire input is available, which introduces unnecessary latency and weakens attention to earlier information in dynamic scenarios. Inspired by human cognition of thinking while reading, we first design a \textit{\textbf{streaming thinking}} paradigm for LLMs, where reasoning unfolds in the order of input and further adjusts its depth once reading is complete. We instantiate this paradigm with \textit{StreamingThinker}, a framework that enables LLMs to think while reading through the integration of streaming CoT generation, streaming-constraint training, and streaming parallel inference. Specifically, StreamingThinker employs streaming reasoning units with quality control for CoT generation, enforces order-preserving reasoning through streaming attention masks and position encoding, and leverages parallel KV caches that decouple input encoding from reasoning generation, thereby ensuring alignment and enabling true concurrency. We evaluate StreamingThinker on the Qwen3 model family across math reasoning, logical reasoning, and context-based QA reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that the StreamingThinker preserves performance comparable to batch thinking, while yielding an 80\% reduction in token waiting before the onset of reasoning and a more than 60\% reduction in time-level latency for producing the final answer, demonstrating the effectiveness of the streaming paradigm for LLM reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Even when prompts and parameters are secured, transformer language models remain vulnerable because their key-value (KV) cache during inference constitutes an overlooked attack surface. This paper introduces Malicious Token Injection (MTI), a modular framework that systematically perturbs cached key vectors at selected layers and timesteps through controlled magnitude and frequency, using additive Gaussian noise, zeroing, and orthogonal rotations. A theoretical analysis quantifies how these perturbations propagate through attention, linking logit deviations to the Frobenius norm of corruption and softmax Lipschitz dynamics. Empirical results show that MTI significantly alters next-token distributions and downstream task performance across GPT-2 and LLaMA-2/7B, as well as destabilizes retrieval-augmented and agentic reasoning pipelines. These findings identify cache integrity as a critical yet underexplored vulnerability in current LLM deployments, positioning cache corruption as a reproducible and theoretically grounded threat model for future robustness and security research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video reasoning using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) relies on costly reinforcement learning (RL) and verbose chain-of-thought, resulting in substantial computational overhead during both training and inference. Moreover, the mechanisms that control the thinking process in these reasoning models are very limited. In this paper, using entropy of the model's output as a signal, we discover that the high-quality models go through a series of micro-explorations and micro-exploitations which keep the reasoning process grounded (i.e., avoid excessive randomness while the model is exploring or thinking through an answer). We further observe that once this "thinking" process is over, more accurate models demonstrate a better convergence by reducing the entropy significantly via a final exploitation phase (i.e., a more certain convergence towards a solution trajectory). We then use these novel, theoretically-grounded insights to tune the model's behavior directly at inference, without using any RL or supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, during inference, our proposed approach called V-Reason (Video-Reason) adapts the value cache of the LMM via a few optimization steps on a small, trainable controller using an entropy-based objective, i.e., no supervision from any dataset or RL is necessary. This tuning improves the model's micro-exploration and exploitation behavior during inference. Our experiments show that our proposed method achieves significant improvements over the base instruction-tuned models across several video reasoning datasets, narrowing the gap with RL-trained models to within 0.6% average accuracy without any training, while offering massive efficiency benefits: output tokens are reduced by 58.6% compared to the RL model.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the main text published at USENIX Security 2025, we presented a systematic analysis of the role of cache occupancy in the design considerations for randomized caches (from the perspectives of performance and security). On the performance front, we presented a uniform benchmarking strategy that allows for a fair comparison among different randomized cache designs. Likewise, from the security perspective, we presented three threat assumptions: (1) covert channels; (2) process fingerprinting side-channel; and (3) AES key recovery. The main takeaway of our work is an open problem of designing a randomized cache of comparable efficiency with modern set-associative LLCs, while still resisting both contention-based and occupancy-based attacks. This note is meant as an addendum to the main text in light of the observations made in [2]. To summarize, the authors in [2] argue that (1) L1d cache size plays a role in adversarial success, and that (2) a patched version of MIRAGE with randomized initial seeding of global eviction map prevents leakage of AES key. We discuss the same in this addendum.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer models have driven breakthroughs across various language tasks by their strong capability to learn rich contextual representations. Scaling them to improve representation, however, often demands substantial memory and compute costs, such as the Key-Value (KV) cache used during auto-regressive decoding. Skip connections offer a promising way to improve representation without bloating resource usage, yet most prior works either improve expressivity while leaving KV costs unchanged, or reduce memory at the cost of weaker representation. In this work, we propose SkipV1Former, a Transformer variant that uses skip connections from the first layer's Value heads to strengthen model representation and reduce KV cache. Specifically, from the second block onward, each layer reuses half of its Value heads from the very first layer, while computing the other half as usual-cutting Value projections and V cache by nearly 50 \%. Theoretically, we show that routing uncompressed first-layer Values into deeper layers restores information lost to compression and accelerates the model's implicit mesa-optimization-a key pattern of Transformer in auto-regressive tasks. Empirically, across different model scales, SkipV1Former delivers consistent reductions of approximately 25 \% in KV cache while improving perplexity relative to standard Multi-Head Attention (MHA) Transformers and some advanced variants. Moreover, we propose a recipe for uptraining existing MHA Transformer checkpoints to SkipV1Former with only 10-15\% additional compute. Finally, SkipV1Former can seamlessly combine advanced methods like Group-Query Attention and Multi-Latent Attention to achieve further KV cache savings and performance improvement. When combined with YOCO, it cuts KV cache size by nearly 50 \% while still improving performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid scaling of language models (LMs) has resulted in unprecedented computational, memory, and energy requirements, making their training and deployment increasingly unsustainable. Quantization has emerged as an essential compression technique to reduce model size, alleviate memory bottlenecks, and accelerate inference. However, while uniform low-bit quantization (e.g., INT8, INT4) provides significant efficiency gains, it can degrade accuracy in sensitive components of transformer-based LMs. Mixed-precision quantization offers a promising alternative by selectively allocating precision across layers or within tensors to balance efficiency and accuracy. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Mixed-Precision quantization frameworks for LMs (MXPLMs). We first review quantization fundamentals, including uniform and non-uniform quantizers, quantization granularity, and methods widely used in post-training quantization. We then categorize and compare recent MXPLM frameworks according to their bit allocation strategies and precision configurations across weights, activations, and key-value caches. A comparative analysis highlights differences in perplexity, zero-shot task performance, and deployment trade-offs. Furthermore, we contrast MXPLMs with earlier mixed-precision quantization methods for deep neural networks, identifying strategies that transfer and those that face challenges in the LM setting. Finally, we summarize open issues and future directions, including hardware-aware design, activation quantization, and scalable optimization methods for billion-parameter models. By consolidating recent advances, this work serves as a reference for understanding the current landscape and research prospects of mixed-precision quantization for large-scale language models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantization has emerged as an effective and lightweight solution to reduce the memory footprint of the KV cache in Large Language Models. Nevertheless, minimizing the accuracy degradation caused by ultra-low-bit KV cache quantization remains a significant challenge. While scalar quantization is constrained by 1-bit bound, vector quantization exploits intra-vector correlations and enables sub-bit regimes, making it more suitable for ultra-low-bit quantization. To further mitigate quantization-induced degradation, we reveal that the degradation is highly uneven across tokens in attention quality. To investigate this unevenness, we introduce anchor score to measure each token's sensitivity to quantization. Our analysis and experiments show that preserving a small subset (1\%) of tokens with the highest Anchor Score significantly mitigates accuracy loss under aggressive quantization.   We propose AnTKV, a dual-stage framework that leverages anchor token-aware vector quantization to compress the KV cache. It combines offline token-aware centroids learning and online anchor token selection to balance compression and accuracy. To enable efficient deployment, we design an online anchor token selection kernel compatible with FlashAttention. It allows LLaMA3-8B to scale to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100, while delivering up to $3.5\times$ higher decoding throughput over the FP16 baseline. Experiments demonstrate that AnTKV matches or surpasses prior methods at 4-bit, and significantly reduce perplexity under ultra-low-bit quantization, achieving 6.32 at 1-bit on Mistral-7B, compared to 7.25 for CQ and 15.36 for KVQuant.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Private large language model (LLM) inference based on secure multi-party computation (MPC) achieves formal data privacy protection but suffers from significant latency overhead, especially for long input sequences. While key-value (KV) cache eviction and sparse attention algorithms have been proposed for efficient LLM inference in plaintext, they are not designed for MPC and cannot benefit private LLM inference directly. In this paper, we propose an accurate and MPC-friendly KV cache eviction framework, dubbed MPCache, building on the observation that historical tokens in a long sequence may have different effects on the downstream decoding. Hence, MPCache combines a look-once static eviction algorithm to discard unimportant KV cache and a query-aware dynamic selection algorithm to activate only a small subset of KV cache for attention computation. MPCache further incorporates a series of optimizations for efficient dynamic KV cache selection, including MPC-friendly similarity approximation, hierarchical KV cache clustering, and cross-layer index-sharing strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MPCache consistently outperforms prior-art KV cache eviction baselines across different generation tasks and achieves 1.8 ~ 2.01x and 3.39 ~ 8.37x decoding latency and communication reduction on different sequence lengths, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Context compression presents a promising approach for accelerating large language model (LLM) inference by compressing long contexts into compact representations. Current context compression methods predominantly rely on autoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress contextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to acquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a fundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge from actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial for real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel method that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture that is equipped with this compression capability \textit{a priori}. Instead of training models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly selects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates contextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving representations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need for autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly leveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor embeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2) bidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture information from the entire context. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC consistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various compression ratios. On out-of-distribution evaluation using MRQA, SAC achieves 1 EM improvement at 5x compression over strong baselines, with increasing advantages at higher compression ratios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are integral to tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering, but their high computational cost, driven by large memory footprints and processing time, limits their scalability and real-time applicability. In this work, we propose leveraging Singular-Value Decomposition (SVD) over the joint query (Q), key (K), and value (V) weight matrices to reduce KV cache size and computational overhead. We in addition introduce an efficient rank allocation strategy that dynamically adjusts the SVD rank based on its impact on VLM accuracy, achieving a significant reduction in both memory usage and computational cost. Finally, we extend this approach by applying quantization to both VLM weights and activations, resulting in a highly efficient VLM. Our method outperforms previous approaches that rely solely on quantization or SVD by achieving more than $10\%$ accuracy improvement while consuming less hardware cost, making it better for real-time deployment on resource-constrained devices.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities. To further enhance LLM capabilities, recent agentic systems, such as Deep Research, incorporate web interactions into LLM reasoning to mitigate uncertainties and reduce potential errors. However, existing research predominantly focuses on reasoning performance, often neglecting the efficiency of agentic systems. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical study that identifies efficiency bottlenecks in web-interactive agentic systems. We decompose end-to-end latency into two primary components: LLM API latency and web environment latency. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study across 15 models and 5 providers to demonstrate high variability in API-based agentic systems. We observe that web environment latency can contribute as much as 53.7% to the overall latency in a web-based agentic system. To improve latency, we propose SpecCache, a caching framework augmented with speculative execution that can reduce web environment overhead. Extensive evaluations on two standard benchmarks show that our approach improves the cache hit rate by up to 58x compared to a random caching strategy, while reducing web environment overhead by up to 3.2x, without degrading agentic system performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Electron spin resonance spectroscopy is a widely used technique for analyzing the microscopic structure, local environment and reorientation of atomic and molecular systems. Conventional inductive detection methods typically require to probe more than a billion of electron spins such that single atom motion is hidden through ensemble averaging. While several single spin spectroscopy methods are currently available, they have been so far limited to static systems. Here we demonstrate single spin spectroscopy of a fluorescent tumbling defect in silicon called the G center, behaving as a pseudo-molecule randomly reorienting itself in the crystalline matrix. Using high-resolution spin spectroscopy, we reveal a fine magnetic structure resulting from the spin principal axes jumping between discrete orientations in the crystal. By modeling the atomic reorientation of the defect, we demonstrate that spin tumbling induces variations in the coupling to the microwave magnetic field, enabling position-dependent Rabi frequencies to be detected in coherent spin control experiments. By virtue of its pseudo-molecule configuration, the G center in silicon is a unique quantum system to investigate the mutual interaction between optical, spin and rotation properties in a highly versatile material.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> FHE-SQL is a privacy-preserving database system that enables secure query processing on encrypted data using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), providing privacy guaranties where an untrusted server can execute encrypted queries without learning either the query contents or the underlying data. Unlike property-preserving encryption-based systems such as CryptDB, which rely on deterministic or order-preserving encryption and are vulnerable to frequency, order, and equality-pattern inference attacks, FHE-SQL performs computations entirely under encryption, eliminating these leakage channels. Compared to trusted-hardware approaches such as TrustedDB, which depend on a hardware security module and thus inherit its trust and side-channel limitations, our design achieves end-to-end cryptographic protection without requiring trusted execution environments. In contrast to high-performance FHE-based engines-Hermes, which target specialized workloads such as vector search, FHE-SQL supports general SQL query semantics with schema-aware, type-safe definitions suitable for relational data management. FHE-SQL mitigates the high cost of ciphertext space by using an indirection architecture that separates metadata in RocksDB from large ciphertexts in blob storage. It supports oblivious selection via homomorphic boolean masks, multi-tier caching, and garbage collection, with security proven under the Universal Composability framework.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have rapidly gained popularity for their strong generation and reasoning capabilities given diverse multimodal inputs. However, these models incur significant computational and memory overhead during inference, which greatly hinders the efficient deployment in practical scenarios. The extensive key-value (KV) cache, necessitated by the lengthy input and output sequences, notably contributes to the high inference cost. Based on this, recent works have investigated ways to reduce the KV cache size for higher efficiency. Although effective, they generally overlook the distinct importance distributions of KV vectors across layers and maintain the same cache size for each layer during the next token prediction. This results in the significant contextual information loss for certain layers, leading to notable performance decline. To address this, we present PrefixKV, where "Prefix" means the top-ranked KV based on importance rather than position in the original sequence. It reframes the challenge of determining KV cache sizes for all layers into the task of searching for the optimal global prefix configuration. With an adaptive layer-wise KV retention recipe based on binary search, the maximum contextual information can thus be preserved in each layer, facilitating the generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with others. It exhibits superior inference efficiency and generation quality trade-offs, showing promising potential for practical applications. Code is available at https://github.com/THU-MIG/PrefixKV.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To enhance the efficiency of the attention mechanism within large language models (LLMs), previous works primarily compress the KV cache or group attention heads, while largely overlooking redundancy between layers. Our comprehensive analyses across various LLMs show that highly similar attention patterns persist within most layers. It's intuitive to reduce the redundancy by sharing attention weights across layers. However, further analysis reveals two challenges: (1) Directly sharing the weight matrix without carefully rearranging the attention heads proves to be ineffective; (2) Shallow layers are vulnerable to small deviations in attention weights.   Driven by these insights, we introduce LISA, a lightweight substitute for self-attention in well-trained LLMs. LISA employs tiny feed-forward networks to align attention heads between adjacent layers and low-rank matrices to approximate differences in layer-wise attention weights. Evaluations encompassing 13 typical benchmarks demonstrate that LISA maintains high response quality in terms of accuracy and perplexity while reducing redundant attention calculations within 53%-84% of the total layers. Our implementations of LISA achieve a 6x compression of Q and K matrices within the attention mechanism, with maximum throughput improvements 19.5%, 32.3%, and 40.1% for LLaMA3-8B, LLaMA2-7B, and LLaMA2-13B, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Prompt caching is critical for reducing latency and cost in LLM inference: OpenAI and Anthropic report up to 50-90% cost savings through prompt reuse. Despite its widespread success, little is known about what constitutes an optimal prompt caching policy, particularly when optimizing tail latency, a metric of central importance to practitioners. The widely used Least Recently Used (LRU) policy can perform arbitrarily poor on this metric, as it is oblivious to the heterogeneity of conversation lengths. To address this gap, we propose Tail-Optimized LRU, a simple two-line modification that reallocates KV cache capacity to prioritize high-latency conversations by evicting cache entries that are unlikely to affect future turns. Though the implementation is simple, we prove its optimality under a natural stochastic model of conversation dynamics, providing the first theoretical justification for LRU in this setting, a result that may be of independent interest to the caching community. Experimentally, on real conversation data WildChat, Tail-Optimized LRU achieves up to 27.5% reduction in P90 tail Time to First Token latency and 23.9% in P95 tail latency compared to LRU, along with up to 38.9% decrease in SLO violations of 200ms. We believe this provides a practical and theoretically grounded option for practitioners seeking to optimize tail latency in real-world LLM deployments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Hash tables are essential building blocks in data-intensive applications, yet existing GPU implementations often struggle with concurrent updates, high load factors, and irregular memory access patterns. We present Hive hash table, a high-performance, warp-cooperative and dynamically resizable GPU hash table that adapts to varying workloads without global rehashing.   Hive hash table makes three key contributions. First, a cache-aligned packed bucket layout stores key-value pairs as 64-bit words, enabling coalesced memory access and atomic updates via single-CAS operations. Second, warp-synchronous concurrency protocols - Warp-Aggregated-Bitmask-Claim (WABC) and Warp-Cooperative Match-and-Elect (WCME) - reduce contention to one atomic operation per warp while ensuring lock-free progress. Third, a load-factor-aware dynamic resizing strategy expands or contracts capacity in warp-parallel K-bucket batches using linear hashing, maintaining balanced occupancy. To handle insertions under heavy contention, Hive hash table employs a four-step strategy: replace, claim-and-commit, bounded cuckoo eviction, and overflow-stash fallback. This design provides lock-free fast paths and bounded recovery cost under contention determined by a fixed eviction depth, while eliminating ABA hazards during concurrent updates.   Experimental evaluation on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 shows Hive hash table sustains load factors up to 95% while delivering 1.5-2x higher throughput than state-of-the-art GPU hash tables (Slab-Hash, DyCuckoo, WarpCore) under mixed insert-delete-lookup workloads. On balanced workload, Hive hash table reaches 3.5 billion updates/s and nearly 4 billion lookups/s, demonstrating scalability and efficiency for GPU-accelerated data processing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work studies how to adaptively recompute key-value (KV) caches for diffusion large language models (DLMs) to maximize prediction accuracy while minimizing decoding latency. Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all tokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little across most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial redundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\bf MASK}$ tokens primarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active prediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that selective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the most-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative lower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose ${\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that jointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the most-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that recomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and off-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs adaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant computation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation quality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent speedups: $8.7\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\times$ on longer sequences, and $4.8\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy than the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput ($6.8\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while preserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We extend the GenTen tensor decomposition package by introducing an accelerated dense matricized tensor times Khatri-Rao product (MTTKRP), the workhorse kernel for canonical polyadic (CP) tensor decompositions, that is portable and performant on modern CPU and GPU architectures. In contrast to the state-of-the-art matrix multiply based MTTKRP kernels used by Tensor Toolbox, TensorLy, etc., that explicitly form Khatri-Rao matrices, we develop a matrix-free element-wise parallelization approach whose memory cost grows with the rank R like the sum of the tensor shape O(R(n+m+k)), compared to matrix-based methods whose memory cost grows like the product of the tensor shape O(R(mnk)). For the largest problem we study, a rank 2000 MTTKRP, the smaller growth rate yields a matrix-free memory cost of just 2% of the matrix-based methods, a 50x improvement. In practice, the reduced memory impact means our matrix-free MTTKRP can compute a rank 2000 tensor decomposition on a single NVIDIA H100 instead of six H100s using a matrix-based MTTKRP. We also compare our optimized matrix-free MTTKRP to baseline matrix-free implementations on different devices, showing a 3x single-device speedup on an Intel 8480+ CPU and an 11x speedup on a H100 GPU. In addition to numerical results, we provide fine grained performance models for an ideal multi-level cache machine, compare analytical performance predictions to empirical results, and provide a motivated heuristic selection for selecting an algorithmic hyperparameter.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce xLLM, an intelligent and efficient Large Language Model (LLM) inference framework designed for high-performance, large-scale enterprise-grade serving, with deep optimizations for diverse AI accelerators. To address these challenges, xLLM builds a novel decoupled service-engine architecture. At the service layer, xLLM-Service features an intelligent scheduling module that efficiently processes multimodal requests and co-locates online and offline tasks through unified elastic scheduling to maximize cluster utilization. This module also relies on a workload-adaptive dynamic Prefill-Decode (PD) disaggregation policy and a novel Encode-Prefill-Decode (EPD) disaggregation policy designed for multimodal inputs. Furthermore, it incorporates a distributed architecture to provide global KV Cache management and robust fault-tolerant capabilities for high availability. At the engine layer, xLLM-Engine co-optimizes system and algorithm designs to fully saturate computing resources. This is achieved through comprehensive multi-layer execution pipeline optimizations, an adaptive graph mode and an xTensor memory management. xLLM-Engine also further integrates algorithmic enhancements such as optimized speculative decoding and dynamic EPLB, collectively serving to substantially boost throughput and inference efficiency. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that xLLM delivers significantly superior performance and resource efficiency. Under identical TPOT constraints, xLLM achieves throughput up to 1.7x that of MindIE and 2.2x that of vLLM-Ascend with Qwen-series models, while maintaining an average throughput of 1.7x that of MindIE with Deepseek-series models. xLLM framework is publicly available at https://github.com/jd-opensource/xllm and https://github.com/jd-opensource/xllm-service.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models have excelled in various domains but face efficiency challenges due to the growing Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-sequence inference. Recent efforts aim to reduce KV cache size by evicting vast non-critical cache elements during runtime while preserving generation quality. However, these methods typically allocate compression budgets uniformly across all attention heads, ignoring the unique attention patterns of each head. In this paper, we establish a theoretical loss upper bound between pre- and post-eviction attention output, explaining the optimization target of prior cache eviction methods, while guiding the optimization of adaptive budget allocation. Base on this, we propose {\it Ada-KV}, the first head-wise adaptive budget allocation strategy. It offers plug-and-play benefits, enabling seamless integration with prior cache eviction methods. Extensive evaluations on 13 datasets from Ruler and 16 datasets from LongBench, all conducted under both question-aware and question-agnostic scenarios, demonstrate substantial quality improvements over existing methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> MPI implementations commonly rely on explicit memory-copy operations, incurring overhead from redundant data movement and buffer management. This overhead notably impacts HPC workloads involving intensive inter-processor communication. In response, we introduce MPI-over-CXL, a novel MPI communication paradigm leveraging CXL, which provides cache-coherent shared memory across multiple hosts. MPI-over-CXL replaces traditional data-copy methods with direct shared memory access, significantly reducing communication latency and memory bandwidth usage. By mapping shared memory regions directly into the virtual address spaces of MPI processes, our design enables efficient pointer-based communication, eliminating redundant copying operations. To validate this approach, we implement a comprehensive hardware and software environment, including a custom CXL 3.2 controller, FPGA-based multi-host emulation, and dedicated software stack. Our evaluations using representative benchmarks demonstrate substantial performance improvements over conventional MPI systems, underscoring MPI-over-CXL's potential to enhance efficiency and scalability in large-scale HPC environments.

A 2.4 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ thick epitaxially grown gain layer enables controlled internal amplification up to 1 kV reverse bias, while maintaining full depletion below 500 V. Electrical characteristics, including I-V, C-V, and gain behavior, were simulated in Synopsys Sentaurus Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) using a quasi-1D geometry and verified across process-related variations in gain layer parameters. To ensure high-voltage stability and proper edge termination, a guard structure combining deep etched trenches and deep $p^+$ junction termination extension (JTE) implants was designed. TCAD simulations varying the guard structure dimensions yielded an optimized design with a breakdown voltage above 2.4 kV. A corresponding wafer run is currently processed at IMB-CNM, Barcelona.

By performing inference directly on the device, data does not need to be sent to the cloud, ensuring faster responses and reducing reliance on network connectivity. However, implementing LLMs on edge devices presents challenges, particularly with managing key-value (KV) caches, which plays a pivotal role in LLM serving. As the input text lengthens, the size of the KV cache increases linearly with the sequence length, leading to a significant memory footprint and data access costs. On the other hand, edge devices have limited memory and computational power, making it hard to store and efficiently access the large caches needed for LLM inference.   To mitigate the substantial overhead caused by KV cache, we propose using embedded DRAM (eDRAM) as the primary storage for LLM serving in edge device, which offers higher storage density compared to SRAM. However, to ensure data integrity, eDRAM needs periodic refresh operations, which are power-intensive. To reduce eDRAM costs and improve overall system performance, we propose~\textit{Kelle}, a software-hardware co-design solution optimized for deploying LLMs on eDRAM-based edge systems. Combined with our fine-grained memory eviction, recomputation, and refresh control algorithms, the \textit{Kelle} accelerator delivers a $3.9\times$ speedup and $4.5\times$ energy savings compared to existing baseline solutions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce Cortex, a prototype workflow-aware serving platform designed for agentic workloads. The core principle of Cortex is stage isolation: it provisions dedicated resource pools for each distinct stage of an agentic workflow. This simple yet powerful strategy mitigates inter-stage interference in compute and memory, leading to better KV cache utilization, higher throughput, and more predictable performance. By customizing resource allocation and scheduling within each distinct stage of agentic workflows, Cortex lays the groundwork for more advanced, agent-native serving paradigms, including malleable resource management, speculative execution of workflow branches, and a shared, multi-tiered cache for "agentic state."

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has focused on test-time scaling to improve reasoning via increased inference computation, but often at the cost of efficiency. We revisit test-time behavior and uncover a simple yet underexplored phenomenon: reasoning uncertainty is highly localized-only a small subset of high-entropy tokens dominantly affects output correctness. Motivated by this, we propose Minimal Test-Time Intervention (MTI), a training-free framework that enhances reasoning accuracy and stability with minimal overhead. MTI includes: (i) Selective CFG intervention, applying classifier-free guidance only at uncertain positions; and (ii) Lightweight negative-prompt guidance, reusing the main model's KV cache to approximate unconditional decoding efficiently. MTI yields consistent gains across general, coding, and STEM tasks-e.g., +1.35% average improvement on eight benchmarks for Qwen3-8B-Base and +5% on AIME2024 using Qwen3-32B-Reasoning-while remaining highly efficient.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The scalability of large language models for long-context reasoning is severely constrained by the linear growth of their Transformer key-value cache, which incurs significant memory and computational costs. We posit that as a model generates reasoning tokens, the informational value of past generated tokens diminishes, creating an opportunity for compression. In this work, we propose to periodically compress the generation KV cache with a learned, special-purpose token and evict compressed entries. We train the model to perform this compression via a modified joint distillation and reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Our training method minimizes overhead over the conventional RL process, as it leverages RL outputs for distillation. Empirically, our method achieves a superior memory-accuracy Pareto frontier compared to both the model without cache compression and training-free compression techniques.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer inference-time memory bottlenecks dominated by the attention Key-Value (KV) cache, which scales with model size and context length. While KV-cache quantization alleviates this cost, bit allocation between keys and values is often tuned heuristically, lacking theoretical grounding and generalizability. This paper proposes two theorems that anchor mixed-precision KV quantization in the intrinsic geometry of Transformer models. First, key projections systematically have larger spectral and Frobenius norms than value matrices, implying higher information density along the key path. Second, for any given memory budget, prioritizing precision for keys over values strictly reduces quantization error and better preserves accuracy. Empirical evaluations across various prominent LLMs and benchmarks show that key-favored allocations (e.g., 4-bit keys, 2-bit values) retain up to 98.3\% accuracy compared to uniform allocations (e.g., 4-bit for both), while conserving memory. These results transform bit allocation from ad hoc tuning into a theoretically grounded, geometry-driven design principle for efficient LLM inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Trainable sparse attention has emerged as a promising solution to address the decoding efficiency bottleneck of LLMs in long-context processing, significantly saving memory accesses while minimally impacting task performance. However, existing sparse attention methods leave a crucial limitation unresolved: the size of the key-value (KV) cache remains unreduced, which constrains on-GPU batch sizes and throttles decoding throughput, especially in large-scale batched inference. In this paper, we show that trainable sparse attention naturally exhibits strong locality in token selection across adjacent decoding steps, thereby enabling KV cache offloading without altering the underlying attention computation. However, the inherent locality remains insufficient to achieve efficient offloading, as the transfer of selected KV pairs between the CPU and GPU continues to dominate the overall decoding cost. Building on this insight, we present NOSA, a trainable sparse attention framework designed to natively support KV cache offloading. NOSA introduces explicit locality constraints by decomposing token selection into query-aware and query-agnostic components, thereby reducing KV transfers while preserving the same attention computation as used during training. We pretrain a 1B-parameter model with NOSA and conduct extensive benchmarks, showing that it preserves near-lossless performance while achieving up to a 2.3x improvement in decoding throughput compared with the vanilla trainable sparse attention baseline (InfLLM-V2).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly prominent for daily tasks, from improving sound-totext translation to generating additional frames for the latest video games. With the help of LLM inference frameworks, such as llama.cpp, which support optimizations such as KV-caching and quantization, it is now easier than ever to deploy LLMs on edge devices. Quantization is fundamental to enable LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices, and llama.cpp utilizes block floating point (BFP) quantization to drastically reduce the bit width of weights and input tensors, the memory footprint, and the computational power required to run LLMs. LLMs are typically quantized with mixed BFP quantization across the model layers to reduce the loss of model accuracy due to quantization. Therefore, to efficiently accelerate across the layers of BFP-quantized LLMs, specialized accelerators need to support different BFP variants without reconfiguration. To address this issue, we propose a Flexible Block FloatingPoint Quantization (F-BFQ) accelerator, which can dynamically switch between two BFP quantization variants and perform matrix multiplication (MatMul) operations. Our initial F-BFQ accelerator design, deployed on the AMD Kria board, reduces inference time by 1.4x on average over the Arm NEON-based CPU execution across three BFP quantized LLMs while achieving 5.2 tokens per second (~3.9 words per second).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models have revolutionized natural language processing, yet their deployment remains hampered by the substantial memory and runtime overhead of the transformer's Key-Value cache. To mitigate this, recent methods employ a scoring-aggregation framework to evict unimportant cache entries, based on the stability assumption-that a fixed subset of entries remains consistently important during generation. However, prior work has largely focused on refining importance indicators for scoring, while defaulting to mean aggregation due to a faithful trust in the stability assumption. In this work, we argue that this underlying assumption is inherently fragile, making mean aggregation highly vulnerable in extreme cases. To counter this, we propose a simple yet elegant defensive aggregation strategy: a two-step, linear-time approach that controls worst-case risk, thereby defending against extreme cases with negligible computational overhead. Embodying this strategy, we propose a novel cache eviction method, DefensiveKV and its extension, Layer-DefensiveKV, which incorporates layer-wise budget allocation. Across seven task domains (18 datasets), our methods reduce generation quality loss by 2.3x and 4.3x respectively, versus the strongest baseline under a 20% cache size. These results set new performance benchmarks and pioneer a promising direction for optimizing cache eviction against underlying fragility through worst-case risk management.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Autonomous driving systems, critical for safety, require real-time guarantees and can be modeled as DAGs. Their acceleration features, such as caches and pipelining, often result in execution times below the worst-case. Thus, a probabilistic approach ensuring constraint satisfaction within a probability threshold is more suitable than worst-case guarantees for these systems. This paper considers probabilistic guarantees for DAG tasks by utilizing the results of probabilistic guarantees for single processors, which have been relatively more advanced than those for multi-core processors. This paper proposes a task set partitioning method that guarantees schedulability under the partitioned scheduling. The evaluation on randomly generated DAG task sets demonstrates that the proposed method schedules more task sets with a smaller mean analysis time compared to existing probabilistic schedulability analysis for DAGs. The evaluation also compares four bin-packing heuristics, revealing Item-Centric Worst-Fit-Decreasing schedules the most task sets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in AI infrastructure, driving the need for high throughput, resource efficient serving systems. Disaggregated LLM serving, which separates prompt prefill from auto-regressive decode, has emerged as a promising architecture by isolating their heterogeneous compute and memory demands. However, current disaggregated systems face three key limitations: (i) static resource allocation cannot adapt to highly dynamic workloads, causing over-provisioning that wastes resources or under-provisioning that violates service level objectives (SLOs); (ii) inherent load imbalance between prefill and decode stages, where prefill is compute-bound and decode is memory-bound, causes under-utilization in one tier while the other becomes a bottleneck; and (iii) prefix cache aware routing skews load distribution, as high cache hit rate prefill nodes attract disproportionately more requests, further degrading balance and efficiency. To address these issues, we present BanaServe, a dynamic orchestration framework that continuously rebalances computational and memory resources across prefill and decode instances while eliminating hotspots induced by cache. BanaServe introduces layer level weight migration, attention level Key Value Cache (KV Cache) migration, and Global KV Cache Store sharing with layer wise overlapped transmission, enabling both coarse grained (layer level) and fine grained (attention level) load redistribution with minimal latency overhead. These mechanisms allow routers to perform purely load aware scheduling, unconstrained by cache placement. Compared to vLLM, BanaServe achieves 1.2x-3.9x higher throughput with 3.9%-78.4% lower total processing time, and outperforms DistServe by 1.1x-2.8x in throughput with 1.4%-70.1% latency reduction.

Edit-Your-Interest introduces a spatio-temporal feature memory to cache features from previous frames, significantly reducing computational overhead compared to full-sequence spatio-temporal modeling approaches.   Specifically, we first introduce a Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory bank (SFM), which is designed to efficiently cache and retain the crucial image tokens processed by spatial attention.   Second, we propose the Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP) method. FMP propagates the most relevant tokens from previous frames to subsequent ones, preserving temporal consistency.   Finally, we introduce an SFM update algorithm that continuously refreshes the cached features, ensuring their long-term relevance and effectiveness throughout the video sequence.   Furthermore, we leverage cross-attention maps to automatically extract masks for the instances of interest.   These masks are seamlessly integrated into the diffusion denoising process, enabling fine-grained control over target objects and allowing Edit-Your-Interest to perform highly accurate edits while robustly preserving the background integrity.   Extensive experiments decisively demonstrate that the proposed Edit-Your-Interest outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and visual fidelity, validating its superior effectiveness and practicality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit enhanced capabilities by Chain-of-Thought reasoning. However, the extended reasoning sequences introduce significant GPU memory overhead due to increased key-value (KV) cache. Existing KV cache compression methods mitigate memory bottlenecks but struggle in long reasoning tasks. In this paper, we analyze attention patterns in reasoning tasks and reveal a Token Importance Recurrence phenomenon: a large proportion of tokens regain high attention after multiple decoding steps, which is failed to capture by existing works and may lead to unpredictable eviction on such periodically critical tokens. To address this, we propose LazyEviction, an observation window-based lagged eviction framework retaining latent recurring tokens by prioritized eviction based on tokens' recurrence patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LazyEviction reduces KV cache by 50%~70% while maintaining comparable accuracy, outperforming existing KV cache compression baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces Dodoor, an efficient randomized decentralized scheduler designed for task scheduling in modern data centers. Dodoor leverages advanced research on the weighted balls-into-bins model with b-batched setting. Unlike other decentralized schedulers that rely on real-time probing of remote servers, Dodoor makes scheduling decisions based on cached server information, which is updated in batches, to reduce communication overheads. To schedule tasks with dynamic, multidimensional resource requirements in heterogeneous cluster, Dodoor uses a novel load score to measure servers' loads for each scheduled task. This score captures the anti-affinity between servers and tasks in contrast to the commonly used heuristic of counting pending tasks to balance load. On a 101-node heterogeneous cluster, Dodoor is evaluated using two workloads: (i) simulated Azure virtual machines placements and (ii) real serverless Python functions executions in Docker. The evaluation shows that Dodoor reduces scheduling messages by 55--66% on both workloads. Dodoor can also increase throughput by up to 33.2% and 21.5%, reduce mean makespan latency by 12.1% and 7.2%, and improve tail latency by 21.9% and 24.6% across the two workloads.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems are increasingly adopted for complex language processing tasks that require communication and coordination among agents. However, these systems often suffer substantial overhead from repeated reprocessing of overlapping contexts across agents. In typical pipelines, once an agent receives a message from its predecessor, the full context-including prior turns-must be reprocessed from scratch, leading to inefficient processing. While key-value (KV) caching is an effective solution for avoiding redundant computation in single-agent settings where prefixes remain unchanged, it cannot be directly reused in multi-agent scenarios due to diverging prefixes introduced by agent-specific context extensions. We identify that the core challenge lies in the offset variance of KV-caches across agents. To address this, we propose KVCOMM, a training-free framework that enables efficient prefilling in multi-agent inference by reusing KV-caches and aligning cache offsets of overlapping contexts under diverse prefix contexts. KVCOMM estimates and adjusts KV-caches for shared content by referencing a pool of cached examples-termed anchors-that store observed cache deviations under varying prefixes. The anchor pool is maintained and updated online, allowing dynamic adaptation to distinct user requests and context structures. KVCOMM achieves over 70% reuse rate across diverse multi-agent workloads, including retrieval-augmented generation, math reasoning, and collaborative coding tasks, all without quality degradation. Particularly, when each fully-connected agent receives 1K input tokens with 512 prefix tokens and 512 output tokens under a five-agent setting, KVCOMM achieves up to 7.8x speedup compared to the standard prefill pipeline, reducing TTFT from ~430 ms to ~55 ms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The reduction of a banded matrix to a bidiagonal form is a crucial step in the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a cornerstone of scientific computing and AI. Despite being a highly parallel algorithm, it was previously believed to be unsuitable for GPU computation because it is memory bandwidth-bound. Recent developments in GPU hardware, including larger L1 memory per Streaming Multiprocessor/Compute Unit, have changed that. We present the first GPU algorithm for reducing a banded matrix to bidiagonal form as part of the NextLA$.$jl open-source software package. Our algorithm is based on previous CPU-based multicore parallel cache-efficient bulge chasing algorithms and adapted to optimize for GPU throughput. We leverage Julia Language's Array abstractions and KernelAbstractions to implement a single hardware- and data precision-agnostic function on NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Apple Metal GPUs for half, single, and double precision, and examine performance optimization across hardware architectures and data precision. We also develop a hardware-aware performance model and identify key hyperparameters, such as inner tilewidth and block concurrency, that govern optimal GPU execution for bandwidth-bound workloads. We demonstrate highly parallel bandwidth-bound algorithm on the GPU can outperform CPU-based implementations: the GPU algorithm outperforms multithreaded CPU High-Performance libraries PLASMA and SLATE as of matrix size 1024 x 1024 and by a factor over 100 for matrices of 32k x 32k. In addition, the performance of the algorithm increases linearly with matrix bandwidth size, making faster reduction of larger matrix bandwidths now also possible. With this work, we break memory bandwidth barriers, as well as matrix bandwidth barriers, resulting in orders-of-magnitude faster algorithms for the reduction of banded matrices to bidiagonal form on the GPU.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably, OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding; and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) require significant GPU memory when processing long texts, with the key value (KV) cache consuming up to 70\% of total memory during inference. Although existing compression methods reduce memory by evaluating the importance of individual tokens, they overlook critical semantic relationships between tokens, resulting in fragmented context and degraded performance. We introduce ChunkKV, which fundamentally reimagines KV cache compression by treating semantic chunks - rather than isolated tokens - as basic compression units. This approach preserves complete linguistic structures and contextual integrity, ensuring that essential meaning is retained even under aggressive compression. Our innovation includes a novel layer-wise index reuse technique that exploits the higher cross-layer similarity of preserved indices in ChunkKV, reducing computational overhead and improving throughput by 26.5\%. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks: LongBench, Needle-In-A-HayStack, GSM8K, and JailbreakV demonstrate that ChunkKV outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 8.7\% in precision while maintaining the same compression ratio. These results confirm that semantic-aware compression significantly enhances both efficiency and performance for long-context LLM inference, providing a simple yet effective solution to the memory bottleneck problem.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A growing trend in modern data analysis is the integration of data management with learning, guided by accuracy, latency, and cost requirements. In practice, applications draw data of different formats from many sources. In the meanwhile, the objectives and budgets change over time. Existing systems handle these applications across databases, analysis libraries, and tuning services. Such fragmentation leads to complex user interaction, limited adaptability, suboptimal performance, and poor extensibility across components. To address these challenges, we present Aixel, a unified, adaptive, and extensible system for AI-powered data analysis. The system organizes work across four layers: application, task, model, and data. The task layer provides a declarative interface to capture user intent, which is parsed into an executable operator plan. An optimizer compiles and schedules this plan to meet specified goals in accuracy, latency, and cost. The task layer coordinates the execution of data and model operators, with built-in support for reuse and caching to improve efficiency. The model layer offers versioned storage for index, metadata, tensors, and model artifacts. It supports adaptive construction, task-aligned drift detection, and safe updates that reuse shared components. The data layer provides unified data management capabilities, including indexing, constraint-aware discovery, task-aligned selection, and comprehensive feature management. With the above designed layers, Aixel delivers a user friendly, adaptive, efficient, and extensible system.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In modern containerized cloud environments, the adoption of RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) has expanded to reduce CPU overhead and enable high-performance data exchange. Achieving this requires strong performance isolation to ensure that one container's RDMA workload does not degrade the performance of others, thereby maintaining critical security assurances. However, existing isolation techniques are difficult to apply effectively due to the complexity of microarchitectural resource management within RDMA NICs (RNICs). This paper experimentally analyzes two types of resource exhaustion attacks on NVIDIA BlueField-3: (i) state saturation attacks and (ii) pipeline saturation attacks. Our results show that state saturation attacks can cause up to a 93.9% loss in bandwidth, a 1,117x increase in latency, and a 115% rise in cache misses for victim containers, while pipeline saturation attacks lead to severe link-level congestion and significant amplification, where small verb requests result in disproportionately high resource consumption. To mitigate these threats and restore predictable security assurances, we propose HT-Verbs, a threshold-driven framework based on real-time per-container RDMA verb telemetry and adaptive resource classification that partitions RNIC resources into hot, warm, and cold tiers and throttles abusive workloads without requiring hardware modifications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> When key-value (KV) stores use SSDs for storing a large number of items, oftentimes they also require large in-memory data structures including indices and caches to be traversed to reduce IOs. This paper considers offloading most of such data structures from the costly host DRAM to secondary memory whose latency is in the microsecond range, an order of magnitude longer than those of currently available DIMM-mounted or CXL memory devices. While emerging microsecond-latency memory is likely to cost much less than DRAM, it can significantly slow down SSD-based KV stores if naively employed. This paper analyzes and evaluates the impact of microsecond-level memory latency on the KV operation throughput. Our analysis finds that a well-known latency-hiding technique of software prefetching for long-latency memory from user-level threads is effective. The novelty of our analysis lies in modeling how the interplay between prefetching and IO affects performance, from which we derive an equation that well explains the throughput degradation due to long memory latency. The model tells us that the presence of IO significantly enhances the tolerance to memory latency, leading to a finding that SSD-based KV stores can be made latency-tolerant without devising new techniques for microsecond-latency memory. To confirm this, we design a microbenchmark as well as modify existing SSD-based KV stores so that they issue prefetches from user-level threads, and run them while placing most of in-memory data structures on FPGA-based memory with adjustable microsecond latency. The results demonstrate that their KV operation throughputs can be well explained by our model, and the modified KV stores achieve near-DRAM throughputs for up to a memory latency of 5 microseconds. This suggests the possibility that SSD-based KV stores can use microsecond-latency memory as a cost-effective alternative to the host DRAM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have become a prominent paradigm for embodied intelligence, yet further performance improvements typically rely on scaling up training data and model size -- an approach that is prohibitively expensive for robotics and fundamentally limited by data collection costs. We address this limitation with $\mathbf{RoVer}$, an embodied test-time scaling framework that uses a $\mathbf{Ro}$bot Process Reward Model (PRM) as a Test-Time $\mathbf{Ver}$ifier to enhance the capabilities of existing VLA models without modifying their architectures or weights. Specifically, RoVer (i) assigns scalar-based process rewards to evaluate the reliability of candidate actions, and (ii) predicts an action-space direction for candidate expansion/refinement. During inference, RoVer generates multiple candidate actions concurrently from the base policy, expands them along PRM-predicted directions, and then scores all candidates with PRM to select the optimal action for execution. Notably, by caching shared perception features, it can amortize perception cost and evaluate more candidates under the same test-time computational budget. Essentially, our approach effectively transforms available computing resources into better action decision-making, realizing the benefits of test-time scaling without extra training overhead. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a general, plug-and-play test-time scaling framework for VLAs; (2) a PRM that jointly provides scalar process rewards and an action-space direction to guide exploration; and (3) an efficient direction-guided sampling strategy that leverages a shared perception cache to enable scalable candidate generation and selection during inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, while cloud-based MLLMs such as QwenVL, InternVL, GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude Sonnet have demonstrated outstanding performance with enormous model sizes reaching hundreds of billions of parameters, they significantly surpass the limitations in memory, power consumption, and computing capacity of edge devices such as mobile phones. This paper introduces AndesVL, a suite of mobile-side MLLMs with 0.6B to 4B parameters based on Qwen3's LLM and various visual encoders. We comprehensively outline the model architectures, training pipeline, and training data of AndesVL, which achieves first-tier performance across a wide range of open-source benchmarks, including fields such as text-rich image understanding, reasoning and math, multi-image comprehension, general VQA, hallucination mitigation, multilingual understanding, and GUI-related tasks when compared with state-of-the-art models of a similar scale. Furthermore, we introduce a 1+N LoRA architecture alongside a Quantization-Aware LoRA Fine-Tuning (QALFT) framework to facilitate efficient task adaptation and model compression during mobile-side deployment of AndesVL. Moreover, utilizing our cache eviction algorithm -- OKV -- along with customized speculative decoding and compression strategies, we achieve a 6.7x peak decoding speedup ratio, up to 30.9% memory reduction, and 1.8 bits-per-weight when deploying AndesVL-4B on MediaTek Dimensity 9500 chips. We release all models on https://huggingface.co/OPPOer.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deploying useful Long-Context Transformer Models (LCTMs) requires addressing two key challenges: (1) A growing memory footprint due to quadratic self-attention and linear KV-cache scaling in memory as sequence length increases; (2) the ContextRot phenomena where empirical evidence suggests that transformer architecture's performance degrades with increasing context length. Given the shared dependency on the input, a natural question arises: Can we surgically select the most important input chunks for processing to synergistically (a) reduce the memory footprint, and (b) mitigate the ContextRot effects? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative for long-context summarization tasks. We propose APCE as a context-aware solution to select the most important input chunks through low-dimensional semantic similarity matching with the current query. By directly operating on the input, APCE decouples from strict dependency on underlying hardware or CUDA environments, promising a compatible solution scalable to different deployment systems. Our empirical evaluations have demonstrated superior or on-par summarization performance for APCE compared to the full dense baseline using a fraction (50%-70%) of the input sequence resulting in KV-cache and self-attention memory efficiency improvements. We hope our findings inspire further research on context-aware efficiency solutions for LCTMs geared towards other relevant long-context tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present LongLive, a frame-level autoregressive (AR) framework for real-time and interactive long video generation. Long video generation presents challenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing models can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to bidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for faster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory challenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based generation, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are critical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in real time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity, especially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt transitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level AR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states with new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable long video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long); and short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as frame sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation. With these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model to minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains 20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both short and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single H100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal quality loss.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) in production faces significant challenges from highly variable request patterns and severe resource fragmentation in serverless clusters. Current systems rely on static pipeline configurations that struggle to adapt to dynamic workload conditions, leading to substantial inefficiencies. We present FlexPipe, a novel system that dynamically reconfigures pipeline architectures during runtime to address these fundamental limitations. FlexPipe decomposes models into fine-grained stages and intelligently adjusts pipeline granularity based on real-time request pattern analysis, implementing three key innovations: fine-grained model partitioning with preserved computational graph constraints, inflight pipeline refactoring with consistent cache transitions, and topology-aware resource allocation that navigates GPU fragmentation. Comprehensive evaluation on an 82-GPU cluster demonstrates that FlexPipe achieves up to 8.5x better resource efficiency while maintaining 38.3% lower latency compared to state-of-the-art systems, reducing GPU reservation requirements from 75% to 30% of peak capacity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However, existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world streaming scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The generation quality of large language models (LLMs) is often improved by utilizing inference-time sequence-level scaling methods (e.g., Chain-of-Thought). We introduce hyper-parallel scaling, a complementary framework that improves prediction quality at the token level. Hyper-parallel scaling computes and aggregates multiple output proposals for a single token from the model. We implement this concept in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, which we refer to as Roster of Experts (RoE). RoE is a training-free inference algorithm that turns a single MoE into a dynamic ensemble of MoEs. RoE injects controlled stochasticity into the expert routing mechanism, enabling it to sample multiple diverse experts for each token and aggregate their outputs for a more accurate final prediction. To overcome the computational cost, we introduce an efficient batching strategy and a specialized KV-caching mechanism that minimizes compute and memory overhead. For example, RoE enables a 7B MoE model to match the performance of a 10.5B MoE model while using 30% less compute for inference. These gains are achieved without any fine-tuning of model parameters.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While Key-Value (KV) cache succeeds in reducing redundant computations in auto-regressive models, it introduces significant memory overhead, limiting its practical deployment in long-sequence scenarios. Existing KV retrieval methods mitigate this by dynamically retaining only a subset of KV entries on the GPU. However, they still suffer from notable efficiency and accuracy bottlenecks due to per-token retrieval and coarse-grained page-level KV management, especially in long-output reasoning scenarios. With the emergence of large reasoning models, efficiently handling such scenarios has become increasingly important. To address this issue, we present two key observations: (1) critical KVs exhibit strong temporal locality during decoding, and (2) these KVs exhibit distinct distribution patterns across the input prompt and generated output. Building on these observations, we propose LouisKV, an efficient KV cache retrieval framework designed for various long-sequence scenarios. Specifically, LouisKV introduces a semantic-aware retrieval strategy leveraging temporal locality to trigger retrieval only at semantic boundaries, drastically reducing computation and data transfer overhead. LouisKV also designs a decoupled, fine-grained management scheme that tailors differentiated strategies for input and output sequences to create retrieval units that better match the model's attention patterns, enabling precise identification of critical KVs. Furthermore, to boost efficiency, LouisKV incorporates several kernel-level optimizations, including custom Triton and CUDA kernels to accelerate the KV clustering and retrieval. Evaluations show that LouisKV achieves up to 4.7$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art KV retrieval methods while maintaining near-lossless accuracy across diverse long-sequence tasks, including long-input short-output, short-input long-output, and long-input long-output scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present the design and characterization of a low-noise environment for measuring the electron's electric dipole moment (EDM) with a beam of molecules. To minimize magnetic Johnson noise from metals, the design features ceramic electric field plates housed in a glass vacuum chamber. To suppress external magnetic noise the apparatus is enclosed within a cylindrical four-layer mu-metal shield with a shielding factor exceeding $10^6$ in one radial direction and $10^5$ in the other. Finite element modelling shows that the difference between these shielding factors is due to imperfect joints between sections of mu-metal. Using atomic magnetometers to monitor the magnetic field inside the shield, we measure noise below 40 fT/$\sqrt{{\rm Hz}}$ at 1 Hz and above, rising to 500 fT/$\sqrt{{\rm Hz}}$ at 0.1 Hz. Analytical and numerical studies show that residual magnetic Johnson noise contributes approximately 13 fT/$\sqrt{{\rm Hz}}$. The background magnetic field averaged along the beamline is maintained below 3 pT, with typical gradients of a few nT/m. An electric field of 20 kV/cm is applied without discharges and with leakage currents below 1 nA. Each magnetometer measures the magnetic field correlated with the direction of the applied electric field with a precision of 0.11 fT in 104 hours of data. These results demonstrate that the apparatus is suitable for measuring the electron EDM with precision at the $10^{-31}$ e cm level. The design principles and characterization techniques presented here are broadly applicable to precision measurements probing fundamental symmetries in molecules, atoms, and neutrons.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models process visual inputs independently at each timestep, discarding valuable temporal information inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. This frame-by-frame processing makes models vulnerable to visual noise while ignoring the substantial coherence between consecutive frames in manipulation sequences. We propose Temporal Token Fusion (TTF), a training-free approach that intelligently integrates historical and current visual representations to enhance VLA inference quality. Our method employs dual-dimension detection combining efficient grayscale pixel difference analysis with attention-based semantic relevance assessment, enabling selective temporal token fusion through hard fusion strategies and keyframe anchoring to prevent error accumulation. Comprehensive experiments across LIBERO, SimplerEnv, and real robot tasks demonstrate consistent improvements: 4.0 percentage points average on LIBERO (72.4\% vs 68.4\% baseline), cross-environment validation on SimplerEnv (4.8\% relative improvement), and 8.7\% relative improvement on real robot tasks. Our approach proves model-agnostic, working across OpenVLA and VLA-Cache architectures. Notably, TTF reveals that selective Query matrix reuse in attention mechanisms enhances rather than compromises performance, suggesting promising directions for direct KQV matrix reuse strategies that achieve computational acceleration while improving task success rates.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse natural language processing tasks. However, their extensive memory requirements, particularly due to KV cache growth during long-text understanding and generation, present significant challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Quantization has emerged as a promising solution to reduce memory consumption while preserving historical information. We propose XQuant, a training-free and plug-and-play framework that achieves ultra-low equivalent bit-width KV cache quantization. XQuant introduces two key innovations: a computationally negligible data-free calibration method and cross-layer KV cache compression, enabling quantization to sub-1.4 bits. Extensive experiments on TruthfulQA and LongBench demonstrate that XQuant outperforms state-of-the-art methods (e.g., KIVI-2bit and AsymKV-1.5bit) by achieving lower bit-width while maintaining superior performance, establishing a better trade-off between memory efficiency and model accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce SANA-Video, a small diffusion model that can efficiently generate videos up to 720x1280 resolution and minute-length duration. SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090 GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation, which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover, SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x speedup). In summary, SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose \textbf{Cognitive Load Traces} (CLTs) as a mid-level interpretability framework for deep models, inspired by Cognitive Load Theory in human cognition. CLTs are defined as symbolic, temporally varying functions that quantify model-internal resource allocation. Formally, we represent CLTs as a three-component stochastic process $(\mathrm{IL}_t, \mathrm{EL}_t, \mathrm{GL}_t)$, corresponding to \emph{Intrinsic}, \emph{Extraneous}, and \emph{Germane} load. Each component is instantiated through measurable proxies such as attention entropy, KV-cache miss ratio, representation dispersion, and decoding stability. We propose both symbolic formulations and visualization methods (load curves, simplex diagrams) that enable interpretable analysis of reasoning dynamics. Experiments on reasoning and planning benchmarks show that CLTs predict error-onset, reveal cognitive strategies, and enable load-guided interventions that improve reasoning efficiency by 15-30\% while maintaining accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated heuristic designers for vehicle routing problems (VRPs), current state-of-the-art methods predominantly rely on prompting massive, general-purpose models like GPT-4. This work challenges that paradigm by demonstrating that a smaller, specialized LLM, when meticulously fine-tuned, can generate components that surpass expert-crafted heuristics within advanced solvers. We propose RFTHGS, a novel Reinforcement learning (RL) framework for Fine-Tuning a small LLM to generate high-performance crossover operators for the Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS) solver, applied to the Capacitated VRP (CVRP). Our method employs a multi-tiered, curriculum-based reward function that progressively guides the LLM to master generating first compilable, then executable, and finally, superior-performing operators that exceed human expert designs. This is coupled with an operator caching mechanism that discourages plagiarism and promotes diversity during training. Comprehensive experiments show that our fine-tuned LLM produces crossover operators which significantly outperform the expert-designed ones in HGS. The performance advantage remains consistent, generalizing from small-scale instances to large-scale problems with up to 1000 nodes. Furthermore, RFTHGS exceeds the performance of leading neuro-combinatorial baselines, prompt-based methods, and commercial LLMs such as GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Data prefetching--loading data into the cache before it is requested--is essential for reducing I/O overhead and improving database performance. While traditional prefetchers focus on sequential patterns, recent learning-based approaches, especially those leveraging data semantics, achieve higher accuracy for complex access patterns. However, these methods often struggle with today's dynamic, ever-growing datasets and require frequent, timely fine-tuning. Privacy constraints may also restrict access to complete datasets, necessitating prefetchers that can learn effectively from samples. To address these challenges, we present GrASP, a learning-based prefetcher designed for both analytical and transactional workloads. GrASP enhances prefetching accuracy and scalability by leveraging logical block address deltas and combining query representations with result encodings. It frames prefetching as a context-aware multi-label classification task, using multi-layer LSTMs to predict delta patterns from embedded context. This delta modeling approach enables GrASP to generalize predictions from small samples to larger, dynamic datasets without requiring extensive retraining. Experiments on real-world datasets and industrial benchmarks demonstrate that GrASP generalizes to datasets 250 times larger than the training data, achieving up to 45% higher hit ratios, 60% lower I/O time, and 55% lower end-to-end query execution latency than existing baselines. On average, GrASP attains a 91.4% hit ratio, a 90.8% I/O time reduction, and a 57.1% execution latency reduction.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While the transformer architecture has achieved state-of-the-art performance on natural language processing tasks, these models impose substantial memory and computational overhead. Recent research has identified significant architectural redundancies within these models, presenting opportunities for optimization without compromising performance. Taking insights from research in AI interpretability and inference-time layer pruning, we introduce an efficient language model architecture, referred to as ShishuLM, which reduces both the parameter count and Key-Value (KV) cache requirements. Given the increasing importance of Small Language Models (SLMs) in agentic AI systems, we evaluate our approach on two SLMs of different scales. Our analysis reveals that for moderate-context scenarios, normalization coupled with attention computation is roughly linear with the input, enabling entire transformer blocks to be approximated through Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Our results show that ShishuLM provides up to 25% reduction in memory requirements and up to 40% improvement in latency during both training and inference, compared to parent models. Our experimental and analytical findings provide insights towards building more efficient SLM architectures from a pre-training standpoint.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While 4-bit quantization has emerged as a memory-optimal choice for non-reasoning models and zero-shot tasks across scales, we show that this universal prescription fails for reasoning models, where the KV cache rather than model size can dominate memory. Through systematic experiments across 1,700 inference scenarios on AIME25 and GPQA-Diamond, we find a scale-dependent trade-off: models with an effective size below 8-bit 4B parameters achieve better accuracy by allocating memory to more weights rather than longer generation, while larger models achieve better accuracy by allocating memory to longer generations. This scale threshold also determines when parallel scaling becomes memory-efficient and whether KV cache eviction outperforms KV quantization. Our findings show that memory optimization for LLMs cannot be scale-agnostic, while providing principled guidelines: for small reasoning models, prioritize model capacity over test-time compute, while for larger ones, maximize test-time compute. Our results suggest that optimizing reasoning models for deployment requires fundamentally different strategies from those established for non-reasoning models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Several learned policies have been proposed to replace heuristics for scheduling, caching, and other system components in modern systems. By leveraging diverse features, learning from historical trends, and predicting future behaviors, such models promise to keep pace with ever-increasing workload dynamism and continuous hardware evolution. However, policies trained in isolation may still achieve suboptimal performance when placed together. In this paper, we inspect one such instance in the domain of hardware caching -- for the policies of cache replacement and prefetching. We argue that these two policies are bidirectionally interdependent and make the case for training the two jointly. We propose a joint learning approach based on developing shared representations for the features used by the two policies. We present two approaches to develop these shared representations, one based on a joint encoder and another based on contrastive learning of the embeddings, and demonstrate promising preliminary results for both of these. Finally, we lay down an agenda for future research in this direction.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Data and workload drift are key to evaluating database components such as caching, cardinality estimation, indexing, and query optimization. Yet, existing benchmarks are static, offering little to no support for modeling drift. This limitation stems from the lack of clear definitions and tools for generating data and workload drift. Motivated by this gap, we propose a unified taxonomy for data and workload drift, grounded in observations from both academia and industry. Building on this foundation, we introduce DriftBench, a lightweight and extensible framework for generating data and workload drift in benchmark inputs. Together, the taxonomy and DriftBench provide a standardized vocabulary and mechanism for modeling and generating drift in benchmarking. We demonstrate their effectiveness through case studies involving data drift, workload drift, and drift-aware cardinality estimation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Denoising diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for image manipulation, yet interactive, localized editing workflows remain underdeveloped. We introduce Layered Diffusion Brushes (LDB), a novel training-free framework that enables interactive, layer-based editing using standard diffusion models. LDB defines each "layer" as a self-contained set of parameters guiding the generative process, enabling independent, non-destructive, and fine-grained prompt-guided edits, even in overlapping regions. LDB leverages a unique intermediate latent caching approach to reduce each edit to only a few denoising steps, achieving 140~ms per edit on consumer GPUs. An editor implementing LDB, incorporating familiar layer concepts, was evaluated via user study and quantitative metrics. Results demonstrate LDB's superior speed alongside comparable or improved image quality, background preservation, and edit fidelity relative to state-of-the-art methods across various sequential image manipulation tasks. The findings highlight LDB's ability to significantly enhance creative workflows by providing an intuitive and efficient approach to diffusion-based image editing and its potential for expansion into related subdomains, such as video editing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Visual grounding aims to predict the locations of target objects specified by textual descriptions. For this task with linguistic and visual modalities, there is a latest research line that focuses on only selecting the linguistic-relevant visual regions for object localization to reduce the computational overhead. Albeit achieving impressive performance, it is iteratively performed on different image scales, and at every iteration, linguistic features and visual features need to be stored in a cache, incurring extra overhead. To facilitate the implementation, in this paper, we propose a feature selection-based simple yet effective baseline for visual grounding, called FSVG. Specifically, we directly encapsulate the linguistic and visual modalities into an overall network architecture without complicated iterative procedures, and utilize the language in parallel as guidance to facilitate the interaction between linguistic modal and visual modal for extracting effective visual features. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost, during the visual feature learning, we introduce a similarity-based feature selection mechanism to only exploit language-related visual features for faster prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets comprehensively substantiate that the proposed FSVG achieves a better balance between accuracy and efficiency beyond the current state-of-the-art methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video diffusion transformers have achieved remarkable progress in high-quality video generation, but remain computationally expensive due to the quadratic complexity of attention over high-dimensional video sequences. Recent acceleration methods enhance the efficiency by exploiting the local sparsity of attention scores; yet they often struggle with accelerating the long-range computation. To address this problem, we propose VORTA, an acceleration framework with two novel components: 1) a sparse attention mechanism that efficiently captures long-range dependencies, and 2) a routing strategy that adaptively replaces full 3D attention with specialized sparse attention variants. VORTA achieves an end-to-end speedup $1.76\times$ without loss of quality on VBench. Furthermore, it can seamlessly integrate with various other acceleration methods, such as model caching and step distillation, reaching up to speedup $14.41\times$ with negligible performance degradation. VORTA demonstrates its efficiency and enhances the practicality of video diffusion transformers in real-world settings. Codes and weights are available at https://github.com/wenhao728/VORTA.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet deploying them on mobile devices remains an arduous challenge due to their extensive computational and memory demands. While lightweight LLMs have been developed to fit mobile environments, they suffer from degraded model accuracy. In contrast, sparsity-based techniques minimize DRAM usage by selectively transferring only relevant neurons to DRAM while retaining the full model in external storage, such as flash. However, such approaches are critically limited by numerous I/O operations, particularly on smartphones with severe IOPS constraints.   In this paper, we propose Neuralink, a novel approach that accelerates LLM inference on smartphones by optimizing neuron placement in flash memory. Neuralink leverages the concept of Neuron Co-Activation, where neurons frequently activated together are linked to facilitate continuous read access and optimize I/O efficiency. Our approach incorporates a two-stage solution: an offline stage that reorganizes neuron placement based on co-activation patterns, and an online stage that employs tailored data access and caching strategies to align well with hardware characteristics. Evaluations conducted on a variety of smartphones and LLMs demonstrate that Neuralink achieves on average $1.49\times$ improvements in end-to-end latency compared to the state-of-the-art. As the first solution to optimize storage placement under sparsity, Neuralink explores a new optimization space at the intersection of sparsity-driven algorithm and storage-level system co-design for LLM inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Automated code review adoption lags in compliance-heavy settings, where static analyzers produce high-volume, low-rationale outputs, and naive LLM use risks hallucination and incurring cost overhead. We present a production system for grounded, PR-native review that pairs static-analysis findings with AST-guided context extraction and a single-GPU, on-demand serving stack (quantized open-weight model, multi-tier caching) to deliver concise explanations and remediation guidance. Evaluated on safety-oriented C/C++ standards, the approach achieves sub-minute median first-feedback (offline p50 build+LLM 59.8s) while maintaining competitive violation reduction and lower violation rates versus larger proprietary models. The architecture is decoupled: teams can adopt the grounding/prompting layer or the serving layer independently. A small internal survey (n=8) provides directional signals of reduced triage effort and moderate perceived grounding, with participants reporting fewer human review iterations. We outline operational lessons and limitations, emphasizing reproducibility, auditability, and pathways to broader standards and assisted patching.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Memory allocators hide beneath nearly every application stack, yet their performance footprint extends far beyond their code size. Even small inefficiencies in the allocators ripple through caches and the rest of the memory hierarchy, collectively imposing what operators often call a "datacenter tax". At hyperscale, even a 1% improvement in allocator efficiency can unlock millions of dollars in savings and measurable reductions in datacenter energy consumption. Modern memory allocators are designed to optimize allocation speed and memory fragmentation in multi-threaded environments, relying on complex metadata and control logic to achieve high performance. However, the overhead introduced by this complexity prompts a reevaluation of allocator design. Notably, such overhead can be avoided in single-threaded scenarios, which continue to be widely used across diverse application domains.   In this paper, we introduce Exgen-Malloc, a memory allocator purpose-built for single-threaded applications. By specializing for single-threaded execution, Exgen-Malloc eliminates unnecessary metadata, simplifies the control flow, thereby reducing overhead and improving allocation efficiency. Its core design features include a centralized heap, a single free-block list, and a balanced strategy for memory commitment and relocation. Additionally, Exgen-Malloc incorporates design principles in modern multi-threaded allocators, which do not exist in legacy single-threaded allocators such as dlmalloc. We evaluate Exgen-Malloc on two Intel Xeon platforms. Across both systems, Exgen-Malloc achieves a speedup of 1.17x, 1.10x, and 1.93x over dlmalloc on SPEC CPU2017, redis-benchmark, and mimalloc-bench, respectively. In addition to performance, Exgen-Malloc achieves 6.2%, 0.1%, and 25.2% memory savings over mimalloc on SPEC CPU2017, redis-benchmark, and mimalloc-bench, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems suffer from severe time-to-first-token (TTFT) bottlenecks due to long input sequences. Existing KV cache reuse methods face a fundamental trade-off: prefix caching requires identical prefixes that rarely occur in RAG scenarios, while direct precomputation sacrifices quality due to missing inter-chunk attention and repeated attention sinks. Recent methods like APE and CacheBlend partially address these issues but remain inadequate for robust RAG applications. This paper presents CacheClip, a novel framework that achieves both fast TTFT and high generation quality. Our key insight is that small auxiliary LLMs exhibit similar last-layer attention distributions to primary LLMs (the target model for generation), enabling efficient identification of tokens critical for restoring inter-chunk attention, thereby significantly improving response quality on cross-chunk reasoning tasks. CacheClip integrates three techniques: (1) auxiliary-model-guided token selection for selective KV cache recomputation, where the auxiliary model is finetuned to improve selection accuracy, (2) shared prefixes to eliminate redundant attention sinks, and (3) grouping strategy to maintain local coherence during partial KV cache updates. Experiments show CacheClip retains up to 94.8% and 85.0% of full-attention performance on NIAH and LongBench, outperforming APE and CacheBlend by 25.2% and 35.1% on NIAH (with reomp% = 20%). Meanwhile, CacheClip accelerates LLM inference by up to 1.92x in prefill time, providing a practical solution to the efficiency-quality trade-off in RAG systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern large language models (LLMs) extend context lengths to millions of tokens, enabling coherent, personalized responses grounded in long conversational histories. This ability, however, hinges on Key-Value (KV) caching, whose memory grows linearly with dialogue length and quickly becomes the bottleneck in resource-constrained environments. An active line of research for reducing memory bottleneck is KV cache compression, which seeks to limit cache size while preserving accuracy. Yet existing methods face two major limitations: (i) evicting the KV cache after full-context prefill causes unbounded peak memory, and (ii) query-dependent eviction narrows the cache to a single query, leading to failure cases in multi-turn conversations. We introduce EpiCache, a training-free KV cache management framework for long conversational question answering (LongConvQA) under fixed memory budgets. EpiCache bounds cache growth through block-wise prefill and preserves topic-relevant context via episodic KV compression, which clusters conversation history into coherent episodes and applies episode-specific KV cache eviction. We further design an adaptive layer-wise budget allocation strategy that measures each layer's sensitivity to eviction and distributes the memory budget across layers accordingly. Across three LongConvQA benchmarks, EpiCache improves accuracy by up to 40%, maintains near-full KV accuracy under 4-6x compression, and reduces latency/memory by up to 2.4x/3.5x, enabling efficient multi-turn interaction under strict resource limits.

User behavior forms a distinct modality, where each action, defined by multi-dimensional attributes such as time, context, and transaction type, constitutes a behavioral token. Modeling these high-cardinality sequences is challenging, and discriminative models often falter under limited supervision. To bridge this gap, we extend generative pretraining to user behavior, learning transferable representations from unlabeled behavioral data analogous to how LLMs learn from text. We present PANTHER, a hybrid generative-discriminative framework that unifies user behavior pretraining and downstream adaptation, enabling large-scale sequential user representation learning and real-time inference. PANTHER introduces: (1) Structured Tokenization to compress multi-dimensional transaction attributes into an interpretable vocabulary; (2) Sequence Pattern Recognition Module (SPRM) for modeling periodic transaction motifs; (3) a Unified User-Profile Embedding that fuses static demographics with dynamic transaction histories; and (4) Real-time scalability enabled by offline caching of pretrained embeddings for millisecond-level inference. Fully deployed and operational online at WeChat Pay, PANTHER delivers a 25.6 percent boost in next-transaction prediction HitRate@1 and a 38.6 percent relative improvement in fraud detection recall over baselines. Cross-domain evaluations on public benchmarks show strong generalization, achieving up to 21 percent HitRate@1 gains over transformer baselines, establishing PANTHER as a scalable, high-performance framework for industrial sequential user behavior modeling.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Contemporary web application architectures involve many layers of proxy services that process traffic. Due to the complexity of HTTP and vendor design decisions, these proxies sometimes process a given request in different ways. Attackers can exploit these processing discrepancies to launch damaging attacks including web cache poisoning and request smuggling. Discrepancy attacks are surging, yet, there exists no systemic defense.   In this work, we propose the first comprehensive defense to address this problem, called HTTP Request Synchronization. Our scheme uses standard HTTP extension mechanisms to augment each request with a complete processing history. It propagates this context through the traffic path detailing how each server hop has processed said request. Using this history, every proxy server can validate that their processing is consistent with all previous hops, eliminating discrepancy attacks. We implement our scheme for 5 popular proxy technologies, Apache, NGINX, HAProxy, Varnish, and Cloudflare, demonstrating its practical impact.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Property-based testing (PBT) is a lightweight formal method, typically implemented as a randomized testing framework. Users specify the input domain for their test using combinators supplied by the PBT framework, and the expected properties or invariants as a unit-test function. The framework then searches for a counterexample, e.g. by generating inputs and calling the test function. In this work, we demonstrate an LLM-based agent which analyzes Python modules, infers function-specific and cross-function properties from code and documentation, synthesizes and executes PBTs, reflects on outputs of these tests to confirm true bugs, and finally outputs actionable bug reports for the developer. We perform an extensive evaluation of our agent across 100 popular Python packages. Of the bug reports generated by the agent, we found after manual review that 56\% were valid bugs and 32\% were valid bugs that we would report to maintainers. We then developed a ranking rubric to surface high-priority valid bugs to developers, and found that of the 21 top-scoring bugs, 86\% were valid and 81\% we would report. The bugs span diverse failure modes from serialization failures to numerical precision errors to flawed cache implementations. We reported 5 bugs, 4 with patches, including to NumPy and cloud computing SDKs, with 3 patches merged successfully. Our results suggest that LLMs with PBT provides a rigorous and scalable method for autonomously testing software. Our code and artifacts are available at: https://github.com/mmaaz-git/agentic-pbt.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks by generating long chains of intermediate steps, but their inference cost is dominated by decoding, where each new token must attend to the entire growing sequence. Existing sparse attention methods reduce computation by pruning the key-value (KV) cache, yet they suffer from severe accuracy degradation on reasoning tasks due to cumulative selection errors and the dynamic importance of tokens over long derivations. We present \textbf{DELTA}, a training-free sparse attention mechanism that achieves computational efficiency without sacrificing model accuracy. DELTA partitions transformer layers into three groups: initial layers that use full attention, a small set of \emph{selection layers} that identify salient tokens via aggregated head-level attention scores, and subsequent \emph{sparse-attention layers} that attend only to the selected subset. This design preserves the full KV cache in GPU memory for accuracy, while avoiding expensive full-attention computation over many layers. On reasoning benchmarks such as AIME and GPQA-Diamond, DELTA matches or surpasses full attention in accuracy, while reducing the number of attended tokens by up to $5\times$ and delivering $1.5\times$ end-to-end speedup. Our results show that selective reuse of intermediate attention maps offers a robust path toward efficient long-context reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks, a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning (SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks, which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense, per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning, improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by +5.96.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Fine-tuning is a crucial paradigm for adapting pre-trained large language models to downstream tasks. Recently, methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been shown to effectively fine-tune LLMs with an extreme reduction in trainable parameters. But, \emph{are their learned solutions really equivalent?} We study how LoRA and full-finetuning change pre-trained models by analyzing the model's weight matrices through the lens of their spectral properties. We find that LoRA and full fine-tuning yield weight matrices whose singular value decompositions exhibit very different structure: weight matrices trained with LoRA have new, high-ranking singular vectors, which we call \emph{intruder dimensions}, while those trained with full fine-tuning do not. Further, we extend the finding that LoRA forgets less than full fine-tuning and find its forgetting is vastly localized to the intruder dimension -- by causally intervening on the intruder dimensions by changing their associated singular values post-fine-tuning, we show that they cause forgetting. Moreover, scaling them down significantly improves modeling of the pre-training distribution with a minimal drop in downstream task performance. Given this, we should expect accumulating intruder dimensions to be harmful and lead to more forgetting. This will be amplified during continual learning because of sequentially fine-tuning, and we show that LoRA models do accumulate intruder dimensions here tend to perform worse in this setting, emphasizing the practicality of our findings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Inverse reinforcement learning is the problem of inferring a reward function from an optimal policy or demonstrations by an expert. In this work, it is assumed that the reward is expressed as a reward machine whose transitions depend on atomic propositions associated with the state of a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Our goal is to identify the true reward machine using finite information. To this end, we first introduce the notion of a prefix tree policy which associates a distribution of actions to each state of the MDP and each attainable finite sequence of atomic propositions. Then, we characterize an equivalence class of reward machines that can be identified given the prefix tree policy. Finally, we propose a SAT-based algorithm that uses information extracted from the prefix tree policy to solve for a reward machine. It is proved that if the prefix tree policy is known up to a sufficient (but finite) depth, our algorithm recovers the exact reward machine up to the equivalence class. This sufficient depth is derived as a function of the number of MDP states and (an upper bound on) the number of states of the reward machine. These results are further extended to the case where we only have access to demonstrations from an optimal policy. Several examples, including discrete grid and block worlds, a continuous state-space robotic arm, and real data from experiments with mice, are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the approach.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose a rubric-guided, pseudo-labeled, and prompt-driven zero-shot video summarization framework that bridges large language models with structured semantic reasoning. A small subset of human annotations is converted into high-confidence pseudo labels and organized into dataset-adaptive rubrics defining clear evaluation dimensions such as thematic relevance, action detail, and narrative progression. During inference, boundary scenes, including the opening and closing segments, are scored independently based on their own descriptions, while intermediate scenes incorporate concise summaries of adjacent segments to assess narrative continuity and redundancy. This design enables the language model to balance local salience with global coherence without any parameter tuning. Across three benchmarks, the proposed method achieves stable and competitive results, with F1 scores of 57.58 on SumMe, 63.05 on TVSum, and 53.79 on QFVS, surpassing zero-shot baselines by +0.85, +0.84, and +0.37, respectively. These outcomes demonstrate that rubric-guided pseudo labeling combined with contextual prompting effectively stabilizes LLM-based scoring and establishes a general, interpretable, and training-free paradigm for both generic and query-focused video summarization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models are typically trained on datasets collected from the web, which may inadvertently contain harmful or sensitive personal information. To address growing privacy concerns, unlearning methods have been proposed to remove the influence of specific data from trained models. Of these, exact unlearning -- which retrains the model from scratch without the target data -- is widely regarded the gold standard for mitigating privacy risks in deployment. In this paper, we revisit this assumption in a practical deployment setting where both the pre- and post-unlearning logits API are exposed, such as in open-weight scenarios. Targeting this setting, we introduce a novel data extraction attack that leverages signals from the pre-unlearning model to guide the post-unlearning model, uncovering patterns that reflect the removed data distribution. Combining model guidance with a token filtering strategy, our attack significantly improves extraction success rates -- doubling performance in some cases -- across common benchmarks such as MUSE, TOFU, and WMDP. Furthermore, we demonstrate our attack's effectiveness on a simulated medical diagnosis dataset to highlight real-world privacy risks associated with exact unlearning. In light of our findings, which suggest that unlearning may, in a contradictory way, increase the risk of privacy leakage during real-world deployments, we advocate for evaluation of unlearning methods to consider broader threat models that account not only for post-unlearning models but also for adversarial access to prior checkpoints.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present Hubble, a suite of fully open-source large language models (LLMs) for the scientific study of LLM memorization. Hubble models come in standard and perturbed variants: standard models are pretrained on a large English corpus, and perturbed models are trained in the same way but with controlled insertion of text (e.g., book passages, biographies, and test sets) designed to emulate key memorization risks. Our core release includes 8 models -- standard and perturbed models with 1B or 8B parameters, pretrained on 100B or 500B tokens -- establishing that memorization risks are determined by the frequency of sensitive data relative to size of the training corpus (i.e., a password appearing once in a smaller corpus is memorized better than the same password in a larger corpus). Our release also includes 6 perturbed models with text inserted at different pretraining phases, showing that sensitive data without continued exposure can be forgotten. These findings suggest two best practices for addressing memorization risks: to dilute sensitive data by increasing the size of the training corpus, and to order sensitive data to appear earlier in training. Beyond these general empirical findings, Hubble enables a broad range of memorization research; for example, analyzing the biographies reveals how readily different types of private information are memorized. We also demonstrate that the randomized insertions in Hubble make it an ideal testbed for membership inference and machine unlearning, and invite the community to further explore, benchmark, and build upon our work.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the ''learning cliff'' phenomenon: when faced with problems far beyond their current capabilities, models consistently fail, yielding a persistent zero-reward signal. In policy optimization algorithms like GRPO, this collapses the advantage calculation to zero, rendering these difficult problems invisible to the learning gradient and stalling progress. To overcome this, we introduce Scaf-GRPO (Scaffolded Group Relative Policy Optimization), a progressive training framework that strategically provides minimal guidance only when a model's independent learning has plateaued. The framework first diagnoses learning stagnation and then intervenes by injecting tiered in-prompt hints, ranging from abstract concepts to concrete steps, enabling the model to construct a valid solution by itself. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematics benchmarks demonstrate Scaf-GRPO's effectiveness, boosting the pass@1 score of the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model on the AIME24 benchmark by a relative 44.3% over a vanilla GRPO baseline. This result demonstrates our framework provides a robust and effective methodology for unlocking a model's ability to solve problems previously beyond its reach, a critical step towards extending the frontier of autonomous reasoning in LLM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Synthetic data has become a cornerstone for scaling large language models, yet its multilingual use remains bottlenecked by translation-based prompts. This strategy inherits English-centric framing and style and neglects cultural dimensions, ultimately constraining model generalization. We argue that the overlooked prompt space-the very inputs that define training distributions-offers a more powerful lever for improving multilingual performance. We introduce a lightweight framework for prompt-space optimization, where translated prompts are systematically transformed for Naturalness, Cultural Adaptation, and Difficulty Enhancement. Using an off-the-shelf multilingual LLM, we apply these transformations to prompts for 12 languages spanning 7 families. Under identical data conditions, our approaches achieve substantial and consistent downstream improvements over the translation-only baseline: +4.7% on Global-MMLU accuracy, +2.4% on Flores XCometXL and +35.3% wins in preferences on mArenaHard. We establish prompt-space optimization as a simple yet powerful paradigm for building multilingual LLMs that are more robust, culturally grounded, and globally capable.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Public and nonprofit organizations often hesitate to adopt AI tools because most models are opaque even though standard approaches typically analyze aggregate patterns rather than offering actionable, case-level guidance. This study tests a practitioner-in-the-loop workflow that pairs transparent decision-tree models with large language models (LLMs) to improve predictive accuracy, interpretability, and the generation of practical insights. Using data from an ongoing college-success program, we build interpretable decision trees to surface key predictors. We then provide each tree's structure to an LLM, enabling it to reproduce case-level predictions grounded in the transparent models. Practitioners participate throughout feature engineering, model design, explanation review, and usability assessment, ensuring that field expertise informs the analysis at every stage. Results show that integrating transparent models, LLMs, and practitioner input yields accurate, trustworthy, and actionable case-level evaluations, offering a viable pathway for responsible AI adoption in the public and nonprofit sectors.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We explore the observational prospects for detecting gravitational lensing induced by cosmological matter currents, a relativistic correction to the standard scalar lensing effect arising from the motion of matter. We propose to isolate this contribution by cross-correlating the weak-lensing convergence field with a reconstructed cosmic momentum field inferred from galaxy surveys. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that this reconstructed momentum field is uncorrelated with the scalar lensing signal, enabling a clean separation of the gravitomagnetic component. We then forecast the detectability of this signal for upcoming wide-field galaxy and weak-lensing surveys, showing that a statistically significant detection may be achievable under realistic observational conditions. Such a measurement would provide the first direct probe of the large-scale cosmic momentum field, offering a novel test of general relativity and Lorentz invariance on cosmological scales.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Suppose Alice trains an open-weight language model and Bob uses a blackbox derivative of Alice's model to produce text. Can Alice prove that Bob is using her model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from the text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an independence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model or text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it through the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are more likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob is using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between Bob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training run. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant correlation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the null hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the query setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model gives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of over 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to 12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value on the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational setting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's text overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood of Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by repeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data. The second approach can reliably distinguish Bob's text from as little as a few hundred tokens; the first does not involve any retraining but requires many more tokens (several hundred thousand) to achieve high power.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Tool calling has become increasingly popular for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, for large tool sets, the resulting tokens would exceed the LLM's context window limit, making it impossible to include every tool. Hence, an external retriever is used to provide LLMs with the most relevant tools for a query. Existing retrieval models rank tools based on the similarity between a user query and a tool description (TD). This leads to suboptimal retrieval as user requests are often poorly aligned with the language of TD. To remedy the issue, we propose ToolDreamer, a framework to condition retriever models to fetch tools based on hypothetical (synthetic) TD generated using an LLM, i.e., description of tools that the LLM feels will be potentially useful for the query. The framework enables a more natural alignment between queries and tools within the language space of TD's. We apply ToolDreamer on the ToolRet dataset and show that our method improves the performance of sparse and dense retrievers with and without training, thus showcasing its flexibility. Through our proposed framework, our aim is to offload a portion of the reasoning burden to the retriever so that the LLM may effectively handle a large collection of tools without inundating its context window.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Model-learning agents should gather information to learn world models that support many downstream tasks and inferences, such as predicting unobserved states, estimating near- and far-term consequences of actions, planning action sequences, and detecting changes in dynamics. Current methods for learning and evaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are anchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization in the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate model-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test phase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is open-ended$\unicode{x2014}$models should support many different tasks unknown ahead of time$\unicode{x2014}$and agnostic to model representation, allowing comparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a suite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three families: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the causal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models on AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute improves performance only in some environments but not others. WorldTest provides a novel template$\unicode{x2014}$reward-free exploration, derived tests, and behavior-based scoring$\unicode{x2014}$to evaluate what agents learn about environment dynamics, and AutumnBench exposes significant headroom in world-model learning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Data-driven methods offer efficient and robust solutions for analyzing complex dynamical systems but rely on the assumption of I.I.D. data, driving the development of generalization techniques for handling environmental differences. These techniques, however, are limited by their dependence on environment labels, which are often unavailable during training due to data acquisition challenges, privacy concerns, and environmental variability, particularly in large public datasets and privacy-sensitive domains. In response, we propose DynaInfer, a novel method that infers environment specifications by analyzing prediction errors from fixed neural networks within each training round, enabling environment assignments directly from data. We prove our algorithm effectively solves the alternating optimization problem in unlabeled scenarios and validate it through extensive experiments across diverse dynamical systems. Results show that DynaInfer outperforms existing environment assignment techniques, converges rapidly to true labels, and even achieves superior performance when environment labels are available.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We study model merging as a practical alternative to conventional adaptation strategies for code-mixed NLP. Starting from a multilingual base model, we: (i) perform continued pre-training (CPT) on unlabeled code-mixed text to obtain an adapted checkpoint, (ii) merge checkpoint with the base model, and (iii) fine-tune (FT) on the downstream task data. We evaluate our approach for sentence classification (sentiment and hate speech) task in English-Hindi (En-Hi) and English-Spanish (En-Es) using XLM-R and Llama-3.2-1B models. Our results show that merged models consistently outperform full fine-tuning and CPT->FT. We observe gains of 2--5 points in F1 over full fine-tuning and ~1-2 points over CPT->FT, indicating that unlabeled data is leveraged more effectively via merging than via CPT alone. Zero-/few-shot prompting with larger LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.3-70B) lags behind fine-tuned and merged checkpoints, underscoring limits of in-context learning for code-mixed inputs. We further test cross-pair transfer by training on En-Hi and evaluating on En-Ta and En-Ml: merged checkpoints transfer more strongly than monolingual-English baselines (e.g., TV/TIES variants reaching 0.65-0.68 F1 vs 0.61-0.63 for full fine-tuning), suggesting that code-mixed knowledge is a more reliable substrate for low-resource pairs. We conclude with adaptation recipes matched to common data regimes (labeled only; labeled+unlabeled; transfer-only) and discuss limitations and scaling considerations for broader tasks and larger models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Data science aims to extract insights from data to support decision-making processes. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly used as assistants for data science, by suggesting ideas, techniques and small code snippets, or for the interpretation of results and reporting. Proper automation of some data-science activities is now promised by the rise of LLM agents, i.e., AI systems powered by an LLM equipped with additional affordances--such as code execution and knowledge bases--that can perform self-directed actions and interact with digital environments. In this paper, we survey the evaluation of LLM assistants and agents for data science. We find (1) a dominant focus on a small subset of goal-oriented activities, largely ignoring data management and exploratory activities; (2) a concentration on pure assistance or fully autonomous agents, without considering intermediate levels of human-AI collaboration; and (3) an emphasis on human substitution, therefore neglecting the possibility of higher levels of automation thanks to task transformation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates large language model inference by employing a small draft model to generate predictions, which are then verified by a larger target model. The effectiveness of SD hinges on the alignment between these models, which is typically enhanced by Knowledge Distillation (KD). However, conventional KD methods aim to minimize the KL divergence between the draft and target models across all tokens, a goal that is misaligned with the true objective of SD, which is to maximize token acceptance rate. Therefore, draft models often struggle to fully assimilate the target model's knowledge due to capacity constraints, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this challenge, we propose AdaSPEC, a novel method that incorporates selective token filtering into the KD process. AdaSPEC utilizes a reference model to identify and filter out difficult-to-fit tokens, enabling the distillation of a draft model that better aligns with the target model on simpler tokens. This approach improves the overall token acceptance rate without compromising generation quality. We evaluate AdaSPEC across diverse tasks, including arithmetic reasoning, instruction-following, coding, and summarization, using model configurations of 31M/1.4B and 350M/2.7B parameters. Our results demonstrate that AdaSPEC consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art DistillSpec method, achieving higher acceptance rates across all tasks (up to 15\%). The code is publicly available at https://github.com/yuezhouhu/adaspec.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sparse fine-tuning techniques adapt LLMs to downstream tasks by only tuning a sparse subset of model parameters. However, the effectiveness of sparse adaptation depends on optimally selecting the model parameters to be fine-tuned. In this work, we introduce a novel sparse fine-tuning technique named GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters, which fine-tunes only those model parameters which have the largest gradient magnitudes on downstream tasks and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes, intuitively prioritizing parameters that are highly task-relevant, but minimally disruptive to pre-trained knowledge. Our experimentation with LLaMA3 8B and Gemma 2B as base models shows that GaLLoP consistently improves or matches the in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution performance obtained via the usage of other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, including LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT. Our analysis demonstrates that GaLLoP mitigates catastrophic forgetting and memorization of task data, as important pre-trained parameters remain unchanged, and stabilizes performance relative to other fine-tuning techniques, robustly generalizing across most random seeds.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern software is increasingly built by composing APIs, elevating the API contract to a critical role. Inadequate contracts, however, lead to mismatched expectations and failures, creating a pressing need for robust conformance testing. Current test generation techniques are hindered by key challenges: polyglot systems, source code inaccessibility, a cost-reliability trade-off, and, most critically, the difficulty of generating structured inputs.   We introduce BOSQTGEN, a novel black-box methodology and tool for API test generation. BOSQTGEN utilizes a novel approach for decomposing API specifications into primitives, using LLMs to suggest coherent strata for them, and employing combinatorial testing to efficiently sample over these values. This approach ensures coverage of critical interactions while avoiding the redundancy of random sampling.   The resulting BOSQTGEN system achieves an average of 82% code coverage on RESTful benchmarks, often a 20% or more increase over prior state-of-the-art systems and nearing parity with hand-written test suites. Providing a fully API-driven approach to test generation, enables developers to automatically create high-quality test cases for validation or test-driven development.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph-based learned simulators have emerged as a promising approach for simulating physical systems on unstructured meshes, offering speed and generalization across diverse geometries. However, they often struggle with capturing global phenomena, such as bending or long-range correlations usually occurring in solid mechanics, and suffer from error accumulation over long rollouts due to their reliance on local message passing and direct next-step prediction. We address these limitations by introducing the Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference Network (ROBIN), a novel learned simulator that integrates two key innovations: (i) Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference (ROBI), a parallelized inference scheme that amortizes the cost of diffusion-based refinement across physical time steps by overlapping denoising steps across a temporal window. (ii) A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network built on algebraic multigrid coarsening, enabling multiscale message passing across different mesh resolutions. This architecture, implemented via Algebraic-hierarchical Message Passing Networks, captures both fine-scale local dynamics and global structural effects critical for phenomena like beam bending or multi-body contact. We validate ROBIN on challenging 2D and 3D solid mechanics benchmarks involving geometric, material, and contact nonlinearities. ROBIN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on all tasks, substantially outperforming existing next-step learned simulators while reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude compared to standard diffusion simulators.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Membership inference attacks (MIAs) have emerged as the standard tool for evaluating the privacy risks of AI models. However, state-of-the-art attacks require training numerous, often computationally expensive, reference models, limiting their practicality. We present a novel approach for estimating model-level vulnerability, the TPR at low FPR, to membership inference attacks without requiring reference models. Empirical analysis shows loss distributions to be asymmetric and heavy-tailed and suggests that most points at risk from MIAs have moved from the tail (high-loss region) to the head (low-loss region) of the distribution after training. We leverage this insight to propose a method to estimate model-level vulnerability from the training and testing distribution alone: using the absence of outliers from the high-loss region as a predictor of the risk. We evaluate our method, the TNR of a simple loss attack, across a wide range of architectures and datasets and show it to accurately estimate model-level vulnerability to the SOTA MIA attack (LiRA). We also show our method to outperform both low-cost (few reference models) attacks such as RMIA and other measures of distribution difference. We finally evaluate the use of non-linear functions to evaluate risk and show the approach to be promising to evaluate the risk in large-language models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LLM-based agents are increasingly moving towards proactivity: rather than awaiting instruction, they exercise agency to anticipate user needs and solve them autonomously. However, evaluating proactivity is challenging; current benchmarks are constrained to localized context, limiting their ability to test reasoning across sources and longer time horizons. To address this gap, we present PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks). PROBE decomposes proactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for unspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing appropriate resolutions. We apply PROBE to evaluate leading LLMs and popular agentic frameworks, showing that even state-of-the-art models struggle to solve this benchmark. Computing our consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and agents, we find that the best end-to-end performance of 40% is achieved by both GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. Additionally, we demonstrate the relative capabilities of each model and analyze mutual failure modes. Our results highlight the current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems, and expose promising future research directions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) capability is central to the recent breakthroughs achieved by large language models in complex reasoning tasks. However, the accompanying issue of ''underthinking'', where models exhibit shallow reasoning by frequently switching thoughts without sufficient exploration, limits both performance and token efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a simple yet effective reasoning strategy: the SmartSwitch inference framework. This framework can be easily integrated into any large language model as a plug-and-play solution, continuously monitoring the model's reasoning process to detect underthinking and guide it toward deeper exploration of promising but overlooked thoughts. Specifically, the perception module identifies points where thoughts switch and evaluates the potential of the preceding thought using an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM). If a high-potential thought is found to be prematurely abandoned, the intervention module interrupts the ongoing inference, backtracks to the point before the switch, and inserts a "deepening prompt" to encourage further exploration along that promising path. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the performance of various large language models of different sizes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The majority of research in both training Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and modeling learning in biological brains focuses on synaptic plasticity, where learning equates to changing the strength of existing connections. However, in biological brains, structural plasticity - where new connections are created and others removed - is also vital, not only for effective learning but also for recovery from damage and optimal resource usage. Inspired by structural plasticity, pruning is often used in machine learning to remove weak connections from trained models to reduce the computational requirements of inference. However, the machine learning frameworks typically used for backpropagation-based training of both ANNs and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are optimized for dense connectivity, meaning that pruning does not help reduce the training costs of ever-larger models. The GeNN simulator already supports efficient GPU-accelerated simulation of sparse SNNs for computational neuroscience and machine learning. Here, we present a new flexible framework for implementing GPU-accelerated structural plasticity rules and demonstrate this first using the e-prop supervised learning rule and DEEP R to train efficient, sparse SNN classifiers and then, in an unsupervised learning context, to learn topographic maps. Compared to baseline dense models, our sparse classifiers reduce training time by up to 10x while the DEEP R rewiring enables them to perform as well as the original models. We demonstrate topographic map formation in faster-than-realtime simulations, provide insights into the connectivity evolution, and measure simulation speed versus network size. The proposed framework will enable further research into achieving and maintaining sparsity in network structure and neural communication, as well as exploring the computational benefits of sparsity in a range of neuromorphic applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their exceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent \textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.   Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its classification and analysis.   Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of \textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Solving complex real-world control tasks often takes multiple tries: if we fail at first, we reflect on what went wrong, and change our strategy accordingly to avoid making the same mistake. In robotics, Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) offer a promising path towards solving complex control tasks, but lack the ability to contextually and dynamically readjust behavior when they fail to accomplish a task. In this work, we introduce Learning from Inference-Time Execution (LITEN), which connects a VLA low-level policy to a high-level VLM that conditions on past experiences by including them in-context, allowing it to learn the affordances and capabilities of the low-level VLA. Our approach iterates between a reasoning phase that generates and executes plans for the low-level VLA, and an assessment phase that reflects on the resulting execution and draws useful conclusions to be included in future reasoning contexts. Unlike similar approaches to self-refinement in non-robotics domains, LITEN must reflect on unstructured real-world robot trajectories (e.g., raw videos), which requires structured guiderails during assessment. Our experimental results demonstrate LITEN is able to effectively learn from past experience to generate plans that use high-affordance instructions to accomplish long-horizon tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming software creation by enabling zero code development platforms. Our survey reviews recent platforms that let users build applications without writing code, by leveraging LLMs as the brains of the development process. We adopt a broad survey methodology, categorizing platforms based on key dimensions such as interface style, backend integration, output type, and extensibility. We analyze both dedicated LLM based app builders (OpenAI's custom GPTs, Bolt.new, Dust.tt, Flowise, Cognosys) and general no code platforms (e.g., Bubble, Glide) that integrate LLM capabilities. We present a taxonomy categorizing these platforms by their interface (conversational, visual, etc.), supported LLM backends, output type (chatbot, full application, workflow), and degree of extensibility. Core features such as autonomous agents, memory management, workflow orchestration, and API integrations are in scope of the survey. We provide a detailed comparison, highlighting each platform's strengths and limitations. Trade offs (customizability, scalability, vendor lock-in) are discussed in comparison with traditional and low code development approaches. Finally, we outline future directions, including multimodal interfaces, on device LLMs, and improved orchestration for democratizing app creation with AI. Our findings indicate that while zero code LLM platforms greatly reduce the barrier to creating AI powered applications, they still face challenges in flexibility and reliability. Overall, the landscape is rapidly evolving, offering exciting opportunities to empower non programmers to create sophisticated software.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have underscored the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to facilitate the emergence of reasoning capabilities. Despite the encouraging results, a fundamental dilemma persists as RL improvement relies on learning from high-quality samples, yet the exploration for such samples remains bounded by the inherent limitations of LLMs. This, in effect, creates an undesirable cycle in which what cannot be explored cannot be learned. In this work, we propose Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel instructional scaffolding framework designed to break the exploration bottleneck for general LLM reasoning. Specifically, RuscaRL introduces checklist-style rubrics as (1) explicit scaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, where different rubrics are provided as external guidance within task instructions to steer diverse high-quality responses. This guidance is gradually decayed over time, encouraging the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns; (2) verifiable rewards for exploitation during model training, where we can obtain robust LLM-as-a-Judge scores using rubrics as references, enabling effective RL on general reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RuscaRL across various benchmarks, effectively expanding reasoning boundaries under the Best-of-N evaluation. Notably, RuscaRL significantly boosts Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 23.6 to 50.3 on HealthBench-500, surpassing GPT-4.1. Furthermore, our fine-tuned variant on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct achieves 61.1 on HealthBench-500, outperforming leading LLMs including OpenAI-o3. Our code is available at https://github.com/IANNXANG/RuscaRL.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Rigorous security-focused evaluation of large language model (LLM) agents is imperative for establishing trust in their safe deployment throughout the software development lifecycle. However, existing benchmarks largely rely on synthetic challenges or simplified vulnerability datasets that fail to capture the complexity and ambiguity encountered by security engineers in practice. We introduce SEC-bench, the first fully automated benchmarking framework for evaluating LLM agents on authentic security engineering tasks. SEC-bench employs a novel multi-agent scaffold that automatically constructs code repositories with harnesses, reproduces vulnerabilities in isolated environments, and generates gold patches for reliable evaluation. Our framework automatically creates high-quality software vulnerability datasets with reproducible artifacts at a cost of only $0.87 per instance. Using SEC-bench, we implement two critical software security tasks to rigorously evaluate LLM agents' capabilities: proof-of-concept (PoC) generation and vulnerability patching. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM code agents reveals significant performance gaps, achieving at most 18.0% success in PoC generation and 34.0% in vulnerability patching on our complete dataset. These results highlight the crucial steps needed toward developing LLM agents that are more practical, intelligent, and autonomous for security engineering.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Ranking items based on pairwise comparisons is common, from using match outcomes to rank sports teams to using purchase or survey data to rank consumer products. Statistical inference-based methods such as the Bradley-Terry model, which extract rankings based on an underlying generative model, have emerged as flexible and powerful tools to tackle ranking in empirical data. In situations with limited and/or noisy comparisons, it is often challenging to confidently distinguish the performance of different items based on the evidence available in the data. However, most inference-based ranking methods choose to assign each item to a unique rank or score, suggesting a meaningful distinction when there is none. Here, we develop a principled nonparametric Bayesian method, adaptable to any statistical ranking method, for learning partial rankings (rankings with ties) that distinguishes among the ranks of different items only when there is sufficient evidence available in the data. We develop a fast agglomerative algorithm to perform Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) inference of partial rankings under our framework and examine the performance of our method on a variety of real and synthetic network datasets, finding that it frequently gives a more parsimonious summary of the data than traditional ranking, particularly when observations are sparse.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has become a cornerstone method in modern data science. However, deploying SGD in high-stakes applications necessitates rigorous quantification of its inherent uncertainty. In this work, we establish \emph{non-asymptotic Berry--Esseen bounds} for linear functionals of online least-squares SGD, thereby providing a Gaussian Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in a \emph{growing-dimensional regime}. Existing approaches to high-dimensional inference for projection parameters, such as~\cite{chang2023inference}, rely on inverting empirical covariance matrices and require at least $t \gtrsim d^{3/2}$ iterations to achieve finite-sample Berry--Esseen guarantees, rendering them computationally expensive and restrictive in the allowable dimensional scaling. In contrast, we show that a CLT holds for SGD iterates when the number of iterations grows as $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$ for any $\delta > 0$, significantly extending the dimensional regime permitted by prior works while improving computational efficiency. The proposed online SGD-based procedure operates in $\mathcal{O}(td)$ time and requires only $\mathcal{O}(d)$ memory, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(td^2 + d^3)$ runtime of covariance-inversion methods. To render the theory practically applicable, we further develop an \emph{online variance estimator} for the asymptotic variance appearing in the CLT and establish \emph{high-probability deviation bounds} for this estimator. Collectively, these results yield the first fully online and data-driven framework for constructing confidence intervals for SGD iterates in the near-optimal scaling regime $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Model (LLM) conditioning refers to instructing an LLM to generate content in accordance with the norms and values of a specific culture, beliefs of a particular political orientation, or any desired text-specified semantic conditioning. Unfortunately, prompt engineering does not ensure that LLMs behave in accordance with a desired conditioning due to the inductive bias of the pre-training and alignment datasets. Prior works have focused on fine-tuning LLMs by directly conditioning the LoRA weights; however, such methods introduce a large number of parameters. As a remedy, we propose Zhyper, a parameter-efficient factorized hypernetwork framework that generates context-aware LoRA adapters from textual descriptions. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that Zhyper achieves competitive performance with up to 26x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we extend Zhyper to cultural alignment, demonstrating improved generalization to out-of-domain settings and a better capturing of fine-grained contextual values.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) promise to democratize financial analysis by reducing information-processing costs. Yet equal access does not ensure equal outcomes, as the locus of friction may shift from processing information to evaluating model outputs. We study GPT's earnings forecasts following corporate earnings releases and document two patterns. First, GPT's narrative attention is consistent and human-like but not always associated with higher forecast accuracy. Second, its quantitative reasoning varies substantially across contexts, challenging the view that LLMs are uniformly weak at numerical tasks. Building on these insights, we propose a diagnostic framework that links forecast accuracy to observable processing features (i.e., narrative focus, numerical reasoning, and self-assessed confidence). These indicators serve as proxies for this new form of information friction and alert investors when to exercise caution. Our study has implications for information frictions, regulatory oversight, and the economics of AI-mediated financial markets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it is crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay contextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training transformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks, visual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans can maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories. Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in photo-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context transformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient. Additionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and remains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be truncated to fit inference constraints.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The use of generative models to sample equilibrium distributions of many-body systems, as first demonstrated by Boltzmann Generators, has attracted substantial interest due to their ability to produce unbiased and uncorrelated samples in `one shot'. Despite their promise and impressive results across the natural sciences, scaling these models to large systems remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a Boltzmann Generator architecture that addresses this scalability bottleneck with a focus on applications in materials science. We leverage augmented coupling flows in combination with graph neural networks to base the generation process on local environmental information, while allowing for energy-based training and fast inference. Compared to previous architectures, our model trains significantly faster, requires far less computational resources, and achieves superior sampling efficiencies. Crucially, the architecture is transferable to larger system sizes, which allows for the efficient sampling of materials with simulation cells of unprecedented size. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by applying it to several materials systems, including Lennard-Jones crystals, ice phases of mW water, and the phase diagram of silicon, for system sizes well above one thousand atoms. The trained Boltzmann Generators produce highly accurate equilibrium ensembles for various crystal structures, as well as Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies across a range of system sizes, able to reach scales where finite-size effects become negligible.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large multimodal models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in understanding images, videos, and audio beyond text. However, efficiently serving LMMs in production environments poses significant challenges due to their complex architectures and heterogeneous characteristics across their multi-stage inference pipelines. We present the first comprehensive systems analysis of two prominent LMM architectures, decoder-only and cross-attention, across six representative open-source models, revealing key systems design implications. We also present an in-depth analysis of production LMM inference traces, uncovering unique workload characteristics, including variable, heavy-tailed request distributions and bursty traffic patterns. Based on these insights, we propose ModServe, a modular LMM serving system that decouples stages for independent optimization and adaptive scaling. ModServe dynamically reconfigures stages and handles bursty traffic with modality-aware scheduling and autoscaling to meet tail latency SLOs while minimizing costs. ModServe achieves 3.3-5.5x higher throughput (leading to 25-41.3% cost saving) while meeting SLOs on a 128-GPU cluster with production traces.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce the task of grounded article generation with the goal of creating a Wikipedia-style article from multiple diverse videos about real-world events -- from natural disasters to political elections -- where all the information in the article is supported by video evidence. Videos are intuitive sources for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), but most contemporary RAG workflows focus heavily on text while existing methods for video-based summarization focus on low-level scene understanding rather than high-level event semantics. To close this gap, we introduce WikiVideo, a benchmark consisting of expert-written articles and densely annotated videos that provide evidence for articles' claims, facilitating the integration of video into RAG pipelines and enabling the creation of in-depth content that is grounded in multimodal sources. We further propose Collaborative Article Generation (CAG), a novel interactive method for article creation from multiple videos. CAG leverages an iterative interaction between an r1-style reasoning model and a VideoLLM to draw higher-level inferences about the target event than is possible with VideoLLMs alone, which fixate on low-level visual features. We benchmark state-of-the-art VideoLLMs and CAG in both oracle retrieval and RAG settings and find that CAG consistently outperforms alternative methods, while suggesting intriguing avenues for future work.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper establishes a benchmark for evaluating tool-calling capabilities of large language models (LLMs) on multi-step geospatial tasks relevant to commercial GIS practitioners. We assess eight commercial LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.5 and 4, Claude Haiku 3.5, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1 and o4-mini) using a simple tool-calling agent equipped with 23 geospatial functions. Our benchmark comprises tasks in four categories of increasing complexity, with both solvable and intentionally unsolvable tasks to test rejection accuracy. We develop a LLM-as-Judge evaluation framework to compare agent solutions against reference solutions. Results show o4-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieve the best overall performance, OpenAI's GPT-4.1, GPT-4o and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview do not fall far behind, but the last two are more efficient in identifying unsolvable tasks. Claude Sonnet 4, due its preference to provide any solution rather than reject a task, proved to be less accurate. We observe significant differences in token usage, with Anthropic models consuming more tokens than competitors. Common errors include misunderstanding geometrical relationships, relying on outdated knowledge, and inefficient data manipulation. The resulting benchmark set, evaluation framework, and data generation pipeline are released as open-source resources (available at https://github.com/Solirinai/GeoBenchX), providing one more standardized method for the ongoing evaluation of LLMs for GeoAI.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Spatial statistics often rely on Gaussian processes (GPs) to capture dependencies across locations. However, their computational cost increases rapidly with the number of locations, potentially needing multiple hours even for moderate sample sizes. To address this, we propose using Semi-Implicit Variational Inference (SIVI), a highly flexible Bayesian approximation method, for scalable Bayesian spatial interpolation. We evaluated SIVI with a GP prior and a Nearest-Neighbour Gaussian Process (NNGP) prior compared to Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI), Pathfinder, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), the reference method in spatial statistics. Methods were compared based on their predictive ability measured by the CRPS, the interval score, and the negative log-predictive density across 50 replicates for both Gaussian and Poisson outcomes. SIVI-based methods achieved similar results to HMC, while being drastically faster. On average, for the Poisson scenario with 500 training locations, SIVI reduced the computational time from roughly 6 hours for HMC to 130 seconds. Furthermore, SIVI-NNGP analyzed a simulated land surface temperature dataset of 150,000 locations while estimating all unknown model parameters in under two minutes. These results highlight the potential of SIVI as a flexible and scalable inference technique in spatial statistics.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The use of quasicircular waveforms in matched-filter analyses of signals from eccentric binary neutron star mergers can lead to biases in the source's parameter estimation. We demonstrate that significant biases can be present already for moderate eccentricities $e_{0} \gtrsim 0.05$ and signals detected by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA with signal-to-noise ratio $\gtrsim 12$. We perform systematic Bayesian mock analyses of unequal-mass nonspinning binary neutron star signals up to eccentricities $e_0 \sim 0.1$ using quasicircular effective-one-body waveforms with spins. We find fractional signal-to-noise ratio losses up to tens of percent and up to 16$\sigma$ deviations in the inference of the chirp mass. The latter effect is sufficiently large to lead to an incorrect (and ambiguous) source identification. The inclusion of spin precession in the quasicircular waveform does not capture eccentricity effects. We conclude that high-precision observations with advanced (and next generation) detectors are likely to require standardized, accurate, and fast eccentric waveforms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Why do thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform their base counterparts? Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens. Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained: pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right time, enabling efficient use of their inference-time compute.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reward Models (RMs) are crucial to aligning large language models (LLMs), but the degree to which an RM specialized to one task (e.g. writing) generalizes to new tasks (e.g. math) is often not known a priori, often making using only one fixed RM to train LLMs suboptimal. However, optimizing LLMs with multiple RMs simultaneously can incur a prohibitively high computational cost and lead to conflicting signals from different RMs that may degrade performance. To address these challenges, we introduce LASeR (Learning to Adaptively Select Rewards), which frames reward model selection as a multi-armed bandit problem, efficiently and iteratively training LLMs using multiple RMs by selecting the most well-suited RM for each instance. On commonsense and math reasoning tasks, we show that LASeR boosts iterative LLM training, improving the absolute average accuracy of Llama-3-8B over three datasets by 2.67% over an ensemble of RM scores while also showing superior efficiency (e.g., a 2x speedup). Moreover, on WildChat (open-ended instruction-following tasks), LASeR leads to a 72.69% AlpacaEval win rate over the RM score ensemble baseline. Extending to long-context generation, LASeR improves by 2.96 F1 points (avg.) on single-document QA tasks and 2.97 F1 points on few-shot learning over the RM score ensemble baseline with best-of-n sampling.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer language models generate text autoregressively, making inference latency proportional to the number of tokens generated. Speculative decoding reduces this latency without sacrificing output quality, by leveraging a small draft model to propose tokens that the larger target model verifies in parallel. In practice, however, there may exist a set of potential draft models- ranging from faster but less inaccurate, to slower yet more reliable. We introduce Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), an algorithm that stacks these draft models into a hierarchy, where each model proposes tokens, and the next larger model verifies them in a single forward pass, until finally the target model verifies tokens. We derive an expression for the expected latency of any such hierarchy and show that selecting the latency-optimal hierarchy can be done in polynomial time. Empirically, HSD gives up to 1.2x speed-up over the best single-draft baseline, demonstrating the practicality of our algorithm in reducing generation latency beyond previous techniques.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A simple device for balancing for a continuous covariate in clinical trials is to stratify by whether the covariate is above or below some target value, typically the predicted median. This raises an issue as to which model should be used for modelling the effect of treatment on the outcome variable, $Y$. Should one fit, the stratum indicator, $S$, the continuous covariate, $X$, both or neither? When a covariate is added to a linear model there are three consequences for inference: 1) the mean square error effect, 2) the variance inflation factor and 3) second order precision. We consider that it is valuable to consider these three factors separately, even if, ultimately, it is their joint effect that matters. We present some simple theory, concentrating in particular on the variance inflation factor, that may be used to guide trialists in their choice of model. We also consider the case where the precise form of the relationship between the outcome and the covariate is not known. We conclude by recommending that the continuous covariate should always be in the model but that, depending on circumstances, there may be some justification in fitting the stratum indicator also.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) can propose rules in natural language, sidestepping the need for a predefined predicate space in traditional rule learning. Yet many LLM-based approaches ignore interactions among rules, and the opportunity to couple LLMs with probabilistic rule learning for robust inference remains underexplored. We present RLIE, a unified framework that integrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn a set of weighted rules. RLIE has four stages: (1) Rule generation, where an LLM proposes and filters candidates; (2) Logistic regression, which learns probabilistic weights for global selection and calibration; (3) Iterative refinement, which updates the rule set using prediction errors; and (4) Evaluation, which compares the weighted rule set as a direct classifier with methods that inject rules into an LLM. We evaluate multiple inference strategies on real-world datasets. Applying rules directly with their learned weights yields superior performance, whereas prompting LLMs with the rules, weights, and logistic-model outputs surprisingly degrades accuracy. This supports the view that LLMs excel at semantic generation and interpretation but are less reliable for precise probabilistic integration. RLIE clarifies the potential and limitations of LLMs for inductive reasoning and couples them with classic probabilistic rule combination methods to enable more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Industrial and government organizations increasingly depend on data-driven analytics for workforce, finance, and regulated decision processes, where timeliness, cost efficiency, and compliance are critical. Distributed frameworks such as Spark and Flink remain effective for massive-scale batch or streaming analytics but introduce coordination complexity and auditing overheads that misalign with moderate-scale, latency-sensitive inference. Meanwhile, cloud providers now offer serverless GPUs, and models such as TabNet enable interpretable tabular ML, motivating new deployment blueprints for regulated environments. In this paper, we present a production-oriented Big Data as a Service (BDaaS) blueprint that integrates a single-node serverless GPU runtime with TabNet. The design leverages GPU acceleration for throughput, serverless elasticity for cost reduction, and feature-mask interpretability for IL4/FIPS compliance. We conduct benchmarks on the HR, Adult, and BLS datasets, comparing our approach against Spark and CPU baselines. Our results show that GPU pipelines achieve up to 4.5x higher throughput, 98x lower latency, and 90% lower cost per 1K inferences compared to Spark baselines, while compliance mechanisms add only ~5.7 ms latency with p99 < 22 ms. Interpretability remains stable under peak load, ensuring reliable auditability. Taken together, these findings provide a compliance-aware benchmark, a reproducible Helm-packaged blueprint, and a decision framework that demonstrate the practicality of secure, interpretable, and cost-efficient serverless GPU analytics for regulated enterprise and government settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Human communication is motivated: people speak, write, and create content with a particular communicative intent in mind. As a result, information that large language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by humans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced information: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order to decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world, they too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of the source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales pitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have this capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled experiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent with rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they successfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner. We then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic reflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find that LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as closely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from vigilance-relevant considerations. However, a simple steering intervention that boosts the salience of intentions and incentives substantially increases the correspondence between LLMs and the rational model. These results suggest that LLMs possess a basic sensitivity to the motivations of others, but generalizing to novel real-world settings will require further improvements to these models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in learning algorithms, evaluations, and optimization tasks. Recent studies have shown that using LLM-based optimizers to automatically optimize model prompts, demonstrations, predictions themselves, or other components can significantly enhance the performance of AI systems, as demonstrated by frameworks such as DSPy and TextGrad. However, optimizers built on language models themselves are usually designed by humans with manual design choices; optimizers themselves are not optimized. Moreover, these optimizers are general purpose by design, to be useful to a broad audience, and are not tailored for specific tasks. To address these challenges, we propose metaTextGrad, which focuses on designing a meta-optimizer to further enhance existing optimizers and align them to be good optimizers for a given task. Our approach consists of two key components: a meta prompt optimizer and a meta structure optimizer. The combination of these two significantly improves performance across multiple benchmarks, achieving an average absolute performance improvement of up to 6% compared to the best baseline.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Test-time compute has led to remarkable success in the large language model (LLM) community, particularly for complex tasks, where longer chains of thought (CoTs) are generated to enhance reasoning capabilities. However, growing evidence reveals that such reasoning models often produce CoTs plagued by excessive redundancy, including unnecessary verification steps and repetitive reasoning shifts. The root cause lies in post-training of them that overly rely on outcome reward paradigms, as the data of process reward paradigms, which regulate intermediate reasoning steps, is difficult to construct at scale. To address this, we propose PI, a novel framework for Test-time Prompt Intervention. PI provides an interface to dynamically guide and regulate reasoning paths during inference through timely (When module) and proper (How module) interventions and post-intervention sampling (Which module). This allows human problem-solving expertise and cognitive science principles to be seamlessly integrated into LLMs' reasoning processes, enhancing controllability and interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that PI significantly shortens CoTs while reducing hallucination, yielding more concise and reliable reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in generative tasks, including register-transfer level (RTL) hardware synthesis. However, their tendency to memorize training data poses critical risks when proprietary or security-sensitive designs are unintentionally exposed during inference. While prior work has examined memorization in natural language, RTL introduces unique challenges: In RTL, structurally different implementations (e.g., behavioral vs. gate-level descriptions) can realize the same hardware, leading to intellectual property (IP) leakage (full or partial) even without verbatim overlap. Conversely, even small syntactic variations (e.g., operator precedence or blocking vs. non-blocking assignments) can drastically alter circuit behavior, making correctness preservation especially challenging. In this work, we systematically study memorization in RTL code generation and propose CircuitGuard, a defense strategy that balances leakage reduction with correctness preservation. CircuitGuard (1) introduces a novel RTL-aware similarity metric that captures both structural and functional equivalence beyond surface-level overlap, and (2) develops an activation-level steering method that identifies and attenuates transformer components most responsible for memorization. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that CircuitGuard identifies (and isolates) 275 memorization-critical features across layers 18-28 of Llama 3.1-8B model, achieving up to 80% reduction in semantic similarity to proprietary patterns while maintaining generation quality. CircuitGuard further shows 78-85% cross-domain transfer effectiveness, enabling robust memorization mitigation across circuit categories without retraining.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We investigate whether combining gas and stellar kinematic maps provides measurable advantages in recovering galaxy mass profiles, compared to using single-component maps alone. While traditional methods struggle to integrate multi-tracer data effectively, we test whether deep learning models can leverage this joint information. We develop a probabilistic convolutional neural network (CNN) framework trained and tested on mock galaxy kinematic maps from multiple cosmological simulation suites. Our model is trained on gas-only, stars-only, and combined gas+stellar velocity maps, allowing direct comparison of performance across tracers. To assess robustness, we include simulations with differing feedback models and galaxy properties. Combining gas and stellar maps reduces the dispersion in the inferred mass profiles by up to a factor of $\sim$1.5 compared to models using either tracer independently. The CNN architecture effectively captures complementary information from the two components. However, we find limitations in generalizing between simulation suites, with reduced performance when applying models trained on one suite to galaxies from another.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present CoSense-LLM, an edge-first framework that turns continuous multimodal sensor streams (for example Wi-Fi CSI, IMU, audio, RFID, and lightweight vision) into compact, verifiable semantic tokens and coordinates with large language models under explicit latency, energy, bandwidth, and privacy constraints. CoSense-LLM has four parts: (i) SenseFusion, a lightweight encoder that aligns sensor embeddings with language and compresses them into short discrete code sequences; (ii) Edge-RAG, a local hybrid retrieval layer that grounds generation in site specific policies and notes; (iii) PromptRouter, a cost and uncertainty aware policy that selects edge only generation, edge plus retrieval, or compact cloud escalation; and (iv) Secure Execution, an auditable redaction path that enforces data minimization so raw waveforms never leave the device. The system works with modern serving optimizations, including paged or streaming KV caches, FlashAttention style kernels, speculative decoding, and quantized LoRA adapters, and supports on device personalization and federated updates under non IID drift. Across home, office, and clinic deployments, CoSense-LLM delivers grounded explanations while meeting tight service level objectives: it sustains sub second (p95) end to end latency on edge dominant paths, reduces inter tier token and bandwidth costs by preferring local retrieval grounded responses, and preserves privacy by transmitting only discrete codes and redacted metadata. Ablations show that Edge-RAG improves factual consistency and reduces contradictions, calibrated uncertainty enables selective abstention and controlled escalations, and KV plus decoding accelerators lower energy per decision. The results support an edge first design that treats semantics, privacy, and predictable latency as co equal goals for large model deployments in interference prone environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable problem-solving abilities but often generate long thinking traces whose utility is unclear. Our work aims to improve their efficiency, enabling them to reach high performance without overthinking. First, we analyze the entropy of token probabilities in reasoning traces. Across three models, we observe a consistent U-shaped entropy pattern: high entropy on easy problems despite high accuracy, low entropy on problems with medium difficulty, and high entropy on hard problems reflecting uncertainty. Specifically, we notice 22--25\% entropy reduction from easy to medium difficulty regions, suggesting an {overthinking} phenomenon on easy instances. Building on these insights, we introduce \textbf{DiffAdapt}, a lightweight framework that selects Easy/Normal/Hard inference strategies per question based on their difficulty and reasoning trace entropy. Each inference strategy consists of a fixed prompt, temperature and maximum token length. In contrast to existing efficiency optimization methods, our approach does not fine-tune base LLM but a small probe that classifies LLM's final hidden state, allowing inexpensive adaptation. We comprehensively evaluate our method on five models and eight benchmarks. Our method achieves comparable or improved accuracy while reducing token usage by up to 22.4\%, establishing a practical path toward compute-efficient reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Predicting precipitation maps is a highly complex spatiotemporal modeling task, critical for mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events. Short-term precipitation forecasting, or nowcasting, requires models that are not only accurate but also computationally efficient for real-time applications. Current methods, such as token-based autoregressive models, often suffer from flawed inductive biases and slow inference, while diffusion models can be computationally intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce BlockGPT, a generative autoregressive transformer using batched tokenization (Block) method that predicts full two-dimensional fields (frames) at each time step. Conceived as a model-agnostic paradigm for video prediction, BlockGPT factorizes space-time by using self-attention within each frame and causal attention across frames; in this work, we instantiate it for precipitation nowcasting. We evaluate BlockGPT on two precipitation datasets, viz. KNMI (Netherlands) and SEVIR (U.S.), comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines including token-based (NowcastingGPT) and diffusion-based (DiffCast+Phydnet) models. The results show that BlockGPT achieves superior accuracy, event localization as measured by categorical metrics, and inference speeds up to 31x faster than comparable baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer models have significantly advanced the field of emotion recognition. However, there are still open challenges when exploring open-ended queries for Large Language Models (LLMs). Although current models offer good results, automatic emotion analysis in open texts presents significant challenges, such as contextual ambiguity, linguistic variability, and difficulty interpreting complex emotional expressions. These limitations make the direct application of generalist models difficult. Accordingly, this work compares the effectiveness of fine-tuning and prompt engineering in emotion detection in three distinct scenarios: (i) performance of fine-tuned pre-trained models and general-purpose LLMs using simple prompts; (ii) effectiveness of different emotion prompt designs with LLMs; and (iii) impact of emotion grouping techniques on these models. Experimental tests attain metrics above 70% with a fine-tuned pre-trained model for emotion recognition. Moreover, the findings highlight that LLMs require structured prompt engineering and emotion grouping to enhance their performance. These advancements improve sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and understanding of user behavior across various domains.

  Exchange Using Dimensional Analysis and Reduced-Order Models</h2>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose a framework for parameter estimation in river transport models using breakthrough curve data, which we refer to as Dimensionless Synthetic Transport Estimation (DSTE). We utilize this framework to parameterize the one-dimensional advection-dispersion equation model, incorporating immobile phase exchange through a memory function. We solve the governing equation analytically in the Laplace domain and numerically invert it to generate synthetic breakthrough curves for different memory functions and boundary conditions. A dimensionless formulation enables decoupling the estimation of advection velocity from other parameters, significantly reducing the number of required forward solutions. To improve computational efficiency, we apply a Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion to transform the synthetic dataset into a reduced-order space. Given a measured breakthrough curve, we estimate the advection velocity by minimizing the distance from the measurement to the synthetic data in KL space, and infer the remaining dimensionless parameters by Projected Barycentric Interpolation (PBI). We benchmark our method against several alternatives, including Laplace domain fitting, moment matching, global random optimization, and variations of the DSTE framework using nearest-neighbor interpolation and neural network-based estimation. Applied to 295 breakthrough curves from 54 tracer tests in 25 rivers, DSTE delivers accurate parameter estimates. The resulting labeled dataset allows researchers to link transport parameters with hydraulic conditions, site characteristics, and measured concentrations. The synthetic dataset can be leveraged for the analysis of new breakthrough curves, eliminating the need for additional forward simulations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Web-based participatory urban sensing has emerged as a vital approach for modern urban management by leveraging mobile individuals as distributed sensors. However, existing urban sensing systems struggle with limited generalization across diverse urban scenarios and poor interpretability in decision-making. In this work, we introduce AgentSense, a hybrid, training-free framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into participatory urban sensing through a multi-agent evolution system. AgentSense initially employs classical planner to generate baseline solutions and then iteratively refines them to adapt sensing task assignments to dynamic urban conditions and heterogeneous worker preferences, while producing natural language explanations that enhance transparency and trust. Extensive experiments across two large-scale mobility datasets and seven types of dynamic disturbances demonstrate that AgentSense offers distinct advantages in adaptivity and explainability over traditional methods. Furthermore, compared to single-agent LLM baselines, our approach outperforms in both performance and robustness, while delivering more reasonable and transparent explanations. These results position AgentSense as a significant advancement towards deploying adaptive and explainable urban sensing systems on the web.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce a universal theory of phase auto-oscillators driven by a bi harmonic signal (having frequency components close to single and double of the free-running oscillator frequency) with noise. With it, we show how deterministic phase locking and stochastic phase slips can be continuously tuned by varying the relative amplitudes and frequencies of the driving components. Using, as an example, a spin-torque nano-oscillator, we numerically validate this theory by implementing a deterministic Ising machine paradigm, a probabilistic one, and dual-mode operation of the two. This demonstration introduces the concept of adaptive Ising machines (AIM), a unified oscillator-based architecture that dynamically combines both regimes within the same hardware platform by properly tuning the amplitudes of the bi-harmonic driving relative to the noise strength. Benchmarking on different classes of combinatorial optimization problems, the AIM exhibits complementary performance compared to oscillator based Ising machines and probabilistic Ising machines, with adaptability to the specific problem class. This work introduces the first OIM capable of transitioning between deterministic and probabilistic computation taking advantage of a proper design of the trade-off between the strength of phase-locking of an auto-oscillator to a bi harmonic external driving and noise, opening a path toward scalable, CMOS compatible hardware for hybrid optimization and inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Population III.1 theory for supermassive black hole (SMBH) formation predicts a very early ($z\sim20-25$), transient phase, ``The Flash'', of cosmic reionization powered by supermassive stars that are SMBH progenitors. The universe then quickly recombined to become mostly neutral, with this state persisting until galaxies begin to reionize intergalactic gas again at $z\sim 10$. The overall Thomson scattering optical depth, $\tau$, from The Flash has been shown to be $\tau_{\rm PopIII.1}\sim0.03$, leading to a total $\tau\sim0.08-0.09$. Such a value, while significantly larger than that previously inferred from {\it Planck} observations of the low-$l$ $EE$ polarization power spectrum of the CMB, can help relieve several ``tensions'' faced by the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, especially the preference for negative neutrino masses and dynamic dark energy. Here we compute $EE$ power spectra of example models of The Flash. We find that, because of its very high redshift, the contribution to $l\lesssim8$ modes is dramatically reduced compared to usual low-$z$ reionization models for the same value of $\tau$, while the power at $l\gtrsim8$ is boosted. Thus the Pop III.1 reionization scenario provides a natural way to increase $\tau$, while remaining closer to the latest CMB low-$l$ polarization observations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress, particularly excelling in realistic scenarios; however, their performance degrades notably in imaginative scenarios. These prompts often involve rarely co-occurring concepts with long-distance semantic relationships, falling outside training distributions. Existing methods typically apply test-time scaling for improving video quality, but their fixed search spaces and static reward designs limit adaptability to imaginative scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose ImagerySearch, a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that dynamically adjusts both the inference search space and reward function according to semantic relationships in the prompt. This enables more coherent and visually plausible videos in challenging imaginative settings. To evaluate progress in this direction, we introduce LDT-Bench, the first dedicated benchmark for long-distance semantic prompts, consisting of 2,839 diverse concept pairs and an automated protocol for assessing creative generation capabilities. Extensive experiments show that ImagerySearch consistently outperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling approaches on LDT-Bench, and achieves competitive improvements on VBench, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse prompt types. We will release LDT-Bench and code to facilitate future research on imaginative video generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-augmented generation has emerged as one of the most effective approaches for code completion, particularly when context from a surrounding repository is essential. However, incorporating context significantly extends sequence length, leading to slower inference - a critical limitation for interactive settings such as IDEs. In this work, we introduce LlavaCode, a framework that compresses code into compact, semantically rich representations interpretable by code LLM, enhancing generation quality while reducing the retrieved context to only a few compressed single-token vectors. Using a small projector module we can significantly increase the EM and ES metrics of coding model with negligible latency increase. Our experiments demonstrate that compressed context enables 20-38% reduction in Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) on line completion tasks compared to full-RAG pipelines.

However, these fonts introduce hidden vulnerabilities in NLP models: while humans easily read stylistic text, models process these characters as distinct tokens, causing interference. We identify this human-model perception gap and propose a style-based attack, Style Attack Disguise (SAD). We design two sizes: light for query efficiency and strong for superior attack performance. Experiments on sentiment classification and machine translation across traditional models, LLMs, and commercial services demonstrate SAD's strong attack performance. We also show SAD's potential threats to multimodal tasks including text-to-image and text-to-speech generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In geotechnical engineering, constitutive models are central to capturing soil behavior across diverse drainage conditions, stress paths,and loading histories. While data driven deep learning (DL) approaches have shown promise as alternatives to traditional constitutive formulations, their deployment requires models that are both accurate and capable of quantifying predictive uncertainty. This study introduces a recursive Bayesian neural network (rBNN) framework that unifies temporal sequence learning with generalized Bayesian inference to achieve both predictive accuracy and rigorous uncertainty quantification. A key innovation is the incorporation of a sliding window recursive structure that enables the model to effectively capture path dependent soil responses under monotonic and cyclic loading. By treating network parameters as random variables and inferring their posterior distributions via generalized variational inference, the rBNN produces well calibrated confidence intervals alongside point predictions.The framework is validated against four datasets spanning both simulated and experimental triaxial tests: monotonic loading using a Hardening Soil model simulation and 28 CD tests on Baskarp sand, and cyclic loading using an exponential constitutive simulation of CD CU tests and 37 experimental cyclic CU tests on Ottawa F65 sand. This progression from monotonic to cyclic and from simulated to experimental data demonstrates the adaptability of the proposed approach across varying levels of data fidelity and complexity. Comparative analyses with LSTM, Encoder Decoder,and GRU architectures highlight that rBNN not only achieves competitive predictive accuracy but also provides reliable confidence intervals.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, leveraging denoising-based generation to enable inherent parallelism. Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models emerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a standardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient and extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference pipeline into four modular components--model, diffusion iteration manager, decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager--and integrates novel algorithms for each component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination of algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial efficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE. At batch size 1, it surpasses 1,100 tokens per second on HumanEval and averages over 800 tokens per second across six benchmarks on $8\times$ H800 GPUs. Compared to prior systems, dInfer delivers a $10\times$ speedup over Fast-dLLM while maintaining similar model performance. Even compared to the AR model (with a comparable number of activation parameters and performance) QWen2.5-3B, which is highly optimized with the latest vLLM inference engine, dInfer still delivers a $2$-$3\times$ speedup.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present high-resolution (~7.5 au) ALMA observations at 1.3 and 3 mm of 16 disks around Class 0/I protostars across multiple star-forming regions and a variety of multiplicities, showing a range of disk sizes (~2-100 au) and including circumbinary disks (CBDs) in binaries with separations <100 au. The disk properties show similarities to Class II disks, including (a) low spectral index (SI) values (alpha=2.1) that increase with disk radius, (b) 3 mm disk sizes only marginally smaller than at 1.3 mm (<10%), and (c) radial intensity profiles well described by modified self-similar profiles. We also find key differences: (i) SI values increasing with radius, but exceeding 2 only at the disk edge (ii) higher brightness temperatures Tb, in some cases higher than the predicted temperatures due to irradiation, and (iii) ~10x higher luminosity at a given size compared to the Class II disks. These results confirm significant optical depth in the observed Class 0/I disks, at both 1.3 and 3 mm, helping to explain their higher luminosities, but higher temperatures are also required for the most compact (< 40 au) disks, suggesting additional viscous heating. Considering optical depth, most disk dust masses are estimated in the range 30-900 Mearth (0.01-0.3 Msun in gas), resulting in some disks reaching marginal gravitational instability. The median location of the water iceline is ~3 au, but it can extend beyond 10-20 au for the hottest disks. CBDs exhibit lower optical depths at both wavelengths and hence higher SI values (alpha=3.0), dust masses of 100 Mearth, and beta~1.5 (2 Class 0 CBDs) and beta~1 (1 Class I CBD), suggesting substantial grain growth only in the more evolved CBD. The inferred high optical depths provide a compelling explanation for the apparent scarcity of dust substructures in the younger disks at ~ 1 mm, despite mounting evidence for early planet formation (ABRIDGED).

                <div class="summary">
                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Effective deep search agents must not only access open-domain and domain-specific knowledge but also apply complex rules-such as legal clauses, medical manuals and tariff rules. These rules often feature vague boundaries and implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for agents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current agent benchmarks.   To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical rule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided by these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products with noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World Customs Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from real-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed HSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories, with these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.   Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source, and closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides, detailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application, and test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While there has been significant progress in evaluating and comparing different representations for learning on protein data, the role of surface-based learning approaches remains not well-understood. In particular, there is a lack of direct and fair benchmark comparison between the best available surface-based learning methods against alternative representations such as graphs. Moreover, the few existing surface-based approaches either use surface information in isolation or, at best, perform global pooling between surface and graph-based architectures.   In this work, we fill this gap by first adapting a state-of-the-art surface encoder for protein learning tasks. We then perform a direct and fair comparison of the resulting method against alternative approaches within the Atom3D benchmark, highlighting the limitations of pure surface-based learning. Finally, we propose an integrated approach, which allows learned feature sharing between graphs and surface representations on the level of nodes and vertices across all layers.   We demonstrate that the resulting architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on all tasks in the Atom3D benchmark, while adhering to the strict benchmark protocol, as well as more broadly on binding site identification and binding pocket classification. Furthermore, we use coarsened surfaces and optimize our approach for efficiency, making our tool competitive in training and inference time with existing techniques.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the era of social networks and rapid misinformation spread, news analysis remains a critical task. Detecting fake news across multiple languages, particularly beyond English, poses significant challenges. Cross-lingual news comparison offers a promising approach to verify information by leveraging external sources in different languages (Chen and Shu, 2024). However, existing datasets for cross-lingual news analysis (Chen et al., 2022a) were manually curated by journalists and experts, limiting their scalability and adaptability to new languages. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a scalable, explainable crowdsourcing pipeline for cross-lingual news similarity assessment. Using this pipeline, we collected a novel dataset CrossNews-UA of news pairs in Ukrainian as a central language with linguistically and contextually relevant languages-Polish, Russian, and English. Each news pair is annotated for semantic similarity with detailed justifications based on the 4W criteria (Who, What, Where, When). We further tested a range of models, from traditional bag-of-words, Transformer-based architectures to large language models (LLMs). Our results highlight the challenges in multilingual news analysis and offer insights into models performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Memory, a fundamental component of human cognition, exhibits adaptive yet fallible characteristics as illustrated by Schacter's memory "sins".These cognitive phenomena have been studied extensively in psychology and neuroscience, but the extent to which artificial systems, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), emulate these cognitive phenomena remains underexplored. This study uses human memory research as a lens for understanding LLMs and systematically investigates human memory effects in state-of-the-art LLMs using paradigms drawn from psychological research. We evaluate seven key memory phenomena, comparing human behavior to LLM performance. Both people and models remember less when overloaded with information (list length effect) and remember better with repeated exposure (list strength effect). They also show similar difficulties when retrieving overlapping information, where storing too many similar facts leads to confusion (fan effect). Like humans, LLMs are susceptible to falsely "remembering" words that were never shown but are related to others (false memories), and they can apply prior learning to new, related situations (cross-domain generalization). However, LLMs differ in two key ways: they are less influenced by the order in which information is presented (positional bias) and more robust when processing random or meaningless material (nonsense effect). These results reveal both alignments and divergences in how LLMs and humans reconstruct memory. The findings help clarify how memory-like behavior in LLMs echoes core features of human cognition, while also highlighting the architectural differences that lead to distinct patterns of error and success.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring their alignment with social norms has become a critical concern. While prior research has examined bias detection in various languages, there remains a significant gap in resources addressing social biases within Persian cultural contexts. In this work, we introduce PBBQ, a comprehensive benchmark dataset designed to evaluate social biases in Persian LLMs. Our benchmark, which encompasses 16 cultural categories, was developed through questionnaires completed by 250 diverse individuals across multiple demographics, in close collaboration with social science experts to ensure its validity. The resulting PBBQ dataset contains over 37,000 carefully curated questions, providing a foundation for the evaluation and mitigation of bias in Persian language models. We benchmark several open-source LLMs, a closed-source model, and Persian-specific fine-tuned models on PBBQ. Our findings reveal that current LLMs exhibit significant social biases across Persian culture. Additionally, by comparing model outputs to human responses, we observe that LLMs often replicate human bias patterns, highlighting the complex interplay between learned representations and cultural stereotypes.Upon acceptance of the paper, our PBBQ dataset will be publicly available for use in future work.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Decompilation converts machine code into human-readable form, enabling analysis and debugging without source code. However, fidelity issues often degrade the readability and semantic accuracy of decompiled output. Existing methods, such as variable renaming or structural simplification, provide partial improvements but lack robust detection and correction, particularly for complex closed-source binaries. We present FidelityGPT, a framework that enhances decompiled code accuracy and readability by systematically detecting and correcting semantic distortions. FidelityGPT introduces distortion-aware prompt templates tailored to closed-source settings and integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a dynamic semantic intensity algorithm to locate distorted lines and retrieve semantically similar code from a database. A variable dependency algorithm further mitigates long-context limitations by analyzing redundant variables and integrating their dependencies into the prompt context. Evaluated on 620 function pairs from a binary similarity benchmark, FidelityGPT achieved an average detection accuracy of 89% and a precision of 83%. Compared to the state-of-the-art DeGPT (Fix Rate 83%, Corrected Fix Rate 37%), FidelityGPT attained 94% FR and 64% CFR, demonstrating significant gains in accuracy and readability. These results highlight its potential to advance LLM-based decompilation and reverse engineering.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The injection molding industry faces critical challenges in preserving and transferring field knowledge, particularly as experienced workers retire and multilingual barriers hinder effective communication. This study introduces IM-Chat, a multi-agent framework based on large language models (LLMs), designed to facilitate knowledge transfer in injection molding. IM-Chat integrates both limited documented knowledge (e.g., troubleshooting tables, manuals) and extensive field data modeled through a data-driven process condition generator that infers optimal manufacturing settings from environmental inputs such as temperature and humidity, enabling robust and context-aware task resolution. By adopting a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) strategy and tool-calling agents within a modular architecture, IM-Chat ensures adaptability without the need for fine-tuning. Performance was assessed across 100 single-tool and 60 hybrid tasks for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-3.5-turbo by domain experts using a 10-point rubric focused on relevance and correctness, and was further supplemented by automated evaluation using GPT-4o guided by a domain-adapted instruction prompt. The evaluation results indicate that more capable models tend to achieve higher accuracy, particularly in complex, tool-integrated scenarios. In addition, compared with the fine-tuned single-agent LLM, IM-Chat demonstrated superior accuracy, particularly in quantitative reasoning, and greater scalability in handling multiple information sources. Overall, these findings demonstrate the viability of multi-agent LLM systems for industrial knowledge workflows and establish IM-Chat as a scalable and generalizable approach to AI-assisted decision support in manufacturing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Precise outbreak forecasting of infectious diseases is essential for effective public health responses and epidemic control. The increased availability of machine learning (ML) methods for time-series forecasting presents an enticing avenue to enhance outbreak forecasting. Though the COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated the value of applying ML models to predict epidemic profiles, using ML models to forecast endemic diseases remains underexplored. In this work, we present ForecastNet-XCL (an ensemble model based on XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM), a deep learning hybrid framework designed to addresses this gap by creating accurate multi-week RSV forecasts up to 100 weeks in advance based on climate and temporal data, without access to real-time surveillance on RSV. The framework combines high-resolution feature learning with long-range temporal dependency capturing mechanisms, bolstered by an autoregressive module trained on climate-controlled lagged relations. Stochastic inference returns probabilistic intervals to inform decision-making. Evaluated across 34 U.S. states, ForecastNet-XCL reliably outperformed statistical baselines, individual neural nets, and conventional ensemble methods in both within- and cross-state scenarios, sustaining accuracy over extended forecast horizons. Training on climatologically diverse datasets enhanced generalization furthermore, particularly in locations having irregular or biennial RSV patterns. ForecastNet-XCL's efficiency, performance, and uncertainty-aware design make it a deployable early-warning tool amid escalating climate pressures and constrained surveillance resources.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Previous research has investigated the application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in understanding 3D scenes by interpreting them as videos. These approaches generally depend on comprehensive 3D data inputs, such as point clouds or reconstructed Bird's-Eye View (BEV) maps. In our research, we advance this field by enhancing the capability of MLLMs to understand and reason in 3D spaces directly from video data, without the need for additional 3D input. We propose a novel and efficient method called the Video-3D Geometry Large Language Model (VG LLM). Our approach utilizes a 3D visual geometry encoder to extract 3D prior information from video sequences. This information is then integrated with visual tokens and input into the MLLM. Extensive experiments have shown that our method has achieved substantial improvements in various tasks related to 3D scene understanding and spatial reasoning, all directly learned from video sources. Impressively, our 4B model, which does not rely on explicit 3D data inputs, achieves competitive results compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and even surpasses the Gemini-1.5-Pro in the VSI-Bench evaluations.

  dependence on $X_{\rm max}$ and primary composition</h2>

                <div class="summary">
                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We show that there is a strong dependence of the radio LDF electric field amplitudes at ground level on the position of $X_{\rm max}$ in the atmosphere, even accounting for differences in the EM energy of the showers. Since an $X_{\rm max}$ dependence leads to a primary composition dependence, this implies that information on the mass composition is encoded not only in the LDF shape but also in its amplitude. This $X_{\rm max}$ dependence can be explained in terms of two competing scalings of the measured electric field: One goes with $(1/\rho)^J$, where $\rho$ is the air density at $X_{\rm max}$ and $J$ is a zenith dependent non-linearity factor describing coherence loss. This density scaling tends to decrease the geomagnetic emission of deeper showers. The other scaling goes with $(1/R)$, where $R$ is the distance from $X_{\rm max}$ to the core at ground, and instead increases the measured electric field of deeper showers. At low zenith angles, the $(1/R)$ scaling is stronger and leads to larger measured electric fields as $X_{\rm max}$ increases. The picture at higher zeniths, i.e., lower densities, is more nuanced. In this region, the deflections due to the Lorentz force are much larger and introduce extra time delays between the particle tracks, decreasing the coherence of the emission. This loss of coherence is highly dependent on the strength of the geomagnetic field and can slow down, or even reverse the increase of the radio emission with decreasing air density. This strong, yet historically overlooked LDF amplitude dependence on $X_{\rm max}$/composition could be used to directly infer, even bypassing any $X_{\rm max}$ reconstruction, the cosmic ray primary composition on an event-by-event basis. It could also have some repercussions on other radio reconstruction methods, such as a possible $X_{\rm max}$/composition bias on shower electromagnetic energy reconstruction methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Since the rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs), people have begun to rely on them for information retrieval. While traditional search engines display ranked lists of sources shaped by search engine optimization (SEO), advertising, and personalization, LLMs typically provide a synthesized response that feels singular and authoritative. While both approaches carry risks of bias and omission, LLMs may amplify the effect by collapsing multiple perspectives into one answer, reducing users ability or inclination to compare alternatives. This concentrates power over information in a few LLM vendors whose systems effectively shape what is remembered and what is overlooked. As a result, certain narratives, individuals or groups, may be disproportionately suppressed, while others are disproportionately elevated. Over time, this creates a new threat: the gradual erasure of those with limited digital presence, and the amplification of those already prominent, reshaping collective memory. To address these concerns, this paper presents a concept of the Right To Be Remembered (RTBR) which encompasses minimizing the risk of AI-driven information omission, embracing the right of fair treatment, while ensuring that the generated content would be maximally truthful.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Model fusion combines multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) with different strengths into a more powerful, integrated model through lightweight training methods. Existing works on model fusion focus primarily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), leaving preference alignment (PA) --a critical phase for enhancing LLM performance--largely unexplored. The current few fusion methods on PA phase, like WRPO, simplify the process by utilizing only response outputs from source models while discarding their probability information. To address this limitation, we propose InfiFPO, a preference optimization method for implicit model fusion. InfiFPO replaces the reference model in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with a fused source model that synthesizes multi-source probabilities at the sequence level, circumventing complex vocabulary alignment challenges in previous works and meanwhile maintaining the probability information. By introducing probability clipping and max-margin fusion strategies, InfiFPO enables the pivot model to align with human preferences while effectively distilling knowledge from source models. Comprehensive experiments on 11 widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that InfiFPO consistently outperforms existing model fusion and preference optimization methods. When using Phi-4 as the pivot model, InfiFPO improve its average performance from 79.95 to 83.33 on 11 benchmarks, significantly improving its capabilities in mathematics, coding, and reasoning tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in AI agents have demonstrated their growing potential to drive and support scientific discovery. In this work, we introduce MLR-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI agents on open-ended machine learning research. MLR-Bench includes three key components: (1) 201 research tasks sourced from NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML workshops covering diverse ML topics; (2) MLR-Judge, an automated evaluation framework combining LLM-based reviewers with carefully designed review rubrics to assess research quality; and (3) MLR-Agent, a modular agent scaffold capable of completing research tasks through four stages: idea generation, proposal formulation, experimentation, and paper writing. Our framework supports both stepwise assessment across these distinct research stages, and end-to-end evaluation of the final research paper. We then use MLR-Bench to evaluate six frontier LLMs and an advanced coding agent, finding that while LLMs are effective at generating coherent ideas and well-structured papers, current coding agents frequently (e.g., in 80% of the cases) produce fabricated or invalidated experimental results--posing a major barrier to scientific reliability. We validate MLR-Judge through human evaluation, showing high agreement with expert reviewers, supporting its potential as a scalable tool for research evaluation. We open-source MLR-Bench to help the community benchmark, diagnose, and improve AI research agents toward trustworthy and transparent scientific discovery.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Feed-forward surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction offers fast, generalizable inference ability, which faces the core challenge of ensuring generalization while elevating novel view quality. Due to the surround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To tackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned explicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the elevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end learning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable geometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture to efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the geometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which shares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly supervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through feature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective metrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generative AI is increasing the productivity of software and hardware development across many application domains. In this work, we utilize the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop a co-pilot agent for assisting gem5 users with automating design space exploration. Computer architecture design space exploration is complex and time-consuming, given that numerous parameter settings and simulation statistics must be analyzed before improving the current design. The emergence of LLMs has significantly accelerated the analysis of long-text data as well as smart decision making, two key functions in a successful design space exploration task. In this project, we first build gem5 Co-Pilot, an AI agent assistant for gem5, which comes with a webpage-GUI for smooth user interaction, agent automation, and result summarization. We also implemented a language for design space exploration, as well as a Design Space Database (DSDB). With DSDB, gem5 Co-Pilot effectively implements a Retrieval Augmented Generation system for gem5 design space exploration. We experiment on cost-constraint optimization with four cost ranges and compare our results with two baseline models. Results show that gem5 Co-Pilot can quickly identify optimal parameters for specific design constraints based on performance and cost, with limited user interaction.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present improvements to speaker diarization in the two-stage end-to-end neural diarization with vector clustering (EEND-VC) framework. The first stage employs a Conformer-based EEND model with WavLM features to infer frame-level speaker activity within short windows. The identities and counts of global speakers are then derived in the second stage by clustering speaker embeddings across windows. The focus of this work is to improve the second stage; we filter unreliable embeddings from short segments and reassign them after clustering. We also integrate the VBx clustering to improve robustness when the number of speakers is large and individual speaking durations are limited. Evaluation on a compound benchmark spanning multiple domains is conducted without fine-tuning the EEND model or tuning clustering parameters per dataset. Despite this, the system generalizes well and matches or exceeds recent state-of-the-art performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Formal languages are an integral part of modeling and simulation. They allow the distillation of knowledge into concise simulation models amenable to automatic execution, interpretation, and analysis. However, the arguably most humanly accessible means of expressing models is through natural language, which is not easily interpretable by computers. Here, we evaluate how a Large Language Model (LLM) might be used for formalizing natural language into simulation models. Existing studies only explored using very large LLMs, like the commercial GPT models, without fine-tuning model weights. To close this gap, we show how an open-weights, 7B-parameter Mistral model can be fine-tuned to translate natural language descriptions to reaction network models in a domain-specific language, offering a self-hostable, compute-efficient, and memory efficient alternative. To this end, we develop a synthetic data generator to serve as the basis for fine-tuning and evaluation. Our quantitative evaluation shows that our fine-tuned Mistral model can recover the ground truth simulation model in up to 84.5% of cases. In addition, our small-scale user study demonstrates the model's practical potential for one-time generation as well as interactive modeling in various domains. While promising, in its current form, the fine-tuned small LLM cannot catch up with large LLMs. We conclude that higher-quality training data are required, and expect future small and open-source LLMs to offer new opportunities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly envisioned as intelligent assistants for personalized learning, systematic head-to-head evaluations in authentic learning scenarios remain scarce. This study presents an empirical comparison of three state-of-the-art LLMs on a tutoring task simulating a realistic learning setting. Using a dataset containing a student's responses to ten mixed-format questions with correctness labels, each model was asked to (i) analyze the quiz to identify underlying knowledge components, (ii) infer the student's mastery profile, and (iii) generate targeted guidance for improvement. To mitigate subjectivity and evaluator bias, Gemini was employed as a virtual judge to perform pairwise comparisons across multiple dimensions: accuracy, clarity, actionability, and appropriateness. Results analyzed via the Bradley-Terry model reveal that GPT-4o is generally preferred, producing feedback that is more informative and better structured than its counterparts, whereas DeepSeek-V3 and GLM-4.5 demonstrate intermittent strengths but lower consistency. These findings highlight the feasibility of deploying LLMs as advanced teaching assistants for individualized support and provide methodological insights for subsequent empirical research on LLM-driven personalized learning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recommender systems have become an essential component of many online platforms, providing personalized recommendations to users. A crucial aspect is embedding techniques that convert the high-dimensional discrete features, such as user and item IDs, into low-dimensional continuous vectors, which can enhance the recommendation performance. Embedding techniques have revolutionized the capture of complex entity relationships, generating significant research interest. This survey presents a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in recommender system embedding techniques. We examine centralized embedding approaches across matrix, sequential, and graph structures. In matrix-based scenarios, collaborative filtering generates embeddings that effectively model user-item preferences, particularly in sparse data environments. For sequential data, we explore various approaches including recurrent neural networks and self-supervised methods such as contrastive and generative learning. In graph-structured contexts, we analyze techniques like node2vec that leverage network relationships, along with applicable self-supervised methods. Our survey addresses critical scalability challenges in embedding methods and explores innovative directions in recommender systems. We introduce emerging approaches, including AutoML, hashing techniques, and quantization methods, to enhance performance while reducing computational complexity. Additionally, we examine the promising role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in embedding enhancement. Through detailed discussion of various architectures and methodologies, this survey aims to provide a thorough overview of state-of-the-art embedding techniques in recommender systems, while highlighting key challenges and future research directions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vertical forcing of partially filled horizontal cylindrical tanks can induce strong sloshing motion, disrupting thermal stratification between the subcooled liquid and the superheated vapor, and causing significant pressure variations. While this configuration is critical for cryogenic fuel storage in future aircraft and ground transport, its thermodynamic consequences remain poorly characterized. This work presents an experimental investigation of sloshing-induced heat and mass transfer in a horizontally oriented cylinder under vertical harmonic excitation. Using a hydrofluoroether fluid (3M Novec HFE-7000), decoupled isothermal and non-isothermal campaigns are conducted to characterize the kinematic and thermodynamic responses across various fill levels and forcing amplitudes, near resonance of the first longitudinal symmetric mode $(2,0)$. To quantify the underlying heat and mass transfer processes, a lumped-parameter model is coupled with an Augmented-state Extended Kalman Filter (AEKF) to infer time-resolved Nusselt numbers from the experimental data. The results confirm the existence of a critical forcing threshold, below which the fluid remains quiescent and thermally stratified. Above this threshold, parametric resonance triggers strong liquid motion, leading to complete thermal destratification and a rapid pressure drop. At a 50% fill level, the primary jet-like modal response intermittently alternates with a planar $(1,0)$ mode, indicating subharmonic resonance from non-linear mode interactions. The AEKF-based inference reveals that the onset of thermal destratification causes a step-change increase in interfacial and wall Nusselt numbers by several orders of magnitude. Pressure-rate decomposition shows that the pressure evolution is dominated by phase change.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Powerful ionized accretion disk winds are often observed during episodic outbursts in Galactic black hole transients. Among those X-ray absorbers, \fexxvi\ doublet structure (Ly$\alpha_1$+Ly$\alpha_2$ with $\sim 20$eV apart) has a unique potential to better probe the underlying physical nature of the wind; i.e. density and kinematics. We demonstrate, based on a physically-motivated magnetic disk wind scenario of a stratified structure in density and velocity, that the doublet line profile can be effectively utilized as a diagnostics to measure wind density and associated velocity dispersion (due to thermal turbulence and/or dynamical shear motion in winds). Our simulated doublet spectra with post-process radiative transfer calculations indicate that the profile can be (1) broad with a single peak for higher velocity dispersion ($\gsim 5,000$ km~s$^{-1}$), (2) a standard shape with 1:2 canonical flux ratio for moderate dispersion ($\sim 1,000-5,000$ km~s$^{-1}$) or (3) double-peaked with its flux ratio approaching 1:1 for lower velocity dispersion ($\lsim 1,000$ km~s$^{-1}$) in optically-thin regime, allowing various line shape. Such a diversity in doublet profile is indeed unambiguously seen in recent observations with XRISM/Resolve at microcalorimeter resolution. We show that some implications inferred from the model will help constrain the local wind physics where \fexxvi\ is predominantly produced in a large-scale, stratified wind.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This research proposes a systematic, large language model (LLM) approach for extracting product and service attributes, features, and associated sentiments from customer reviews. Grounded in marketing theory, the framework distinguishes perceptual attributes from actionable features, producing interpretable and managerially actionable insights. We apply the methodology to 20,000 Yelp reviews of Starbucks stores and evaluate eight prompt variants on a random subset of reviews. Model performance is assessed through agreement with human annotations and predictive validity for customer ratings. Results show high consistency between LLMs and human coders and strong predictive validity, confirming the reliability of the approach. Human coders required a median of six minutes per review, whereas the LLM processed each in two seconds, delivering comparable insights at a scale unattainable through manual coding. Managerially, the analysis identifies attributes and features that most strongly influence customer satisfaction and their associated sentiments, enabling firms to pinpoint "joy points," address "pain points," and design targeted interventions. We demonstrate how structured review data can power an actionable marketing dashboard that tracks sentiment over time and across stores, benchmarks performance, and highlights high-leverage features for improvement. Simulations indicate that enhancing sentiment for key service features could yield 1-2% average revenue gains per store.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability. First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts with superior scalability and robustness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent work has demonstrated state-of-the-art results in large language model (LLM) hallucination detection and mitigation through consistency-based approaches which involve aggregating multiple responses sampled from a single LLM for a given prompt. These approaches help offset limitations stemming from the imperfect data on which LLMs are trained, which includes biases and under-representation of information required at deployment time among other limitations which can lead to hallucinations. We show that extending these single-model consistency methods to combine responses from multiple LLMs with different training data, training schemes and model architectures can result in substantial further improvements in hallucination detection and mitigation capabilities beyond their single-model consistency counterparts. We evaluate this \emph{consortium consistency} approach across many model teams from a pool of 15 LLMs and explore under what conditions it is beneficial to team together different LLMs in this manner. Further, we show that these performance improvements often come with reduced inference costs, offsetting a significant drawback with single-model consistency methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We investigate whether the latest combination of DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, cosmic microwave background (CMB) data (Planck 2018 + ACT), and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) compilations (Pantheon+, Union3, and DES Y5) favor a dynamical dark energy component, and explore if such a scenario can simultaneously help resolve the Hubble tension. We contrast two frameworks: the widely used phenomenological $w_0 w_a$CDM model, and bimetric gravity, a fundamental modification of general relativity that naturally gives rise to phantom dark energy. The $w_0 w_a$CDM model is moderately preferred over $\Lambda$CDM, at the $2$-$4 \, \sigma$ level, when fitting DESI DR2 + CMB + SNe Ia, but it exacerbates the Hubble tension. By comparison, bimetric gravity provides a modest improvement in fit quality, at the $1 \, \sigma$ level, but, by inferring $H_0 = 69.0 \pm 0.4 \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, it partially eases the Hubble tension, from a $5 \,\sigma$ discrepancy to a $3.7 \, \sigma$ tension. Including locally calibrated SNe Ia brings the overall preference for the bimetric model over $\Lambda$CDM to the $2 \, \sigma$ level, comparable to that of the $w_0 w_a$CDM model when including the local SN Ia calibration.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present ASAP, a new framework for detecting and grounding multi-modal media manipulation (DGM4).Upon thorough examination, we observe that accurate fine-grained cross-modal semantic alignment between the image and text is vital for accurately manipulation detection and grounding. While existing DGM4 methods pay rare attention to the cross-modal alignment, hampering the accuracy of manipulation detecting to step further. To remedy this issue, this work targets to advance the semantic alignment learning to promote this task. Particularly, we utilize the off-the-shelf Multimodal Large-Language Models (MLLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct paired image-text pairs, especially for the manipulated instances. Subsequently, a cross-modal alignment learning is performed to enhance the semantic alignment. Besides the explicit auxiliary clues, we further design a Manipulation-Guided Cross Attention (MGCA) to provide implicit guidance for augmenting the manipulation perceiving. With the grounding truth available during training, MGCA encourages the model to concentrate more on manipulated components while downplaying normal ones, enhancing the model's ability to capture manipulations. Extensive experiments are conducted on the DGM4 dataset, the results demonstrate that our model can surpass the comparison method with a clear margin.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language model (LLM) routers improve the efficiency of multi-model systems by directing each query to the most appropriate model while leveraging the diverse strengths of heterogeneous LLMs. Most existing approaches frame routing as a classification problem based solely on the input query. While this reduces overhead by avoiding inference across all models, it overlooks valuable information that could be gleaned from potential outputs and fails to capture implicit intent or contextual nuances that often emerge only during response generation. These limitations can result in suboptimal routing decisions, particularly for complex or ambiguous queries that require deeper semantic understanding. To address this challenge, we propose Lookahead, a routing framework that "foresees" potential model outputs by predicting their latent representations and uses these predictions to guide model selection, thus enabling more informed routing without full inference. Within this framework, we implement two approaches based on causal and masked language models. Empirical evaluations across seven public benchmarks - spanning instruction following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation - show that Lookahead consistently outperforms existing routing baselines, achieving an average performance gain of 7.7% over the state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/huangcb01/lookahead-routing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite many advances in knowledge engineering (KE), challenges remain in areas such as engineering knowledge graphs (KGs) at scale, keeping up with evolving domain knowledge, multilingualism, and multimodality. Recently, KE has used LLMs to support semi-automatic tasks, but the most effective use of LLMs to support knowledge engineers across the KE activites is still in its infancy. To explore the vision of LLM copilots for KE and change existing KE practices, we conducted a multimethod study during a KE hackathon. We investigated participants' views on the use of LLMs, the challenges they face, the skills they may need to integrate LLMs into their practices, and how they use LLMs responsibly. We found participants felt LLMs could contribute to improving efficiency when engineering KGs, but presented increased challenges around the already complex issues of evaluating the KE tasks. We discovered prompting to be a useful but undervalued skill for knowledge engineers working with LLMs, and note that natural language processing skills may become more relevant across more roles in KG construction. Integrating LLMs into KE tasks needs to be mindful of potential risks and harms related to responsible AI. Given the limited ethical training, most knowledge engineers receive solutions such as our suggested `KG cards' based on data cards could be a useful guide for KG construction. Our findings can support designers of KE AI copilots, KE researchers, and practitioners using advanced AI to develop trustworthy applications, propose new methodologies for KE and operate new technologies responsibly.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Koopman-Hill projection method offers an efficient approach for stability analysis of linear time-periodic systems, and thereby also for the Floquet stability analysis of periodic solutions of nonlinear systems. However, its accuracy has previously been supported only by numerical evidence, lacking rigorous theoretical guarantees. This paper presents the first explicit error bound for the truncation error of the Koopman-Hill projection method, establishing a solid theoretical foundation for its application. The bound applies to linear time-periodic systems whose Fourier coefficients decay exponentially with a sufficient rate, and is derived using constructive series expansions. The bound quantifies the difference between the true and approximated fundamental solution matrices, clarifies conditions for guaranteed convergence, and enables conservative but reliable inference of Floquet multipliers and stability properties. Additionally, the same methodology applied to a subharmonic formulation demonstrates improved convergence rates of the latter. Numerical examples, including the Mathieu equation and the Duffing oscillator, illustrate the practical relevance of the bound and underscore its importance as the first rigorous theoretical justification for the Koopman-Hill projection method.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the era of large language models (LLMs), weight-activation quantization helps fit models on edge device by reducing memory and compute bit-widths. However, three challenges persist for energy constrained hardware: (1) even after quantization, multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations remain unavoidable and continue to dominate energy consumption; (2) dequantization (or per-tensor/channel rescaling) introduces extra arithmetic and data movement, increasing latency and energy; (3) uniform parameters bit widths clip salient values-while intra-channel mixed precision is generally impractical on current matrix hardware and memory. In contrast, brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), owing to their binary spike-based information representation and the Integrate-and-Fire (IF) paradigm, naturally support mixed-precision storage and energy-efficient computation by replacing complex MACs with temporal Accumulate (ACCs). Motivated by this property, we propose SpikeQuant, which selectively applies mixed-precision quantization to activations with salient values and re-encodes them into binary spike counts, thereby enabling dynamic mixed storage of different bitwidths. Furthermore, by embedding the quantization scale into the threshold of the IF mechanism, our approach performs energy-efficient linear transformations on weights and activations while avoiding explicit dequantization. Experimental results demonstrate that SpikeQuant consistently achieves near-FP16 perplexity under W4A4 quantization while reducing energy cost by up to 4.6 times compared to existing methods, highlighting its effectiveness for accurate and energy-efficient LLM deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Identifying causal relationships in climate systems remains challenging due to nonlinear, coupled dynamics that limit the effectiveness of linear and stochastic causal discovery approaches. This study benchmarks Convergence Cross Mapping (CCM) against Granger causality, PCMCI, and VarLiNGAM using both synthetic datasets with ground truth causal links and 41 years of Arctic climate data (1979--2021). Unlike stochastic models that rely on autoregressive residual dependence, CCM leverages Takens' state-space reconstruction and delay-embedding to reconstruct attractor manifolds from time series. Cross mapping between reconstructed manifolds exploits deterministic signatures of causation, enabling the detection of weak and bidirectional causal links that linear models fail to resolve. Results demonstrate that CCM achieves higher specificity and fewer false positives on synthetic benchmarks, while maintaining robustness under observational noise and limited sample lengths. On Arctic data, CCM reveals significant causal interactions between sea ice extent and atmospheric variables like specific humidity, longwave radiation, and surface temperature with a $p$-value of $0.009$, supporting ice-albedo feedbacks and moisture-radiation couplings central to Arctic amplification. In contrast, stochastic approaches miss these nonlinear dependencies or infer spurious causal relations. This work establishes CCM as a robust causal inference tool for nonlinear climate dynamics and provides the first systematic benchmarking framework for method selection in climate research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modeling realistic human behaviour to understand people's mode choices in order to propose personalised mobility solutions remains challenging. This paper presents an architecture for modeling realistic human mobility behavior in complex multimodal transport systems, demonstrated through a case study in Toulouse, France. We apply Large Language Models (LLMs) within an agent-based simulation to capture decision-making in a real urban setting. The framework integrates the GAMA simulation platform with an LLM-based generative agent, along with General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data for public transport, and OpenTripPlanner for multimodal routing. GAMA platform models the interactive transport environment, providing visualization and dynamic agent interactions while eliminating the need to construct the simulation environment from scratch. This design enables a stronger focus on developing generative agents and evaluating their performance in transport decision-making processes. Over a simulated month, results show that agents not only make context-aware transport decisions but also form habits over time. We conclude that combining LLMs with agent-based simulation offers a promising direction for advancing intelligent transportation systems and personalised multimodal mobility solutions. We also discuss some limitations of this approach and outline future work on scaling to larger regions, integrating real-time data, and refining memory models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a \textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the \emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete classifier over a set of optional resolutions, CARES interpolates continuous resolutions at inference for fine-grained control. Across five multimodal benchmarks spanning documents and natural images, as well as diverse target VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Although membership inference attacks (MIAs) and machine-generated text detection target different goals, identifying training samples and synthetic texts, their methods often exploit similar signals based on a language model's probability distribution. Despite this shared methodological foundation, the two tasks have been independently studied, which may lead to conclusions that overlook stronger methods and valuable insights developed in the other task. In this work, we theoretically and empirically investigate the transferability, i.e., how well a method originally developed for one task performs on the other, between MIAs and machine text detection. For our theoretical contribution, we prove that the metric that achieves the asymptotically highest performance on both tasks is the same. We unify a large proportion of the existing literature in the context of this optimal metric and hypothesize that the accuracy with which a given method approximates this metric is directly correlated with its transferability. Our large-scale empirical experiments, including 7 state-of-the-art MIA methods and 5 state-of-the-art machine text detectors across 13 domains and 10 generators, demonstrate very strong rank correlation (rho > 0.6) in cross-task performance. We notably find that Binoculars, originally designed for machine text detection, achieves state-of-the-art performance on MIA benchmarks as well, demonstrating the practical impact of the transferability. Our findings highlight the need for greater cross-task awareness and collaboration between the two research communities. To facilitate cross-task developments and fair evaluations, we introduce MINT, a unified evaluation suite for MIAs and machine-generated text detection, with implementation of 15 recent methods from both tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Fine-tuning is a crucial paradigm for adapting pre-trained large language models to downstream tasks. Recently, methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been shown to effectively fine-tune LLMs with an extreme reduction in trainable parameters. But, \emph{are their learned solutions really equivalent?} We study how LoRA and full-finetuning change pre-trained models by analyzing the model's weight matrices through the lens of their spectral properties. We find that LoRA and full fine-tuning yield weight matrices whose singular value decompositions exhibit very different structure: weight matrices trained with LoRA have new, high-ranking singular vectors, which we call \emph{intruder dimensions}, while those trained with full fine-tuning do not. Further, we extend the finding that LoRA forgets less than full fine-tuning and find its forgetting is vastly localized to the intruder dimension -- by causally intervening on the intruder dimensions by changing their associated singular values post-fine-tuning, we show that they cause forgetting. Moreover, scaling them down significantly improves modeling of the pre-training distribution with a minimal drop in downstream task performance. Given this, we should expect accumulating intruder dimensions to be harmful and lead to more forgetting. This will be amplified during continual learning because of sequentially fine-tuning, and we show that LoRA models do accumulate intruder dimensions here tend to perform worse in this setting, emphasizing the practicality of our findings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose a rubric-guided, pseudo-labeled, and prompt-driven zero-shot video summarization framework that bridges large language models with structured semantic reasoning. A small subset of human annotations is converted into high-confidence pseudo labels and organized into dataset-adaptive rubrics defining clear evaluation dimensions such as thematic relevance, action detail, and narrative progression. During inference, boundary scenes, including the opening and closing segments, are scored independently based on their own descriptions, while intermediate scenes incorporate concise summaries of adjacent segments to assess narrative continuity and redundancy. This design enables the language model to balance local salience with global coherence without any parameter tuning. Across three benchmarks, the proposed method achieves stable and competitive results, with F1 scores of 57.58 on SumMe, 63.05 on TVSum, and 53.79 on QFVS, surpassing zero-shot baselines by +0.85, +0.84, and +0.37, respectively. These outcomes demonstrate that rubric-guided pseudo labeling combined with contextual prompting effectively stabilizes LLM-based scoring and establishes a general, interpretable, and training-free paradigm for both generic and query-focused video summarization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models are typically trained on datasets collected from the web, which may inadvertently contain harmful or sensitive personal information. To address growing privacy concerns, unlearning methods have been proposed to remove the influence of specific data from trained models. Of these, exact unlearning -- which retrains the model from scratch without the target data -- is widely regarded the gold standard for mitigating privacy risks in deployment. In this paper, we revisit this assumption in a practical deployment setting where both the pre- and post-unlearning logits API are exposed, such as in open-weight scenarios. Targeting this setting, we introduce a novel data extraction attack that leverages signals from the pre-unlearning model to guide the post-unlearning model, uncovering patterns that reflect the removed data distribution. Combining model guidance with a token filtering strategy, our attack significantly improves extraction success rates -- doubling performance in some cases -- across common benchmarks such as MUSE, TOFU, and WMDP. Furthermore, we demonstrate our attack's effectiveness on a simulated medical diagnosis dataset to highlight real-world privacy risks associated with exact unlearning. In light of our findings, which suggest that unlearning may, in a contradictory way, increase the risk of privacy leakage during real-world deployments, we advocate for evaluation of unlearning methods to consider broader threat models that account not only for post-unlearning models but also for adversarial access to prior checkpoints.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present Hubble, a suite of fully open-source large language models (LLMs) for the scientific study of LLM memorization. Hubble models come in standard and perturbed variants: standard models are pretrained on a large English corpus, and perturbed models are trained in the same way but with controlled insertion of text (e.g., book passages, biographies, and test sets) designed to emulate key memorization risks. Our core release includes 8 models -- standard and perturbed models with 1B or 8B parameters, pretrained on 100B or 500B tokens -- establishing that memorization risks are determined by the frequency of sensitive data relative to size of the training corpus (i.e., a password appearing once in a smaller corpus is memorized better than the same password in a larger corpus). Our release also includes 6 perturbed models with text inserted at different pretraining phases, showing that sensitive data without continued exposure can be forgotten. These findings suggest two best practices for addressing memorization risks: to dilute sensitive data by increasing the size of the training corpus, and to order sensitive data to appear earlier in training. Beyond these general empirical findings, Hubble enables a broad range of memorization research; for example, analyzing the biographies reveals how readily different types of private information are memorized. We also demonstrate that the randomized insertions in Hubble make it an ideal testbed for membership inference and machine unlearning, and invite the community to further explore, benchmark, and build upon our work.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the ''learning cliff'' phenomenon: when faced with problems far beyond their current capabilities, models consistently fail, yielding a persistent zero-reward signal. In policy optimization algorithms like GRPO, this collapses the advantage calculation to zero, rendering these difficult problems invisible to the learning gradient and stalling progress. To overcome this, we introduce Scaf-GRPO (Scaffolded Group Relative Policy Optimization), a progressive training framework that strategically provides minimal guidance only when a model's independent learning has plateaued. The framework first diagnoses learning stagnation and then intervenes by injecting tiered in-prompt hints, ranging from abstract concepts to concrete steps, enabling the model to construct a valid solution by itself. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematics benchmarks demonstrate Scaf-GRPO's effectiveness, boosting the pass@1 score of the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model on the AIME24 benchmark by a relative 44.3% over a vanilla GRPO baseline. This result demonstrates our framework provides a robust and effective methodology for unlocking a model's ability to solve problems previously beyond its reach, a critical step towards extending the frontier of autonomous reasoning in LLM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Synthetic data has become a cornerstone for scaling large language models, yet its multilingual use remains bottlenecked by translation-based prompts. This strategy inherits English-centric framing and style and neglects cultural dimensions, ultimately constraining model generalization. We argue that the overlooked prompt space-the very inputs that define training distributions-offers a more powerful lever for improving multilingual performance. We introduce a lightweight framework for prompt-space optimization, where translated prompts are systematically transformed for Naturalness, Cultural Adaptation, and Difficulty Enhancement. Using an off-the-shelf multilingual LLM, we apply these transformations to prompts for 12 languages spanning 7 families. Under identical data conditions, our approaches achieve substantial and consistent downstream improvements over the translation-only baseline: +4.7% on Global-MMLU accuracy, +2.4% on Flores XCometXL and +35.3% wins in preferences on mArenaHard. We establish prompt-space optimization as a simple yet powerful paradigm for building multilingual LLMs that are more robust, culturally grounded, and globally capable.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In-memory key-value datastores have become indispensable building blocks of modern cloud-native infrastructures, yet their evolution faces scalability, compatibility, and sustainability constraints. The current literature lacks an experimental evaluation of state-of-the-art tools in the domain. This study addressed this timely gap by benchmarking Redis alternatives and systematically evaluating Valkey, KeyDB, and Garnet under realistic workloads within Kubernetes deployments. The results demonstrate clear trade-offs among the benchmarked data systems. Our study presents a comprehensive performance and viability assessment of the emerging in-memory key-value stores. Metrics include throughput, tail latency, CPU and memory efficiency, and migration complexity. We highlight trade-offs between performance, compatibility, and long-term viability, including project maturity, community support, and sustained development.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot generalization through large-scale image-text pretraining, yet their performance can drop once the deployment distribution diverges from the training distribution. To address this, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods update models using unlabeled target data. However, existing approaches often ignore two key challenges: prototype degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically similar classes. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{C}lass-Aware \textbf{P}rototype \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{N}egative \textbf{C}ontrast(\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed specifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts. CPL-NC introduces a \textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and activation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to retain rare-category knowledge. Additionally, a \textit{Negative Contrastive Learning} Mechanism identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to improve class separability. The framework employs asymmetric optimization, refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features. Experiments on 15 benchmarks show that CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid escalation of computational requirements for training large-scale language models has reinforced structural asymmetries between high-capacity jurisdictions and countries in the Global South. This paper examines the technical and fiscal feasibility of sovereign-scale language model training in Brazil and Mexico under conditions of constrained hardware access, energy availability, and fiscal ceilings. Using a dual-axis design that varies accelerator generation (NVIDIA H100 vs. A100) and training duration (90 vs. 150 days), we estimate compute demand, energy consumption, capital expenditures, and regulatory compatibility for the training of a 10-trillion-token model. Our findings show that while all configurations remain below export-control and electrical infrastructure thresholds, fiscal viability is determined by hardware efficiency. H100-based scenarios achieve training feasibility at a total cost of 8-14 million USD, while A100 deployments require 19-32 million USD due to higher energy and hardware demand. We argue that extending training timelines should be treated as a policy lever to mitigate hardware constraints, enabling the production of usable, auditable, and locally aligned models without competing at the global frontier. This study contributes to the discourse on AI compute governance and technological sovereignty by highlighting context-sensitive strategies that allow middle-income countries to establish sustainable and strategically sufficient AI capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Public and nonprofit organizations often hesitate to adopt AI tools because most models are opaque even though standard approaches typically analyze aggregate patterns rather than offering actionable, case-level guidance. This study tests a practitioner-in-the-loop workflow that pairs transparent decision-tree models with large language models (LLMs) to improve predictive accuracy, interpretability, and the generation of practical insights. Using data from an ongoing college-success program, we build interpretable decision trees to surface key predictors. We then provide each tree's structure to an LLM, enabling it to reproduce case-level predictions grounded in the transparent models. Practitioners participate throughout feature engineering, model design, explanation review, and usability assessment, ensuring that field expertise informs the analysis at every stage. Results show that integrating transparent models, LLMs, and practitioner input yields accurate, trustworthy, and actionable case-level evaluations, offering a viable pathway for responsible AI adoption in the public and nonprofit sectors.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Tool calling has become increasingly popular for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, for large tool sets, the resulting tokens would exceed the LLM's context window limit, making it impossible to include every tool. Hence, an external retriever is used to provide LLMs with the most relevant tools for a query. Existing retrieval models rank tools based on the similarity between a user query and a tool description (TD). This leads to suboptimal retrieval as user requests are often poorly aligned with the language of TD. To remedy the issue, we propose ToolDreamer, a framework to condition retriever models to fetch tools based on hypothetical (synthetic) TD generated using an LLM, i.e., description of tools that the LLM feels will be potentially useful for the query. The framework enables a more natural alignment between queries and tools within the language space of TD's. We apply ToolDreamer on the ToolRet dataset and show that our method improves the performance of sparse and dense retrievers with and without training, thus showcasing its flexibility. Through our proposed framework, our aim is to offload a portion of the reasoning burden to the retriever so that the LLM may effectively handle a large collection of tools without inundating its context window.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We study model merging as a practical alternative to conventional adaptation strategies for code-mixed NLP. Starting from a multilingual base model, we: (i) perform continued pre-training (CPT) on unlabeled code-mixed text to obtain an adapted checkpoint, (ii) merge checkpoint with the base model, and (iii) fine-tune (FT) on the downstream task data. We evaluate our approach for sentence classification (sentiment and hate speech) task in English-Hindi (En-Hi) and English-Spanish (En-Es) using XLM-R and Llama-3.2-1B models. Our results show that merged models consistently outperform full fine-tuning and CPT->FT. We observe gains of 2--5 points in F1 over full fine-tuning and ~1-2 points over CPT->FT, indicating that unlabeled data is leveraged more effectively via merging than via CPT alone. Zero-/few-shot prompting with larger LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.3-70B) lags behind fine-tuned and merged checkpoints, underscoring limits of in-context learning for code-mixed inputs. We further test cross-pair transfer by training on En-Hi and evaluating on En-Ta and En-Ml: merged checkpoints transfer more strongly than monolingual-English baselines (e.g., TV/TIES variants reaching 0.65-0.68 F1 vs 0.61-0.63 for full fine-tuning), suggesting that code-mixed knowledge is a more reliable substrate for low-resource pairs. We conclude with adaptation recipes matched to common data regimes (labeled only; labeled+unlabeled; transfer-only) and discuss limitations and scaling considerations for broader tasks and larger models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Data science aims to extract insights from data to support decision-making processes. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly used as assistants for data science, by suggesting ideas, techniques and small code snippets, or for the interpretation of results and reporting. Proper automation of some data-science activities is now promised by the rise of LLM agents, i.e., AI systems powered by an LLM equipped with additional affordances--such as code execution and knowledge bases--that can perform self-directed actions and interact with digital environments. In this paper, we survey the evaluation of LLM assistants and agents for data science. We find (1) a dominant focus on a small subset of goal-oriented activities, largely ignoring data management and exploratory activities; (2) a concentration on pure assistance or fully autonomous agents, without considering intermediate levels of human-AI collaboration; and (3) an emphasis on human substitution, therefore neglecting the possibility of higher levels of automation thanks to task transformation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sparse fine-tuning techniques adapt LLMs to downstream tasks by only tuning a sparse subset of model parameters. However, the effectiveness of sparse adaptation depends on optimally selecting the model parameters to be fine-tuned. In this work, we introduce a novel sparse fine-tuning technique named GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters, which fine-tunes only those model parameters which have the largest gradient magnitudes on downstream tasks and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes, intuitively prioritizing parameters that are highly task-relevant, but minimally disruptive to pre-trained knowledge. Our experimentation with LLaMA3 8B and Gemma 2B as base models shows that GaLLoP consistently improves or matches the in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution performance obtained via the usage of other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, including LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT. Our analysis demonstrates that GaLLoP mitigates catastrophic forgetting and memorization of task data, as important pre-trained parameters remain unchanged, and stabilizes performance relative to other fine-tuning techniques, robustly generalizing across most random seeds.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern software is increasingly built by composing APIs, elevating the API contract to a critical role. Inadequate contracts, however, lead to mismatched expectations and failures, creating a pressing need for robust conformance testing. Current test generation techniques are hindered by key challenges: polyglot systems, source code inaccessibility, a cost-reliability trade-off, and, most critically, the difficulty of generating structured inputs.   We introduce BOSQTGEN, a novel black-box methodology and tool for API test generation. BOSQTGEN utilizes a novel approach for decomposing API specifications into primitives, using LLMs to suggest coherent strata for them, and employing combinatorial testing to efficiently sample over these values. This approach ensures coverage of critical interactions while avoiding the redundancy of random sampling.   The resulting BOSQTGEN system achieves an average of 82% code coverage on RESTful benchmarks, often a 20% or more increase over prior state-of-the-art systems and nearing parity with hand-written test suites. Providing a fully API-driven approach to test generation, enables developers to automatically create high-quality test cases for validation or test-driven development.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Radio observations provide a window into a planet's interior and play a crucial role in studying its atmosphere and surface, key factors to find potential habitability. The discovery of thousands of exoplanets, together with advances in radio astronomy through the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), motivates the search for planetary-scale radio emissions. Here, we employ the radiometric Bode's law (RBL) and machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset of 1330 confirmed exoplanets, aiming to estimate their potential radio emission. Permutation Importance (PI) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analyses indicate that a planet's mass, radius, orbital semi-major axis, and distance from Earth are sufficient to dependably forecast its radio flux and frequency. The random forest model accurately reproduces these radio characteristics, confirming its reliability for exoplanetary radio predictions. Considering observational constraints, we find that 64 exoplanets could generate signals detectable by the SKA, 52 of which remain observable in the intermediate AA* deployment. Among these, MASCARA-1 b stands out with a predicted flux of 7.209 mJy at 135.1 MHz, making it an excellent SKA-Low target. Meanwhile, WASP-18 b, with a flux of 18.638 mJy peaking at 812.9 MHz, is the most promising candidate for SKA-Mid. These results show that the SKA can detect gas giants, such as MASCARA-1 b (SNR>400) and WASP-18 b (SNR>4236), within feasible integration times. Additionally, we identify four candidates (HATS-18 b, WASP-12 b, WASP-103 b, and WASP-121 b) that are likely affected by radio quenching, highlighting the importance of considering this effect in target selection for observation campaigns.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LLM-based agents are increasingly moving towards proactivity: rather than awaiting instruction, they exercise agency to anticipate user needs and solve them autonomously. However, evaluating proactivity is challenging; current benchmarks are constrained to localized context, limiting their ability to test reasoning across sources and longer time horizons. To address this gap, we present PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks). PROBE decomposes proactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for unspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing appropriate resolutions. We apply PROBE to evaluate leading LLMs and popular agentic frameworks, showing that even state-of-the-art models struggle to solve this benchmark. Computing our consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and agents, we find that the best end-to-end performance of 40% is achieved by both GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. Additionally, we demonstrate the relative capabilities of each model and analyze mutual failure modes. Our results highlight the current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems, and expose promising future research directions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) capability is central to the recent breakthroughs achieved by large language models in complex reasoning tasks. However, the accompanying issue of ''underthinking'', where models exhibit shallow reasoning by frequently switching thoughts without sufficient exploration, limits both performance and token efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a simple yet effective reasoning strategy: the SmartSwitch inference framework. This framework can be easily integrated into any large language model as a plug-and-play solution, continuously monitoring the model's reasoning process to detect underthinking and guide it toward deeper exploration of promising but overlooked thoughts. Specifically, the perception module identifies points where thoughts switch and evaluates the potential of the preceding thought using an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM). If a high-potential thought is found to be prematurely abandoned, the intervention module interrupts the ongoing inference, backtracks to the point before the switch, and inserts a "deepening prompt" to encourage further exploration along that promising path. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the performance of various large language models of different sizes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming software creation by enabling zero code development platforms. Our survey reviews recent platforms that let users build applications without writing code, by leveraging LLMs as the brains of the development process. We adopt a broad survey methodology, categorizing platforms based on key dimensions such as interface style, backend integration, output type, and extensibility. We analyze both dedicated LLM based app builders (OpenAI's custom GPTs, Bolt.new, Dust.tt, Flowise, Cognosys) and general no code platforms (e.g., Bubble, Glide) that integrate LLM capabilities. We present a taxonomy categorizing these platforms by their interface (conversational, visual, etc.), supported LLM backends, output type (chatbot, full application, workflow), and degree of extensibility. Core features such as autonomous agents, memory management, workflow orchestration, and API integrations are in scope of the survey. We provide a detailed comparison, highlighting each platform's strengths and limitations. Trade offs (customizability, scalability, vendor lock-in) are discussed in comparison with traditional and low code development approaches. Finally, we outline future directions, including multimodal interfaces, on device LLMs, and improved orchestration for democratizing app creation with AI. Our findings indicate that while zero code LLM platforms greatly reduce the barrier to creating AI powered applications, they still face challenges in flexibility and reliability. Overall, the landscape is rapidly evolving, offering exciting opportunities to empower non programmers to create sophisticated software.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have underscored the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to facilitate the emergence of reasoning capabilities. Despite the encouraging results, a fundamental dilemma persists as RL improvement relies on learning from high-quality samples, yet the exploration for such samples remains bounded by the inherent limitations of LLMs. This, in effect, creates an undesirable cycle in which what cannot be explored cannot be learned. In this work, we propose Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel instructional scaffolding framework designed to break the exploration bottleneck for general LLM reasoning. Specifically, RuscaRL introduces checklist-style rubrics as (1) explicit scaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, where different rubrics are provided as external guidance within task instructions to steer diverse high-quality responses. This guidance is gradually decayed over time, encouraging the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns; (2) verifiable rewards for exploitation during model training, where we can obtain robust LLM-as-a-Judge scores using rubrics as references, enabling effective RL on general reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RuscaRL across various benchmarks, effectively expanding reasoning boundaries under the Best-of-N evaluation. Notably, RuscaRL significantly boosts Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 23.6 to 50.3 on HealthBench-500, surpassing GPT-4.1. Furthermore, our fine-tuned variant on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct achieves 61.1 on HealthBench-500, outperforming leading LLMs including OpenAI-o3.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Rigorous security-focused evaluation of large language model (LLM) agents is imperative for establishing trust in their safe deployment throughout the software development lifecycle. However, existing benchmarks largely rely on synthetic challenges or simplified vulnerability datasets that fail to capture the complexity and ambiguity encountered by security engineers in practice. We introduce SEC-bench, the first fully automated benchmarking framework for evaluating LLM agents on authentic security engineering tasks. SEC-bench employs a novel multi-agent scaffold that automatically constructs code repositories with harnesses, reproduces vulnerabilities in isolated environments, and generates gold patches for reliable evaluation. Our framework automatically creates high-quality software vulnerability datasets with reproducible artifacts at a cost of only $0.87 per instance. Using SEC-bench, we implement two critical software security tasks to rigorously evaluate LLM agents' capabilities: proof-of-concept (PoC) generation and vulnerability patching. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM code agents reveals significant performance gaps, achieving at most 18.0% success in PoC generation and 34.0% in vulnerability patching on our complete dataset. These results highlight the crucial steps needed toward developing LLM agents that are more practical, intelligent, and autonomous for security engineering.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Model (LLM) conditioning refers to instructing an LLM to generate content in accordance with the norms and values of a specific culture, beliefs of a particular political orientation, or any desired text-specified semantic conditioning. Unfortunately, prompt engineering does not ensure that LLMs behave in accordance with a desired conditioning due to the inductive bias of the pre-training and alignment datasets. Prior works have focused on fine-tuning LLMs by directly conditioning the LoRA weights; however, such methods introduce a large number of parameters. As a remedy, we propose Zhyper, a parameter-efficient factorized hypernetwork framework that generates context-aware LoRA adapters from textual descriptions. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that Zhyper achieves competitive performance with up to 26x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we extend Zhyper to cultural alignment, demonstrating improved generalization to out-of-domain settings and a better capturing of fine-grained contextual values.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) promise to democratize financial analysis by reducing information-processing costs. Yet equal access does not ensure equal outcomes, as the locus of friction may shift from processing information to evaluating model outputs. We study GPT's earnings forecasts following corporate earnings releases and document two patterns. First, GPT's narrative attention is consistent and human-like but not always associated with higher forecast accuracy. Second, its quantitative reasoning varies substantially across contexts, challenging the view that LLMs are uniformly weak at numerical tasks. Building on these insights, we propose a diagnostic framework that links forecast accuracy to observable processing features (i.e., narrative focus, numerical reasoning, and self-assessed confidence). These indicators serve as proxies for this new form of information friction and alert investors when to exercise caution. Our study has implications for information frictions, regulatory oversight, and the economics of AI-mediated financial markets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper establishes a benchmark for evaluating tool-calling capabilities of large language models (LLMs) on multi-step geospatial tasks relevant to commercial GIS practitioners. We assess eight commercial LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.5 and 4, Claude Haiku 3.5, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1 and o4-mini) using a simple tool-calling agent equipped with 23 geospatial functions. Our benchmark comprises tasks in four categories of increasing complexity, with both solvable and intentionally unsolvable tasks to test rejection accuracy. We develop a LLM-as-Judge evaluation framework to compare agent solutions against reference solutions. Results show o4-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieve the best overall performance, OpenAI's GPT-4.1, GPT-4o and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview do not fall far behind, but the last two are more efficient in identifying unsolvable tasks. Claude Sonnet 4, due its preference to provide any solution rather than reject a task, proved to be less accurate. We observe significant differences in token usage, with Anthropic models consuming more tokens than competitors. Common errors include misunderstanding geometrical relationships, relying on outdated knowledge, and inefficient data manipulation. The resulting benchmark set, evaluation framework, and data generation pipeline are released as open-source resources (available at https://github.com/Solirinai/GeoBenchX), providing one more standardized method for the ongoing evaluation of LLMs for GeoAI.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Why do thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform their base counterparts? Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens. Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained: pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right time, enabling efficient use of their inference-time compute.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reward Models (RMs) are crucial to aligning large language models (LLMs), but the degree to which an RM specialized to one task (e.g. writing) generalizes to new tasks (e.g. math) is often not known a priori, often making using only one fixed RM to train LLMs suboptimal. However, optimizing LLMs with multiple RMs simultaneously can incur a prohibitively high computational cost and lead to conflicting signals from different RMs that may degrade performance. To address these challenges, we introduce LASeR (Learning to Adaptively Select Rewards), which frames reward model selection as a multi-armed bandit problem, efficiently and iteratively training LLMs using multiple RMs by selecting the most well-suited RM for each instance. On commonsense and math reasoning tasks, we show that LASeR boosts iterative LLM training, improving the absolute average accuracy of Llama-3-8B over three datasets by 2.67% over an ensemble of RM scores while also showing superior efficiency (e.g., a 2x speedup). Moreover, on WildChat (open-ended instruction-following tasks), LASeR leads to a 72.69% AlpacaEval win rate over the RM score ensemble baseline. Extending to long-context generation, LASeR improves by 2.96 F1 points (avg.) on single-document QA tasks and 2.97 F1 points on few-shot learning over the RM score ensemble baseline with best-of-n sampling.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The recent boom of large pre-trained models witnesses remarkable success in developing foundation models (FMs) for time series forecasting. Despite impressive performance across diverse downstream forecasting tasks, existing time series FMs possess massive network architectures and require substantial pre-training on large-scale datasets, which significantly hinders their deployment in resource-constrained environments. In response to this growing tension between versatility and affordability, we propose SEMPO, a novel lightweight foundation model that requires pretraining on relatively small-scale data, yet exhibits strong general time series forecasting. Concretely, SEMPO comprises two key modules: 1) energy-aware SpEctral decomposition module, that substantially improves the utilization of pre-training data by modeling not only the high-energy frequency signals but also the low-energy yet informative frequency signals that are ignored in current methods; and 2) Mixture-of-PrOmpts enabled Transformer, that learns heterogeneous temporal patterns through small dataset-specific prompts and adaptively routes time series tokens to prompt-based experts for parameter-efficient model adaptation across different datasets and domains. Equipped with these modules, SEMPO significantly reduces both pre-training data scale and model size, while achieving strong generalization. Extensive experiments on two large-scale benchmarks covering 16 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SEMPO in both zero-shot and few-shot forecasting scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) can propose rules in natural language, sidestepping the need for a predefined predicate space in traditional rule learning. Yet many LLM-based approaches ignore interactions among rules, and the opportunity to couple LLMs with probabilistic rule learning for robust inference remains underexplored. We present RLIE, a unified framework that integrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn a set of weighted rules. RLIE has four stages: (1) Rule generation, where an LLM proposes and filters candidates; (2) Logistic regression, which learns probabilistic weights for global selection and calibration; (3) Iterative refinement, which updates the rule set using prediction errors; and (4) Evaluation, which compares the weighted rule set as a direct classifier with methods that inject rules into an LLM. We evaluate multiple inference strategies on real-world datasets. Applying rules directly with their learned weights yields superior performance, whereas prompting LLMs with the rules, weights, and logistic-model outputs surprisingly degrades accuracy. This supports the view that LLMs excel at semantic generation and interpretation but are less reliable for precise probabilistic integration. RLIE clarifies the potential and limitations of LLMs for inductive reasoning and couples them with classic probabilistic rule combination methods to enable more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Industrial and government organizations increasingly depend on data-driven analytics for workforce, finance, and regulated decision processes, where timeliness, cost efficiency, and compliance are critical. Distributed frameworks such as Spark and Flink remain effective for massive-scale batch or streaming analytics but introduce coordination complexity and auditing overheads that misalign with moderate-scale, latency-sensitive inference. Meanwhile, cloud providers now offer serverless GPUs, and models such as TabNet enable interpretable tabular ML, motivating new deployment blueprints for regulated environments. In this paper, we present a production-oriented Big Data as a Service (BDaaS) blueprint that integrates a single-node serverless GPU runtime with TabNet. The design leverages GPU acceleration for throughput, serverless elasticity for cost reduction, and feature-mask interpretability for IL4/FIPS compliance. We conduct benchmarks on the HR, Adult, and BLS datasets, comparing our approach against Spark and CPU baselines. Our results show that GPU pipelines achieve up to 4.5x higher throughput, 98x lower latency, and 90% lower cost per 1K inferences compared to Spark baselines, while compliance mechanisms add only ~5.7 ms latency with p99 < 22 ms. Interpretability remains stable under peak load, ensuring reliable auditability. Taken together, these findings provide a compliance-aware benchmark, a reproducible Helm-packaged blueprint, and a decision framework that demonstrate the practicality of secure, interpretable, and cost-efficient serverless GPU analytics for regulated enterprise and government settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Human communication is motivated: people speak, write, and create content with a particular communicative intent in mind. As a result, information that large language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by humans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced information: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order to decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world, they too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of the source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales pitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have this capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled experiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent with rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they successfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner. We then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic reflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find that LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as closely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from vigilance-relevant considerations. However, a simple steering intervention that boosts the salience of intentions and incentives substantially increases the correspondence between LLMs and the rational model. These results suggest that LLMs possess a basic sensitivity to the motivations of others, but generalizing to novel real-world settings will require further improvements to these models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in learning algorithms, evaluations, and optimization tasks. Recent studies have shown that using LLM-based optimizers to automatically optimize model prompts, demonstrations, predictions themselves, or other components can significantly enhance the performance of AI systems, as demonstrated by frameworks such as DSPy and TextGrad. However, optimizers built on language models themselves are usually designed by humans with manual design choices; optimizers themselves are not optimized. Moreover, these optimizers are general purpose by design, to be useful to a broad audience, and are not tailored for specific tasks. To address these challenges, we propose metaTextGrad, which focuses on designing a meta-optimizer to further enhance existing optimizers and align them to be good optimizers for a given task. Our approach consists of two key components: a meta prompt optimizer and a meta structure optimizer. The combination of these two significantly improves performance across multiple benchmarks, achieving an average absolute performance improvement of up to 6% compared to the best baseline.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Test-time compute has led to remarkable success in the large language model (LLM) community, particularly for complex tasks, where longer chains of thought (CoTs) are generated to enhance reasoning capabilities. However, growing evidence reveals that such reasoning models often produce CoTs plagued by excessive redundancy, including unnecessary verification steps and repetitive reasoning shifts. The root cause lies in post-training of them that overly rely on outcome reward paradigms, as the data of process reward paradigms, which regulate intermediate reasoning steps, is difficult to construct at scale. To address this, we propose PI, a novel framework for Test-time Prompt Intervention. PI provides an interface to dynamically guide and regulate reasoning paths during inference through timely (When module) and proper (How module) interventions and post-intervention sampling (Which module). This allows human problem-solving expertise and cognitive science principles to be seamlessly integrated into LLMs' reasoning processes, enhancing controllability and interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that PI significantly shortens CoTs while reducing hallucination, yielding more concise and reliable reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in generative tasks, including register-transfer level (RTL) hardware synthesis. However, their tendency to memorize training data poses critical risks when proprietary or security-sensitive designs are unintentionally exposed during inference. While prior work has examined memorization in natural language, RTL introduces unique challenges: In RTL, structurally different implementations (e.g., behavioral vs. gate-level descriptions) can realize the same hardware, leading to intellectual property (IP) leakage (full or partial) even without verbatim overlap. Conversely, even small syntactic variations (e.g., operator precedence or blocking vs. non-blocking assignments) can drastically alter circuit behavior, making correctness preservation especially challenging. In this work, we systematically study memorization in RTL code generation and propose CircuitGuard, a defense strategy that balances leakage reduction with correctness preservation. CircuitGuard (1) introduces a novel RTL-aware similarity metric that captures both structural and functional equivalence beyond surface-level overlap, and (2) develops an activation-level steering method that identifies and attenuates transformer components most responsible for memorization. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that CircuitGuard identifies (and isolates) 275 memorization-critical features across layers 18-28 of Llama 3.1-8B model, achieving up to 80% reduction in semantic similarity to proprietary patterns while maintaining generation quality. CircuitGuard further shows 78-85% cross-domain transfer effectiveness, enabling robust memorization mitigation across circuit categories without retraining.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Memory-efficient training of deep neural networks has become increasingly important as models grow larger while deployment environments impose strict resource constraints. We propose TraDy, a novel transfer learning scheme leveraging two key insights: layer importance for updates is architecture-dependent and determinable a priori, while dynamic stochastic channel selection provides superior gradient approximation compared to static approaches. We introduce a dynamic channel selection approach that stochastically resamples channels between epochs within preselected layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate TraDy achieves state-of-the-art performance across various downstream tasks and architectures while maintaining strict memory constraints, achieving up to 99% activation sparsity, 95% weight derivative sparsity, and 97% reduction in FLOPs for weight derivative computation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present CoSense-LLM, an edge-first framework that turns continuous multimodal sensor streams (for example Wi-Fi CSI, IMU, audio, RFID, and lightweight vision) into compact, verifiable semantic tokens and coordinates with large language models under explicit latency, energy, bandwidth, and privacy constraints. CoSense-LLM has four parts: (i) SenseFusion, a lightweight encoder that aligns sensor embeddings with language and compresses them into short discrete code sequences; (ii) Edge-RAG, a local hybrid retrieval layer that grounds generation in site specific policies and notes; (iii) PromptRouter, a cost and uncertainty aware policy that selects edge only generation, edge plus retrieval, or compact cloud escalation; and (iv) Secure Execution, an auditable redaction path that enforces data minimization so raw waveforms never leave the device. The system works with modern serving optimizations, including paged or streaming KV caches, FlashAttention style kernels, speculative decoding, and quantized LoRA adapters, and supports on device personalization and federated updates under non IID drift. Across home, office, and clinic deployments, CoSense-LLM delivers grounded explanations while meeting tight service level objectives: it sustains sub second (p95) end to end latency on edge dominant paths, reduces inter tier token and bandwidth costs by preferring local retrieval grounded responses, and preserves privacy by transmitting only discrete codes and redacted metadata. Ablations show that Edge-RAG improves factual consistency and reduces contradictions, calibrated uncertainty enables selective abstention and controlled escalations, and KV plus decoding accelerators lower energy per decision. The results support an edge first design that treats semantics, privacy, and predictable latency as co equal goals for large model deployments in interference prone environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become the leading approach for creating artificial agents in complex environments. Model-based approaches, which are RL methods with world models that predict environment dynamics, are among the most promising directions for improving data efficiency, forming a critical step toward bridging the gap between research and real-world deployment. In particular, world models enhance sample efficiency by learning in imagination, which involves training a generative sequence model of the environment in a self-supervised manner. Recently, Masked Generative Modelling has emerged as a more efficient and superior inductive bias for modelling and generating token sequences. Building on the Efficient Stochastic Transformer-based World Models (STORM) architecture, we replace the traditional MLP prior with a Masked Generative Prior (e.g., MaskGIT Prior) and introduce GIT-STORM. We evaluate our model on two downstream tasks: reinforcement learning and video prediction. GIT-STORM demonstrates substantial performance gains in RL tasks on the Atari 100k benchmark. Moreover, we apply Transformer-based World Models to continuous action environments for the first time, addressing a significant gap in prior research. To achieve this, we employ a state mixer function that integrates latent state representations with actions, enabling our model to handle continuous control tasks. We validate this approach through qualitative and quantitative analyses on the DeepMind Control Suite, showcasing the effectiveness of Transformer-based World Models in this new domain. Our results highlight the versatility and efficacy of the MaskGIT dynamics prior, paving the way for more accurate world models and effective RL policies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable problem-solving abilities but often generate long thinking traces whose utility is unclear. Our work aims to improve their efficiency, enabling them to reach high performance without overthinking. First, we analyze the entropy of token probabilities in reasoning traces. Across three models, we observe a consistent U-shaped entropy pattern: high entropy on easy problems despite high accuracy, low entropy on problems with medium difficulty, and high entropy on hard problems reflecting uncertainty. Specifically, we notice 22--25\% entropy reduction from easy to medium difficulty regions, suggesting an {overthinking} phenomenon on easy instances. Building on these insights, we introduce \textbf{DiffAdapt}, a lightweight framework that selects Easy/Normal/Hard inference strategies per question based on their difficulty and reasoning trace entropy. Each inference strategy consists of a fixed prompt, temperature and maximum token length. In contrast to existing efficiency optimization methods, our approach does not fine-tune base LLM but a small probe that classifies LLM's final hidden state, allowing inexpensive adaptation. We comprehensively evaluate our method on five models and eight benchmarks. Our method achieves comparable or improved accuracy while reducing token usage by up to 22.4\%, establishing a practical path toward compute-efficient reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer models have significantly advanced the field of emotion recognition. However, there are still open challenges when exploring open-ended queries for Large Language Models (LLMs). Although current models offer good results, automatic emotion analysis in open texts presents significant challenges, such as contextual ambiguity, linguistic variability, and difficulty interpreting complex emotional expressions. These limitations make the direct application of generalist models difficult. Accordingly, this work compares the effectiveness of fine-tuning and prompt engineering in emotion detection in three distinct scenarios: (i) performance of fine-tuned pre-trained models and general-purpose LLMs using simple prompts; (ii) effectiveness of different emotion prompt designs with LLMs; and (iii) impact of emotion grouping techniques on these models. Experimental tests attain metrics above 70% with a fine-tuned pre-trained model for emotion recognition. Moreover, the findings highlight that LLMs require structured prompt engineering and emotion grouping to enhance their performance. These advancements improve sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and understanding of user behavior across various domains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurate and real-time prediction of wireless channel conditions, particularly the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), is a foundational requirement for enabling Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) in highly dynamic Industry 4.0 environments. Traditional physics-based or statistical models fail to cope with the spatio-temporal complexities introduced by mobile obstacles and transient interference inherent to smart warehouses. To address this, we introduce Evo-WISVA (Evolutionary Wireless Infrastructure for Smart Warehouse using VAE), a novel synergistic deep learning architecture that functions as a lightweight 2D predictive digital twin of the radio environment. Evo-WISVA integrates a memory-augmented Variational Autoencoder (VAE) featuring an Attention-driven Latent Memory Module (LMM) for robust, context-aware spatial feature extraction, with a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network for precise temporal forecasting and sequential refinement. The entire pipeline is optimized end-to-end via a joint loss function, ensuring optimal feature alignment between the generative and predictive components. Rigorous experimental evaluation conducted on a high-fidelity ns-3-generated industrial warehouse dataset demonstrates that Evo-WISVA significantly surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 47.6\% reduction in average reconstruction error. Crucially, the model exhibits exceptional generalization capacity to unseen environments with vastly increased dynamic complexity (up to ten simultaneously moving obstacles) while maintaining amortized computational efficiency essential for real-time deployment. Evo-WISVA establishes a foundational technology for proactive wireless resource management, enabling autonomous optimization and advancing the realization of predictive digital twins in industrial communication networks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Web-based participatory urban sensing has emerged as a vital approach for modern urban management by leveraging mobile individuals as distributed sensors. However, existing urban sensing systems struggle with limited generalization across diverse urban scenarios and poor interpretability in decision-making. In this work, we introduce AgentSense, a hybrid, training-free framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into participatory urban sensing through a multi-agent evolution system. AgentSense initially employs classical planner to generate baseline solutions and then iteratively refines them to adapt sensing task assignments to dynamic urban conditions and heterogeneous worker preferences, while producing natural language explanations that enhance transparency and trust. Extensive experiments across two large-scale mobility datasets and seven types of dynamic disturbances demonstrate that AgentSense offers distinct advantages in adaptivity and explainability over traditional methods. Furthermore, compared to single-agent LLM baselines, our approach outperforms in both performance and robustness, while delivering more reasonable and transparent explanations. These results position AgentSense as a significant advancement towards deploying adaptive and explainable urban sensing systems on the web.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Zero-shot Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) requires an agent to navigate unseen environments based on natural language instructions without any prior training. Current methods face a critical trade-off: either rely on environment-specific waypoint predictors that limit scene generalization, or underutilize the reasoning capabilities of large models during navigation. We introduce LaViRA, a simple yet effective zero-shot framework that addresses this dilemma by decomposing action into a coarse-to-fine hierarchy: Language Action for high-level planning, Vision Action for perceptual grounding, and Robot Action for robust navigation. This modular decomposition allows us to leverage the distinct strengths of different scales of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) at each stage, creating a system that is powerful in its reasoning, grounding and practical control. LaViRA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the VLN-CE benchmark, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities in unseen environments, while maintaining transparency and efficiency for real-world deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-augmented generation has emerged as one of the most effective approaches for code completion, particularly when context from a surrounding repository is essential. However, incorporating context significantly extends sequence length, leading to slower inference - a critical limitation for interactive settings such as IDEs. In this work, we introduce LlavaCode, a framework that compresses code into compact, semantically rich representations interpretable by code LLM, enhancing generation quality while reducing the retrieved context to only a few compressed single-token vectors. Using a small projector module we can significantly increase the EM and ES metrics of coding model with negligible latency increase. Our experiments demonstrate that compressed context enables 20-38% reduction in Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) on line completion tasks compared to full-RAG pipelines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With social media growth, users employ stylistic fonts and font-like emoji to express individuality, creating visually appealing text that remains human-readable. However, these fonts introduce hidden vulnerabilities in NLP models: while humans easily read stylistic text, models process these characters as distinct tokens, causing interference. We identify this human-model perception gap and propose a style-based attack, Style Attack Disguise (SAD). We design two sizes: light for query efficiency and strong for superior attack performance. Experiments on sentiment classification and machine translation across traditional models, LLMs, and commercial services demonstrate SAD's strong attack performance. We also show SAD's potential threats to multimodal tasks including text-to-image and text-to-speech generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In geotechnical engineering, constitutive models are central to capturing soil behavior across diverse drainage conditions, stress paths,and loading histories. While data driven deep learning (DL) approaches have shown promise as alternatives to traditional constitutive formulations, their deployment requires models that are both accurate and capable of quantifying predictive uncertainty. This study introduces a recursive Bayesian neural network (rBNN) framework that unifies temporal sequence learning with generalized Bayesian inference to achieve both predictive accuracy and rigorous uncertainty quantification. A key innovation is the incorporation of a sliding window recursive structure that enables the model to effectively capture path dependent soil responses under monotonic and cyclic loading. By treating network parameters as random variables and inferring their posterior distributions via generalized variational inference, the rBNN produces well calibrated confidence intervals alongside point predictions.The framework is validated against four datasets spanning both simulated and experimental triaxial tests: monotonic loading using a Hardening Soil model simulation and 28 CD tests on Baskarp sand, and cyclic loading using an exponential constitutive simulation of CD CU tests and 37 experimental cyclic CU tests on Ottawa F65 sand. This progression from monotonic to cyclic and from simulated to experimental data demonstrates the adaptability of the proposed approach across varying levels of data fidelity and complexity. Comparative analyses with LSTM, Encoder Decoder,and GRU architectures highlight that rBNN not only achieves competitive predictive accuracy but also provides reliable confidence intervals.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, leveraging denoising-based generation to enable inherent parallelism. Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models emerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a standardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient and extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference pipeline into four modular components--model, diffusion iteration manager, decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager--and integrates novel algorithms for each component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination of algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial efficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE. At batch size 1, it surpasses 1,100 tokens per second on HumanEval and averages over 800 tokens per second across six benchmarks on $8\times$ H800 GPUs. Compared to prior systems, dInfer delivers a $10\times$ speedup over Fast-dLLM while maintaining similar model performance. Even compared to the AR model (with a comparable number of activation parameters and performance) QWen2.5-3B, which is highly optimized with the latest vLLM inference engine, dInfer still delivers a $2$-$3\times$ speedup. The implementation of dInfer is open-sourced at https://github.com/inclusionAI/dInfer.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Effective deep search agents must not only access open-domain and domain-specific knowledge but also apply complex rules-such as legal clauses, medical manuals and tariff rules. These rules often feature vague boundaries and implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for agents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current agent benchmarks.   To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical rule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided by these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products with noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World Customs Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from real-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed HSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories, with these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.   Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source, and closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides, detailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application, and test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the era of social networks and rapid misinformation spread, news analysis remains a critical task. Detecting fake news across multiple languages, particularly beyond English, poses significant challenges. Cross-lingual news comparison offers a promising approach to verify information by leveraging external sources in different languages (Chen and Shu, 2024). However, existing datasets for cross-lingual news analysis (Chen et al., 2022a) were manually curated by journalists and experts, limiting their scalability and adaptability to new languages. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a scalable, explainable crowdsourcing pipeline for cross-lingual news similarity assessment. Using this pipeline, we collected a novel dataset CrossNews-UA of news pairs in Ukrainian as a central language with linguistically and contextually relevant languages-Polish, Russian, and English. Each news pair is annotated for semantic similarity with detailed justifications based on the 4W criteria (Who, What, Where, When). We further tested a range of models, from traditional bag-of-words, Transformer-based architectures to large language models (LLMs). Our results highlight the challenges in multilingual news analysis and offer insights into models performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Memory, a fundamental component of human cognition, exhibits adaptive yet fallible characteristics as illustrated by Schacter's memory "sins".These cognitive phenomena have been studied extensively in psychology and neuroscience, but the extent to which artificial systems, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), emulate these cognitive phenomena remains underexplored. This study uses human memory research as a lens for understanding LLMs and systematically investigates human memory effects in state-of-the-art LLMs using paradigms drawn from psychological research. We evaluate seven key memory phenomena, comparing human behavior to LLM performance. Both people and models remember less when overloaded with information (list length effect) and remember better with repeated exposure (list strength effect). They also show similar difficulties when retrieving overlapping information, where storing too many similar facts leads to confusion (fan effect). Like humans, LLMs are susceptible to falsely "remembering" words that were never shown but are related to others (false memories), and they can apply prior learning to new, related situations (cross-domain generalization). However, LLMs differ in two key ways: they are less influenced by the order in which information is presented (positional bias) and more robust when processing random or meaningless material (nonsense effect). These results reveal both alignments and divergences in how LLMs and humans reconstruct memory. The findings help clarify how memory-like behavior in LLMs echoes core features of human cognition, while also highlighting the architectural differences that lead to distinct patterns of error and success.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring their alignment with social norms has become a critical concern. While prior research has examined bias detection in various languages, there remains a significant gap in resources addressing social biases within Persian cultural contexts. In this work, we introduce PBBQ, a comprehensive benchmark dataset designed to evaluate social biases in Persian LLMs. Our benchmark, which encompasses 16 cultural categories, was developed through questionnaires completed by 250 diverse individuals across multiple demographics, in close collaboration with social science experts to ensure its validity. The resulting PBBQ dataset contains over 37,000 carefully curated questions, providing a foundation for the evaluation and mitigation of bias in Persian language models. We benchmark several open-source LLMs, a closed-source model, and Persian-specific fine-tuned models on PBBQ. Our findings reveal that current LLMs exhibit significant social biases across Persian culture. Additionally, by comparing model outputs to human responses, we observe that LLMs often replicate human bias patterns, highlighting the complex interplay between learned representations and cultural stereotypes.Upon acceptance of the paper, our PBBQ dataset will be publicly available for use in future work.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Decompilation converts machine code into human-readable form, enabling analysis and debugging without source code. However, fidelity issues often degrade the readability and semantic accuracy of decompiled output. Existing methods, such as variable renaming or structural simplification, provide partial improvements but lack robust detection and correction, particularly for complex closed-source binaries. We present FidelityGPT, a framework that enhances decompiled code accuracy and readability by systematically detecting and correcting semantic distortions. FidelityGPT introduces distortion-aware prompt templates tailored to closed-source settings and integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a dynamic semantic intensity algorithm to locate distorted lines and retrieve semantically similar code from a database. A variable dependency algorithm further mitigates long-context limitations by analyzing redundant variables and integrating their dependencies into the prompt context. Evaluated on 620 function pairs from a binary similarity benchmark, FidelityGPT achieved an average detection accuracy of 89% and a precision of 83%. Compared to the state-of-the-art DeGPT (Fix Rate 83%, Corrected Fix Rate 37%), FidelityGPT attained 94% FR and 64% CFR, demonstrating significant gains in accuracy and readability. These results highlight its potential to advance LLM-based decompilation and reverse engineering.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The injection molding industry faces critical challenges in preserving and transferring field knowledge, particularly as experienced workers retire and multilingual barriers hinder effective communication. This study introduces IM-Chat, a multi-agent framework based on large language models (LLMs), designed to facilitate knowledge transfer in injection molding. IM-Chat integrates both limited documented knowledge (e.g., troubleshooting tables, manuals) and extensive field data modeled through a data-driven process condition generator that infers optimal manufacturing settings from environmental inputs such as temperature and humidity, enabling robust and context-aware task resolution. By adopting a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) strategy and tool-calling agents within a modular architecture, IM-Chat ensures adaptability without the need for fine-tuning. Performance was assessed across 100 single-tool and 60 hybrid tasks for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-3.5-turbo by domain experts using a 10-point rubric focused on relevance and correctness, and was further supplemented by automated evaluation using GPT-4o guided by a domain-adapted instruction prompt. The evaluation results indicate that more capable models tend to achieve higher accuracy, particularly in complex, tool-integrated scenarios. In addition, compared with the fine-tuned single-agent LLM, IM-Chat demonstrated superior accuracy, particularly in quantitative reasoning, and greater scalability in handling multiple information sources. Overall, these findings demonstrate the viability of multi-agent LLM systems for industrial knowledge workflows and establish IM-Chat as a scalable and generalizable approach to AI-assisted decision support in manufacturing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Precise outbreak forecasting of infectious diseases is essential for effective public health responses and epidemic control. The increased availability of machine learning (ML) methods for time-series forecasting presents an enticing avenue to enhance outbreak forecasting. Though the COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated the value of applying ML models to predict epidemic profiles, using ML models to forecast endemic diseases remains underexplored. In this work, we present ForecastNet-XCL (an ensemble model based on XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM), a deep learning hybrid framework designed to addresses this gap by creating accurate multi-week RSV forecasts up to 100 weeks in advance based on climate and temporal data, without access to real-time surveillance on RSV. The framework combines high-resolution feature learning with long-range temporal dependency capturing mechanisms, bolstered by an autoregressive module trained on climate-controlled lagged relations. Stochastic inference returns probabilistic intervals to inform decision-making. Evaluated across 34 U.S. states, ForecastNet-XCL reliably outperformed statistical baselines, individual neural nets, and conventional ensemble methods in both within- and cross-state scenarios, sustaining accuracy over extended forecast horizons. Training on climatologically diverse datasets enhanced generalization furthermore, particularly in locations having irregular or biennial RSV patterns. ForecastNet-XCL's efficiency, performance, and uncertainty-aware design make it a deployable early-warning tool amid escalating climate pressures and constrained surveillance resources.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Previous research has investigated the application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in understanding 3D scenes by interpreting them as videos. These approaches generally depend on comprehensive 3D data inputs, such as point clouds or reconstructed Bird's-Eye View (BEV) maps. In our research, we advance this field by enhancing the capability of MLLMs to understand and reason in 3D spaces directly from video data, without the need for additional 3D input. We propose a novel and efficient method called the Video-3D Geometry Large Language Model (VG LLM). Our approach utilizes a 3D visual geometry encoder to extract 3D prior information from video sequences. This information is then integrated with visual tokens and input into the MLLM. Extensive experiments have shown that our method has achieved substantial improvements in various tasks related to 3D scene understanding and spatial reasoning, all directly learned from video sources. Impressively, our 4B model, which does not rely on explicit 3D data inputs, achieves competitive results compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and even surpasses the Gemini-1.5-Pro in the VSI-Bench evaluations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Since the rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs), people have begun to rely on them for information retrieval. While traditional search engines display ranked lists of sources shaped by search engine optimization (SEO), advertising, and personalization, LLMs typically provide a synthesized response that feels singular and authoritative. While both approaches carry risks of bias and omission, LLMs may amplify the effect by collapsing multiple perspectives into one answer, reducing users ability or inclination to compare alternatives. This concentrates power over information in a few LLM vendors whose systems effectively shape what is remembered and what is overlooked. As a result, certain narratives, individuals or groups, may be disproportionately suppressed, while others are disproportionately elevated. Over time, this creates a new threat: the gradual erasure of those with limited digital presence, and the amplification of those already prominent, reshaping collective memory. To address these concerns, this paper presents a concept of the Right To Be Remembered (RTBR) which encompasses minimizing the risk of AI-driven information omission, embracing the right of fair treatment, while ensuring that the generated content would be maximally truthful.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Model fusion combines multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) with different strengths into a more powerful, integrated model through lightweight training methods. Existing works on model fusion focus primarily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), leaving preference alignment (PA) --a critical phase for enhancing LLM performance--largely unexplored. The current few fusion methods on PA phase, like WRPO, simplify the process by utilizing only response outputs from source models while discarding their probability information. To address this limitation, we propose InfiFPO, a preference optimization method for implicit model fusion. InfiFPO replaces the reference model in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with a fused source model that synthesizes multi-source probabilities at the sequence level, circumventing complex vocabulary alignment challenges in previous works and meanwhile maintaining the probability information. By introducing probability clipping and max-margin fusion strategies, InfiFPO enables the pivot model to align with human preferences while effectively distilling knowledge from source models. Comprehensive experiments on 11 widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that InfiFPO consistently outperforms existing model fusion and preference optimization methods. When using Phi-4 as the pivot model, InfiFPO improve its average performance from 79.95 to 83.33 on 11 benchmarks, significantly improving its capabilities in mathematics, coding, and reasoning tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot performance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the extent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains underexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies, their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2) models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated. These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical practice.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance. To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in AI agents have demonstrated their growing potential to drive and support scientific discovery. In this work, we introduce MLR-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI agents on open-ended machine learning research. MLR-Bench includes three key components: (1) 201 research tasks sourced from NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML workshops covering diverse ML topics; (2) MLR-Judge, an automated evaluation framework combining LLM-based reviewers with carefully designed review rubrics to assess research quality; and (3) MLR-Agent, a modular agent scaffold capable of completing research tasks through four stages: idea generation, proposal formulation, experimentation, and paper writing. Our framework supports both stepwise assessment across these distinct research stages, and end-to-end evaluation of the final research paper. We then use MLR-Bench to evaluate six frontier LLMs and an advanced coding agent, finding that while LLMs are effective at generating coherent ideas and well-structured papers, current coding agents frequently (e.g., in 80% of the cases) produce fabricated or invalidated experimental results--posing a major barrier to scientific reliability. We validate MLR-Judge through human evaluation, showing high agreement with expert reviewers, supporting its potential as a scalable tool for research evaluation. We open-source MLR-Bench to help the community benchmark, diagnose, and improve AI research agents toward trustworthy and transparent scientific discovery.

Earth Observation (EO) represents a quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generative AI is increasing the productivity of software and hardware development across many application domains. In this work, we utilize the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop a co-pilot agent for assisting gem5 users with automating design space exploration. Computer architecture design space exploration is complex and time-consuming, given that numerous parameter settings and simulation statistics must be analyzed before improving the current design. The emergence of LLMs has significantly accelerated the analysis of long-text data as well as smart decision making, two key functions in a successful design space exploration task. In this project, we first build gem5 Co-Pilot, an AI agent assistant for gem5, which comes with a webpage-GUI for smooth user interaction, agent automation, and result summarization. We also implemented a language for design space exploration, as well as a Design Space Database (DSDB). With DSDB, gem5 Co-Pilot effectively implements a Retrieval Augmented Generation system for gem5 design space exploration. We experiment on cost-constraint optimization with four cost ranges and compare our results with two baseline models. Results show that gem5 Co-Pilot can quickly identify optimal parameters for specific design constraints based on performance and cost, with limited user interaction.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Formal languages are an integral part of modeling and simulation. They allow the distillation of knowledge into concise simulation models amenable to automatic execution, interpretation, and analysis. However, the arguably most humanly accessible means of expressing models is through natural language, which is not easily interpretable by computers. Here, we evaluate how a Large Language Model (LLM) might be used for formalizing natural language into simulation models. Existing studies only explored using very large LLMs, like the commercial GPT models, without fine-tuning model weights. To close this gap, we show how an open-weights, 7B-parameter Mistral model can be fine-tuned to translate natural language descriptions to reaction network models in a domain-specific language, offering a self-hostable, compute-efficient, and memory efficient alternative. To this end, we develop a synthetic data generator to serve as the basis for fine-tuning and evaluation. Our quantitative evaluation shows that our fine-tuned Mistral model can recover the ground truth simulation model in up to 84.5% of cases. In addition, our small-scale user study demonstrates the model's practical potential for one-time generation as well as interactive modeling in various domains. While promising, in its current form, the fine-tuned small LLM cannot catch up with large LLMs. We conclude that higher-quality training data are required, and expect future small and open-source LLMs to offer new opportunities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly envisioned as intelligent assistants for personalized learning, systematic head-to-head evaluations in authentic learning scenarios remain scarce. This study presents an empirical comparison of three state-of-the-art LLMs on a tutoring task simulating a realistic learning setting. Using a dataset containing a student's responses to ten mixed-format questions with correctness labels, each model was asked to (i) analyze the quiz to identify underlying knowledge components, (ii) infer the student's mastery profile, and (iii) generate targeted guidance for improvement. To mitigate subjectivity and evaluator bias, Gemini was employed as a virtual judge to perform pairwise comparisons across multiple dimensions: accuracy, clarity, actionability, and appropriateness. Results analyzed via the Bradley-Terry model reveal that GPT-4o is generally preferred, producing feedback that is more informative and better structured than its counterparts, whereas DeepSeek-V3 and GLM-4.5 demonstrate intermittent strengths but lower consistency. These findings highlight the feasibility of deploying LLMs as advanced teaching assistants for individualized support and provide methodological insights for subsequent empirical research on LLM-driven personalized learning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recommender systems have become an essential component of many online platforms, providing personalized recommendations to users. A crucial aspect is embedding techniques that convert the high-dimensional discrete features, such as user and item IDs, into low-dimensional continuous vectors, which can enhance the recommendation performance. Embedding techniques have revolutionized the capture of complex entity relationships, generating significant research interest. This survey presents a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in recommender system embedding techniques. We examine centralized embedding approaches across matrix, sequential, and graph structures. In matrix-based scenarios, collaborative filtering generates embeddings that effectively model user-item preferences, particularly in sparse data environments. For sequential data, we explore various approaches including recurrent neural networks and self-supervised methods such as contrastive and generative learning. In graph-structured contexts, we analyze techniques like node2vec that leverage network relationships, along with applicable self-supervised methods. Our survey addresses critical scalability challenges in embedding methods and explores innovative directions in recommender systems. We introduce emerging approaches, including AutoML, hashing techniques, and quantization methods, to enhance performance while reducing computational complexity. Additionally, we examine the promising role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in embedding enhancement. Through detailed discussion of various architectures and methodologies, this survey aims to provide a thorough overview of state-of-the-art embedding techniques in recommender systems, while highlighting key challenges and future research directions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper investigates security vulnerabilities and countermeasures for 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Fifth Generation New Radio (5G-NR) Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA)-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) localization in low-altitude urban environments. We first optimize node selection strategies under Air to Ground (A2G) channel conditions, proving that optimal selection depends on UAV altitude and deployment density. We propose lightweight User Equipment (UE)-assisted that reduce overhead while enhancing accuracy. We then expose critical security vulnerabilities by introducing merged-peak spoofing attacks where rogue UAVs transmit multiple lower-power pulses that merge with legitimate signals, bypassing existing detection methods. Through theoretical modeling and sensitivity analysis, we quantify how synchronization quality and geometric factors determine spoofing success probability, revealing fundamental weaknesses in current 3GPP positioning frameworks. To address these vulnerabilities, we design a network-centric anomaly detection framework at the Localization Management Function (LMF) using existing 3GPP-specified parameters, coupled with a recursive gradient descent-based robust localization algorithm that filters anomaly data while estimating UAV position. Our unified framework simultaneously provides robust victim localization and spoofer localization-capabilities not integrated in existing literature. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of both optimization and security mechanisms for 3GPP-compliant UAV positioning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This research proposes a systematic, large language model (LLM) approach for extracting product and service attributes, features, and associated sentiments from customer reviews. Grounded in marketing theory, the framework distinguishes perceptual attributes from actionable features, producing interpretable and managerially actionable insights. We apply the methodology to 20,000 Yelp reviews of Starbucks stores and evaluate eight prompt variants on a random subset of reviews. Model performance is assessed through agreement with human annotations and predictive validity for customer ratings. Results show high consistency between LLMs and human coders and strong predictive validity, confirming the reliability of the approach. Human coders required a median of six minutes per review, whereas the LLM processed each in two seconds, delivering comparable insights at a scale unattainable through manual coding. Managerially, the analysis identifies attributes and features that most strongly influence customer satisfaction and their associated sentiments, enabling firms to pinpoint "joy points," address "pain points," and design targeted interventions. We demonstrate how structured review data can power an actionable marketing dashboard that tracks sentiment over time and across stores, benchmarks performance, and highlights high-leverage features for improvement. Simulations indicate that enhancing sentiment for key service features could yield 1-2% average revenue gains per store.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), instance-based explanations for time series have gained increasing attention due to their potential for actionable and interpretable insights in domains such as healthcare. Addressing the challenges of explainability of state-of-the-art models, we propose a prototype-driven framework for generating sparse counterfactual explanations tailored to 12-lead ECG classification models. Our method employs SHAP-based thresholds to identify critical signal segments and convert them into interval rules, uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and medoid clustering to extract representative prototypes, and aligns these prototypes to query R-peaks for coherence with the sample being explained. The framework generates counterfactuals that modify only 78% of the original signal while maintaining 81.3% validity across all classes and achieving 43% improvement in temporal stability. We evaluate three variants of our approach, Original, Sparse, and Aligned Sparse, with class-specific performance ranging from 98.9% validity for myocardial infarction (MI) to challenges with hypertrophy (HYP) detection (13.2%). This approach supports near realtime generation (< 1 second) of clinically valid counterfactuals and provides a foundation for interactive explanation platforms. Our findings establish design principles for physiologically-aware counterfactual explanations in AI-based diagnosis systems and outline pathways toward user-controlled explanation interfaces for clinical deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability. First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts with superior scalability and robustness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent work has demonstrated state-of-the-art results in large language model (LLM) hallucination detection and mitigation through consistency-based approaches which involve aggregating multiple responses sampled from a single LLM for a given prompt. These approaches help offset limitations stemming from the imperfect data on which LLMs are trained, which includes biases and under-representation of information required at deployment time among other limitations which can lead to hallucinations. We show that extending these single-model consistency methods to combine responses from multiple LLMs with different training data, training schemes and model architectures can result in substantial further improvements in hallucination detection and mitigation capabilities beyond their single-model consistency counterparts. We evaluate this \emph{consortium consistency} approach across many model teams from a pool of 15 LLMs and explore under what conditions it is beneficial to team together different LLMs in this manner. Further, we show that these performance improvements often come with reduced inference costs, offsetting a significant drawback with single-model consistency methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present ASAP, a new framework for detecting and grounding multi-modal media manipulation (DGM4).Upon thorough examination, we observe that accurate fine-grained cross-modal semantic alignment between the image and text is vital for accurately manipulation detection and grounding. While existing DGM4 methods pay rare attention to the cross-modal alignment, hampering the accuracy of manipulation detecting to step further. To remedy this issue, this work targets to advance the semantic alignment learning to promote this task. Particularly, we utilize the off-the-shelf Multimodal Large-Language Models (MLLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct paired image-text pairs, especially for the manipulated instances. Subsequently, a cross-modal alignment learning is performed to enhance the semantic alignment. Besides the explicit auxiliary clues, we further design a Manipulation-Guided Cross Attention (MGCA) to provide implicit guidance for augmenting the manipulation perceiving. With the grounding truth available during training, MGCA encourages the model to concentrate more on manipulated components while downplaying normal ones, enhancing the model's ability to capture manipulations. Extensive experiments are conducted on the DGM4 dataset, the results demonstrate that our model can surpass the comparison method with a clear margin.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language model (LLM) routers improve the efficiency of multi-model systems by directing each query to the most appropriate model while leveraging the diverse strengths of heterogeneous LLMs. Most existing approaches frame routing as a classification problem based solely on the input query. While this reduces overhead by avoiding inference across all models, it overlooks valuable information that could be gleaned from potential outputs and fails to capture implicit intent or contextual nuances that often emerge only during response generation. These limitations can result in suboptimal routing decisions, particularly for complex or ambiguous queries that require deeper semantic understanding. To address this challenge, we propose Lookahead, a routing framework that "foresees" potential model outputs by predicting their latent representations and uses these predictions to guide model selection, thus enabling more informed routing without full inference. Within this framework, we implement two approaches based on causal and masked language models. Empirical evaluations across seven public benchmarks - spanning instruction following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation - show that Lookahead consistently outperforms existing routing baselines, achieving an average performance gain of 7.7% over the state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/huangcb01/lookahead-routing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite many advances in knowledge engineering (KE), challenges remain in areas such as engineering knowledge graphs (KGs) at scale, keeping up with evolving domain knowledge, multilingualism, and multimodality. Recently, KE has used LLMs to support semi-automatic tasks, but the most effective use of LLMs to support knowledge engineers across the KE activites is still in its infancy. To explore the vision of LLM copilots for KE and change existing KE practices, we conducted a multimethod study during a KE hackathon. We investigated participants' views on the use of LLMs, the challenges they face, the skills they may need to integrate LLMs into their practices, and how they use LLMs responsibly. We found participants felt LLMs could contribute to improving efficiency when engineering KGs, but presented increased challenges around the already complex issues of evaluating the KE tasks. We discovered prompting to be a useful but undervalued skill for knowledge engineers working with LLMs, and note that natural language processing skills may become more relevant across more roles in KG construction. Integrating LLMs into KE tasks needs to be mindful of potential risks and harms related to responsible AI. Given the limited ethical training, most knowledge engineers receive solutions such as our suggested `KG cards' based on data cards could be a useful guide for KG construction. Our findings can support designers of KE AI copilots, KE researchers, and practitioners using advanced AI to develop trustworthy applications, propose new methodologies for KE and operate new technologies responsibly.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the era of large language models (LLMs), weight-activation quantization helps fit models on edge device by reducing memory and compute bit-widths. However, three challenges persist for energy constrained hardware: (1) even after quantization, multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations remain unavoidable and continue to dominate energy consumption; (2) dequantization (or per-tensor/channel rescaling) introduces extra arithmetic and data movement, increasing latency and energy; (3) uniform parameters bit widths clip salient values-while intra-channel mixed precision is generally impractical on current matrix hardware and memory. In contrast, brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), owing to their binary spike-based information representation and the Integrate-and-Fire (IF) paradigm, naturally support mixed-precision storage and energy-efficient computation by replacing complex MACs with temporal Accumulate (ACCs). Motivated by this property, we propose SpikeQuant, which selectively applies mixed-precision quantization to activations with salient values and re-encodes them into binary spike counts, thereby enabling dynamic mixed storage of different bitwidths. Furthermore, by embedding the quantization scale into the threshold of the IF mechanism, our approach performs energy-efficient linear transformations on weights and activations while avoiding explicit dequantization. Experimental results demonstrate that SpikeQuant consistently achieves near-FP16 perplexity under W4A4 quantization while reducing energy cost by up to 4.6 times compared to existing methods, highlighting its effectiveness for accurate and energy-efficient LLM deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modeling realistic human behaviour to understand people's mode choices in order to propose personalised mobility solutions remains challenging. This paper presents an architecture for modeling realistic human mobility behavior in complex multimodal transport systems, demonstrated through a case study in Toulouse, France. We apply Large Language Models (LLMs) within an agent-based simulation to capture decision-making in a real urban setting. The framework integrates the GAMA simulation platform with an LLM-based generative agent, along with General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data for public transport, and OpenTripPlanner for multimodal routing. GAMA platform models the interactive transport environment, providing visualization and dynamic agent interactions while eliminating the need to construct the simulation environment from scratch. This design enables a stronger focus on developing generative agents and evaluating their performance in transport decision-making processes. Over a simulated month, results show that agents not only make context-aware transport decisions but also form habits over time. We conclude that combining LLMs with agent-based simulation offers a promising direction for advancing intelligent transportation systems and personalised multimodal mobility solutions. We also discuss some limitations of this approach and outline future work on scaling to larger regions, integrating real-time data, and refining memory models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a solution for distributed model training across decentralized, privacy-preserving devices, but the different energy capacities of participating devices (system heterogeneity) constrain real-world implementations. These energy limitations not only reduce model accuracy but also increase dropout rates, impacting on convergence in practical FL deployments. In this work, we propose LeanFed, an energy-aware FL framework designed to optimize client selection and training workloads on battery-constrained devices. LeanFed leverages adaptive data usage by dynamically adjusting the fraction of local data each device utilizes during training, thereby maximizing device participation across communication rounds while ensuring they do not run out of battery during the process. We rigorously evaluate LeanFed against traditional FedAvg on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, simulating various levels of data heterogeneity and device participation rates. Results show that LeanFed consistently enhances model accuracy and stability, particularly in settings with high data heterogeneity and limited battery life, by mitigating client dropout and extending device availability. This approach demonstrates the potential of energy-efficient, privacy-preserving FL in real-world, large-scale applications, setting a foundation for robust and sustainable pervasive AI on resource-constrained networks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sealed-bid auctions ensure fair competition and efficient allocation but are often deployed on centralized infrastructure, enabling opaque manipulation. Public blockchains eliminate central control, yet their inherent transparency conflicts with the confidentiality required for sealed bidding. Prior attempts struggle to reconcile privacy, verifiability, and scalability without relying on trusted intermediaries, multi-round protocols, or expensive cryptography. We present a sealed-bid auction protocol that executes sensitive bidding logic on a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)-backed confidential compute blockchain while retaining settlement and enforcement on a public chain. Bidders commit funds to enclave-generated escrow addresses, ensuring confidentiality and binding commitments. After the deadline, any party can trigger resolution: the confidential blockchain determines the winner through verifiable off-chain computation and issues signed settlement transactions for execution on the public chain. Our design provides security, privacy, and scalability without trusted third parties or protocol modifications. We implement it on SUAVE with Ethereum settlement, evaluate its scalability and trust assumptions, and demonstrate deployment with minimal integration on existing infrastructure

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on CPU-based edge devices is crucial for enabling on-device intelligence and expanding AI accessibility. However, it remains challenging due to limited memory and computational resources. During edge inference, memory usage and latency are the primary bottlenecks. Although weight quantization can effectively reduce memory consumption, existing hardware-friendly approaches often rely on uniform quantization, which poorly fits weight distributions and incurs high dequantization overhead at low bit widths. To address these limitations, we propose ELUTQ, an efficient quantization framework introducing a novel quantization format, Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ). HLQ better captures the statistical characteristics of weights without increasing the computational cost of Bit-serial LUT-based GEMM operations, thereby eliminating dequantization overhead. It is orthogonal to existing quantization algorithms and can be seamlessly integrated into various quantization pipelines. For efficient on-device deployment, ELUTQ provides optimized CPU kernels for end-to-end inference. Experiments show that for LLaMA3-8B, HLQ reduces perplexity by about 8% at 3-bit and 85% at 2-bit precision under post-training quantization, completing quantization within one hour. With efficient finetuning, HLQ further improves 2-bit performance within two hours. In terms of inference efficiency, our 2-bit LLaMA2-7B achieves over 25 tokens/s on an Apple M2 chip (4 threads, batch size = 1).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns (complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores (quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our Middo consistently enhances the quality of seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Word2VecT/Middo.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The DNS infrastructure is infamous for facilitating reflective amplification attacks. Various countermeasures such as server shielding, access control, rate limiting, and protocol restrictions have been implemented. Still, the threat remains throughout the deployment of DNS servers. In this paper, we report on and evaluate the often unnoticed threat that derives from transparent DNS forwarders, a widely deployed, incompletely functional set of DNS components. Transparent DNS forwarders transfer DNS requests without rebuilding packets with correct source addresses. As such, transparent forwarders feed DNS requests into (mainly powerful and anycasted) open recursive resolvers, which thereby can be misused to participate unwillingly in distributed reflective amplification attacks. We show how transparent forwarders raise severe threats to the Internet infrastructure. They easily circumvent rate limiting and achieve an additional, scalable impact via the DNS anycast infrastructure. We empirically verify this scaling behavior up to a factor of 14. Transparent forwarders can also assist in bypassing firewall rules that protect recursive resolvers, making these shielded infrastructure entities part of the global DNS attack surface.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this work, we study security of Model Context Protocol (MCP) agent toolchains and their applications in smart homes. We introduce AegisMCP, a protocol-level intrusion detector. Our contributions are: (i) a minimal attack suite spanning instruction-driven escalation, chain-of-tool exfiltration, malicious MCP server registration, and persistence; (ii) NEBULA-Schema (Network-Edge Behavioral Learning for Untrusted LLM Agents), a reusable protocol-level instrumentation that represents MCP activity as a streaming heterogeneous temporal graph over agents, MCP servers, tools, devices, remotes, and sessions; and (iii) a CPU-only streaming detector that fuses novelty, session-DAG structure, and attribute cues for near-real-time edge inference, with optional fusion of local prompt-guardrail signals. On an emulated smart-home testbed spanning multiple MCP stacks and a physical bench, AegisMCP achieves sub-second per-window model inference and end-to-end alerting. The latency of AegisMCP is consistently sub-second on Intel N150-class edge hardware, while outperforming traffic-only and sequence baselines; ablations confirm the importance of DAG and install/permission signals. We release code, schemas, and generators for reproducible evaluation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Artificial intelligence approaches for base-band processing for radio receivers have demonstrated significant performance gains. Most of the proposed methods are characterized by high compute and memory requirements, hindering their deployment at the edge of the Radio Access Networks (RAN) and limiting their scalability to large bandwidths and many antenna 6G systems. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity, model-driven neural network-based receiver, designed for multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems and suitable for implementation at the RAN edge. The proposed solution is compliant with the 5G New Radio (5G NR), and supports different modulation schemes, bandwidths, number of users, and number of base-station antennas with a single trained model without the need for further training. Numerical simulations of the Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) processing show that the proposed solution outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of achievable Transport Block Error Rate (TBLER), while reducing the Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) by 66$\times$, and the learnable parameters by 396$\times$.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A $p$-beauty contest is a wide class of games of guessing the most popular strategy among other players. In particular, guessing a fraction of a mean of numbers chosen by all players is a classic behavioral experiment designed to test iterative reasoning patterns among various groups of people. The previous literature reveals that the level of sophistication of the opponents is an important factor affecting the outcome of the game. Smarter decision makers choose strategies that are closer to theoretical Nash equilibrium and demonstrate faster convergence to equilibrium in iterated contests with information revelation. We replicate a series of classic experiments by running virtual experiments with large language models (LLMs) who play against various groups of virtual players. Our results show that LLMs recognize strategic context of the game and demonstrate expected adaptability to the changing set of parameters. LLMs systematically behave in a more sophisticated way compared to the participants of the original experiments. All LLMs still fail to identify dominant strategies in a two-player game. Our results contribute to the discussion on the accuracy of modeling human economic agents by artificial intelligence.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Endless Tuning is a design method for a reliable deployment of artificial intelligence based on a double mirroring process, which pursues both the goals of avoiding human replacement and filling the so-called responsibility gap (Matthias 2004). Originally depicted in (Fabris et al. 2024) and ensuing the relational approach urged therein, it was then actualized in a protocol, implemented in three prototypical applications regarding decision-making processes (respectively: loan granting, pneumonia diagnosis, and art style recognition) and tested with such as many domain experts. Step by step illustrating the protocol, giving insights concretely showing a different voice (Gilligan 1993) in the ethics of artificial intelligence, a philosophical account of technical choices (e.g., a reversed and hermeneutic deployment of XAI algorithms) will be provided in the present study together with the results of the experiments, focusing on user experience rather than statistical accuracy. Even thoroughly employing deep learning models, full control was perceived by the interviewees in the decision-making setting, while it appeared that a bridge can be built between accountability and liability in case of damage.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The surge of user-generated online content presents a wealth of insights into customer preferences and market trends. However, the highly diverse, complex, and context-rich nature of such contents poses significant challenges to traditional opinion mining approaches. To address this, we introduce Online Opinion Mining Benchmark (OOMB), a novel dataset and evaluation protocol designed to assess the ability of large language models (LLMs) to mine opinions effectively from diverse and intricate online environments. OOMB provides extensive (entity, feature, opinion) tuple annotations and a comprehensive opinion-centric summary that highlights key opinion topics within each content, thereby enabling the evaluation of both the extractive and abstractive capabilities of models. Through our proposed benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of which aspects remain challenging and where LLMs exhibit adaptability, to explore whether they can effectively serve as opinion miners in realistic online scenarios. This study lays the foundation for LLM-based opinion mining and discusses directions for future research in this field.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) are safety-critical, where failures can be severe. While Metamorphic Testing (MT) is effective for fault detection in ADS, existing methods rely heavily on manual effort and lack automation. We present AutoMT, a multi-agent MT framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that automates the extraction of Metamorphic Relations (MRs) from local traffic rules and the generation of valid follow-up test cases. AutoMT leverages LLMs to extract MRs from traffic rules in Gherkin syntax using a predefined ontology. A vision-language agent analyzes scenarios, and a search agent retrieves suitable MRs from a RAG-based database to generate follow-up cases via computer vision. Experiments show that AutoMT achieves up to 5 x higher test diversity in follow-up case generation compared to the best baseline (manual expert-defined MRs) in terms of validation rate, and detects up to 20.55% more behavioral violations. While manual MT relies on a fixed set of predefined rules, AutoMT automatically extracts diverse metamorphic relations that augment real-world datasets and help uncover corner cases often missed during in-field testing and data collection. Its modular architecture separating MR extraction, filtering, and test generation supports integration into industrial pipelines and potentially enables simulation-based testing to systematically cover underrepresented or safety-critical scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development of thinking language models that generate extensive internal reasoning chains before producing responses. While these models achieve improved performance, controlling their reasoning processes remains challenging. This work presents a steering approach for thinking LLMs by analyzing and manipulating specific reasoning behaviors in DeepSeek-R1-Distill models. Through a systematic experiment on 500 tasks across 10 diverse categories, we identify several reasoning behaviors exhibited by thinking models, including expressing uncertainty, generating examples for hypothesis validation, and backtracking in reasoning chains. We demonstrate that these behaviors are mediated by linear directions in the model's activation space and can be controlled using steering vectors. By extracting and applying these vectors, we provide a method to modulate specific aspects of the model's reasoning process, such as its tendency to backtrack or express uncertainty. Our approach offers practical tools for steering reasoning processes in thinking models in a controlled and interpretable manner. We validate our steering method using three DeepSeek-R1-Distill models, demonstrating consistent control across different model architectures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We address the challenge of adopting language models (LMs) for embodied tasks in dynamic environments, where online access to large-scale inference engines or symbolic planners is constrained due to latency, connectivity, and resource limitations. To this end, we present NeSyPr, a novel embodied reasoning framework that compiles knowledge via neurosymbolic proceduralization, thereby equipping LM-based agents with structured, adaptive, and timely reasoning capabilities. In NeSyPr, task-specific plans are first explicitly generated by a symbolic tool leveraging its declarative knowledge. These plans are then transformed into composable procedural representations that encode the plans' implicit production rules, enabling the resulting composed procedures to be seamlessly integrated into the LM's inference process. This neurosymbolic proceduralization abstracts and generalizes multi-step symbolic structured path-finding and reasoning into single-step LM inference, akin to human knowledge compilation. It supports efficient test-time inference without relying on external symbolic guidance, making it well suited for deployment in latency-sensitive and resource-constrained physical systems. We evaluate NeSyPr on the embodied benchmarks PDDLGym, VirtualHome, and ALFWorld, demonstrating its efficient reasoning capabilities over large-scale reasoning models and a symbolic planner, while using more compact LMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce MSC-Bench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-hop, end-to-end tool orchestration by LLM agents in a hierarchical Model-Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem. Existing benchmarks often evaluate tools in isolation, ignoring challenges such as functional overlap and cross-server orchestration, leading to overly optimistic assessments. MSC-Bench addresses these gaps by constructing ground truth through 'equal function sets', allowing objective metrics such as F1 score and reducing the dependency on LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Organized as a five-level curriculum, it systematically tests agent capabilities from single-tool orchestration to complex cross-server planning, and robustness to out-of-scope requests. Experiments reveal that rigid hierarchies can hinder performance without co-designed strategies, and even state-of-the-art agents exhibit systemic weaknesses in robustness. MSC-Bench provides a diagnostic framework to expose these limitations and guide the development of more capable and efficient tool-using agents. The benchmark and resources are publicly available at https://github.com/snooow1029/MSC_Bench.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models trained on vast corpora inherently risk memorizing sensitive or harmful content, which may later resurface in their outputs. Prevailing unlearning methods generally rely on gradient ascent and its variants to lower the probability of specific target responses. However, we find that this strategy induces a critical side effect: probability mass is redistributed into high-likelihood regions, often corresponding to semantically related rephrasings of the targets. We refer to this as the squeezing effect, which explains why many methods yield merely spurious unlearning, a problem further obscured by automated metrics (e.g., ROUGE, truth ratio) that misreport actual success. To address this, we propose a bootstrapping (BS) framework that explicitly links the squeezing effect with the model's own high-confidence generations, namely its model beliefs. Since model beliefs inherently capture the very high-likelihood regions where probability mass is squeezed, incorporating them into the unlearning objective directly counters the squeezing effect. By jointly suppressing both target responses and model beliefs, BS-T (token) attenuates high-probability tokens, whereas BS-S (sequence) removes entire high-confidence generations, together achieving more thorough forgetting while preserving utility. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the effectiveness of our approach.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have become a popular paradigm of AI applications. However, trustworthiness issues in MAS remain a critical concern. Unlike challenges in single-agent systems, MAS involve more complex communication processes, making them susceptible to corruption attacks. To mitigate this issue, several defense mechanisms have been developed based on the graph representation of MAS, where agents represent nodes and communications form edges. Nevertheless, these methods predominantly focus on static graph defense, attempting to either detect attacks in a fixed graph structure or optimize a static topology with certain defensive capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose a dynamic defense paradigm for MAS graph structures, which continuously monitors communication within the MAS graph, then dynamically adjusts the graph topology, accurately disrupts malicious communications, and effectively defends against evolving and diverse dynamic attacks. Experimental results in increasingly complex and dynamic MAS environments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing MAS defense mechanisms, contributing an effective guardrail for their trustworthy applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The growing prevalence of speech deepfakes has raised serious concerns, particularly in real-world scenarios such as telephone fraud and identity theft. While many anti-spoofing systems have demonstrated promising performance on lab-generated synthetic speech, they often fail when confronted with physical replay attacks-a common and low-cost form of attack used in practical settings. Our experiments show that models trained on existing datasets exhibit severe performance degradation, with average accuracy dropping to 59.6% when evaluated on replayed audio. To bridge this gap, we present EchoFake, a comprehensive dataset comprising more than 120 hours of audio from over 13,000 speakers, featuring both cutting-edge zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) speech and physical replay recordings collected under varied devices and real-world environmental settings. Additionally, we evaluate three baseline detection models and show that models trained on EchoFake achieve lower average EERs across datasets, indicating better generalization. By introducing more practical challenges relevant to real-world deployment, EchoFake offers a more realistic foundation for advancing spoofing detection methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Identifying which text spans refer to entities -- mention detection -- is both foundational for information extraction and a known performance bottleneck. We introduce ToMMeR, a lightweight model (<300K parameters) probing mention detection capabilities from early LLM layers. Across 13 NER benchmarks, ToMMeR achieves 93\% recall zero-shot, with over 90\% precision using an LLM as a judge showing that ToMMeR rarely produces spurious predictions despite high recall. Cross-model analysis reveals that diverse architectures (14M-15B parameters) converge on similar mention boundaries (DICE >75\%), confirming that mention detection emerges naturally from language modeling. When extended with span classification heads, ToMMeR achieves near SOTA NER performance (80-87\% F1 on standard benchmarks). Our work provides evidence that structured entity representations exist in early transformer layers and can be efficiently recovered with minimal parameters.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> When used in high-stakes settings, AI systems are expected to produce decisions that are transparent, interpretable, and auditable, a requirement increasingly expected by regulations. Decision trees such as CART provide clear and verifiable rules, but they are restricted to structured tabular data and cannot operate directly on unstructured inputs such as text. In practice, large language models (LLMs) are widely used for such data, yet prompting strategies such as chain-of-thought or prompt optimization still rely on free-form reasoning, limiting their ability to ensure trustworthy behaviors. We present the Agentic Classification Tree (ACT), which extends decision-tree methodology to unstructured inputs by formulating each split as a natural-language question, refined through impurity-based evaluation and LLM feedback via TextGrad. Experiments on text benchmarks show that ACT matches or surpasses prompting-based baselines while producing transparent and interpretable decision paths.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the field of large language model (LLM) compression, singular value decomposition (SVD) is a widely studied and adopted low-rank decomposition technique. Since SVD operates exclusively on linear modules, and these modules in LLMs are separated by nonlinear components, SVD can only be applied independently to each linear module. Under a global compression ratio constraint, determining the appropriate rank for different linear modules becomes a critical problem. Existing approaches, such as heuristic algorithms and mask-based training, have made progress in addressing this challenge. However, these methods still suffer from several limitations: heuristic algorithms explore the solution space within restricted regions, while mask-based training struggles to efficiently capture the relationship between singular value spectra and trainable parameters. More importantly, current methods overlook the key property that the gain function is non-smooth at a compression ratio of 1, which often leads the training process to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Rank Allocation (ARA) method. Specifically, (1) ARA introduces a dedicated mask design that enables efficient mapping and updating between retained ranks and trainable parameters; and (2) it employs an additional loss function to guide parameter selection toward globally optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that ARA achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the LLaMA2-7B model with a 80\% compression ratio, ARA reduces perplexity on WikiText2 from 8.38 to 6.42 and improves average zero-shot task accuracy by 9.72 percentage points compared with uniform compression. These results highlight the effectiveness of our method for rank allocation in SVD-based LLM compression.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Self-correction of large language models (LLMs) emerges as a critical component for enhancing their reasoning performance. Although various self-correction methods have been proposed, a comprehensive evaluation of these methods remains largely unexplored, and the question of whether LLMs can truly correct themselves is a matter of significant interest and concern. In this study, we introduce CorrectBench, a benchmark developed to evaluate the effectiveness of self-correction strategies, including intrinsic, external, and fine-tuned approaches, across three tasks: commonsense reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and code generation. Our findings reveal that: 1) Self-correction methods can improve accuracy, especially for complex reasoning tasks; 2) Mixing different self-correction strategies yields further improvements, though it reduces efficiency; 3) Reasoning LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) have limited optimization under additional self-correction methods and have high time costs. Interestingly, a comparatively simple chain-of-thought (CoT) baseline demonstrates competitive accuracy and efficiency. These results underscore the potential of self-correction to enhance LLM's reasoning performance while highlighting the ongoing challenge of improving their efficiency. Consequently, we advocate for further research focused on optimizing the balance between reasoning capabilities and operational efficiency. Project Page: https://correctbench.github.io/

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a critical bottleneck in their immense size, necessitating efficient compression techniques. While Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a promising approach, existing SVD-based methods treat the entire parameter matrix uniformly, overlooking that SVD approximation errors vary significantly across different matrix parts, which often leads to suboptimal compression. To address this, we propose \textbf{C}olumn-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{S}ingular \textbf{V}alue \textbf{D}ecomposition (CPSVD), a novel method that refines SVD-based LLM compression by intelligently segmenting the parameter matrix. Unlike traditional SVD, CPSVD identifies and directly preserves matrix columns with high decomposition errors, applying SVD only to columns with low decomposition errors, while precisely determining the optimal balance point between these two strategies to minimize error. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent heterogeneity in decomposition errors across different matrices within an LLM, CPSVD adaptively allocates non-uniform compression rates to modules within that layer, while adhering to a target layer-wise compression ratio, thereby further enhancing compression performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPSVD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methods, achieving lower perplexity and higher accuracy on zero-shot tasks.

Spire integrates the speech modality into an existing multilingual LM via speech discretization and continued pre-training using only 42.5K hours of speech. In particular, we adopt the pretraining framework of multilingual LMs and treat discretized speech input as an additional translation language. This approach not only equips the model with speech capabilities, but also preserves its strong text-based performance. We achieve this using significantly less data than existing speech LMs, demonstrating that discretized speech input integration as an additional language is feasible during LM adaptation. We make our code and models available to the community.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cardiovascular diseases are becoming increasingly prevalent in modern society, with a profound impact on global health and well-being. These Cardiovascular disorders are complex and multifactorial, influenced by genetic predispositions, lifestyle choices, and diverse socioeconomic and clinical factors. Information about these interrelated factors is dispersed across multiple types of textual data, including patient narratives, medical records, and scientific literature. Natural language processing (NLP) has emerged as a powerful approach for analysing such unstructured data, enabling healthcare professionals and researchers to gain deeper insights that may transform the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cardiac disorders. This review provides a comprehensive overview of NLP research in cardiology from 2014 to 2025. We systematically searched six literature databases for studies describing NLP applications across a range of cardiovascular diseases. After a rigorous screening process, we identified 265 relevant articles. Each study was analysed across multiple dimensions, including NLP paradigms, cardiology-related tasks, disease types, and data sources. Our findings reveal substantial diversity within these dimensions, reflecting the breadth and evolution of NLP research in cardiology. A temporal analysis further highlights methodological trends, showing a progression from rule-based systems to large language models. Finally, we discuss key challenges and future directions, such as developing interpretable LLMs and integrating multimodal data. To the best of our knowledge, this review represents the most comprehensive synthesis of NLP research in cardiology to date.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, the state-of-the-art in large-scale AI, achieve high quality by sparsely activating parameters. However, their reliance on routing between a few monolithic experts via a top-k mechanism creates a "quality cliff", offering only a few coarse-grained operating points. This inflexibility forces a difficult trade-off between cost and quality, preventing adaptation to diverse Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and leading to significant resource over-provisioning.   This paper introduces MoE-Prism, a model-system co-design that transforms rigid MoE models into elastic services. Our methodology is divided into two phases. First, an \emph{Offline Refactoring Engine} systematically deconstructs monolithic experts into fine-grained "sub-experts." This engine employs a partitioning optimization solver that uses a metaheuristic-based approach to group neurons, preserving functional locality without requiring retraining. Second, an \emph{Online Scheduling Engine} leverages this new elasticity through QoS-aware scheduling. It implements specialized policies to solve complex system problems, including maximizing throughput in cloud deployments and managing latency-optimized offloading for memory-constrained devices. Our evaluation across three different MoE models shows that MoE-Prismprovides over 4 times more distinct, stable operating points than the baseline. This allows an AI service to dynamically improve throughput by up to 19.9\% under a strict latency budget or reduce latency by up to 10.36\% under limited resources. MoE-Prism provides the critical "control knob" to bridge the model-system gap, enabling the next generation of adaptive, efficient, and QoS-aware AI services.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized product recommenders, yet their susceptibility to adversarial manipulation poses critical challenges, particularly in real-world commercial applications. Our approach is the first one to tap into human psychological principles, seamlessly modifying product descriptions, making such manipulations hard to detect. In this work, we investigate cognitive biases as black-box adversarial strategies, drawing parallels between their effects on LLMs and human purchasing behavior. Through extensive evaluation across models of varying scale, we find that certain biases, such as social proof, consistently boost product recommendation rate and ranking, while others, like scarcity and exclusivity, surprisingly reduce visibility. Our results demonstrate that cognitive biases are deeply embedded in state-of-the-art LLMs, leading to highly unpredictable behavior in product recommendations and posing significant challenges for effective mitigation.
