                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Previous measurements of neutron energy using fast plastic scintillators while operating the Fusion Z Pinch Experiment (FuZE) constrained the energy of any yield-producing deuteron beams to less than $4.65 keV$. FuZE has since been operated at increasingly higher input power, resulting in increased plasma current and larger fusion neutron yields. A detailed experimental study of the neutron energy isotropy in these regimes applies more stringent limits to possible contributions from beam-target fusion. The FuZE device operated at $-25~kV$ charge voltage has resulted in average plasma currents of $370~kA$ and D-D fusion neutron yields of $4\times10^7$ neutrons per discharge. Measurements of the neutron energy isotropy under these operating conditions demonstrates the energy of deuteron beams is less than $7.4 \pm 5.6^\mathrm{(stat)} \pm 3.7^\mathrm{(syst)}~keV$. Characterization of the detector response has reduced the number of free parameters in the fit of the neutron energy distribution, improving the confidence in the forward-fit method. Gamma backgrounds have been measured and the impact of these contributions on the isotropy results have been studied. Additionally, a time dependent measurement of the isotropy has been resolved for the first time, indicating increases to possible deuteron beam energies at late times. This suggests the possible growth of $m$=0 instabilities at the end of the main radiation event but confirms that the majority of the neutron production exhibits isotropy consistent with thermonuclear origin.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a process where a large language model (LLM) retrieves useful information from a database and then generates the responses. It is becoming popular in enterprise settings for daily business operations. For example, Copilot for Microsoft 365 has accumulated millions of businesses. However, the security implications of adopting such RAG-based systems are unclear.   In this paper, we introduce ConfusedPilot, a class of security vulnerabilities of RAG systems that confuse Copilot and cause integrity and confidentiality violations in its responses. First, we investigate a vulnerability that embeds malicious text in the modified prompt in RAG, corrupting the responses generated by the LLM. Second, we demonstrate a vulnerability that leaks secret data, which leverages the caching mechanism during retrieval. Third, we investigate how both vulnerabilities can be exploited to propagate misinformation within the enterprise and ultimately impact its operations, such as sales and manufacturing. We also discuss the root cause of these attacks by investigating the architecture of a RAG-based system. This study highlights the security vulnerabilities in today's RAG-based systems and proposes design guidelines to secure future RAG-based systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have ignited an innovative surge of AI applications, marking a new era of exciting possibilities equipped with extended context windows. However, hosting these models is cost-prohibitive mainly due to the extensive memory consumption of KV Cache involving long-context modeling. Despite several works proposing to evict unnecessary tokens from the KV Cache, most of them rely on the biased local statistics of accumulated attention scores and report performance using unconvincing metric like perplexity on inadequate short-text evaluation. In this paper, we propose NACL, a general framework for long-context KV cache eviction that achieves more optimal and efficient eviction in a single operation during the encoding phase. Due to NACL's efficiency, we combine more accurate attention score statistics in PROXY TOKENS EVICTION with the diversified random eviction strategy of RANDOM EVICTION, aiming to alleviate the issue of attention bias and enhance the robustness in maintaining pivotal tokens for long-context modeling tasks. Notably, our method significantly improves the performance on short- and long-text tasks by 80% and 76% respectively, reducing KV Cache by up to 50% with over 95% performance maintenance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in edge computing~(EC) have pushed cloud-based data caching services to edge, however, such emerging edge storage comes with numerous challenging and unique security issues. One of them is the problem of edge data integrity verification (EDIV) which coordinates multiple participants (e.g., data owners and edge nodes) to inspect whether data cached on edge is authentic. To date, various solutions have been proposed to address the EDIV problem, while there is no systematic review. Thus, we offer a comprehensive survey for the first time, aiming to show current research status, open problems, and potentially promising insights for readers to further investigate this under-explored field. Specifically, we begin by stating the significance of the EDIV problem, the integrity verification difference between data cached on cloud and edge, and three typical system models with corresponding inspection processes. To thoroughly assess prior research efforts, we synthesize a universal criteria framework that an effective verification approach should satisfy. On top of it, a schematic development timeline is developed to reveal the research advance on EDIV in a sequential manner, followed by a detailed review of the existing EDIV solutions. Finally, we highlight intriguing research challenges and possible directions for future work, along with a discussion on how forthcoming technology, e.g., machine learning and context-aware security, can augment security in EC. Given our findings, some major observations are: there is a noticeable trend to equip EDIV solutions with various functions and diversify study scenarios; completing EDIV within two types of participants (i.e., data owner and edge nodes) is garnering escalating interest among researchers; although the majority of existing methods rely on cryptography, emerging technology is being explored to handle the EDIV problem.

  Bottlenecks in LLM Inference</h2>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In large-language models, memory constraints in the key-value cache (KVC) pose a challenge during inference, especially with long prompts. In this work, we observed that compressing KV values is more effective than compressing the model regarding accuracy and job completion time (JCT). However, quantizing KV values and dropping less-important tokens incur significant runtime computational time overhead, delaying JCT. These methods also cannot reduce computation time or high network communication time overhead in sequence-parallelism (SP) frameworks for long prompts. To tackle these issues, based on our insightful observations from experimental analysis, we propose ZeroC, a Zero-delay QKV Compression system that eliminates time overhead and even reduces computation and communication time of the model operations. ZeroC innovatively embeds compression and decompression operations within model operations and adaptively determines compression ratios at a hybrid layer-token level. Further, it enables a communication-efficient SP inference framework. Trace-driven experiments demonstrate that ZeroC achieves up to 80% lower average JCT, 35% lower average perplexity, and 2.8x higher throughput with the same latency compared to state-of-the-art compression methods. ZeroC also reduces the average JCT of current LLM serving systems by up to 91% with the constraint of 0.1 perplexity increase. We open-sourced the code.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Diffusion models, widely used for image generation, face significant challenges related to their broad applicability due to prolonged inference times and high memory demands. Efficient Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is crucial to address these issues. However, unlike traditional models, diffusion models critically rely on the time-step for the multi-round denoising. Typically, each time-step is encoded into a hypersensitive temporal feature by several modules. Despite this, existing PTQ methods do not optimize these modules individually. Instead, they employ unsuitable reconstruction objectives and complex calibration methods, leading to significant disturbances in the temporal feature and denoising trajectory, as well as reduced compression efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel quantization framework that includes three strategies: 1) TIB-based Maintenance: Based on our innovative Temporal Information Block (TIB) definition, Temporal Information-aware Reconstruction (TIAR) and Finite Set Calibration (FSC) are developed to efficiently align original temporal features. 2) Cache-based Maintenance: Instead of indirect and complex optimization for the related modules, pre-computing and caching quantized counterparts of temporal features are developed to minimize errors. 3) Disturbance-aware Selection: Employ temporal feature errors to guide a fine-grained selection between the two maintenance strategies for further disturbance reduction. This framework preserves most of the temporal information and ensures high-quality end-to-end generation. Extensive testing on various datasets, diffusion models and hardware confirms our superior performance and acceleration..

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The concept of ownership in high level languages can aid both the programmer and the compiler to reason about the validity of memory operations. Previously, ownership semantics has been used successfully in high level automatic program verification to model a reference to data by a first order logic (FOL) representation of data instead of maintaining an address map. However, ownership semantics is not used in low level program verification. We have identified two challenges. First, ownership information is lost when a program is compiled to a low level intermediate representation (e.g., in LLVM IR). Second, pointers in low level programs point to bytes using an address map (e.g., in unsafe Rust) and thus the verification condition (VC) cannot always replace a pointer by its FOL abstraction. To remedy the situation, we develop ownership semantics for an LLVM like low level intermediate representation. Using these semantics, the VC can opportunistically model some memory accesses by a direct access of a pointer cache that stores byte representation of data. This scheme reduces instances where an address map must be maintained, especially for mostly safe programs that follow ownership semantics. For unsafe functionality, memory accesses are modelled by operations on an address map and we provide mechanisms to keep the address map and pointer cache in sync. We implement these semantics in SEABMC, a bit precise bounded model checker for LLVM. For evaluation, the source programs are assumed to be written in C. Since C does not have ownership built in, suitable macros are added that introduce and preserve ownership during translation to LLVM like IR for verification. This approach is evaluated on mature open source C code. For both handcrafted benchmarks and practical programs, we observe a speedup of $1.3x--5x$ during SMT solving.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims to identify and classify entities in text into predefined categories. However, when applied to Arabic data, NER encounters unique challenges stemming from the language's rich morphological inflections, absence of capitalization cues, and spelling variants, where a single word can comprise multiple morphemes. In this paper, we introduce Arabic KNN-NER, our submission to the Wojood NER Shared Task 2024 (ArabicNLP 2024). We have participated in the shared sub-task 1 Flat NER. In this shared sub-task, we tackle fine-grained flat-entity recognition for Arabic text, where we identify a single main entity and possibly zero or multiple sub-entities for each word. Arabic KNN-NER augments the probability distribution of a fine-tuned model with another label probability distribution derived from performing a KNN search over the cached training data. Our submission achieved 91% on the test set on the WojoodFine dataset, placing Arabic KNN-NER on top of the leaderboard for the shared task.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper explores the potential of cryogenic computing and superconducting electronics as promising alternatives to traditional semiconductor devices. As semiconductor devices face challenges such as increased leakage currents and reduced performance at higher temperatures, these novel technologies offer high performance and low power computation. Cryogenic computing operates at ultra-low temperatures near 77 K, leading to lower leakage currents and improved electron mobility. On the other hand, superconducting electronics, operating near 0 K, allow electrons to flow without resistance, offering the potential for ultra-low-power, high-speed computation. This study presents a comprehensive performance modeling and analysis of these technologies and provides insights into their potential benefits and limitations. We implement models of in-order and out-of-order cores operating at high clock frequencies associated with superconducting electronics and cryogenic computing in gem5. We evaluate the performance of these components using workloads representative of real-world applications like NPB, SPEC CPU2006, and GAPBS. Our results show the potential speedups achievable by these components and the limitations posed by cache bandwidth. This work provides valuable insights into the performance implications and design trade-offs associated with cryogenic and superconducting technologies, laying the foundation for future research in this field using gem5.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The emergence of intelligence in large language models (LLMs) has inspired investigations into their integration into automata learning. This paper introduces the probabilistic Minimally Adequate Teacher (pMAT) formulation, which leverages a probabilistic oracle that could give persistent errors randomly during answering the membership queries for deterministic finite automata (DFA) learning. Given the tendency of LLMs to produce hallucinatory content, we have developed techniques to improve answer accuracy and ensure the correctness of the learned automata. We propose the $\mathtt{Discrimination}$ prompt as well as the $\mathtt{Verification}$ prompt and explore their advantages over common prompts. Additionally, we compare DFA learning performance between the TTT algorithm and common active learning algorithms. To address the exponential number of persistent errors, we implement a dynamic query cache refinement algorithm that identifies and corrects conflicting queries by combining the active and passive learning algorithms. The empirical results demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our approach, providing a theoretical foundation for automata learning with LLMs in the loop.
