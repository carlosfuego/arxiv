                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based language models have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, yet their high inference latency poses a significant challenge for real-timeand large-scale deployment. While existing caching mechanisms,such as token-level key-value caches, offer speedups in autore-gressive decoding, they are limited in scope and applicability. In this paper, we present LLMCache, a novel layer-wise caching framework that accelerates transformer inference by reusing intermediate activations based on semantic similarity of input sequences. Unlike prior work, LLMCache is model-agnostic,operates across both encoder and decoder architectures, and supports caching at arbitrary transformer layers. We introduce a lightweight fingerprinting mechanism for matching seman-tically similar inputs and propose adaptive eviction strategies to manage cache staleness. Experiments on BERT and GPT-2 across SQuAD, WikiText-103, and OpenBookQA show up to 3.1 X speedup in inference time with <0.5% accuracy degradation. Our results highlight LLMCache as a practical and general-purpose solution for optimizing transformer inference in real-world applications

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern LLM applications such as deep-research assistants, coding agents, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, repeatedly process long prompt histories containing shared document or code chunks, creating significant pressure on the Key Value (KV) cache, which must operate within limited memory while sustaining high throughput and low latency. Prefix caching partially alleviates some of these costs by reusing KV cache for previously processed tokens, but limited by strict prefix matching. Position-independent caching (PIC) enables chunk-level reuse at arbitrary positions, but requires selective recomputation and positional-encoding (PE) adjustments. However, because these operations vary across queries, KV for the same chunk diverges across requests. Moreover, without page alignment, chunk KV layouts diverge in memory, preventing page sharing. These issues result in only modest HBM savings even when many requests reuse the same content.   We present MEPIC, a memory-efficient PIC system that enables chunk KV reuse across positions, requests, and batches. MEPIC aligns chunk KV to paged storage, shifts recomputation from token- to block-level so only the first block is request-specific, removes positional encodings via Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) fusion in the attention kernel, and makes remaining blocks fully shareable. These techniques eliminate most duplicate chunk KV in HBM, reducing usage by up to 2x over state-of-the-art PIC at comparable latency and accuracy, and up to 5x for long prompts, without any model changes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models often face a three-way trade-off among detection accuracy, inference latency, and deployment cost when used in real-world safety-sensitive applications. This paper introduces Prefix Probing, a black-box harmful content detection method that compares the conditional log-probabilities of "agreement/execution" versus "refusal/safety" opening prefixes and leverages prefix caching to reduce detection overhead to near first-token latency. During inference, the method requires only a single log-probability computation over the probe prefixes to produce a harmfulness score and apply a threshold, without invoking any additional models or multi-stage inference. To further enhance the discriminative power of the prefixes, we design an efficient prefix construction algorithm that automatically discovers highly informative prefixes, substantially improving detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Prefix Probing achieves detection effectiveness comparable to mainstream external safety models while incurring only minimal computational cost and requiring no extra model deployment, highlighting its strong practicality and efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) set the state of the art in visual generation, yet their quadratic self-attention cost fundamentally limits scaling to long token sequences. Recent Top-K sparse attention approaches reduce the computation of DiTs by compressing tokens into block-wise representation and selecting a small set of relevant key blocks, but still suffer from (i) quadratic selection cost on compressed tokens and (ii) increasing K required to maintain model quality as sequences grow. We identify that their inefficiency is due to the single-level design, as a single coarse level is insufficient to represent the global structure. In this paper, we introduce Log-linear Sparse Attention (LLSA), a trainable sparse attention mechanism for extremely long token sequences that reduces both selection and attention costs from quadratic to log-linear complexity by utilizing a hierarchical structure. LLSA performs hierarchical Top-K selection, progressively adopting sparse Top-K selection with the indices found at the previous level, and introduces a Hierarchical KV Enrichment mechanism that preserves global context while using fewer tokens of different granularity during attention computation. To support efficient training, we develop a high-performance GPU implementation that uses only sparse indices for both the forward and backward passes, eliminating the need for dense attention masks. We evaluate LLSA on high-resolution pixel-space image generation without using patchification and VAE encoding. LLSA accelerates attention inference by 28.27x and DiT training by 6.09x on 256x256 pixel token sequences, while maintaining generation quality. The results demonstrate that LLSA offers a promising direction for training long-sequence DiTs efficiently. Code is available at: https://github.com/SingleZombie/LLSA

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Existing diffusion-based video generation methods are fundamentally constrained by sequential computation and long-horizon inconsistency, limiting their practical adoption in real-time, streaming audio-driven avatar synthesis. We present Live Avatar, an algorithm-system co-designed framework that enables efficient, high-fidelity, and infinite-length avatar generation using a 14-billion-parameter diffusion model. Our approach introduces Timestep-forcing Pipeline Parallelism (TPP), a distributed inference paradigm that pipelines denoising steps across multiple GPUs, effectively breaking the autoregressive bottleneck and ensuring stable, low-latency real-time streaming. To further enhance temporal consistency and mitigate identity drift and color artifacts, we propose the Rolling Sink Frame Mechanism (RSFM), which maintains sequence fidelity by dynamically recalibrating appearance using a cached reference image. Additionally, we leverage Self-Forcing Distribution Matching Distillation to facilitate causal, streamable adaptation of large-scale models without sacrificing visual quality. Live Avatar demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, reaching 20 FPS end-to-end generation on 5 H800 GPUs, and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to achieve practical, real-time, high-fidelity avatar generation at this scale. Our work establishes a new paradigm for deploying advanced diffusion models in industrial long-form video synthesis applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across various tasks, yet their high computational demands pose deployment challenges, especially on consumer-grade hardware. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models provide an efficient solution through selective activation of parameter subsets, which reduces computation requirements. Despite this efficiency, state-of-the-art MoE models still require substantial memory beyond typical consumer GPU capacities. Traditional offloading methods that transfer model weights between CPU and GPU introduce latency, limiting inference performance. This paper presents a novel CPU-GPU collaborative inference framework that incorporates an expert caching mechanism on the GPU to reduce data transfer requirements and enable faster inference through cache hits. Computations are offloaded to CPU for efficient cache miss handling, which benefits from CPU multithreading optimizations. The evaluations of our framework demonstrate performance improvements and highlight the potential of CPU-GPU collaboration to maximize hardware utilization for single-request inference scenarios on consumer-grade systems. The implementation of our framework is available at https://github.com/elsa-lab/MoE-CPU-GPU-Collaborative-Inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Disaggregated memory (DM) is a promising data center architecture that decouples CPU and memory into independent resource pools to improve resource utilization. Building on DM, memory-disaggregated key-value (KV) stores are adopted to efficiently manage remote data. Unfortunately, existing approaches suffer from poor performance due to two critical issues: 1) the overdependence on one-sided atomic operations in index processing, and 2) the constrained efficiency in compute-side caches. To address these issues, we propose FlexKV, a memory-disaggregated KV store with index proxying. Our key idea is to dynamically offload the index to compute nodes, leveraging their powerful CPUs to accelerate index processing and maintain high-performance compute-side caches. Three challenges have to be addressed to enable efficient index proxying on DM, i.e., the load imbalance across compute nodes, the limited memory of compute nodes, and the expensive cache coherence overhead. FlexKV proposes: 1) a rank-aware hotness detection algorithm to continuously balance index load across compute nodes, 2) a two-level CN memory optimization scheme to efficiently utilize compute node memory, and 3) an RPC-aggregated cache management mechanism to reduce cache coherence overhead. The experimental results show that FlexKV improves throughput by up to 2.94$\times$ and reduces latency by up to 85.2%, compared with the state-of-the-art memory-disaggregated KV stores.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents VLCache, a cache reuse framework that exploits both Key-Value (KV) cache and encoder cache from prior multimodal inputs to eliminate costly recomputation when the same multimodal inputs recur. Unlike previous heuristic approaches, we formally identify the cumulative reuse error effect and demonstrate how to minimize the non-prefix cache reuse error effectively. We further analyze the varying importance of model layers and propose a dynamic, layer-aware recomputation strategy to balance accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results show that VLCache achieves an accuracy on par with full recomputation, while requiring only 2-5% of the tokens to compute, yielding 1.2x-16x TTFT speedups. We develop an experimental implementation of the proposed VLCache pipeline based on SGLang, enabling significantly faster inference in practical deployments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The limited bandwidth of PCIe has emerged as the critical bottleneck for large language model (LLM) performance, such as prefix cache fetching and model switching. Although intra-server multipath data transfer between GPU and host memory is theoretically possible, heterogeneous protocols such as PCIe and NVLink currently limit the bandwidth between host memory and GPUs to that of a single PICe link. This limitation resuals in underutilized intra-server bandwidth. To address this issue, we propose Multipath Memory Access (MMA), a scheme that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to enalbe efficient multipath data transfer between GPU and host memory. MMA supports seamless deployment via dynamic library injection, enabling LLM applications to benefit from MMA without requiring any code modification. In our testbed, MMA significantly improves the data transfer bandwidth between the GPU and memory, achieving a peak bandwidth of 245 GB/s-representing a 4.62x speedup compared to the natice single-path bandwidth. End-to-end evaluations demonstrate that MMA reduces the time-to-first-token (TTFT) for LLM serving by 1.14x to 2.38x and decreases model-switching latency in vLLM's sleep mode by 1.12x to 2.48x.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The attention layer, a core component of Transformer-based LLMs, brings out inefficiencies in current GPU systems due to its low operational intensity and the substantial memory requirements of KV caches. We propose a High-bandwidth Processing Unit (HPU), a memoryintensive co-processor that enhances GPU resource utilization during large-batched LLM inference. By offloading memory-bound operations, the HPU allows the GPU to focus on compute-intensive tasks, increasing overall efficiency. Also, the HPU, as an add-on card, scales out to accommodate surging memory demands driven by large batch sizes and extended sequence lengths. In this paper, we show the HPU prototype implemented with PCIe-based FPGA cards mounted on a GPU system. Our novel GPU-HPU heterogeneous system demonstrates up to 4.1x performance gains and 4.6x energy efficiency improvements over a GPUonly system, providing scalability without increasing the number of GPUs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent multimodal research, the diffusion paradigm has emerged as a promising alternative to the autoregressive paradigm (AR), owing to its unique decoding advantages. However, due to the capability limitations of the base diffusion language model, the performance of the diffusion vision language model (dVLM) still lags significantly behind that of mainstream models. This leads to a simple yet fundamental question: Is it possible to construct dVLMs based on existing powerful AR models? In response, we propose DiffusionVL, a dVLM family that could be translated from any powerful AR models. Through simple fine-tuning, we successfully adapt AR pre-trained models into the diffusion paradigm. This approach yields two key observations: (1) The paradigm shift from AR-based multimodal models to diffusion is remarkably effective. (2) Direct conversion of an AR language model to a dVLM is also feasible, achieving performance competitive with LLaVA-style visual-instruction-tuning. Further, we introduce a block-decoding design into dVLMs that supports arbitrary-length generation and KV cache reuse, achieving a significant inference speedup. We conduct a large number of experiments. Despite training with less than 5% of the data required by prior methods, DiffusionVL achieves a comprehensive performance improvement-a 34.4% gain on the MMMU-Pro (vision) bench and 37.5% gain on the MME (Cog.) bench-alongside a 2x inference speedup. The model and code are released at https://github.com/hustvl/DiffusionVL.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Early-Exit (EE) is a Large Language Model (LLM) architecture that accelerates inference by allowing easier tokens to be generated using only a subset of the model's layers. However, traditional batching frameworks are ill-suited for EE LLMs, as not all requests in a batch may be ready to exit at the same time. Existing solutions either force a uniform decision on the batch, which overlooks EE opportunities, or degrade output quality by forcing premature exits. We propose Dynamic Rebatching, a solution where we dynamically reorganize the batch at each early-exit point. Requests that meet the exit criteria are immediately processed, while those that continue are held in a buffer, re-grouped into a new batch, and forwarded to deeper layers. We introduce DREX, an early-exit inference system that implements Dynamic Rebatching with two key optimizations: 1) a copy-free rebatching buffer that avoids physical data movement, and 2) an EE and SLA-aware scheduler that analytically predicts whether a given rebatching operation will be profitable. DREX also efficiently handles the missing KV cache from skipped layers using memory-efficient state-copying. Our evaluation shows that DREX improves throughput by 2-12% compared to baseline approaches while maintaining output quality. Crucially, DREX completely eliminates involuntary exits, providing a key guarantee for preserving the output quality intended by the EE model.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Language models (LMs) are becoming increasingly dependent on external tools. LM-based agentic frameworks frequently interact with their environment via such tools to search files, run code, call APIs, etc. Further, modern reasoning-based LMs use tools such as web search and Python code execution to enhance their reasoning capabilities. While tools greatly improve the capabilities of LMs, they also introduce performance bottlenecks during the inference process. In this paper, we introduce novel systems optimizations to address such performance bottlenecks by speculating tool calls and forcing sequences to remain resident in the inference engine to minimize overheads. Our optimizations lead to throughput improvements of several hundred tokens per second when hosting inference for LM agents. We provide a theoretical analysis of our algorithms to provide insights into speculation configurations that will yield the best performance. Further, we recommend a new "tool cache" API endpoint to enable LM providers to easily adopt these optimizations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Bloom filters are a fundamental data structure for approximate membership queries, with applications ranging from data analytics to databases and genomics. Several variants have been proposed to accommodate parallel architectures. GPUs, with massive thread-level parallelism and high-bandwidth memory, are a natural fit for accelerating these Bloom filter variants potentially to billions of operations per second. Although CPU-optimized implementations have been well studied, GPU designs remain underexplored. We close this gap by exploring the design space on GPUs along three dimensions: vectorization, thread cooperation, and compute latency.   Our evaluation shows that the combination of these optimization points strongly affects throughput, with the largest gains achieved when the filter fits within the GPU's cache domain. We examine how the hardware responds to different parameter configurations and relate these observations to measured performance trends. Crucially, our optimized design overcomes the conventional trade-off between speed and precision, delivering the throughput typically restricted to high-error variants while maintaining the superior accuracy of high-precision configurations. At iso error rate, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by $11.35\times$ ($15.4\times$) for bulk filter lookup (construction), respectively, achieving above $92\%$ of the practical speed-of-light across a wide range of configurations on a B200 GPU. We propose a modular CUDA/C++ implementation, which will be openly available soon.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Radial profiles of density fluctuations and radial electric field, $E_r$, have been measured using Doppler reflectometry during the post-pellet enhanced confinement phase achieved, under different heating power levels and magnetic configurations, along the 2018 W7-X experimental campaign. A pronounced $E_r$-well is measured with local values as high as -40 kV/m in the radial range $ρ\sim 0.7-0.8$ during the post-pellet enhanced confinement phase. The maximum $E_r$ intensity scales with both plasma density and Electron Cyclotron Heating (ECH) power level following a similar trend as the plasma energy content. A good agreement is found when the experimental $E_r$ profiles are compared to simulations carried out using the neoclassical codes DKES and KNOSOS. The density fluctuation level decreases from the plasma edge toward the plasma core and the drop is more pronounced in the post-pellet enhanced confinement phase than in reference gas fuelled plasmas. Besides, in the post-pellet phase, the density fluctuation level is lower in the high iota magnetic configuration than in the standard one. In order to discriminate whether this difference is related to the differences in the plasma profiles or in the stability properties of the two configurations, gyrokinetic simulations have been carried out using the codes \texttt{stella} and EUTERPE. The simulation results point to the plasma profile evolution after the pellet injection and the stabilization effect of the radial electric field profile as the dominant players in the stabilization of the plasma turbulence.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in long-context scenarios such as multi-turn conversations. However, long contexts pose significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory overhead from Key-Value (KV) cache and increased latency due to excessive memory accesses. Recent methods for dynamic KV selection struggle with trade-offs: block-level indexing degrades accuracy by retrieving irrelevant KV entries, while token-level indexing incurs high latency from inefficient retrieval mechanisms. In this paper, we propose CTKVR, a novel centroid-then-token KV retrieval scheme that addresses these limitations. CTKVR leverages a key observation: query vectors adjacent in position exhibit high similarity after Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and share most of their top-k KV cache entries. Based on this insight, CTKVR employs a two-stage retrieval strategy: lightweight centroids are precomputed during prefilling for centroid-grained indexing, followed by token-level refinement for precise KV retrieval. This approach balances retrieval efficiency and accuracy. To further enhance performance, we implement an optimized system for indexing construction and search using CPU-GPU co-execution. Experimentally, CTKVR achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks with less than 1% accuracy degradation. Meanwhile, CTKVR delivers 3 times and 4 times throughput speedups on Llama-3-8B and Yi-9B at 96K context length across diverse GPU hardware.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In real-world IoT applications, sensor data is usually collected under diverse and dynamic contextual conditions where factors such as sensor placements or ambient environments can significantly affect data patterns and downstream performance. Traditional domain adaptation or generalization methods often ignore such context information or use simplistic integration strategies, making them ineffective in handling unseen context shifts after deployment. In this paper, we propose Chorus, a context-aware, data-free model customization approach that adapts models to unseen deployment conditions without requiring target-domain data. The key idea is to learn effective context representations that capture their influence on sensor data patterns and to adaptively integrate them based on the degree of context shift. Specifically, Chorus first performs unsupervised cross-modal reconstruction between unlabeled sensor data and language-based context embeddings, while regularizing the context embedding space to learn robust, generalizable context representations. Then, it trains a lightweight gated head on limited labeled samples to dynamically balance sensor and context contributions-favoring context when sensor evidence is ambiguous and vice versa. To further reduce inference latency, Chorus employs a context-caching mechanism that reuses cached context representations and updates only upon detected context shifts. Experiments on IMU, speech, and WiFi sensing tasks under diverse context shifts show that Chorus outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 11.3% in unseen contexts, while maintaining comparable latency on smartphone and edge devices.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Long-sequence modeling faces a fundamental trade-off between the efficiency of compressive fixed-size memory in RNN-like models and the fidelity of lossless growing memory in attention-based Transformers. Inspired by the Multi-Store Model in cognitive science, we introduce a memory framework of artificial neural networks. Our method maintains a sliding window of the Transformer's KV cache as lossless short-term memory, while a learnable module termed Artificial Hippocampus Network (AHN) recurrently compresses out-of-window information into a fixed-size compact long-term memory. To validate this framework, we instantiate AHNs using modern RNN-like architectures, including Mamba2, DeltaNet, and GatedDeltaNet to augment open-weight LLMs. We also propose an efficient self-distillation training method where the base model's all parameters are frozen and only the parameters from AHNs are optimized. For inference, our method sets a default large sliding window size of 32k for attention, and AHNs activate only when the sequence length exceeds the 32k window, addressing the quadratic-complexity issue of attention that emerges at that scale. Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks LV-Eval and InfiniteBench demonstrate that AHN-augmented models consistently outperform sliding window baselines and achieve performance comparable or even superior to full-attention models, while substantially reducing computational and memory requirements. For instance, augmenting the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct with AHNs reduces inference FLOPs by 40.5% and memory cache by 74.0%, while improving its average score on LV-Eval (128k sequence length) from 4.41 to 5.88.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The proliferation of large language models has driven demand for long-context inference on resource-constrained edge platforms. However, deploying these models on Neural Processing Units (NPUs) presents significant challenges due to architectural mismatch: the quadratic complexity of standard attention conflicts with NPU memory and compute patterns. This paper presents a comprehensive performance analysis of causal inference operators on a modern NPU, benchmarking quadratic attention against sub-quadratic alternatives including structured state-space models and causal convolutions. Our analysis reveals a spectrum of critical bottlenecks: quadratic attention becomes severely memory-bound with catastrophic cache inefficiency, while sub-quadratic variants span from compute-bound on programmable vector cores to memory-bound by data movement. These findings provide essential insights for co-designing hardware-aware models and optimization strategies to enable efficient long-context inference on edge platforms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Advanced nanopore measurements allow structural probing of molecules with high spatial and temporal resolution. We report high signal-to-noise, 1-10 MHz bandwidth, translocation measurements of the multi-state folding of heme protein cytochrome c in KCl solution through optimally designed silicon nitride pores of 2.3-3.3 nm diameter and 3.6-3.8 nm effective thickness, and an optimal concentration of a denaturant (Gdm-Cl). The pore diameter is slightly smaller than the protein size, forcing the protein to squeeze through the pore. The sufficiently large pore thickness allows enough time for protein probing at an applied field of approximately 250 kV/cm. Through Bayesian Information Criterion score analysis, current blockades reveal six distinct levels, attributed to specific protein states. We calculate the transition probabilities between the states and the conditional probabilities of the protein leaving the pore from each state. We validate the model by simulating events and comparing them to experimental data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The cryogenic approach to the search for the neutron electric dipole moment--performing the experiment in superfluid liquid helium--holds promise for a substantial increase in sensitivity, potentially enabling a sensitivity level of $10^{-28}$ e-cm. A crucial component in realizing such an experiment is the high voltage and electrode system capable of providing an electric field of 75 kV/cm. This, in turn, requires an electric potential of 635 kV to be applied to the high voltage electrode, while simultaneously satisfying other experimental constraints, such as those on heat load and magnetic noise requirements. This paper describes the outcome of a comprehensive development program addressing these challenges. It outlines the system requirements, discusses new insights into relevant physical phenomena, and details selected technical solutions with their corresponding experimental demonstrations and expected performance. The results collectively demonstrate the successful development of the necessary technology for the high-voltage and electrode system for this approach.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, the memory footprint of key-value (KV) caches during inference has become a significant bottleneck. Existing approaches primarily focus on compressing KV caches within a single prompt or reusing shared prefixes or frequently ocurred text segments across prompts. However, such strategies are limited in scenarios where prompts are semantically similar but lexically different, which frequently occurs in tasks such as multi-document summarization and conversational agents. We propose \textit{SemShareKV}, a KV cache sharing and compression framework that accelerates LLM inference by reusing KVCache in semantically similar prompts. Instead of relying on exact token matches, SemShareKV applies fuzzy token matching using locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) on token embeddings and incorporates Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to better preserve positional information. By selectively reusing relevant key-value pairs from a reference prompt's cache, SemShareKV reduces redundant computation while maintaining output quality. Experiments on diverse summarization datasets show up to 6.25$\times$ speedup and 42\% lower GPU memory usage with 5k tokens input, with negligible quality degradation. These results highlight the potential of semantic-aware cache sharing for efficient LLM inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reusing KV cache is essential for high efficiency of Large Language Model (LLM) inference systems. With more LLM users, the KV cache footprint can easily exceed GPU memory capacity, so prior work has proposed to either evict KV cache to lower-tier storage devices, or compress KV cache so that more KV cache can be fit in the fast memory. However, prior work misses an important opportunity: jointly optimizing the eviction and compression decisions across all KV caches to minimize average generation latency without hurting quality.   We propose EVICPRESS, a KV-cache management system that applies lossy compression and adaptive eviction to KV cache across multiple storage tiers. Specifically, for each KV cache of a context, EVICPRESS considers the effect of compression and eviction of the KV cache on the average generation quality and delay across all contexts as a whole. To achieve this, EVICPRESS proposes a unified utility function that quantifies the effect of quality and delay of the lossy compression or eviction. To this end, EVICPRESS's profiling module periodically updates the utility function scores on all possible eviction-compression configurations for all contexts and places KV caches using a fast heuristic to rearrange KV caches on all storage tiers, with the goal of maximizing the utility function scores on each storage tier. Compared to the baselines that evict KV cache or compress KV cache, EVICPRESS achieves higher KV-cache hit rates on fast devices, i.e., lower delay, while preserving high generation quality by applying conservative compression to contexts that are sensitive to compression errors. Evaluation on 12 datasets and 5 models demonstrates that EVICPRESS achieves up to 2.19x faster time-to-first-token (TTFT) at equivalent generation quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current experiments seeking first-ever observation of Ultra-High Energy Neutrinos (UHEN) typically utilize radio frequency (RF) receiver antennas deployed in cold, radio-transparent polar ice, to measure the coherent RF signals resulting from neutrino interactions with ice molecules. Accurate calibration of the receiver response, sampling the full range of possible neutrino geometries, is necessary to estimate the energy and incoming direction of the incident neutrino. Herein, we detail the design and performance of a custom radio-frequency calibration transmitter, consisting of a battery-powered, kiloVolt-scale signal generator (`IDL' pulser) driving an antenna (South Pole UNiversity of Kansas antenna, or `SPUNK') capable of operating at pressures of 200 atmospheres. Performance was validated by lowering the transmitter into a borehole at the South Pole to a depth of 1740 m, yielding high Signal-to-Noise ratio signals at a distance of 5 km from the source.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The core challenge for streaming video generation is maintaining the content consistency in long context, which poses high requirement for the memory design. Most existing solutions maintain the memory by compressing historical frames with predefined strategies. However, different to-generate video chunks should refer to different historical cues, which is hard to satisfy with fixed strategies. In this work, we propose MemFlow to address this problem. Specifically, before generating the coming chunk, we dynamically update the memory bank by retrieving the most relevant historical frames with the text prompt of this chunk. This design enables narrative coherence even if new event happens or scenario switches in future frames. In addition, during generation, we only activate the most relevant tokens in the memory bank for each query in the attention layers, which effectively guarantees the generation efficiency. In this way, MemFlow achieves outstanding long-context consistency with negligible computation burden (7.9% speed reduction compared with the memory-free baseline) and keeps the compatibility with any streaming video generation model with KV cache.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multi-token generation has emerged as a promising paradigm for accelerating transformer-based large model inference. Recent efforts primarily explore diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) for parallel decoding to reduce inference latency. To achieve AR-level generation quality, many techniques adapt AR models into dLLMs to enable parallel decoding. However, they suffer from limited speedup compared to AR models due to a pretrain-to-posttrain mismatch. Specifically, the masked data distribution in post-training deviates significantly from the real-world data distribution seen during pretraining, and dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which conflicts with the causal prior learned during pretraining and hinders the integration of exact KV cache reuse. To address this, we introduce Jacobi Forcing, a progressive distillation paradigm where models are trained on their own generated parallel decoding trajectories, smoothly shifting AR models into efficient parallel decoders while preserving their pretrained causal inference property. The models trained under this paradigm, Jacobi Forcing Model, achieves 3.8x wall-clock speedup on coding and math benchmarks with minimal loss in performance. Based on Jacobi Forcing Models' trajectory characteristics, we introduce multi-block decoding with rejection recycling, which enables up to 4.5x higher token acceptance count per iteration and nearly 4.0x wall-clock speedup, effectively trading additional compute for lower inference latency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scaling language models to handle longer input sequences typically necessitates large key-value (KV) caches, resulting in substantial memory overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Tensor Product Attention (TPA), a novel attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions to represent queries, keys, and values compactly, substantially shrinking the KV cache size at inference time. By factorizing these representations into contextual low-rank components and seamlessly integrating with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), TPA achieves improved model quality alongside memory efficiency. Based on TPA, we introduce the Tensor ProducT ATTenTion Transformer (T6), a new model architecture for sequence modeling. Through extensive empirical evaluation on language modeling tasks, we demonstrate that T6 surpasses or matches the performance of standard Transformer baselines including Multi-Head Attention (MHA), Multi-Query Attention (MQA), Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), and Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) across various metrics, including perplexity and a range of established evaluation benchmarks. Notably, TPA's memory efficiency and computational efficiency at decoding stage enables processing longer sequences under fixed resource constraints, addressing a critical scalability challenge in modern language models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper proposes a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework based on the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm for hybrid underlay-overlay cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) networks with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)-energy harvesting (EH) and cooperative caching. Unlike prior hierarchical DRL approaches that focus primarily on spectrum access or power control, our work jointly optimizes EH, hybrid access coordination, power allocation, and caching in a unified framework. The joint optimization problem is formulated as a weighted-sum multi-objective task, designed to maximize throughput and cache hit ratio while simultaneously minimizing transmission delay. In the proposed model, CIoT agents jointly optimize EH and data transmission using a learnable time switching (TS) factor. They also coordinate spectrum access under hybrid overlay-underlay paradigms and make power control and cache placement decisions while considering energy, interference, and storage constraints. Specifically, in this work, cooperative caching is used to enable overlay access, while power control is used for underlay access. A novel three-level hierarchical SAC (H-SAC) agent decomposes the mixed discrete-continuous action space into modular subproblems, improving scalability and convergence over flat DRL methods. The high-level policy adjusts the TS factor, the mid-level policy manages spectrum access coordination and cache sharing, and the low-level policy decides transmit power and caching actions for both the CIoT agent and PU content. Simulation results show that the proposed hierarchical SAC approach significantly outperforms benchmark and greedy strategies. It achieves better performance in terms of average sum rate, delay, cache hit ratio, and energy efficiency, even under channel fading and uncertain conditions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce the Kimina Lean Server, an open-source project designed as a high-performance verifier for reinforcement learning pipelines. Built on top of the Lean REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) maintained by the Lean FRO, our server combines server-side parallelism by managing multiple Lean processes in parallel with a Least Recently Used (LRU) caching mechanism that reuses Lean imports across requests. On the client side, a lightweight Python package enables submitting proof batches and receiving Lean feedback, including extracted tactics and tactic states.   Together, these features enable a scalable workflow for large-scale verification and data extraction. In our experiments, the Kimina Lean Server outperforms previous Lean interaction tools, achieving a 1.5 to 2 times speedup in verification time. Moreover, its improved efficiency has enabled its use in the large-scale training of state-of-the-art models such as Kimina-Prover.   We hope that our open-source project will support the neural theorem proving community and accelerate future progress by enabling efficient large-scale verification and proof data extraction.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT and LLaMA, introduce unique memory access characteristics during inference due to frequent token sequence lookups and embedding vector retrievals. These workloads generate highly irregular and bursty access patterns, causing traditional prefetching and replacement policies to mispredict and trigger severe cache pollution, thereby degrading system performance. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an Adaptive Cache Pollution Control (ACPC) mechanism tailored for LLM inference workloads, integrating Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)-based access prediction with a priority-aware replacement strategy. The TCN module learns temporal dependencies in token access sequences to identify potential high-reuse cache lines, while the replacement policy dynamically adjusts eviction priorities based on predicted reuse likelihood and cache occupancy. The proposed framework is implemented and evaluated on representative transformer-based inference traces, including GPT-style autoregressive decoding and embedding retrieval workloads. Experimental results demonstrate that ACPC reduces cache pollution by 41.7 percent, improves cache hit rate by 8.9 percent, and achieves a 60.0 percent reduction in L2 miss penalty, compared with state-of-the-art machine-learning-based replacement baselines. Additionally, the proposed Temporal CNN-based ACPC framework increases token generation throughput by 15.9 percent and achieves the lowest final loss of 0.21, confirming its superior efficiency and stability under complex LLM inference workloads. These results highlight ACPC's effectiveness in recognizing useful cache lines and mitigating redundant prefetches under dynamic LLM access behaviors. The proposed approach provides a scalable, learning-driven solution for optimizing memory efficiency and latency in large-scale LLM serving and inference systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as intelligent agents. Their multi-stage workflows, which alternate between local computation and calls to external network services like Web APIs, introduce a mismatch in their execution pattern and the scheduling granularity of existing inference systems such as vLLM. Existing systems typically focus on per-segment optimization which prevents them from minimizing the end-to-end latency of the complete agentic workflow, i.e., the global Job Completion Time (JCT) over the entire request lifecycle. To address this limitation, we propose Astraea, a service engine designed to shift the optimization from local segments to the global request lifecycle. Astraea employs a state-aware, hierarchical scheduling algorithm that integrates a request's historical state with future predictions. It dynamically classifies requests by their I/O and compute intensive nature and uses an enhanced HRRN policy to balance efficiency and fairness. Astraea also implements an adaptive KV cache manager that intelligently handles the agent state during I/O waits based on the system memory pressure. Extensive experiments show that Astraea reduces average JCT by up to 25.5\% compared to baseline methods. Moreover, our approach demonstrates strong robustness and stability under high load across various model scales.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LLM serving is increasingly dominated by decode attention, which is a memory-bound operation due to massive KV cache loading from global memory. Meanwhile, real-world workloads exhibit substantial, hierarchical shared prefixes across requests (e.g., system prompts, tools/templates, RAG). Existing attention implementations fail to fully exploit prefix sharing: one-query-per-CTA execution repeatedly loads shared prefix KV cache, while one-size-fits-all tiling leaves on-chip resources idle and exacerbates bubbles for uneven KV lengths. These choices amplify memory bandwidth pressure and stall memory-bound decode attention.   This paper introduces PAT, a prefix-aware attention kernel implementation for LLM decoding that organizes execution with a pack-forward-merge paradigm. PAT packs queries by shared prefix to reduce repeated memory accesses, runs a customized multi-tile kernel to achieve high resource efficiency. It further applies practical multi-stream forwarding and KV splitting to reduce resource bubbles. The final merge performs online softmax with negligible overhead. We implement PAT as an off-the-shelf plugin for vLLM. Evaluation on both real-world and synthetic workloads shows that PAT reduces attention latency by 53.5% on average and TPOT by 17.0-93.1% under the same configurations against state-of-the-art attention kernels. PAT's source code is publicly available at https://github.com/flashserve/PAT.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for high-quality image generation, yet their computational expense remains substantial due to iterative denoising. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) significantly enhances generation quality and controllability but doubles the computation by requiring both conditional and unconditional forward passes at every timestep. We present OUSAC (Optimized gUidance Scheduling with Adaptive Caching), a framework that accelerates diffusion transformers (DiT) through systematic optimization. Our key insight is that variable guidance scales enable sparse computation: adjusting scales at certain timesteps can compensate for skipping CFG at others, enabling both fewer total sampling steps and fewer CFG steps while maintaining quality. However, variable guidance patterns introduce denoising deviations that undermine standard caching methods, which assume constant CFG scales across steps. Moreover, different transformer blocks are affected at different levels under dynamic conditions. This paper develops a two-stage approach leveraging these insights. Stage-1 employs evolutionary algorithms to jointly optimize which timesteps to skip and what guidance scale to use, eliminating up to 82% of unconditional passes. Stage-2 introduces adaptive rank allocation that tailors calibration efforts per transformer block, maintaining caching effectiveness under variable guidance. Experiments demonstrate that OUSAC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art acceleration methods, achieving 53% computational savings with 15% quality improvement on DiT-XL/2 (ImageNet 512x512), 60% savings with 16.1% improvement on PixArt-alpha (MSCOCO), and 5x speedup on FLUX while improving CLIP Score over the 50-step baseline.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed with rapidly expanding context windows to support increasingly demanding applications. However, long contexts pose significant deployment challenges, primarily due to the KV cache whose size grows proportionally with context length. While KV cache compression methods are proposed to address this issue, KV dropping methods incur considerable accuracy loss, and KV retrieval methods suffer from significant efficiency bottlenecks. We propose FreeKV, an algorithm-system co-optimization framework to enhance KV retrieval efficiency while preserving accuracy. On the algorithm side, FreeKV introduces speculative retrieval to shift the KV selection and recall processes out of the critical path, combined with fine-grained correction to ensure accuracy. On the system side, FreeKV employs hybrid KV layouts across CPU and GPU memory to eliminate fragmented data transfers, and leverages double-buffered streamed recall to further improve efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that FreeKV achieves near-lossless accuracy across various scenarios and models, delivering up to 13$\times$ speedup compared to SOTA KV retrieval methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have emerged as the de facto architecture for scaling up language models without significantly increasing the computational cost. Recent MoE models demonstrate a clear trend towards high expert granularity (smaller expert intermediate dimension) and higher sparsity (constant number of activated experts with higher number of total experts), which improve model quality per FLOP. However, fine-grained MoEs suffer from increased activation memory footprint and reduced hardware efficiency due to higher IO costs, while sparser MoEs suffer from wasted computations due to padding in Grouped GEMM kernels. In response, we propose a memory-efficient algorithm to compute the forward and backward passes of MoEs with minimal activation caching for the backward pass. We also design GPU kernels that overlap memory IO with computation benefiting all MoE architectures. Finally, we propose a novel "token rounding" method that minimizes the wasted compute due to padding in Grouped GEMM kernels. As a result, our method SonicMoE reduces activation memory by 45% and achieves a 1.86x compute throughput improvement on Hopper GPUs compared to ScatterMoE's BF16 MoE kernel for a fine-grained 7B MoE. Concretely, SonicMoE on 64 H100s achieves a training throughput of 213 billion tokens per day comparable to ScatterMoE's 225 billion tokens per day on 96 H100s for a 7B MoE model training with FSDP-2 using the lm-engine codebase. Under high MoE sparsity settings, our tile-aware token rounding algorithm yields an additional 1.16x speedup on kernel execution time compared to vanilla top-$K$ routing while maintaining similar downstream performance. We open-source all our kernels to enable faster MoE model training.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion language models (dLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm that enables parallel, non-autoregressive generation, but their learning efficiency lags behind that of autoregressive (AR) language models when trained from scratch. To this end, we study AR-to-dLM conversion to transform pretrained AR models into efficient dLMs that excel in speed while preserving AR models' task accuracy. We achieve this by identifying limitations in the attention patterns and objectives of existing AR-to-dLM methods and then proposing principles and methodologies for more effective AR-to-dLM conversion. Specifically, we first systematically compare different attention patterns and find that maintaining pretrained AR weight distributions is critical for effective AR-to-dLM conversion. As such, we introduce a continuous pretraining scheme with a block-wise attention pattern, which remains causal across blocks while enabling bidirectional modeling within each block. We find that this approach can better preserve pretrained AR models' weight distributions than fully bidirectional modeling, in addition to its known benefit of enabling KV caching, and leads to a win-win in accuracy and efficiency. Second, to mitigate the training-test gap in mask token distributions (uniform vs. highly left-to-right), we propose a position-dependent token masking strategy that assigns higher masking probabilities to later tokens during training to better mimic test-time behavior. Leveraging this framework, we conduct extensive studies of dLMs' attention patterns, training dynamics, and other design choices, providing actionable insights into scalable AR-to-dLM conversion. These studies lead to the Efficient-DLM family, which outperforms state-of-the-art AR models and dLMs, e.g., our Efficient-DLM 8B achieves +5.4%/+2.7% higher accuracy with 4.5x/2.7x higher throughput compared to Dream 7B and Qwen3 4B, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) networks, efficient spectrum sharing is essential to address increasing wireless demands. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for joint cooperative caching and spectrum access coordination in CIoT networks, enabling the CIoT agents to collaborate with primary users (PUs) by caching PU content and serving their requests, fostering mutual benefits. The proposed DRL framework jointly optimizes caching policy and spectrum access under challenging conditions. Unlike traditional cognitive radio (CR) methods, where CIoT agents vacate the spectrum for PUs, or relaying techniques, which merely support spectrum sharing, caching brings data closer to the edge, reducing latency by minimizing retrieval distance. Simulations demonstrate that our approach outperforms others in lowering latency, increasing CIoT and PU cache hit rates, and enhancing network throughput. This approach redefines spectrum sharing, offering a fresh perspective on CIoT network design and illustrating the potential of DRL-guided caching to highlight the benefits of collaboration over dynamic spectrum access scenarios, elevating CIoT performance under constrained resources.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work introduces a hypergraph formulation that generalizes the classical paradigm of Bar-Yossef et al. to the multi-sender index coding (MSIC) setting. Central to the model is a 4-regular side-information hypergraph G, a new adjacency representation A_G = [A_1 ... A_N], and a simple fitting criterion for sub-hypergraph validity, in the presence of specially designed hyperedges that capture both side information and cross-sender signal cancellation. This formulation establishes a tight achievability-converse equivalence for the general N-sender, K-receiver problem: every valid fitting induces a valid linear multi-sender index code, every linear code induces a valid fitting, and the optimal scalar linear broadcast length equals the hyper-minrank l**lin(G) = hyperminrank(G) = min*{A fits G} sum_{n=1}^N rank(A_n). Beyond this exact characterization, the approach yields hypergraph analogues of Haemers-type bounds on the broadcast length, including a clique-cover upper bound and a lower bound via the clique number of a carefully defined complement hypergraph. Algorithmically, we provide an exact procedure to compute hyperminrank(G), and show that in certain regimes its complexity is asymptotically better than approximate LT-CMAR solutions. The framework captures well-known settings such as embedded index coding, and applies directly to multi-sender cache-aided communications, coded computation, distributed storage, and edge/satellite systems, where hyperminrank can serve as a unified design target.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Autoregressive models (ARMs) are hindered by slow sequential inference. While masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a parallel alternative, they suffer from critical drawbacks: high computational overhead from precluding Key-Value (KV) caching, and incoherent generation arising from learning dependencies over an intractable space of token combinations. To address these limitations, we introduce ReFusion, a novel masked diffusion model that achieves superior performance and efficiency by elevating parallel decoding from the token level to a higher slot level, where each slot is a fixed-length, contiguous sub-sequence. This is achieved through an iterative ``plan-and-infill'' decoding process: a diffusion-based planning step first identifies a set of weakly dependent slots, and an autoregressive infilling step then decodes these selected slots in parallel. The slot-based design simultaneously unlocks full KV cache reuse with a unified causal framework and reduces the learning complexity from the token combination space to a manageable slot-level permutation space. Extensive experiments on seven diverse benchmarks show that ReFusion not only overwhelmingly surpasses prior MDMs with 34% performance gains and an over 18$\times$ speedup on average, but also bridges the performance gap to strong ARMs while maintaining a 2.33$\times$ average speedup.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, they often struggle with long-text sequences due to the ``lost in the middle'' phenomenon. This issue has been shown to arise from a U-shaped attention bias, where attention is disproportionately focused on the beginning and end of a text, leaving the middle section underrepresented. While previous studies have attributed this bias to position encoding, our research first identifies an additional factor: initial saliency. It means that in the attention computation for each token, tokens with higher attention weights relative to the initial token tend to receive more attention in the prediction of the next token. We further find that utilizing this property by scaling attention weight between the initial token and others improves the model's ability to process long contexts, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.6\% in MDQA dataset. Moreover, combining this approach with existing methods to reduce position encoding bias further enhances performance, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.4\% in KV-Retrieval tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion models exhibit remarkable generative ability, yet achieving smooth and semantically consistent image morphing remains a challenge. Existing approaches often yield abrupt transitions or over-saturated appearances due to the lack of adaptive structural and semantic alignments. We propose CHIMERA, a zero-shot diffusion-based framework that formulates morphing as a cached inversion-guided denoising process. To handle large semantic and appearance disparities, we propose Adaptive Cache Injection and Semantic Anchor Prompting. Adaptive Cache Injection (ACI) caches down, mid, and up blocks features from both inputs during DDIM inversion and re-injects them adaptively during denoising, enabling spatial and semantic alignment in depth- and time-adaptive manners and enabling natural feature fusion and smooth transitions. Semantic Anchor Prompting (SAP) leverages a vision-language model to generate a shared anchor prompt that serves as a semantic anchor, bridging dissimilar inputs and guiding the denoising process toward coherent results. Finally, we introduce the Global-Local Consistency Score (GLCS), a morphing-oriented metric that simultaneously evaluates the global harmonization of the two inputs and the smoothness of the local morphing transition. Extensive experiments and user studies show that CHIMERA achieves smoother and more semantically aligned transitions than existing methods, establishing a new state of the art in image morphing. The code and project page will be publicly released.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Instructional video generation is an emerging task that aims to synthesize coherent demonstrations of procedural activities from textual descriptions. Such capability has broad implications for content creation, education, and human-AI interaction, yet existing video diffusion models struggle to maintain temporal consistency and controllability across long sequences of multiple action steps. We introduce a pipeline for future-driven streaming instructional video generation, dubbed SneakPeek, a diffusion-based autoregressive framework designed to generate precise, stepwise instructional videos conditioned on an initial image and structured textual prompts. Our approach introduces three key innovations to enhance consistency and controllability: (1) predictive causal adaptation, where a causal model learns to perform next-frame prediction and anticipate future keyframes; (2) future-guided self-forcing with a dual-region KV caching scheme to address the exposure bias issue at inference time; (3) multi-prompt conditioning, which provides fine-grained and procedural control over multi-step instructions. Together, these components mitigate temporal drift, preserve motion consistency, and enable interactive video generation where future prompt updates dynamically influence ongoing streaming video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces temporally coherent and semantically faithful instructional videos that accurately follow complex, multi-step task descriptions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> MoE models offer efficient scaling through conditional computation, but their large parameter size and expensive expert offloading make on-device deployment challenging. Existing acceleration techniques such as prefetching or expert clustering often increase energy usage or reduce expert diversity. We present SliceMoE, an energy-efficient MoE inference framework for miss-rate-constrained deployment. SliceMoE introduces Dynamic Bit-Sliced Caching (DBSC), which caches experts at slice-level granularity and assigns precision on demand to expand effective expert capacity. To support mixed-precision experts without memory duplication, we propose Calibration-Free Asymmetric Matryoshka Quantization (AMAT), a truncation-based scheme that maintains compatibility between low-bit and high-bit slices. We further introduce Predictive Cache Warmup (PCW) to reduce early-decode cold misses by reshaping cache contents during prefill. Evaluated on DeepSeek-V2-Lite and Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, SliceMoE reduces decode-stage energy consumption by up to 2.37x and 2.85x, respectively, and improves decode latency by up to 1.81x and 1.64x, while preserving near-high-bit accuracy. These results demonstrate that slice-level caching enables an efficient on-device MoE deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Autoregressive video diffusion models (AR-VDMs) show strong promise as scalable alternatives to bidirectional VDMs, enabling real-time and interactive applications. Yet there remains room for improvement in their sample fidelity. A promising solution is inference-time alignment, which optimizes the noise space to improve sample fidelity without updating model parameters. Yet, optimization- or search-based methods are computationally impractical for AR-VDMs. Recent text-to-image (T2I) works address this via feedforward noise refiners that modulate sampled noises in a single forward pass. Can such noise refiners be extended to AR-VDMs? We identify the failure of naively extending T2I noise refiners to AR-VDMs and propose AutoRefiner-a noise refiner tailored for AR-VDMs, with two key designs: pathwise noise refinement and a reflective KV-cache. Experiments demonstrate that AutoRefiner serves as an efficient plug-in for AR-VDMs, effectively enhancing sample fidelity by refining noise along stochastic denoising paths.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for style transfer, yet they struggle with photo-realistic transfers, often producing painting-like results or missing detailed stylistic elements. Current methods inadequately address unwanted influence from original content styles and style reference content features. We introduce SCAdapter, a novel technique leveraging CLIP image space to effectively separate and integrate content and style features. Our key innovation systematically extracts pure content from content images and style elements from style references, ensuring authentic transfers. This approach is enhanced through three components: Controllable Style Adaptive Instance Normalization (CSAdaIN) for precise multi-style blending, KVS Injection for targeted style integration, and a style transfer consistency objective maintaining process coherence. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate SCAdapter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both conventional and diffusion-based baselines. By eliminating DDIM inversion and inference-stage optimization, our method achieves at least $2\times$ faster inference than other diffusion-based approaches, making it both more effective and efficient for practical applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Rollout-training disaggregation is emerging as the standard architecture for Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training, where memory-bound rollout and compute-bound training are physically disaggregated onto purpose-built clusters to maximize hardware efficiency. However, the strict synchronization required by on-policy algorithms introduces severe dependency bubbles, forcing one cluster to idle while the dependent phase is running on the other. We present RollMux, a cluster scheduling framework that reclaims these bubbles through cross-cluster orchestration. RollMux is built on the insight that the structural idleness of one job can be effectively utilized by the active phase of another. To realize this, we introduce the co-execution group abstraction, which partitions the cluster into isolated locality domains. This abstraction enables a two-tier scheduling architecture: an inter-group scheduler that optimizes job placement using conservative stochastic planning, and an intra-group scheduler that orchestrates a provably optimal round-robin schedule. The group abstraction also imposes a residency constraint, ensuring that massive model states remain cached in host memory to enable "warm-star" context switching. We evaluate RollMux on a production-scale testbed with 328 H20 and 328 H800 GPUs. RollMux improves cost efficiency by 1.84x over standard disaggregation and 1.38x over state-of-the-art co-located baselines, all while achieving 100% SLO attainment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable success in generative tasks (e.g., image and video generation), and the demand for high-quality content (e.g., 2K/4K videos) is rapidly increasing across various domains. However, generating ultra-high-resolution videos on existing standard-resolution (e.g., 720p) platforms remains challenging due to the excessive re-training requirements and prohibitively high computational and memory costs. To this end, we introduce SUPERGEN, an efficient tile-based framework for ultra-high-resolution video generation. SUPERGEN features a novel training-free algorithmic innovation with tiling to successfully support a wide range of resolutions without additional training efforts while significantly reducing both memory footprint and computational complexity. Moreover, SUPERGEN incorporates a tile-tailored, adaptive, region-aware caching strategy that accelerates video generation by exploiting redundancy across denoising steps and spatial regions. SUPERGEN also integrates cache-guided, communication-minimized tile parallelism for enhanced throughput and minimized latency. Evaluations show that SUPERGEN maximizes performance gains while achieving high output quality across various benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Economic decision-making depends not only on structured signals such as prices and taxes, but also on unstructured language, including peer dialogue and media narratives. While multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise in optimizing economic decisions, it struggles with the semantic ambiguity and contextual richness of language. We propose LAMP (Language-Augmented Multi-Agent Policy), a framework that integrates language into economic decision-making and narrows the gap to real-world settings. LAMP follows a Think-Speak-Decide pipeline: (1) Think interprets numerical observations to extract short-term shocks and long-term trends, caching high-value reasoning trajectories; (2) Speak crafts and exchanges strategic messages based on reasoning, updating beliefs by parsing peer communications; and (3) Decide fuses numerical data, reasoning, and reflections into a MARL policy to optimize language-augmented decision-making. Experiments in economic simulation show that LAMP outperforms both MARL and LLM-only baselines in cumulative return (+63.5%, +34.0%), robustness (+18.8%, +59.4%), and interpretability. These results demonstrate the potential of language-augmented policies to deliver more effective and robust economic strategies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generative reasoning with large language models (LLMs) often involves long decoding sequences, leading to substantial memory and latency overheads from accumulating key-value (KV) caches. While existing KV compression methods primarily focus on reducing prefill memory from long input sequences, they fall short in addressing the dynamic and layer-sensitive nature of long-form generation, which is central to reasoning tasks. We propose Lethe, a dynamic KV cache management framework that introduces adaptivity along both the spatial and temporal dimensions of decoding. Along the spatial dimension, Lethe performs layerwise sparsity-aware allocation, assigning token pruning budgets to each transformer layer based on estimated attention redundancy. Along the temporal dimension, Lethe conducts multi-round token pruning during generation, driven by a Recency-Aware Selective Retention} (RASR) mechanism. RASR extends traditional recency-based heuristics by also considering token relevance derived from evolving attention patterns, enabling informed decisions about which tokens to retain or evict. Empirical results demonstrate that Lethe achieves a favorable balance between efficiency and generation quality across diverse models and tasks, increases throughput by up to 2.56x.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We examine the use of different randomisation policies for stochastic gradient algorithms used in sampling, based on first-order (or overdamped) Langevin dynamics, the most popular of which is known as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics. Conventionally, this algorithm is combined with a specific stochastic gradient strategy, called Robbins-Monro. In this work, we study an alternative strategy, Random Reshuffling, and show convincingly that it leads to improved performance via: a) a proof of reduced bias in the Wasserstein metric for strongly convex, gradient Lipschitz potentials; b) an analytical demonstration of reduced bias for a Gaussian model problem; and c) an empirical demonstration of reduced bias in numerical experiments for some logistic regression problems. This is especially important since Random Reshuffling is typically more efficient due to memory access and cache reasons. Such acceleration for the Random Reshuffling policy is familiar from the optimisation literature on stochastic gradient descent.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion models achieve remarkable generative quality, but computational overhead scales with step count, model depth, and sequence length. Feature caching is effective since adjacent timesteps yield highly similar features. However, an inherent trade-off remains: aggressive timestep reuse offers large speedups but can easily cross the critical line, hurting fidelity, while block- or token-level reuse is safer but yields limited computational savings. We present X-Slim (eXtreme-Slimming Caching), a training-free, cache-based accelerator that, to our knowledge, is the first unified framework to exploit cacheable redundancy across timesteps, structure (blocks), and space (tokens). Rather than simply mixing levels, X-Slim introduces a dual-threshold controller that turns caching into a push-then-polish process: it first pushes reuse at the timestep level up to an early-warning line, then switches to lightweight block- and token-level refresh to polish the remaining redundancy, and triggers full inference once the critical line is crossed to reset accumulated error. At each level, context-aware indicators decide when and where to cache. Across diverse tasks, X-Slim advances the speed-quality frontier. On FLUX.1-dev and HunyuanVideo, it reduces latency by up to 4.97x and 3.52x with minimal perceptual loss. On DiT-XL/2, it reaches 3.13x acceleration and improves FID by 2.42 over prior methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This research introduces a transformative framework for integrating Vision-Enhanced Large Language Models (LLMs) with advanced transformer-based architectures to tackle challenges in high-resolution image synthesis and multimodal data interpretation. The proposed model incorporates a rectified flow mechanism that connects noise and data with linear paths, enabling efficient and high-quality generation. A bidirectional tokenization strategy is employed to seamlessly merge inputs from text, image, and video modalities, fostering a unified understanding across diverse data types. By embedding spatial-temporal features and leveraging a hybrid text-image sequence modeling approach, the framework achieves unparalleled fidelity in synthesized images and coherent multimodal representations. The architecture is optimized with a noise-aware learning algorithm, addressing discrepancies in noisy data distributions and improving generative performance under varying input conditions. Rigorous evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate a 25% increase in image resolution clarity and a 20% reduction in computational requirements compared to diffusion-based methods. Furthermore, the model exhibits robust scalability and adaptability, showcasing its potential in applications like autonomous systems, creative content generation, and advanced video analysis. This work underscores the role of vision-centric LLMs in redefining capabilities in computer vision and multimodal artificial intelligence.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Model (LLM) inference is typically memory-intensive, especially when processing large batch sizes and long sequences, due to the large size of key-value (KV) cache. Vector Quantization (VQ) is recently adopted to alleviate this issue, but we find that the existing approach is susceptible to distribution shift due to its reliance on calibration datasets. To address this limitation, we introduce NSNQuant, a calibration-free Vector Quantization (VQ) technique designed for low-bit compression of the KV cache. By applying a three-step transformation-1) a token-wise normalization (Normalize), 2) a channel-wise centering (Shift), and 3) a second token-wise normalization (Normalize)-with Hadamard transform, NSNQuant effectively aligns the token distribution with the standard normal distribution. This alignment enables robust, calibration-free vector quantization using a single reusable codebook. Extensive experiments show that NSNQuant consistently outperforms prior methods in both 1-bit and 2-bit settings, offering strong generalization and up to 3$\times$ throughput gain over full-precision baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Few-shot image classification remains difficult under limited supervision and visual domain shift. Recent cache-based adaptation approaches (e.g., Tip-Adapter) address this challenge to some extent by learning lightweight residual adapters over frozen features, yet they still inherit CLIP's tendency to encode global, general-purpose representations that are not optimally discriminative to adapt the generalist to the specialist's domain in low-data regimes. We address this limitation with a novel patch-driven relational refinement that learns cache adapter weights from intra-image patch dependencies rather than treating an image embedding as a monolithic vector. Specifically, we introduce a relational gated graph attention network that constructs a patch graph and performs edge-aware attention to emphasize informative inter-patch interactions, producing context-enriched patch embeddings. A learnable multi-aggregation pooling then composes these into compact, task-discriminative representations that better align cache keys with the target few-shot classes. Crucially, the proposed graph refinement is used only during training to distil relational structure into the cache, incurring no additional inference cost beyond standard cache lookup. Final predictions are obtained by a residual fusion of cache similarity scores with CLIP zero-shot logits. Extensive evaluations on 11 benchmarks show consistent gains over state-of-the-art CLIP adapter and cache-based baselines while preserving zero-shot efficiency. We further validate battlefield relevance by introducing an Injured vs. Uninjured Soldier dataset for casualty recognition. It is motivated by the operational need to support triage decisions within the "platinum minutes" and the broader "golden hour" window in time-critical UAV-driven search-and-rescue and combat casualty care.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Streaming video large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for real-time multimodal tasks such as video captioning, question answering, conversational agents, and augmented reality. However, these models face fundamental memory and computational challenges because their key-value (KV) caches grow substantially with continuous streaming video input. This process requires an iterative prefill stage, which is a unique feature of streaming video LLMs. Due to its iterative prefill stage, it suffers from significant limitations, including extensive computation, substantial data transfer, and degradation in accuracy. Crucially, this issue is exacerbated for edge deployment, which is the primary target for these models.   In this work, we propose V-Rex, the first software-hardware co-designed accelerator that comprehensively addresses both algorithmic and hardware bottlenecks in streaming video LLM inference. At its core, V-Rex introduces ReSV, a training-free dynamic KV cache retrieval algorithm. ReSV exploits temporal and spatial similarity-based token clustering to reduce excessive KV cache memory across video frames. To fully realize these algorithmic benefits, V-Rex offers a compact, low-latency hardware accelerator with a dynamic KV cache retrieval engine (DRE), featuring bit-level and early-exit based computing units. V-Rex achieves unprecedented real-time of 3.9-8.3 FPS and energy-efficient streaming video LLM inference on edge deployment with negligible accuracy loss. While DRE only accounts for 2.2% power and 2.0% area, the system delivers 1.9-19.7x speedup and 3.1-18.5x energy efficiency improvements over AGX Orin GPU. This work is the first to comprehensively tackle KV cache retrieval across algorithms and hardware, enabling real-time streaming video LLM inference on resource-constrained edge devices.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) for car-like robots, addressed by algorithms such as Conflict-Based Search with Continuous Time (CL-CBS), faces significant computational challenges due to expensive kinematic heuristic calculations. Traditional heuristic caching assumes that the heuristic function depends only on the state, which is incorrect in CBS where constraints from conflict resolution make the search space context-dependent. We propose \textbf{CAR-CHASE} (Car-Like Robot Conflict-Aware Heuristic Adaptive Search Enhancement), a novel approach that combines \textbf{conflict-aware heuristic caching} -- which caches heuristic values based on both state and relevant constraint context -- with an \textbf{adaptive hybrid heuristic} that intelligently switches between fast approximate and exact computations. Our key innovations are (1) a compact \emph{conflict fingerprint} that efficiently encodes which constraints affect a state's heuristic, (2) a relevance filter using spatial, temporal, and geometric criteria, and (3) an adaptive switching strategy with theoretical quality bounds. Experimental evaluation on 480 benchmark instances with varying agent counts (10 to 30) and obstacle densities (0\% and 50\%) demonstrates a geometric mean speedup of 2.46$\times$ over the baseline CL-CBS implementation while maintaining solution optimality. The optimizations improve success rate from 77.9\% to 84.8\% (+6.9 percentage points), reduce total runtime by 70.1\%, and enable solving 33 additional instances that previously timed out. Performance gains scale with problem complexity, reaching up to 4.06$\times$ speedup for challenging 30-agent obstacle scenarios. Our techniques are general and applicable to other CBS variants.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a foundational programming model for high-performance computing. MPI libraries traditionally employ network interconnects (e.g., Ethernet and InfiniBand) and network protocols (e.g., TCP and RoCE) with complex software stacks for cross-node communication. We present cMPI, the first work to optimize MPI point-to-point communication (both one-sided and two-sided) using CXL memory sharing on a real CXL platform, transforming cross-node communication into memory transactions and data copies within CXL memory, bypassing traditional network protocols. We analyze performance across various interconnects and find that CXL memory sharing achieves 7.2x-8.1x lower latency than TCP-based interconnects deployed in small- and medium-scale clusters. We address challenges of CXL memory sharing for MPI communication, including data object management over the dax representation [50], cache coherence, and atomic operations. Overall, cMPI outperforms TCP over standard Ethernet NIC and high-end SmartNIC by up to 49x and 72x in latency and bandwidth, respectively, for small messages.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Performance prediction for OpenMP workloads on heterogeneous embedded SoCs is challenging due to complex interactions between task DAG structure, control-flow irregularity, cache   and branch behavior, and thermal dynamics; classical heuristics struggle under workload irregularity, tabular regressors discard structural information, and model-free RL risks   overheating resource-constrained devices. We introduce GraphPerf-RT, the first surrogate that unifies task DAG topology, CFG-derived code semantics, and runtime context (per-core   DVFS, thermal state, utilization) in a heterogeneous graph representation with typed edges encoding precedence, placement, and contention. Multi-task evidential heads predict   makespan, energy, cache and branch misses, and utilization with calibrated uncertainty (Normal-Inverse-Gamma), enabling risk-aware scheduling that filters low-confidence rollouts.   We validate GraphPerf-RT on three embedded ARM platforms (Jetson TX2, Jetson Orin NX, RUBIK Pi), achieving R^2 > 0.95 with well-calibrated uncertainty (ECE < 0.05). To   demonstrate end-to-end scheduling utility, we integrate the surrogate with four RL methods on Jetson TX2: single-agent model-free (SAMFRL), single-agent model-based (SAMBRL),   multi-agent model-free (MAMFRL-D3QN), and multi-agent model-based (MAMBRL-D3QN). Experiments across 5 seeds (200 episodes each) show that MAMBRL-D3QN with GraphPerf-RT as the   world model achieves 66% makespan reduction (0.97 +/- 0.35s) and 82% energy reduction (0.006 +/- 0.005J) compared to model-free baselines, demonstrating that accurate,   uncertainty-aware surrogates enable effective model-based planning on thermally constrained embedded systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown promising accuracy improvements on complex problem-solving tasks. While these models have attained high accuracy by leveraging additional computation at test time, they need to generate long chain-of-thought reasoning in order to think before answering, which requires generating thousands of tokens. While sparse attention methods can help reduce the KV cache pressure induced by this long autoregressive reasoning, these methods can introduce errors which disrupt the reasoning process. Additionally, prior methods often pre-process the input to make it easier to identify the important prompt tokens when computing attention during generation, and this pre-processing is challenging to perform online for newly generated reasoning tokens. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing Multipole Attention, which accelerates autoregressive reasoning by only computing exact attention for the most important tokens, while maintaining approximate representations for the remaining tokens. Our method first performs clustering to group together semantically similar key vectors, and then uses the cluster centroids both to identify important key vectors and to approximate the remaining key vectors in order to retain high accuracy. We design a fast cluster update process to quickly re-cluster the input and previously generated tokens, thereby allowing for accelerating attention to the previous output tokens. We evaluate our method using emerging LRMs such as Qwen-8B, demonstrating that our approach can maintain accuracy on complex reasoning tasks even with aggressive attention sparsity settings. We also provide kernel implementations to demonstrate the practical efficiency gains from our method, achieving up to 4.5$\times$ speedup for attention in long-context reasoning applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on long-context tasks, but are often bottlenecked by memory constraints. Namely, the KV cache, which is used to significantly speed up attention computations, grows linearly with context length. A suite of compression algorithms has been introduced to alleviate cache growth by evicting unimportant tokens. However, several popular strategies are targeted towards the prefill phase, i.e., processing long prompt context, and their performance is rarely assessed on reasoning tasks requiring long decoding. In particular, short but complex prompts, such as those in benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH500, often benefit from multi-step reasoning and self-reflection, resulting in thinking sequences thousands of tokens long. In this work, we benchmark the performance of several popular compression strategies on long-reasoning tasks. For the non-reasoning Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, we determine that no singular strategy fits all, and that performance is heavily influenced by dataset type. However, we discover that H2O and our decoding-enabled variant of SnapKV are dominant strategies for reasoning models, indicating the utility of heavy-hitter tracking for reasoning traces. We also find that eviction strategies at low budgets can produce longer reasoning traces, revealing a tradeoff between cache size and inference costs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-language-action (VLA) models enable impressive zero shot manipulation, but their inference stacks are often too heavy for responsive web demos or high frequency robot control on commodity GPUs. We present BLURR, a lightweight inference wrapper that can be plugged into existing VLA controllers without retraining or changing model checkpoints. Instantiated on the pi-zero VLA controller, BLURR keeps the original observation interfaces and accelerates control by combining an instruction prefix key value cache, mixed precision execution, and a single step rollout schedule that reduces per step computation. In our SimplerEnv based evaluation, BLURR maintains task success rates comparable to the original controller while significantly lowering effective FLOPs and wall clock latency. We also build an interactive web demo that allows users to switch between controllers and toggle inference options in real time while watching manipulation episodes. This highlights BLURR as a practical approach for deploying modern VLA policies under tight compute budgets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Aggressively quantized large language models (LLMs), such as BitNet-style 1.58-bit Transformers with ternary weights, make it feasible to deploy generative AI on low-power edge FPGAs. However, as prompts grow to tens of thousands of tokens, edge hardware performance drops sharply with sequence length due to quadratic prefill cost and rapidly increasing KV-cache bandwidth demands, making inference latency of longer context length a first-order system concern. Recent studies on LLMs expose a fundamental prefill-decode asymmetry: prefill is compute-bound and dominated by dense matrix-matrix operations, whereas decoding is memory-bandwidth-bound and dominated by KV-cache traffic. A static accelerator must provision resources and a single dataflow for both regimes, leading to duplicated attention logic, underutilized fabric, and tight LUT/URAM limits that cap model size and usable context. We propose a prefill--decode disaggregated LLM accelerator, PD-Swap, that uses Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) to time-multiplex the attention module on edge FPGAs. The core table-lookup ternary matrix multiplication and weight-buffering engines remain static, while the attention subsystem is a reconfigurable partition with two phase-specialized architectures: a compute-heavy, token-parallel prefill engine and a bandwidth-optimized, KV-cache-centric decoding engine. A roofline-inspired model and design space exploration jointly optimize reconfigurable-region size, parallelism under reconfiguration and routability constraints, and reconfiguration latency is hidden by computation latency. PD-Swap achieves up to 27~tokens/s decoding throughput, outperforming prior state-of-the-art works by 1.3x--2.1x (larger gains at longer context lengths), without extra area cost.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recommendation system delivers substantial economic benefits by providing personalized predictions. Generative recommendation (GR) integrates LLMs to enhance the understanding of long user-item sequences. Despite employing attention-based architectures, GR's workload differs markedly from that of LLM serving. GR typically processes long prompt while producing short, fixed-length outputs, yet the computational cost of each decode phase is especially high due to the large beam width. In addition, since the beam search involves a vast item space, the sorting overhead becomes particularly time-consuming. We propose xGR, a GR-oriented serving system that meets strict low-latency requirements under highconcurrency scenarios. First, xGR unifies the processing of prefill and decode phases through staged computation and separated KV cache. Second, xGR enables early sorting termination and mask-based item filtering with data structure reuse. Third, xGR reconstructs the overall pipeline to exploit multilevel overlap and multi-stream parallelism. Our experiments with real-world recommendation service datasets demonstrate that xGR achieves at least 3.49x throughput compared to the state-of-the-art baseline under strict latency constraints.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce Skeleton-Cache, the first training-free test-time adaptation framework for skeleton-based zero-shot action recognition (SZAR), aimed at improving model generalization to unseen actions during inference. Skeleton-Cache reformulates inference as a lightweight retrieval process over a non-parametric cache that stores structured skeleton representations, combining both global and fine-grained local descriptors. To guide the fusion of descriptor-wise predictions, we leverage the semantic reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to assign class-specific importance weights. By integrating these structured descriptors with LLM-guided semantic priors, Skeleton-Cache dynamically adapts to unseen actions without any additional training or access to training data. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60/120 and PKU-MMD II demonstrate that Skeleton-Cache consistently boosts the performance of various SZAR backbones under both zero-shot and generalized zero-shot settings. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Alchemist0754/Skeleton-Cache.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are critical for preventing DNS spoofing, yet its specifications contain ambiguities and vulnerabilities that elude traditional "break-and-fix" approaches. A holistic, foundational security analysis of the protocol has thus remained an open problem. This paper introduces DNSSECVerif, the first framework for comprehensive, automated formal security analysis of the DNSSEC protocol suite. Built on the SAPIC+ symbolic verifier, our high-fidelity model captures protocol-level interactions, including cryptographic operations and stateful caching with fine-grained concurrency control. Using DNSSECVerif, we formally prove four of DNSSEC's core security guarantees and uncover critical ambiguities in the standards--notably, the insecure coexistence of NSEC and NSEC3. Our model also automatically rediscovers three classes of known attacks, demonstrating fundamental weaknesses in the protocol design. To bridge the model-to-reality gap, we validate our findings through targeted testing of mainstream DNS software and a large-scale measurement study of over 2.2 million open resolvers, confirming the real-world impact of these flaws. Our work provides crucial, evidence-based recommendations for hardening DNSSEC specifications and implementations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Existing DiT-based audio-driven avatar generation methods have achieved considerable progress, yet their broader application is constrained by limitations such as high computational overhead and the inability to synthesize long-duration videos. Autoregressive methods address this problem by applying block-wise autoregressive diffusion methods. However, these methods suffer from the problem of error accumulation and quality degradation. To address this, we propose JoyAvatar, an audio-driven autoregressive model capable of real-time inference and infinite-length video generation with the following contributions: (1) Progressive Step Bootstrapping (PSB), which allocates more denoising steps to initial frames to stabilize generation and reduce error accumulation; (2) Motion Condition Injection (MCI), enhancing temporal coherence by injecting noise-corrupted previous frames as motion condition; and (3) Unbounded RoPE via Cache-Resetting (URCR), enabling infinite-length generation through dynamic positional encoding. Our 1.3B-parameter causal model achieves 16 FPS on a single GPU and achieves competitive results in visual quality, temporal consistency, and lip synchronization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current video generation models perform well at single-shot synthesis but struggle with multi-shot videos, facing critical challenges in maintaining character and background consistency across shots and flexibly generating videos of arbitrary length and shot count. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{FilmWeaver}, a novel framework designed to generate consistent, multi-shot videos of arbitrary length. First, it employs an autoregressive diffusion paradigm to achieve arbitrary-length video generation. To address the challenge of consistency, our key insight is to decouple the problem into inter-shot consistency and intra-shot coherence. We achieve this through a dual-level cache mechanism: a shot memory caches keyframes from preceding shots to maintain character and scene identity, while a temporal memory retains a history of frames from the current shot to ensure smooth, continuous motion. The proposed framework allows for flexible, multi-round user interaction to create multi-shot videos. Furthermore, due to this decoupled design, our method demonstrates high versatility by supporting downstream tasks such as multi-concept injection and video extension. To facilitate the training of our consistency-aware method, we also developed a comprehensive pipeline to construct a high-quality multi-shot video dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches on metrics for both consistency and aesthetic quality, opening up new possibilities for creating more consistent, controllable, and narrative-driven video content.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work reports the electrical characteristics comparison study between Cr2O3 and NiOx based heterojunction diodes (HJD) on halide vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) grown \b{eta}-Ga2O3 epitaxial layers. Both as-fabricated Cr2O3 and NiOx HJDs exhibited forward current density in a range of 130-150 A/cm^2 at 5 V with rectifying ratios >10^10 and a reverse leakage current density at 10^-8 A/cm^2 at -5 V. The differential specific on-resistance of Cr2O3 and NiOx HJDs was 12.01 mΩ*cm^2 and 12.05 mΩ*cm^2, respectively. Breakdown voltages of Cr2O3 HJDs ranged from 1.4-1.9 kV and 1.5-2.3 kV for NiOx HJDs. Theoretical band alignment between Cr2O3 and \b{eta}-Ga2O3 was calculated from first principles. The ambient exposed NiOx/HVPE \b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs forward current density degraded after 10 days while that of Cr2O3/HVPE \b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs remained nearly unchanged after the same amount of time. It was later confirmed that the ambient exposed sputtered NiOx sheet resistance (Rsh) degradation gave rise to the reduction of the forward current density of the NiOx based HJDs, and water (H2O) was qualitatively determined to be the agent attributed to the forward conduction degradation by measuring the Rsh of NiOx-on-sapphire reference wafer after exposing it to different environments. The Cr2O3/HVPE \b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJD also exhibited enhanced thermal stability compared to the NiOx/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 heterostructures at elevated temperatures. Interfacial nickel gallate (Ga2NiO4) phase formation expected from phase diagrams can explain the reduced thermal stability of NiOx/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs. This study indicates that Cr2O3 is a stable p-type oxide for the realization of robust multi-kV \b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion models have significantly advanced the field of talking head generation. However, the slow inference speeds and non-autoregressive paradigms severely constrain the application of diffusion-based THG models. In this study, we propose REST, the first diffusion-based, real-time, end-to-end streaming audio-driven talking head generation framework. To support real-time end-to-end generation, a compact video latent space is first learned through high spatiotemporal VAE compression. Additionally, to enable autoregressive streaming within the compact video latent space, we introduce an ID-Context Cache mechanism, which integrates ID-Sink and Context-Cache principles to key-value caching for maintaining temporal consistency and identity coherence during long-time streaming generation. Furthermore, an Asynchronous Streaming Distillation (ASD) training strategy is proposed to mitigate error accumulation in autoregressive generation and enhance temporal consistency, which leverages a non-streaming teacher with an asynchronous noise schedule to supervise the training of the streaming student model. REST bridges the gap between autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches, demonstrating substantial value for applications requiring real-time talking head generation. Experimental results demonstrate that REST outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both generation speed and overall performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to indirect prompt injection attacks, in which the model inadvertently responds to task messages injected within the prompt context. This vulnerability stems from LLMs' inability to distinguish between data and instructions within a prompt. In this paper, we propose CachePrune, a defense method that identifies and prunes task-triggering neurons from the KV cache of the input prompt context. By pruning such neurons, we encourage the LLM to interpret the input prompt context purely as data rather than as cues for instruction following. To identify these neurons, we introduce a neural attribution mechanism guided by a preferential attribution loss, which enables effective attribution with only a few samples while preserving response quality after pruning. We further enhance the efficacy of neural attribution by leveraging an observed triggering effect inherent in the model's response generation behavior. Notably, our approach does not impose additional formatting on the prompt or introduce extra test-time LLM calls. Experiments show that CachePrune can significantly reduce attack success rates while maintaining clean response quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present Adaptive Soft Rolling KV Freeze with Entropy-Guided Recovery (ASR-KF-EGR), a training-free inference-time framework for efficient large language model generation. Our method introduces a reversible soft-freeze mechanism that temporarily suspends key-value (KV) updates for low-importance tokens identified within a sliding attention window. Unlike eviction-based approaches that permanently discard context, ASR-KF-EGR preserves all tokens in off-GPU storage and restores them on demand. We extend the framework with sublinear freeze scheduling, where freeze duration grows sublinearly with repeated low-importance detections, preventing over-aggressive compression. Preliminary experiments on LLaMA-3 8B demonstrate 55-67% reduction in active KV cache size while maintaining generation quality and passing needle-in-haystack retrieval tests. The method is architecture-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, and provides a practical solution for memory-constrained deployment of long-context LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Language models (LMs) underpin emerging mobile and embedded AI applications like meeting and video summarization and document analysis, which often require processing multiple long-context inputs. Running an LM locally on-device improves privacy, enables offline use, and reduces cost, but long-context inference quickly hits a \emph{memory capacity wall} as the key-value (KV) cache grows linearly with context length and batch size. Existing KV-cache offloading schemes are designed to transfer cache data from GPU memory to CPU memory; however, they are not suitable for embedded and mobile systems, where the CPU and GPU (or NPU) typically share a unified memory and the non-volatile secondary storage (disk) offers limited I/O bandwidth. We present KVSwap, a software framework tailored for local devices that achieves high memory efficiency while effectively leveraging disk storage. KVSwap stores the full cache on disk, uses highly compact in-memory metadata to predict which entries to preload, overlaps computation with hardware-aware disk access, and orchestrates read patterns to match storage device characteristics. Our evaluation shows that across representative LMs and storage types, KVSwap delivers higher throughput under tight memory budgets while maintaining generation quality over existing KV cache offloading schemes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing tasks, but their deployment in datacenter environments faces significant challenges due to the massive memory requirements of key-value (KV) caches. During the autoregressive decoding process, KV caches consume substantial GPU memory, limiting batch sizes and overall system throughput. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{CXL-SpecKV}, a novel disaggregated KV-cache architecture that leverages Compute Express Link (CXL) interconnects and FPGA accelerators to enable efficient speculative execution and memory disaggregation. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (i) a CXL-based memory disaggregation framework that offloads KV-caches to remote FPGA memory with low latency, (ii) a speculative KV-cache prefetching mechanism that predicts and preloads future tokens' cache entries, and (iii) an FPGA-accelerated KV-cache compression and decompression engine that reduces memory bandwidth requirements by up to 4$\times$. When evaluated on state-of-the-art LLM models, CXL-SpecKV achieves up to 3.2$\times$ higher throughput compared to GPU-only baselines, while reducing memory costs by 2.8$\times$ and maintaining accuracy. Our system demonstrates that intelligent memory disaggregation combined with speculative execution can effectively address the memory wall challenge in large-scale LLM serving.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp introduces a sparse attention mechanism that significantly reduces inference latency in long-context scenarios. Although the overall throughput has improved greatly, the Decode-stage of PD disaggregation remains to be a major bottleneck. This bottleneck primarily stems from the conflict between linear growth of Latent-Cache with sequence length and the limited GPU memory capacity, which constrains the feasible batch-size and thereby suppresses Decode-stage throughput.   To address this challenge, we propose ESS (Extended Sparse Server), an offload-centric system design tailored for DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp. ESS selectively offloads Latent-Cache to CPU memory while preserving latency-critical components on GPU. By freeing up GPU memory, ESS effectively decoupling batch-size scaling from GPU memory constraints. This design significantly improves Decode-stage throughput, thereby reducing deployment costs in real-world settings.   Our high-fidelity simulations show that ESS delivers 69.4\% throughput improvement at 32K context length and up to 123\% throughput improvement at 128K, demonstrating its effectiveness for large-context inference workloads. These results highlight ESS as a practical and scalable solution for long-context LLM serving.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Key-Value (KV) cache is the primary memory bottleneck in long-context Large Language Models, yet it is typically treated as an opaque numerical tensor. In this work, we propose \textbf{STA-Attention}, a framework that utilizes Top-K Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose the KV cache into interpretable ``semantic atoms.'' Unlike standard $L_1$-regularized SAEs, our Top-K approach eliminates shrinkage bias, preserving the precise dot-product geometry required for attention. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental \textbf{Key-Value Asymmetry}: while Key vectors serve as highly sparse routers dominated by a ``Semantic Elbow,'' deep Value vectors carry dense content payloads requiring a larger budget. Based on this structure, we introduce a Dual-Budget Strategy that selectively preserves the most informative semantic components while filtering representational noise. Experiments on Yi-6B, Mistral-7B, Qwen2.5-32B, and others show that our semantic reconstructions maintain perplexity and zero-shot performance comparable to the original models, effectively bridging the gap between mechanistic interpretability and faithful attention modeling.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Altermagnets represent a novel magnetic phase with transformative potential for ultrafast spintronics, yet efficient control of their magnetic states remains challenging. We demonstrate an ultra-low-power electric-field control of altermagnetism in MnTe through strain-mediated coupling in MnTe/PMN-PT heterostructures with negligible Joule heating. Application of +6 kV/cm electric fields induces piezoelectric strain in PMN-PT, modulating the Néel temperature from 310 to 328 K. As a result, around the magnetic phase transition, the altermagnetic spin splitting of MnTe is reversibly switched "on" and "off" by the electric fields. Meanwhile, the piezoelectric strain generates lattice distortions and magnetic structure changes in MnTe, enabling up to 9.7% resistance modulation around the magnetic phase transition temperature. Leveraging this effect, we implement programmable resistance states in a Hopfield neuromorphic network, achieving 100% pattern recognition accuracy at <=40% noise levels. This approach establishes the electric-field control as a low-power strategy for altermagnetic manipulation while demonstrating the viability of altermagnetic materials for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing beyond conventional charge-based architectures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present LeMiCa, a training-free and efficient acceleration framework for diffusion-based video generation. While existing caching strategies primarily focus on reducing local heuristic errors, they often overlook the accumulation of global errors, leading to noticeable content degradation between accelerated and original videos. To address this issue, we formulate cache scheduling as a directed graph with error-weighted edges and introduce a Lexicographic Minimax Path Optimization strategy that explicitly bounds the worst-case path error. This approach substantially improves the consistency of global content and style across generated frames. Extensive experiments on multiple text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate that LeMiCa delivers dual improvements in both inference speed and generation quality. Notably, our method achieves a 2.9x speedup on the Latte model and reaches an LPIPS score of 0.05 on Open-Sora, outperforming prior caching techniques. Importantly, these gains come with minimal perceptual quality degradation, making LeMiCa a robust and generalizable paradigm for accelerating diffusion-based video generation. We believe this approach can serve as a strong foundation for future research on efficient and reliable video synthesis. Our code is available at :https://github.com/UnicomAI/LeMiCa

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising potential in Vision-Language Navigation (VLN). However, their practical development is severely hindered by the substantial training overhead. We recognize two key issues that contribute to the overhead: (1) the quadratic computational burden from processing long-horizon historical observations as massive sequences of tokens, and (2) the exploration-efficiency trade-off in DAgger, i.e., a data aggregation process of collecting agent-explored trajectories. While more exploration yields effective error-recovery trajectories for handling test-time distribution shifts, it comes at the cost of longer trajectory lengths for both training and inference. To address these challenges, we propose Efficient-VLN, a training-efficient VLN model. Specifically, to mitigate the token processing burden, we design two efficient memory mechanisms: a progressive memory that dynamically allocates more tokens to recent observations, and a learnable recursive memory that utilizes the key-value cache of learnable tokens as the memory state. Moreover, we introduce a dynamic mixed policy to balance the exploration-efficiency trade-off. Extensive experiments show that Efficient-VLN achieves state-of-the-art performance on R2R-CE (64.2% SR) and RxR-CE (67.0% SR). Critically, our model consumes merely 282 H800 GPU hours, demonstrating a dramatic reduction in training overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce Disentangled360, an innovative 3D-aware technology that integrates the advantages of direction disentangled volume rendering with single-image 360° unique view synthesis for applications in medical imaging and natural scene reconstruction. In contrast to current techniques that either oversimplify anisotropic light behavior or lack generalizability across various contexts, our framework distinctly differentiates between isotropic and anisotropic contributions inside a Gaussian Splatting backbone. We implement a dual-branch conditioning framework, one optimized for CT intensity driven scattering in volumetric data and the other for real-world RGB scenes through normalized camera embeddings. To address scale ambiguity and maintain structural realism, we present a hybrid pose agnostic anchoring method that adaptively samples scene depth and material transitions, functioning as stable pivots during scene distillation. Our design integrates preoperative radiography simulation and consumer-grade 360° rendering into a singular inference pipeline, facilitating rapid, photorealistic view synthesis with inherent directionality. Evaluations on the Mip-NeRF 360, RealEstate10K, and DeepDRR datasets indicate superior SSIM and LPIPS performance, while runtime assessments confirm its viability for interactive applications. Disentangled360 facilitates mixed-reality medical supervision, robotic perception, and immersive content creation, eliminating the necessity for scene-specific finetuning or expensive photon simulations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent research has developed several LLM architectures suitable for inference on end-user devices, such as the Mixture of Lookup Experts (MoLE)~\parencite{jie_mixture_2025}. A key feature of MoLE is that each token id is associated with a dedicated group of experts. For a given input, only the experts corresponding to the input token id will be activated. Since the communication overhead of loading this small number of activated experts into RAM during inference is negligible, expert parameters can be offloaded to storage, making MoLE suitable for resource-constrained devices. However, MoLE's context-independent expert selection mechanism, based solely on input ids, may limit model performance. To address this, we propose the \textbf{M}ixture \textbf{o}f \textbf{L}ookup \textbf{K}ey-\textbf{V}alue Experts (\textbf{MoLKV}) model. In MoLKV, each expert is structured as a key-value pair. For a given input, the input-derived query interacts with the cached key-value experts from the current sequence, generating a context-aware expert output. This context-aware mechanism alleviates the limitation of MoLE, and experimental results demonstrate that MoLKV achieves significantly lower validation loss in small-scale evaluations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enables efficient scaling of large language models (LLMs) with sparsely activated experts during inference. To effectively deploy large MoE models on memory-constrained devices, many systems introduce *expert offloading* that caches a subset of experts in fast memory, leaving others on slow memory to run on CPU or load on demand. While some research has exploited the locality of expert activations, where consecutive tokens activate similar experts, the degree of this **local routing consistency** varies across models and remains understudied. In this paper, we propose two metrics to measure local routing consistency of MoE models: (1) **Segment Routing Best Performance (SRP)**, which evaluates how well a fixed group of experts can cover the needs of a segment of tokens, and (2) **Segment Cache Best Hit Rate (SCH)**, which measures the hit rate of an expert cache utilizing a length of future information under a cache limit. We analyze 20 MoE LLMs with diverse sizes and architectures and use toy models to verify key factors related to local routing consistency. We find a strong trade-off between local routing consistency and *local* load balance, while showing that *global* load balance can coexist with local routing consistency. Meanwhile, settings like shared experts that decrease expert combination space can lead to low local routing consistency. We further reveal that domain-specialized experts contribute more to routing consistency than vocabulary-specialized ones, and that most models balance between cache effectiveness and efficiency with cache sizes approximately twice the active experts. These findings pave the way for memory-efficient MoE design and deployment without compromising inference speed. We publish the code for replicating experiments at https://github.com/ljcleo/moe-lrc .

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Finite-element (FE) discretisations have emerged as a powerful real-space alternative to large-scale Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) calculations, offering systematic convergence, excellent parallel scalability, while accommodating generic boundary conditions. However, the dominant computational bottleneck in FE-based DFT arises from the repeated application of the discretised sparse Hamiltonian to large blocks of trial vectors during iterations in an iterative eigensolver. Traditional sparse matrix-vector multiplications and FE cell-matrix approaches encounter memory limitations and high data-movement overheads, particularly at higher polynomial orders, typically used in DFT calculations. To overcome these challenges, this work develops matrix-free algorithms for FE-discretised DFT that substantially accelerate these products by doing on-the-fly operations that utilize structured tensor contractions over 1D basis functions and quadrature data. A unified multilevel batched data layout that handles both real and complex-valued operators is introduced to maximise cache reuse and SIMD utilisation on Frontier (AVX2), Param Pravega (AVX512) and Fugaku (SVE). We also combine terms for optimal cache reuse, even-odd decomposition to reduce FLOP, and mixed-precision intrinsics. Extensive benchmarks show that for large multivector pseudopotential DFT calculations, the matrix-free kernels deliver 1.5-4x speedups over the state-of-the-art cell-matrix approach baselines. For all-electron DFT calculations, the matrix-free operator achieves gains of up to 5.8x due to its efficient implementation and superior arithmetic intensity. When integrated with an error-tolerant Chebyshev-filtered subspace iteration eigensolver, the matrix-free formalism yields substantial reductions in end-to-end time-to-solution using FE meshes that deliver desired accuracies in ground-state properties.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rise of multi-agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) and specialized reasoning agents exposes fundamental limitations in today's data management architectures. Traditional databases and data fabrics were designed for static, well-defined workloads, whereas agentic systems exhibit dynamic, context-driven, and collaborative behaviors. Agents continuously decompose tasks, shift attention across modalities, and share intermediate results with peers - producing non-deterministic, multi-modal workloads that strain conventional query optimizers and caching mechanisms. We propose an Agent-Centric Data Fabric, a unified architecture that rethinks how data systems serve, optimize, coordinate, and learn from agentic workloads. To achieve this we exploit the concepts of attention-guided data retrieval, semantic micro-caching for context-driven agent federations, predictive data prefetching and quorum-based data serving. Together, these mechanisms enable agents to access representative data faster and more efficiently, while reducing redundant queries, data movement, and inference load across systems. By framing data systems as adaptive collaborators, instead of static executors, we outline new research directions toward behaviorally responsive data infrastructures, where caching, probing, and orchestration jointly enable efficient, context-rich data exchange among dynamic, reasoning-driven agents.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose JFR, a Bellman-Ford-based optimization framework leveraging frontier contraction and abstract multi-hop jump propagation to accelerate shortest-path computation while strictly preserving correctness. JFR achieves substantial reductions in relaxation operations, ranging from 25 to 99 percent, across sparse, dense, and negative-edge graphs, ensuring robust performance even under adversarial or highly connected topologies. On ultra-large graphs with up to N=20,000 nodes and 295 million edges, JFR maintains strong operational reductions and comparable or improved runtime relative to SPFA-SLF, demonstrating consistent robustness across graph size and density. Lower relaxation counts imply reduced memory-access overheads and computational effort; this normalized work reduction highlights JFR's suitability for scenarios requiring high throughput or energy-conscious operation. Future work focuses on integrating high-performance queue structures, adaptive frontier strategies, and cache-aware techniques to further reduce constant-factor overheads and fully realize JFR's practical runtime potential.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vehicle edge caching is a promising technology that can significantly reduce the latency for vehicle users (VUs) to access content by pre-caching user-interested content at edge nodes. It is crucial to accurately predict the content that VUs are interested in without exposing their privacy. Traditional federated learning (FL) can protect user privacy by sharing models rather than raw data. However, the training of FL requires frequent model transmission, which can result in significant communication overhead. Additionally, vehicles may leave the road side unit (RSU) coverage area before training is completed, leading to training failures. To address these issues, in this letter, we propose a federated distillation-assisted vehicle edge caching scheme based on lightweight denoising diffusion probabilistic model (LDPM). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed vehicle edge caching scheme has good robustness to variations in vehicle speed, significantly reducing communication overhead and improving cache hit percentage.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) face a fundamental memory wall: their learned basis functions create parameter counts that impose extreme bandwidth demands, hindering deployment in memory-constrained environments. We show that Vision KANs exhibit a holographic topology, where information is distributed across the interference of splines rather than localized to specific edges. Consequently, traditional pruning fails (10% sparsity degrades mAP from 85.23% to 45%, a $\sim$40-point drop). To address this, we present SHARe-KAN, a framework utilizing Gain-Shape-Bias Vector Quantization to exploit functional redundancy while preserving the dense topology. Coupled with LUTHAM, a hardware-aware compiler with static memory planning, we achieve $88\times$ runtime memory reduction (1.13 GB $\to$ 12.91 MB) and match uncompressed baseline accuracy on PASCAL VOC. Profiling on NVIDIA Ampere architecture confirms $>90\%$ L2 cache residency, demonstrating that the workload is decoupled from DRAM bandwidth constraints inherent to spline-based architectures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid growth of Web3.0 is transforming the Internet from a centralized structure to decentralized, which empowers users with unprecedented self-sovereignty over their own data. However, in the context of decentralized data access within Web3.0, it is imperative to cope with efficiency concerns caused by the replication of redundant data, as well as security vulnerabilities caused by data inconsistency. To address these challenges, we develop a Trustworthy Decentralized Cooperative Caching (TDC-Cache) framework for Web3.0 to ensure efficient caching and enhance system resilience against adversarial threats. This framework features a two-layer architecture, wherein the Decentralized Oracle Network (DON) layer serves as a trusted intermediary platform for decentralized caching, bridging the contents from decentralized storage and the content requests from users. In light of the complexity of Web3.0 network topologies and data flows, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Decentralized Caching (DRL-DC) for TDC-Cache to dynamically optimize caching strategies of distributed oracles. Furthermore, we develop a Proof of Cooperative Learning (PoCL) consensus to maintain the consistency of decentralized caching decisions within DON. Experimental results show that, compared with existing approaches, the proposed framework reduces average access latency by 20%, increases the cache hit rate by at most 18%, and improves the average success consensus rate by 10%. Overall, this paper serves as a first foray into the investigation of decentralized caching framework and strategy for Web3.0.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. These capabilities stem primarily from the self-attention mechanism, which enables modeling of long-range dependencies. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to sequence length poses significant computational and memory challenges, especially as sequence length extends to extremes. While various sparse attention and KV cache compression methods have been proposed to improve efficiency, they often suffer from limitations such as reliance on fixed patterns, inability to handle both prefilling and decoding stages, or the requirement for additional training. In this paper, we propose Training-free Context-adaptive Attention (TCA-Attention), a training-free sparse attention mechanism that selectively attends to only the informative tokens for efficient long-context inference. Our method consists of two lightweight phases: i) an offline calibration phase that determines head-specific sparsity budgets via a single forward pass, and ii) an online token selection phase that adaptively retains core context tokens using a lightweight redundancy metric. TCA-Attention provides a unified solution that accelerates both prefilling and decoding while reducing KV cache memory footprint, without requiring parameter updates or architectural changes. Theoretical analysis shows that our approach maintains bounded approximation error. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCA-Attention achieves a 2.8$\times$ speedup and reduces KV cache by 61% at 128K context length while maintaining performance comparable to full attention across various benchmarks, offering a practical plug-and-play solution for efficient long-context inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The proliferation of 100B+ parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) with 100k+ context length support have resulted in increasing demands for on-chip memory to support large KV caches. Techniques such as StreamingLLM and SnapKV demonstrate how to control KV cache size while maintaining model accuracy. Yet, these techniques are not commonly used within industrial deployments using frameworks like vLLM or SGLang. The reason is twofold: on one hand, the static graphs and continuous batching methodology employed by these frameworks make it difficult to admit modifications to the standard multi-head attention algorithm, while on the other hand, the accuracy implications of such techniques on modern instruction-following and reasoning models are not well understood, obfuscating the need for implementing these techniques. In this paper, we explore these accuracy implications on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1, and develop SnapStream, a KV cache compression method that can be deployed at scale. We demonstrate the efficacy of SnapStream in a 16-way tensor-parallel deployment of DeepSeek-671B on SambaNova SN40L accelerators running at 128k context length and up to 1832 tokens per second in a real production setting. SnapStream enables $4\times$ improved on-chip memory usage and introduces minimal accuracy degradation on LongBench-v2, AIME24 and LiveCodeBench. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of sparse KV attention techniques deployed in a production inference system with static graphs and continuous batching.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in chain of thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the current LLM reasoning paradigm initiates thinking only after the entire input is available, which introduces unnecessary latency and weakens attention to earlier information in dynamic scenarios. Inspired by human cognition of thinking while reading, we first design a \textit{\textbf{streaming thinking}} paradigm for LLMs, where reasoning unfolds in the order of input and further adjusts its depth once reading is complete. We instantiate this paradigm with \textit{StreamingThinker}, a framework that enables LLMs to think while reading through the integration of streaming CoT generation, streaming-constraint training, and streaming parallel inference. Specifically, StreamingThinker employs streaming reasoning units with quality control for CoT generation, enforces order-preserving reasoning through streaming attention masks and position encoding, and leverages parallel KV caches that decouple input encoding from reasoning generation, thereby ensuring alignment and enabling true concurrency. We evaluate StreamingThinker on the Qwen3 model family across math reasoning, logical reasoning, and context-based QA reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that the StreamingThinker preserves performance comparable to batch thinking, while yielding an 80\% reduction in token waiting before the onset of reasoning and a more than 60\% reduction in time-level latency for producing the final answer, demonstrating the effectiveness of the streaming paradigm for LLM reasoning. Code will be released at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/StreamingLLM/tree/main/StreamingThinker.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Window attention and linear attention represent two principal strategies for mitigating the quadratic complexity and ever-growing KV cache in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, we observe that window-based VLMs suffer performance degradation when sequence length exceeds the window size, while linear attention underperforms on information-intensive tasks such as OCR and document understanding. To overcome these limitations, we propose InfiniteVL, a linear-complexity VLM architecture that synergizes sliding window attention (SWA) with Gated DeltaNet. For achieving competitive multimodal performance under constrained resources, we design a three-stage training strategy comprising distillation pretraining, instruction tuning, and long-sequence SFT. Remarkably, using less than 2\% of the training data required by leading VLMs, InfiniteVL not only substantially outperforms previous linear-complexity VLMs but also matches the performance of leading Transformer-based VLMs, while demonstrating effective long-term memory retention. Compared to similar-sized Transformer-based VLMs accelerated by FlashAttention-2, InfiniteVL achieves over 3.6\times inference speedup while maintaining constant latency and memory footprint. In streaming video understanding scenarios, it sustains a stable 24 FPS real-time prefill speed while preserving long-term memory cache.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Relational data, occurring in the real world, are often structured as graphs, which provide the logical abstraction required to make analytical derivations simpler. As graphs get larger, the irregular access patterns exhibited in most graph algorithms, hamper performance. This, along with NUMA and physical memory limits, results in scaling complexities with sequential/shared memory frameworks. StarPlat's MPI backend abstracts away the programmatic complexity involved in designing optimal distributed graph algorithms. It provides an instrument for coding graph algorithms that scale over distributed memory. In this work, we provide an analysis-transformation framework that leverages general semantics associated with iterations involving nodes and their neighbors, within StarPlat, to aggregate communication. The framework scans for patterns that warrant re-ordering in neighborhood access patterns, aggregate communication, and avoid communication altogether with opportunistic caching in reduction constructs. We also architect an optimized bulk-reduction substrate using Open MPI's passive Remote Memory Access (RMA) constructs. We applied our optimization logic to StarPlat's distributed backend and outperformed d-Galois by 2.05 and DRONE by 1.44 times in Single Source Shortest Paths across several big data graphs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficient edge caching reduces latency and alleviates backhaul congestion in modern networks. Traditional caching policies, such as Least Recently Used (LRU) and Least Frequently Used (LFU), perform well under specific request patterns. LRU excels in workloads with strong temporal locality, while LFU is effective when content popularity remains static. However, real-world client requests often exhibit correlations due to shared contexts and coordinated activities. This is particularly evident in Virtual Reality (VR) environments, where groups of clients navigate shared virtual spaces, leading to correlated content requests.   In this paper, we introduce the \textit{grouped client request model}, a generalization of the Independent Reference Model that explicitly captures different types of request correlations. Our theoretical analysis of LRU under this model reveals that the optimal causal caching policy depends on cache size: LFU is optimal for small to moderate caches, while LRU outperforms it for larger caches. To address the limitations of existing policies, we propose Least Following and Recently Used (LFRU), a novel online caching policy that dynamically infers and adapts to causal relationships in client requests to optimize evictions. LFRU prioritizes objects likely to be requested based on inferred dependencies, achieving near-optimal performance compared to the offline optimal Belady policy in structured correlation settings.   We develop VR based datasets to evaluate caching policies under realistic correlated requests. Our results show that LFRU consistently performs at least as well as LRU and LFU, outperforming LRU by up to 2.9x and LFU by up to1.9x in certain settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large reasoning models (LRMs) often cost significant key-value (KV) cache overhead, due to their linear growth with the verbose chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process. This costs both memory and throughput bottleneck limiting their efficient deployment. Towards reducing KV cache size during inference, we first investigate the effectiveness of existing KV cache eviction methods for CoT reasoning. Interestingly, we find that due to unstable token-wise scoring and the reduced effective KV budget caused by padding tokens, state-of-the-art (SoTA) eviction methods fail to maintain accuracy in the multi-batch setting. Additionally, these methods often generate longer sequences than the original model, as semantic-unaware token-wise eviction leads to repeated revalidation during reasoning. To address these issues, we present \textbf{SkipKV}, a \textbf{\textit{training-free}} KV compression method for selective \textit{eviction} and \textit{generation} operating at a coarse-grained sentence-level sequence removal for efficient CoT reasoning. In specific, it introduces a \textit{sentence-scoring metric} to identify and remove highly similar sentences while maintaining semantic coherence. To suppress redundant generation, SkipKV dynamically adjusts a steering vector to update the hidden activation states during inference enforcing the LRM to generate concise response. Extensive evaluations on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SkipKV in maintaining up to $\mathbf{26.7}\%$ improved accuracy compared to the alternatives, at a similar compression budget. Additionally, compared to SoTA, SkipKV yields up to $\mathbf{1.6}\times$ fewer generation length while improving throughput up to $\mathbf{1.7}\times$.

We show that Compactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining 20% fewer tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, while being more task-robust. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated compression: inferring the maximum compression a given context supports before significant performance loss. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that Compactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV memory burden by 68%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5 and Llama 3.1 families. Finally, we release compactor-vllm, an inference engine and suite of optimized Triton kernels designed to efficiently support the sparse, non-contiguous memory access patterns inherent to compressed KV caches. This work demonstrates that Compactor offers a practical, high-performance solution for alleviating the memory bottleneck in modern LLM deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in a wide range of natural language processing applications. However, the high energy and latency overhead induced by the KV cache limits the edge deployment, especially for long contexts. Emerging hybrid bonding (HB) technology has been proposed as a promising alternative to conventional near-memory processing (NMP) architectures, offering improved bandwidth efficiency and lower power consumption while exhibiting characteristics of distributed memory. In this paper, we propose H2EAL, a hybrid bonding-based accelerator with sparse attention algorithm-hardware co-design for efficient LLM inference at the edge. At the algorithm level, we propose a hybrid sparse attention scheme with static and dynamic sparsity for different heads to fully leverage the sparsity with high accuracy. At the hardware level, we co-design the hardware to support hybrid sparse attention and propose memory-compute co-placement to address the distributed memory bottleneck. Since different attention heads exhibit different sparse patterns and the attention structure often mismatches the HB architecture, we further develop a load-balancing scheduler with parallel tiled attention to address workload imbalance and optimize the mapping strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate H2EAL achieves 5.20~48.21x speedup and 6.22~73.48x energy efficiency improvement over baseline HB implementation, with a negligible average accuracy drop of 0.87% on multiple benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) is pushing AI accelerators toward increasingly powerful and specialized designs. Instead of further complicating software development with deeply hierarchical scratchpad memories (SPMs) and their asynchronous management, we investigate the opposite point of the design spectrum: a multi-core AI accelerator equipped with a shared system-level cache and application-aware management policies, which keeps the programming effort modest. Our approach exploits dataflow information available in the software stack to guide cache replacement (including dead-block prediction), in concert with bypass decisions and mechanisms that alleviate cache thrashing.   We assess the proposal using a cycle-accurate simulator and observe substantial performance gains (up to 1.80x speedup) compared with conventional cache architectures. In addition, we build and validate an analytical model that takes into account the actual overlapping behaviors to extend the measurement results of our policies to real-world larger-scale workloads. Experiment results show that when functioning together, our bypassing and thrashing mitigation strategies can handle scenarios both with and without inter-core data sharing and achieve remarkable speedups.   Finally, we implement the design in RTL and the area of our design is $\mathbf{0.064mm^2}$ with 15nm process, which can run at 2 GHz clock frequency. Our findings explore the potential of the shared cache design to assist the development of future AI accelerator systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present CadLLM, a training-free method to accelerate the inference throughput of diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs). We first investigate the dynamic nature of token unmasking confidence across blocks and steps. Based on this observation, we present a lightweight adaptive approach that controls the generation block size, step size, and threshold based on the average confidence of unmasked tokens. We further reduce softmax overhead by dynamically leveraging a subset of the vocabulary to regulate sampling breadth. CadLLM is a plug-and-play, model-agnostic method compatible with KV-cache-based dLLMs. Extensive experiments on four popular tasks demonstrate that CadLLM yields up to 2.28x throughput improvement over the state-of-the-art baseline with competitive accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Key-Value (KV) cache, which stores intermediate attention computations (Key and Value pairs) to avoid redundant calculations, is a fundamental mechanism for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference. However, this efficiency optimization introduces significant yet underexplored privacy risks. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of these vulnerabilities, demonstrating that an attacker can reconstruct sensitive user inputs directly from the KV-cache. We design and implement three distinct attack vectors: a direct Inversion Attack, a more broadly applicable and potent Collision Attack, and a semantic-based Injection Attack. These methods demonstrate the practicality and severity of KV-cache privacy leakage issues. To mitigate this, we propose KV-Cloak, a novel, lightweight, and efficient defense mechanism. KV-Cloak uses a reversible matrix-based obfuscation scheme, combined with operator fusion, to secure the KV-cache. Our extensive experiments show that KV-Cloak effectively thwarts all proposed attacks, reducing reconstruction quality to random noise. Crucially, it achieves this robust security with virtually no degradation in model accuracy and minimal performance overhead, offering a practical solution for trustworthy LLM deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Perceiving and reconstructing 3D scene geometry from visual inputs is crucial for autonomous driving. However, there still lacks a driving-targeted dense geometry perception model that can adapt to different scenarios and camera configurations. To bridge this gap, we propose a Driving Visual Geometry Transformer (DVGT), which reconstructs a global dense 3D point map from a sequence of unposed multi-view visual inputs. We first extract visual features for each image using a DINO backbone, and employ alternating intra-view local attention, cross-view spatial attention, and cross-frame temporal attention to infer geometric relations across images. We then use multiple heads to decode a global point map in the ego coordinate of the first frame and the ego poses for each frame. Unlike conventional methods that rely on precise camera parameters, DVGT is free of explicit 3D geometric priors, enabling flexible processing of arbitrary camera configurations. DVGT directly predicts metric-scaled geometry from image sequences, eliminating the need for post-alignment with external sensors. Trained on a large mixture of driving datasets including nuScenes, OpenScene, Waymo, KITTI, and DDAD, DVGT significantly outperforms existing models on various scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/wzzheng/DVGT.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Conventional evaluation methods for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) lack interpretability and are often insufficient to fully disclose significant capability gaps across models. To address this, we introduce AuditDM, an automated framework that actively discovers and rectifies MLLM failure modes by auditing their divergence. AuditDM fine-tunes an MLLM as an auditor via reinforcement learning to generate challenging questions and counterfactual images that maximize disagreement among target models. Once trained, the auditor uncovers diverse, interpretable exemplars that reveal model weaknesses and serve as annotation-free data for rectification. When applied to SoTA models like Gemma-3 and PaliGemma-2, AuditDM discovers more than 20 distinct failure types. Fine-tuning on these discoveries consistently improves all models across 16 benchmarks, and enables a 3B model to surpass its 28B counterpart. Our results suggest that as data scaling hits diminishing returns, targeted model auditing offers an effective path to model diagnosis and improvement.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances have shown that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) benefit from multimodal interleaved chain-of-thought (CoT) with vision tool interactions. However, existing open-source models often exhibit blind tool-use reasoning patterns, invoking vision tools even when they are unnecessary, which significantly increases inference overhead and degrades model performance. To this end, we propose AdaTooler-V, an MLLM that performs adaptive tool-use by determining whether a visual problem truly requires tools. First, we introduce AT-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts reward scales based on the Tool Benefit Score of each sample, encouraging the model to invoke tools only when they provide genuine improvements. Moreover, we construct two datasets to support training: AdaTooler-V-CoT-100k for SFT cold start and AdaTooler-V-300k for RL with verifiable rewards across single-image, multi-image, and video data. Experiments across twelve benchmarks demonstrate the strong reasoning capability of AdaTooler-V, outperforming existing methods in diverse visual reasoning tasks. Notably, AdaTooler-V-7B achieves an accuracy of 89.8\% on the high-resolution benchmark V*, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. All code, models, and data are released.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) with explicit reasoning capabilities excel at mathematical reasoning yet still commit process errors, such as incorrect calculations, brittle logic, and superficially plausible but invalid steps. In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Reasoner, an on-policy joint training framework designed to enhance reasoning by co-evolving an LLM reasoner and an LLM-based discriminator through adversarial reinforcement learning. A compute-efficient review schedule partitions each reasoning chain into logically complete slices of comparable length, and the discriminator evaluates each slice's soundness with concise, structured justifications. Learning couples complementary signals: the LLM reasoner is rewarded for logically consistent steps that yield correct answers, while the discriminator earns rewards for correctly detecting errors or distinguishing traces in the reasoning process. This produces dense, well-calibrated, on-policy step-level rewards that supplement sparse exact-match signals, improving credit assignment, increasing sample efficiency, and enhancing overall reasoning quality of LLMs. Across various mathematical benchmarks, the method delivers consistent gains over strong baselines with standard RL post-training. Specifically, on AIME24, we improve DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from 54.0 to 61.3 (+7.3) and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B from 43.7 to 53.7 (+10.0). The modular discriminator also enables flexible reward shaping for objectives such as teacher distillation, preference alignment, and mathematical proof-based reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Gravitational waves (GWs) are unique messengers as they travel through the Universe without alteration except for gravitational lensing. Their long wavelengths make them susceptible to diffraction by cosmic structures, providing an unprecedented opportunity to map dark matter substructures. Identifying lensed events requires the analysis of thousands to millions of simulated events to reach high statistical significances. This is computationally prohibitive with standard GW parameter estimation methods. We build on top of state-of-the-art neural posterior algorithms to accelerate the lensed inference from CPU days to minutes with DINGO-lensing. We showcase its capabilities by reanalyzing GW231123, the most promising lensed candidate so far, and find that its statistical significance cannot exceed 4$σ$. We observe that 8% of GW231123-like nonlensed simulations favor lensing, which could be explained by the self-similarity of short-duration signals. Still, 58% of GW231123-like lensed simulations have larger support for lensing, showing that higher detection statistics are possible. Although GW231123 exposes the challenges of claiming the first GW lensing detection, our deep-learning methods have demonstrated to be powerful enough to enable the upcoming discovery of lensed GWs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Prior studies investigating the internal workings of LLMs have uncovered sparse subnetworks, often referred to as circuits, that are responsible for performing specific tasks. Additionally, it has been shown that model performance improvement through fine-tuning often results from the strengthening of existing circuits in the model. Taken together, these findings suggest the possibility of intervening directly on such circuits to make precise, task-targeted updates. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method called Constructive Circuit Amplification which identifies pivotal tokens from model reasoning traces as well as model components responsible for the desired task, and updates only those components. Applied to mathematical reasoning, it improves accuracy by up to +11.4% across multiple models while modifying as little as 1.59% of model components, with minimal impact on other abilities as measured by MMLU, TriviaQA, and TruthfulQA. These results demonstrate that targeted capabilities can be reliably enhanced by selectively updating a sparse set of model components.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper examines the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), a framework for improving the reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in multimodal models highlight the pivotal role of image tokenization in high-resolution image generation. By compressing images into compact latent representations, tokenizers enable generative models to operate in lower-dimensional spaces, thereby improving computational efficiency and reducing complexity. Discrete tokenizers naturally align with the autoregressive paradigm but still lag behind continuous ones, limiting their adoption in multimodal systems. To address this, we propose \textbf{SFTok}, a discrete tokenizer that incorporates a multi-step iterative mechanism for precise reconstruction. By integrating \textbf{self-forcing guided visual reconstruction} and \textbf{debias-and-fitting training strategy}, SFTok resolves the training-inference inconsistency in multi-step process, significantly enhancing image reconstruction quality. At a high compression rate of only 64 tokens per image, SFTok achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality on ImageNet (rFID = 1.21) and demonstrates exceptional performance in class-to-image generation tasks (gFID = 2.29).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models, such as Imagen, Stable Diffusion, and FLUX, have led to remarkable improvements in visual quality. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality of training data. Web-crawled and synthetic image datasets often contain low-quality or redundant samples, which lead to degraded visual fidelity, unstable training, and inefficient computation. Hence, effective data selection is crucial for improving data efficiency. Existing approaches rely on costly manual curation or heuristic scoring based on single-dimensional features in Text-to-Image data filtering. Although meta-learning based method has been explored in LLM, there is no adaptation for image modalities. To this end, we propose **Alchemist**, a meta-gradient-based framework to select a suitable subset from large-scale text-image data pairs. Our approach automatically learns to assess the influence of each sample by iteratively optimizing the model from a data-centric perspective. Alchemist consists of two key stages: data rating and data pruning. We train a lightweight rater to estimate each sample's influence based on gradient information, enhanced with multi-granularity perception. We then use the Shift-Gsampling strategy to select informative subsets for efficient model training. Alchemist is the first automatic, scalable, meta-gradient-based data selection framework for Text-to-Image model training. Experiments on both synthetic and web-crawled datasets demonstrate that Alchemist consistently improves visual quality and downstream performance. Training on an Alchemist-selected 50% of the data can outperform training on the full dataset.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generation-time text watermarking embeds statistical signals into text for traceability of AI-generated content. We explore *post-hoc watermarking* where an LLM rewrites existing text while applying generation-time watermarking, to protect copyrighted documents, or detect their use in training or RAG via watermark radioactivity. Unlike generation-time approaches, which is constrained by how LLMs are served, this setting offers additional degrees of freedom for both generation and detection. We investigate how allocating compute (through larger rephrasing models, beam search, multi-candidate generation, or entropy filtering at detection) affects the quality-detectability trade-off. Our strategies achieve strong detectability and semantic fidelity on open-ended text such as books. Among our findings, the simple Gumbel-max scheme surprisingly outperforms more recent alternatives under nucleus sampling, and most methods benefit significantly from beam search. However, most approaches struggle when watermarking verifiable text such as code, where we counterintuitively find that smaller models outperform larger ones. This study reveals both the potential and limitations of post-hoc watermarking, laying groundwork for practical applications and future research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current diffusion-based acceleration methods for long-portrait animation struggle to ensure identity (ID) consistency. This paper presents FlashPortrait, an end-to-end video diffusion transformer capable of synthesizing ID-preserving, infinite-length videos while achieving up to 6x acceleration in inference speed. In particular, FlashPortrait begins by computing the identity-agnostic facial expression features with an off-the-shelf extractor. It then introduces a Normalized Facial Expression Block to align facial features with diffusion latents by normalizing them with their respective means and variances, thereby improving identity stability in facial modeling. During inference, FlashPortrait adopts a dynamic sliding-window scheme with weighted blending in overlapping areas, ensuring smooth transitions and ID consistency in long animations. In each context window, based on the latent variation rate at particular timesteps and the derivative magnitude ratio among diffusion layers, FlashPortrait utilizes higher-order latent derivatives at the current timestep to directly predict latents at future timesteps, thereby skipping several denoising steps and achieving 6x speed acceleration. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of FlashPortrait both qualitatively and quantitatively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reward models (RMs) are essential for training large language models (LLMs), but remain underexplored for omni models that handle interleaved image and text sequences. We introduce Multimodal RewardBench 2 (MMRB2), the first comprehensive benchmark for reward models on multimodal understanding and (interleaved) generation. MMRB2 spans four tasks: text-to-image, image editing, interleaved generation, and multimodal reasoning ("thinking-with-images"), providing 1,000 expert-annotated preference pairs per task from 23 models and agents across 21 source tasks. MMRB2 is designed with: (1) practical but challenging prompts; (2) responses from state-of-the-art models and agents; and (3) preference pairs with strong human-expert consensus, curated via an ensemble filtering strategy. Using MMRB2, we study existing judges for each subtask, including multimodal LLM-as-a-judge and models trained with human preferences. The latest Gemini 3 Pro attains 75-80% accuracy. GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro reach 66-75% accuracy, compared to >90% for humans, yet surpass the widely used GPT-4o (59%). The best performing open-source model Qwen3-VL-32B achieves similar accuracies as Gemini 2.5 Flash (64%). We also show that MMRB2 performance strongly correlates with downstream task success using Best-of-N sampling and conduct an in-depth analysis that shows key areas to improve the reward models going forward.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Portrait animation has witnessed tremendous quality improvements thanks to recent advances in video diffusion models. However, these 2D methods often compromise 3D consistency and speed, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios, such as digital twins or telepresence. In contrast, 3D-aware facial animation feedforward methods -- built upon explicit 3D representations, such as neural radiance fields or Gaussian splatting -- ensure 3D consistency and achieve faster inference speed, but come with inferior expression details. In this paper, we aim to combine their strengths by distilling knowledge from a 2D diffusion-based method into a feed-forward encoder, which instantly converts an in-the-wild single image into a 3D-consistent, fast yet expressive animatable representation. Our animation representation is decoupled from the face's 3D representation and learns motion implicitly from data, eliminating the dependency on pre-defined parametric models that often constrain animation capabilities. Unlike previous computationally intensive global fusion mechanisms (e.g., multiple attention layers) for fusing 3D structural and animation information, our design employs an efficient lightweight local fusion strategy to achieve high animation expressivity. As a result, our method runs at 107.31 FPS for animation and pose control while achieving comparable animation quality to the state-of-the-art, surpassing alternative designs that trade speed for quality or vice versa.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) unlock world-knowledge-aware video understanding through pretraining on internet-scale data and have already shown promise on tasks such as movie analysis and video question answering. However, deploying VLLMs for downstream tasks such as video recommendation remains challenging, since real systems require multi-video inputs, lightweight backbones, low-latency sequential inference, and rapid response. In practice, (1) decode-only generation yields high latency for sequential inference, (2) typical interfaces do not support multi-video inputs, and (3) constraining outputs to language discards fine-grained visual details that matter for downstream vision tasks. We argue that these limitations stem from the absence of a representation that preserves pixel-level detail while leveraging world knowledge. We present LinkedOut, a representation that extracts VLLM world knowledge directly from video to enable fast inference, supports multi-video histories, and removes the language bottleneck. LinkedOut extracts semantically grounded, knowledge-aware tokens from raw frames using VLLMs, guided by promptable queries and optional auxiliary modalities. We introduce a cross-layer knowledge fusion MoE that selects the appropriate level of abstraction from the rich VLLM features, enabling personalized, interpretable, and low-latency recommendation. To our knowledge, LinkedOut is the first VLLM-based video recommendation method that operates on raw frames without handcrafted labels, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. Interpretability studies and ablations confirm the benefits of layer diversity and layer-wise fusion, pointing to a practical path that fully leverages VLLM world-knowledge priors and visual reasoning for downstream vision tasks such as recommendation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Equipping large language models (LLMs) with search engines via reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective approach for building search agents. However, overreliance on search introduces unnecessary cost and risks exposure to noisy or malicious content, while relying solely on parametric knowledge risks hallucination. The central challenge is to develop agents that adaptively balance parametric knowledge with external search, invoking search only when necessary. Prior work mitigates search overuse by shaping rewards around the number of tool calls. However, these penalties require substantial reward engineering, provide ambiguous credit assignment, and can be exploited by agents that superficially reduce calls. Moreover, evaluating performance solely through call counts conflates necessary and unnecessary search, obscuring the measurement of true adaptive behavior. To address these limitations, we first quantify the self-knowledge awareness of existing search agents via an F1-based decision metric, revealing that methods such as Search-R1 often overlook readily available parametric knowledge. Motivated by these findings, we propose AdaSearch, a simple two-stage, outcome-driven RL framework that disentangles problem solving from the decision of whether to invoke search, and makes this decision process explicit and interpretable. This transparency is crucial for high-stakes domains such as finance and medical question answering, yet is largely neglected by prior approaches. Experiments across multiple model families and sizes demonstrate that AdaSearch substantially improves knowledge-boundary awareness, reduces unnecessary search calls, preserves strong task performance, and offers more transparent, interpretable decision behaviors.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Invisible watermarking is essential for tracing the provenance of digital content. However, training state-of-the-art models remains notoriously difficult, with current approaches often struggling to balance robustness against true imperceptibility. This work introduces Pixel Seal, which sets a new state-of-the-art for image and video watermarking. We first identify three fundamental issues of existing methods: (i) the reliance on proxy perceptual losses such as MSE and LPIPS that fail to mimic human perception and result in visible watermark artifacts; (ii) the optimization instability caused by conflicting objectives, which necessitates exhaustive hyperparameter tuning; and (iii) reduced robustness and imperceptibility of watermarks when scaling models to high-resolution images and videos. To overcome these issues, we first propose an adversarial-only training paradigm that eliminates unreliable pixel-wise imperceptibility losses. Second, we introduce a three-stage training schedule that stabilizes convergence by decoupling robustness and imperceptibility. Third, we address the resolution gap via high-resolution adaptation, employing JND-based attenuation and training-time inference simulation to eliminate upscaling artifacts. We thoroughly evaluate the robustness and imperceptibility of Pixel Seal on different image types and across a wide range of transformations, and show clear improvements over the state-of-the-art. We finally demonstrate that the model efficiently adapts to video via temporal watermark pooling, positioning Pixel Seal as a practical and scalable solution for reliable provenance in real-world image and video settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We explore a novel analysis framework for parameter inference with large-scale CMB polarization data. Our method uses simulation-based inference combined with the needlet internal linear combination (NILC) algorithm and cross-correlation-based statistics to compress the data into a vector that is robust to model misspecification and small enough to be amenable to neural posterior estimation with normalizing flows. By leveraging this compressed data representation, our method enables the robust use of the anisotropic and non-Gaussian information in the foreground fields to more accurately separate the CMB polarization signal from these contaminants. Using an idealized ground-based experimental setup inspired by the Simons Observatory Small Aperture Telescopes, we demonstrate improved statistical constraining power for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ compared to the (constrained) NILC algorithm and improved robustness to complex foregrounds compared to other techniques in the literature. Trained on a relatively simple semi-analytical foreground model, the method yields unbiased $r$ results across a range of PySM Galactic foreground simulations, including the high-complexity d12 model, for which we obtain $r=(1.09 \pm 0.27)\cdot 10^{-2}$ for input $r=0.01$ and sky fraction $f_{\mathrm{sky}} = 0.21$. We thus demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of a complete, maps-to-parameters, simulation-based analysis of large-scale CMB polarization for current ground-based observatories.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Treatment noncompliance is pervasive in infectious disease cluster-randomized trials. Although all individuals within a cluster are assigned the same treatment condition, the treatment uptake status may vary across individuals due to noncompliance. We propose a semiparametric framework to evaluate the individual compliance effect and network assignment effect within principal stratum exhibiting different patterns of noncompliance. The individual compliance effect captures the portion of the treatment effect attributable to changes in treatment receipt, while the network assignment effect reflects the pure impact of treatment assignment and spillover among individuals within the same cluster. Unlike prior efforts which either empirically identify or interval identify these estimands, we characterize new structural assumptions for nonparametric point identification. We then develop semiparametrically efficient estimators that combine data-adaptive machine learning methods with efficient influence functions to enable more robust inference. Additionally, we introduce sensitivity analysis methods to study the impact under assumption violations, and apply the proposed methods to reanalyze a cluster-randomized trial in Kenya that evaluated the impact of school-based mass deworming on disease transmission.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver exceptional performance across natural language tasks but demand substantial computational resources, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Existing compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning, often degrade critical linguistic properties and lack formal guarantees for preserving model behavior. We propose Temporal Logic-Guided Large Language Model Compression (TOGGLE), a novel framework that leverages Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to formally specify and enforce linguistic properties during compression. TOGGLE employs an STL robustness-guided Bayesian optimization to systematically explore layer-wise quantization and pruning configurations, generating compressed models that formally satisfy specified linguistic constraints without retraining or fine-tuning. Evaluating TOGGLE on four LLM architectures (GPT-2, DeepSeek-V2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B, and Mistral 7B), we achieve up to 3.3x reduction in computational costs (FLOPs) and up to a 68.8% reduction in model size while satisfying all linguistic properties. TOGGLE represents the first integration of formal methods into LLM compression, enabling efficient, verifiable deployment of LLMs on edge hardware.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The convergence of artificial AI and XR technologies (AI XR) promises innovative applications across many domains. However, the sensitive nature of data (e.g., eye-tracking) used in these systems raises significant privacy concerns, as adversaries can exploit these data and models to infer and leak personal information through membership inference attacks (MIA) and re-identification (RDA) with a high success rate. Researchers have proposed various techniques to mitigate such privacy attacks, including differential privacy (DP). However, AI XR datasets often contain numerous features, and applying DP uniformly can introduce unnecessary noise to less relevant features, degrade model accuracy, and increase inference time, limiting real-time XR deployment. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework combining explainable AI (XAI) and DP-enabled privacy-preserving mechanisms to defend against privacy attacks. Specifically, we leverage post-hoc explanations to identify the most influential features in AI XR models and selectively apply DP to those features during inference. We evaluate our XAI-guided DP approach on three state-of-the-art AI XR models and three datasets: cybersickness, emotion, and activity classification. Our results show that the proposed method reduces MIA and RDA success rates by up to 43% and 39%, respectively, for cybersickness tasks while preserving model utility with up to 97% accuracy using Transformer models. Furthermore, it improves inference time by up to ~2x compared to traditional DP approaches. To demonstrate practicality, we deploy the XAI-guided DP AI XR models on an HTC VIVE Pro headset and develop a user interface (UI), namely PrivateXR, allowing users to adjust privacy levels (e.g., low, medium, high) while receiving real-time task predictions, protecting user privacy during XR gameplay.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled the training of large language model (LLM) agents to interact with the environment and to solve multi-turn long-horizon tasks. However, the RL-trained agents often struggle in tasks that require active exploration and fail to efficiently adapt from trial-and-error experiences. In this paper, we present LaMer, a general Meta-RL framework that enables LLM agents to actively explore and learn from the environment feedback at test time. LaMer consists of two key components: (i) a cross-episode training framework to encourage exploration and long-term rewards optimization; and (ii) in-context policy adaptation via reflection, allowing the agent to adapt their policy from task feedback signal without gradient update. Experiments across diverse environments show that LaMer significantly improves performance over RL baselines, with 11%, 14%, and 19% performance gains on Sokoban, MineSweeper and Webshop, respectively. Moreover, LaMer also demonstrates better generalization to more challenging or previously unseen tasks compared to the RL-trained agents. Overall, our results demonstrate that Meta-RL provides a principled approach to induce exploration in language agents, enabling more robust adaptation to novel environments through learned exploration strategies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based language models have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, yet their high inference latency poses a significant challenge for real-timeand large-scale deployment. While existing caching mechanisms,such as token-level key-value caches, offer speedups in autore-gressive decoding, they are limited in scope and applicability. In this paper, we present LLMCache, a novel layer-wise caching framework that accelerates transformer inference by reusing intermediate activations based on semantic similarity of input sequences. Unlike prior work, LLMCache is model-agnostic,operates across both encoder and decoder architectures, and supports caching at arbitrary transformer layers. We introduce a lightweight fingerprinting mechanism for matching seman-tically similar inputs and propose adaptive eviction strategies to manage cache staleness. Experiments on BERT and GPT-2 across SQuAD, WikiText-103, and OpenBookQA show up to 3.1 X speedup in inference time with <0.5% accuracy degradation. Our results highlight LLMCache as a practical and general-purpose solution for optimizing transformer inference in real-world applications

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Time-critical networking requires low-latency decisions from sparse and bursty telemetry, where fixed-step neural inference waste computation. We introduce Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS), a two-state neuron whose variables correspond to normalised queue occupancy and a recovery resource. NOS combines a saturating excitability nonlinearity for finite buffers, service and damping leaks, graph-local inputs with per-link gates and delays, and differentiable resets compatible with surrogate gradients and neuromorphic deployment. We establish existence and uniqueness of subthreshold equilibria, derive Jacobian-based local stability tests, and obtain a scalar network stability threshold that separates topology from node physics through a Perron-mode spectral condition. A stochastic arrival model aligned with telemetry smoothing links NOS responses to classical queueing behaviour while explaining increased variability near stability margins. Across chain, star, and scale-free graphs, NOS improves early-warning F1 and detection latency over MLP, RNN, GRU, and temporal-GNN baselines under a common residual-based protocol, while providing practical calibration and stability rules suited to resource-constrained networking deployments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mixture models postulate the overall population as a mixture of finite subpopulations with unobserved membership. Fitting mixture models usually requires large sample sizes and combining data from multiple sites can be beneficial. However, sharing individual participant data across sites is often less feasible due to various types of practical constraints, such as data privacy concerns. Moreover, substantial heterogeneity may exist across sites, and locally identified latent classes may not be comparable across sites. We propose a unified modeling framework where a common definition of the latent classes is shared across sites and heterogeneous mixing proportions of latent classes are allowed to account for between-site heterogeneity. To fit the heterogeneous mixture model on multi-site data, we propose a novel distributed Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm where at each iteration a density ratio tilted surrogate Q function is constructed to approximate the standard Q function of the EM algorithm as if the data from multiple sites could be pooled together. Theoretical analysis shows that our estimator achieves the same contraction property as the estimators derived from the EM algorithm based on the pooled data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Neural network controllers increasingly demand millions of parameters, and language model approaches push into the billions. For embedded aerospace systems with strict power and latency constraints, this scaling is prohibitive. We present Tiny Recursive Control (TRC), a neural architecture based on a counterintuitive principle: capacity can emerge from iteration depth rather than parameter count. TRC applies compact networks (approximately 1.5M parameters) repeatedly through a two-level hierarchical latent structure, refining control sequences by simulating trajectories and correcting based on tracking error. Because the same weights process every refinement step, adding iterations increases computation without increasing memory. We evaluate TRC on nonlinear control problems including oscillator stabilization and powered descent with fuel constraints. Across these domains, TRC achieves near-optimal control costs while requiring only millisecond-scale inference on GPU and under 10~MB memory, two orders of magnitude smaller than language model baselines. These results demonstrate that recursive reasoning, previously confined to discrete tasks, transfers effectively to continuous control synthesis.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern LLM applications such as deep-research assistants, coding agents, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, repeatedly process long prompt histories containing shared document or code chunks, creating significant pressure on the Key Value (KV) cache, which must operate within limited memory while sustaining high throughput and low latency. Prefix caching partially alleviates some of these costs by reusing KV cache for previously processed tokens, but limited by strict prefix matching. Position-independent caching (PIC) enables chunk-level reuse at arbitrary positions, but requires selective recomputation and positional-encoding (PE) adjustments. However, because these operations vary across queries, KV for the same chunk diverges across requests. Moreover, without page alignment, chunk KV layouts diverge in memory, preventing page sharing. These issues result in only modest HBM savings even when many requests reuse the same content.   We present MEPIC, a memory-efficient PIC system that enables chunk KV reuse across positions, requests, and batches. MEPIC aligns chunk KV to paged storage, shifts recomputation from token- to block-level so only the first block is request-specific, removes positional encodings via Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) fusion in the attention kernel, and makes remaining blocks fully shareable. These techniques eliminate most duplicate chunk KV in HBM, reducing usage by up to 2x over state-of-the-art PIC at comparable latency and accuracy, and up to 5x for long prompts, without any model changes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational components of modern software systems. As their influence grows, concerns about fairness have become increasingly pressing. Prior work has proposed metamorphic testing to detect fairness issues, applying input transformations to uncover inconsistencies in model behavior. This paper introduces an alternative perspective for testing counterfactual fairness in LLMs, proposing a structured and intent-aware framework coined CAFFE (Counterfactual Assessment Framework for Fairness Evaluation). Inspired by traditional non-functional testing, CAFFE (1) formalizes LLM-Fairness test cases through explicitly defined components, including prompt intent, conversational context, input variants, expected fairness thresholds, and test environment configuration, (2) assists testers by automatically generating targeted test data, and (3) evaluates model responses using semantic similarity metrics. Our experiments, conducted on three different architectural families of LLM, demonstrate that CAFFE achieves broader bias coverage and more reliable detection of unfair behavior than existing metamorphic approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Translating natural language (NL) into a formal language such as temporal logic (TL) is integral for human communication with robots and autonomous systems. State-of-the-art approaches decompose the task into a lifting of atomic propositions (APs) phase and a translation phase. However, existing methods struggle with accurate lifting, the existence of co-references, and learning from limited data. In this paper, we propose a framework for NL to TL translation called Grammar Forced Translation (GraFT). The framework is based on the observation that previous work solves both the lifting and translation steps by letting a language model iteratively predict tokens from its full vocabulary. In contrast, GraFT reduces the complexity of both tasks by restricting the set of valid output tokens from the full vocabulary to only a handful in each step. The solution space reduction is obtained by exploiting the unique properties of each problem. We also provide a theoretical justification for why the solution space reduction leads to more efficient learning. We evaluate the effectiveness of GraFT using the CW, GLTL, and Navi benchmarks. Compared with state-of-the-art translation approaches, it can be observed that GraFT the end-to-end translation accuracy by 5.49% and out-of-domain translation accuracy by 14.06% on average.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We live in a multivariate world, and effective construction, allocation, forecasting, and risk analysis of financial portfolios simply is not possible without explicitly modeling the dependence structure of their assets. Dependence structure can drive portfolio results more than the combined effects of other parameters in investment and risk models, but the literature provides relatively little to define the finite-sample distributions of dependence measures under challenging, real-world financial data conditions. Yet this is exactly what is needed to make valid and useable inferences about their estimates for essential purposes, such as hypothesis testing, dynamic monitoring, realistic and granular (reverse) scenario analyses, and mitigating the effects of correlation breakdowns during market upheavals. This work develops a new and straightforward method, Nonparametric Angles-based Correlation (NAbC), for defining the finite-sample distribution of any dependence measure whose matrix of pairwise associations is positive definite (e.g. Pearsons, Kendalls, Spearmans, Tail Dependence Matrix, and others). NAbC remains valid under marginal asset distributions with notably different and varying degrees of serial correlation, non-stationarity, heavy-tailedness, and asymmetry. It provides p-values and confidence intervals at both the matrix level and the pairwise cell level, for both one and two-sample tests, with analytic consistency across levels. It provides these results even when selected cells in the matrix are frozen, thus enabling flexible, granular, and realistic scenarios and stress tests. Finally, when applied to directional dependence measures, NAbC enables accurate DAG recovery in causal modeling. NAbC stands alone in providing all of these capabilities, and should prove to be a very useful means by which we can better manage financial portfolios in our multivariate world.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models achieve strong generalization in robotic manipulation but remain largely reactive and 2D-centric, making them unreliable in tasks that require precise 3D reasoning. We propose GeoPredict, a geometry-aware VLA framework that augments a continuous-action policy with predictive kinematic and geometric priors. GeoPredict introduces a trajectory-level module that encodes motion history and predicts multi-step 3D keypoint trajectories of robot arms, and a predictive 3D Gaussian geometry module that forecasts workspace geometry with track-guided refinement along future keypoint trajectories. These predictive modules serve exclusively as training-time supervision through depth-based rendering, while inference requires only lightweight additional query tokens without invoking any 3D decoding. Experiments on RoboCasa Human-50, LIBERO, and real-world manipulation tasks show that GeoPredict consistently outperforms strong VLA baselines, especially in geometry-intensive and spatially demanding scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Continual Learning (CL) aims to incrementally acquire new knowledge while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Within this setting, Online Continual Learning (OCL) focuses on updating models promptly and incrementally from single or small batches of observations from a data stream. Extending OCL to graph-structured data is crucial, as many real-world networks evolve over time and require timely, online predictions. However, existing continual or streaming graph learning methods typically assume access to entire graph snapshots or multiple passes over tasks, violating the efficiency constraints of the online setting. To address this gap, we introduce the Online Continual Graph Learning (OCGL) setting, which formalizes node-level continual learning on evolving graphs under strict memory and computational budgets. OCGL defines how a model incrementally processes a stream of node-level information while maintaining anytime inference and respecting resource constraints. We further establish a comprehensive benchmark comprising seven datasets and nine CL strategies, suitably adapted to the OCGL setting, enabling a standardized evaluation setup. Finally, we present a minimalistic yet competitive baseline for OCGL, inspired by our benchmarking results, that achieves strong empirical performance with high efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) grounds large language models (LLMs) in external evidence, but fails when retrieved sources conflict or contain outdated or subjective information. Prior work address these issues independently but lack unified reasoning supervision. We propose a reasoning-trace-augmented RAG framework that adds structured, interpretable reasoning across three stages : (1) document-level adjudication, (2) conflict analysis, and (3) grounded synthesis, producing citation-linked answers or justified refusals. A Conflict-Aware Trust-Score (CATS) pipeline is introduced which evaluates groundedness, factual correctness, refusal accuracy, and conflict-behavior alignment using an LLM-as-a-Judge. Our 539-query reasoning dataset and evaluation pipeline establish a foundation for conflict-aware, interpretable RAG systems. Experimental results demonstrate substantial gains over baselines, most notably with Qwen, where Supervised Fine-Tuning improved End-to-End answer correctness from 0.069 to 0.883 and behavioral adherence from 0.074 to 0.722.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While comments are non-functional elements of source code, Large Language Models (LLM) frequently rely on them to perform Software Engineering (SE) tasks. Yet, where in the model this reliance resides, and how it affects performance, remains poorly understood. We present the first concept-level interpretability study of LLMs in SE, analyzing three tasks - code completion, translation, and refinement - through the lens of internal comment representation. Using Concept Activation Vectors (CAV), we show that LLMs not only internalize comments as distinct latent concepts but also differentiate between subtypes such as Javadocs, inline, and multiline comments. By systematically activating and deactivating these concepts in the LLMs' embedding space, we observed significant, model-specific, and task-dependent shifts in performance ranging from -90% to +67%. Finally, we conducted a controlled experiment using the same set of code inputs, prompting LLMs to perform 10 distinct SE tasks while measuring the activation of the comment concept within their latent representations. We found that code summarization consistently triggered the strongest activation of comment concepts, whereas code completion elicited the weakest sensitivity. These results open a new direction for building SE tools and models that reason about and manipulate internal concept representations rather than relying solely on surface-level input.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Leaving posterior sensitivity concerns aside, non-identifiability of the parameters does not raise a difficulty for Bayesian inference as far as the posterior is proper, but multi-modality or flat regions of the posterior induced by the lack of identification leaves a challenge for modern Bayesian computation. Sampling methods often struggle with slow or non-convergence when dealing with multiple modes or flat regions of the target distributions. This paper develops a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach for non-identified models, leveraging the knowledge of observationally equivalent sets of parameters, and highlights an important role that identification plays in modern Bayesian analysis.We show that our identification-aware proposal eliminates mode entrapment, achieving a convergence rate uniformly bounded away from zero, in sharp contrast to the exponentially decaying rates characterizing standard Random Walk Metropolis and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Simulation studies show its superior performance compared to other popular computational methods including Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo. We also demonstrate that our method uncovers non-trivial modes in the target distribution in a structural vector moving-average (SVMA) application.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Bandits with preference feedback present a powerful tool for optimizing unknown target functions when only pairwise comparisons are allowed instead of direct value queries. This model allows for incorporating human feedback into online inference and optimization and has been employed in systems for fine-tuning large language models. The problem is well understood in simplified settings with linear target functions or over finite small domains that limit practical interest. Taking the next step, we consider infinite domains and nonlinear (kernelized) rewards. In this setting, selecting a pair of actions is quite challenging and requires balancing exploration and exploitation at two levels: within the pair, and along the iterations of the algorithm. We propose MAXMINLCB, which emulates this trade-off as a zero-sum Stackelberg game, and chooses action pairs that are informative and yield favorable rewards. MAXMINLCB consistently outperforms existing algorithms and satisfies an anytime-valid rate-optimal regret guarantee. This is due to our novel preference-based confidence sequences for kernelized logistic estimators.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present Kling-Omni, a generalist generative framework designed to synthesize high-fidelity videos directly from multimodal visual language inputs. Adopting an end-to-end perspective, Kling-Omni bridges the functional separation among diverse video generation, editing, and intelligent reasoning tasks, integrating them into a holistic system. Unlike disjointed pipeline approaches, Kling-Omni supports a diverse range of user inputs, including text instructions, reference images, and video contexts, processing them into a unified multimodal representation to deliver cinematic-quality and highly-intelligent video content creation. To support these capabilities, we constructed a comprehensive data system that serves as the foundation for multimodal video creation. The framework is further empowered by efficient large-scale pre-training strategies and infrastructure optimizations for inference. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Kling-Omni demonstrates exceptional capabilities in in-context generation, reasoning-based editing, and multimodal instruction following. Moving beyond a content creation tool, we believe Kling-Omni is a pivotal advancement toward multimodal world simulators capable of perceiving, reasoning, generating and interacting with the dynamic and complex worlds.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present FlowDet, the first formulation of object detection using modern Conditional Flow Matching techniques. This work follows from DiffusionDet, which originally framed detection as a generative denoising problem in the bounding box space via diffusion. We revisit and generalise this formulation to a broader class of generative transport problems, while maintaining the ability to vary the number of boxes and inference steps without re-training. In contrast to the curved stochastic transport paths induced by diffusion, FlowDet learns simpler and straighter paths resulting in faster scaling of detection performance as the number of inference steps grows. We find that this reformulation enables us to outperform diffusion based detection systems (as well as non-generative baselines) across a wide range of experiments, including various precision/recall operating points using multiple feature backbones and datasets. In particular, when evaluating under recall-constrained settings, we can highlight the effects of the generative transport without over-compensating with large numbers of proposals. This provides gains of up to +3.6% AP and +4.2% AP$_{rare}$ over DiffusionDet on the COCO and LVIS datasets, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Natural language (NL) to temporal logic (TL) translation enables engineers to specify, verify, and enforce system behaviors without manually crafting formal specifications-an essential capability for building trustworthy autonomous systems. While existing NL-to-TL translation frameworks have demonstrated encouraging initial results, these systems either explicitly assume access to accurate atom grounding or suffer from low grounded translation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework for Grounding Natural Language Into System Signatures for Temporal Logic translation called GinSign. The framework introduces a grounding model that learns the abstract task of mapping NL spans onto a given system signature: given a lifted NL specification and a system signature $\mathcal{S}$, the classifier must assign each lifted atomic proposition to an element of the set of signature-defined atoms $\mathcal{P}$. We decompose the grounding task hierarchically -- first predicting predicate labels, then selecting the appropriately typed constant arguments. Decomposing this task from a free-form generation problem into a structured classification problem permits the use of smaller masked language models and eliminates the reliance on expensive LLMs. Experiments across multiple domains show that frameworks which omit grounding tend to produce syntactically correct lifted LTL that is semantically nonequivalent to grounded target expressions, whereas our framework supports downstream model checking and achieves grounded logical-equivalence scores of $95.5\%$, a $1.4\times$ improvement over SOTA.

Their ability to perceive, reason, and act through natural language understanding enables autonomous problem-solving in complex pervasive environments, including the management of heterogeneous sensors, devices, and data. This survey outlines the architectural components of LLM agents (profiling, memory, planning, and action) and examines their deployment and evaluation across various scenarios. Than it reviews computational and infrastructural advancements (cloud to edge) in pervasive computing and how AI is moving in this field. It highlights state-of-the-art agent deployment strategies and applications, including local and distributed execution on resource-constrained devices. This survey identifies key challenges of these agents in pervasive computing such as architectural, energetic and privacy limitations. It finally proposes what we called "Agent as a Tool", a conceptual framework for pervasive agentic AI, emphasizing context awareness, modularity, security, efficiency and effectiveness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) architectures are the most popular design for language modeling. Energy-based modeling is a different paradigm that views inference as a dynamical process operating on an energy landscape. We propose a minimal modification of the GPT setting to unify it with the EBM framework. The inference step of our model, which we call eNeRgy-GPT (NRGPT), is conceptualized as an exploration of the tokens on the energy landscape. We prove, and verify empirically, that under certain circumstances this exploration becomes gradient descent, although they don't necessarily lead to the best performing models. We demonstrate that our model performs well for simple language (Shakespeare dataset), algebraic ListOPS tasks, and richer settings such as OpenWebText language modeling. We also observe that our models may be more resistant to overfitting, doing so only during very long training.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Autonomous driving has long relied on modular "Perception-Decision-Action" pipelines, where hand-crafted interfaces and rule-based components often break down in complex or long-tailed scenarios. Their cascaded design further propagates perception errors, degrading downstream planning and control. Vision-Action (VA) models address some limitations by learning direct mappings from visual inputs to actions, but they remain opaque, sensitive to distribution shifts, and lack structured reasoning or instruction-following capabilities. Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal learning has motivated the emergence of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks, which integrate perception with language-grounded decision making. By unifying visual understanding, linguistic reasoning, and actionable outputs, VLAs offer a pathway toward more interpretable, generalizable, and human-aligned driving policies. This work provides a structured characterization of the emerging VLA landscape for autonomous driving. We trace the evolution from early VA approaches to modern VLA frameworks and organize existing methods into two principal paradigms: End-to-End VLA, which integrates perception, reasoning, and planning within a single model, and Dual-System VLA, which separates slow deliberation (via VLMs) from fast, safety-critical execution (via planners). Within these paradigms, we further distinguish subclasses such as textual vs. numerical action generators and explicit vs. implicit guidance mechanisms. We also summarize representative datasets and benchmarks for evaluating VLA-based driving systems and highlight key challenges and open directions, including robustness, interpretability, and instruction fidelity. Overall, this work aims to establish a coherent foundation for advancing human-compatible autonomous driving systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as epistemic partners in everyday reasoning, yet their errors remain predominantly analyzed through predictive metrics rather than through their interpretive effects on human judgment. This study examines how different forms of epistemic failure emerge, are masked, and are tolerated in human AI interaction, where failure is understood as a relational breakdown shaped by model-generated plausibility and human interpretive judgment. We conducted a three round, multi LLM evaluation using interdisciplinary tasks and progressively differentiated assessment frameworks to observe how evaluators interpret model responses across linguistic, epistemic, and credibility dimensions. Our findings show that LLM errors shift from predictive to hermeneutic forms, where linguistic fluency, structural coherence, and superficially plausible citations conceal deeper distortions of meaning. Evaluators frequently conflated criteria such as correctness, relevance, bias, groundedness, and consistency, indicating that human judgment collapses analytical distinctions into intuitive heuristics shaped by form and fluency. Across rounds, we observed a systematic verification burden and cognitive drift. As tasks became denser, evaluators increasingly relied on surface cues, allowing erroneous yet well formed answers to pass as credible. These results suggest that error is not solely a property of model behavior but a co-constructed outcome of generative plausibility and human interpretive shortcuts. Understanding AI epistemic failure therefore requires reframing evaluation as a relational interpretive process, where the boundary between system failure and human miscalibration becomes porous. The study provides implications for LLM assessment, digital literacy, and the design of trustworthy human AI communication.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> [...] This paper presents AutoRAN, an automated, intent-driven framework for zero-touch provisioning of open, programmable cellular networks. Leveraging cloud-native principles, AutoRAN employs virtualization, declarative infrastructure-as-code templates, and disaggregated micro-services to abstract physical resources and protocol stacks. Its orchestration engine integrates Language Models (LLMs) to translate high-level intents into machine-readable configurations, enabling closed-loop control via telemetry-driven observability. Implemented on a multi-architecture OpenShift cluster with heterogeneous compute (x86/ARM CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs) and multi-vendor Radio Access Network (RAN) hardware (Foxconn, NI), AutoRAN automates deployment of O-RAN-compliant stacks-including OpenAirInterface, NVIDIA ARC RAN, Open5GS core, and O-RAN Software Community (OSC) RIC components-using CI/CD pipelines. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoRAN is capable of deploying an end-to-end Private 5G network in less than 60 seconds with 1.6 Gbps throughput, validating its ability to streamline configuration, accelerate testing, and reduce manual intervention with similar performance than non cloud-based implementations. With its novel LLM-assisted intent translation mechanism, and performance-optimized automation workflow for multi-vendor environments, AutoRAN has the potential of advancing the robustness of next-generation cellular supply chains through reproducible, intent-based provisioning across public and private deployments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> When performing 3D manipulation tasks, robots have to execute action planning based on perceptions from multiple fixed cameras. The multi-camera setup introduces substantial redundancy and irrelevant information, which increases computational costs and forces the model to spend extra training time extracting crucial task-relevant details. To filter out redundant information and accurately extract task-relevant features, we propose the VERM (Virtual Eye for Robotic Manipulation) method, leveraging the knowledge in foundation models to imagine a virtual task-adaptive view from the constructed 3D point cloud, which efficiently captures necessary information and mitigates occlusion. To facilitate 3D action planning and fine-grained manipulation, we further design a depth-aware module and a dynamic coarse-to-fine procedure. Extensive experimental results on both simulation benchmark RLBench and real-world evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods while achieving 1.89x speedup in training time and 1.54x speedup in inference speed.

We provide baseline results using three pretrained multilingual language models and two large language models to compare the performance of recent models and facilitate future research in NER. We find that no single model is best in all languages and that significant work remains to obtain high performance from LLMs on the NER task. OpenNER is released at https://github.com/bltlab/open-ner.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Edge transport barriers (ETBs) in magnetically confined fusion plasmas, commonly known as pedestals, play a crucial role in achieving high confinement plasmas. However, their defining characteristic, a steep rise in plasma pressure over short length scales, makes them challenging to diagnose experimentally. In this work, we use Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to develop first-principles metrics for quantifying the spatiotemporal resolution limits of inferring differentiable profiles of temperature, pressure, or other quantities from experimental measurements. Although we focus on pedestals, the methods are fully general and can be applied to any setting involving the inference of profiles from discrete measurements. First, we establish a correspondence between GPR and low-pass filtering, giving an explicit expression for the effective `cutoff frequency' associated with smoothing incurred by GPR. Second, we introduce a novel information-theoretic metric, \(N_{eff}\), which measures the effective number of data points contributing to the inferred value of a profile or its derivative. These metrics enable a quantitative assessment of the trade-off between `over-fitting' and `over-regularization', providing both practitioners and consumers of GPR with a systematic way to evaluate the credibility of inferred profiles. We apply these tools to develop practical advice for using GPR in both time-independent and time-dependent settings, and demonstrate their usage on inferring pedestal profiles using measurements from the DIII-D tokamak.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose POLAR, a novel radar-guided depth estimation method that introduces polynomial fitting to efficiently transform scaleless depth predictions from pretrained monocular depth estimation (MDE) models into metric depth maps. Unlike existing approaches that rely on complex architectures or expensive sensors, our method is grounded in a fundamental insight: although MDE models often infer reasonable local depth structure within each object or local region, they may misalign these regions relative to one another, making a linear scale and shift (affine) transformation insufficient given three or more of these regions. To address this limitation, we use polynomial coefficients predicted from cheap, ubiquitous radar data to adaptively adjust predictions non-uniformly across depth ranges. In this way, POLAR generalizes beyond affine transformations and is able to correct such misalignments by introducing inflection points. Importantly, our polynomial fitting framework preserves structural consistency through a novel training objective that enforces local monotonicity via first-derivative regularization. POLAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets, outperforming existing methods by an average of 24.9% in MAE and 33.2% in RMSE, while also achieving state-of-the-art efficiency in terms of latency and computational cost.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Simulation-based inference (SBI) with neural posterior estimation (NPE) provides rapid X-ray spectral fitting in both Gaussian and Poisson regimes by learning approximate parameter posteriors from simulations. We investigate auto-encoders for compressing high-resolution X-ray spectra, motivated by newAthena X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU), and use likelihood-based importance sampling to refine NPE outputs. Our auto-encoder maps spectra to a low-dimensional latent space and is trained with a custom loss equal to the Cash statistic (C-stat) between simulated and reconstructed spectra. A neural density estimator is then trained on the latent representations. Both models are trained in multiple rounds: at each round, new simulations are drawn from a truncated proposal concentrated around the observation, improving efficiency as the proposal contracts. After NPE convergence, we apply likelihood-based importance sampling to correct the learned posterior. To assess information retention, we train a diagnostic network that predicts the original spectral parameters from the latent space, and we also train a network to learn the likelihood directly to accelerate importance sampling. On X-IFU-like simulations, the auto-encoder and multi-round NPE outperforms PCA and hand-crafted spectral summaries in accuracy and robustness. After importance sampling, the resulting posteriors are statistically indistinguishable from those obtained with nested sampling. On a standard laptop, the full pipeline (simulation, compression, inference, correction) delivers 10x speedups. We further demonstrate the approach on XRISM/Resolve and on lower-resolution NICER and XMM-Newton EPIC-pn data, confirming applicability across instruments and resolutions. Overall, NPE on compressed spectra paired with likelihood-based importance sampling offers an exact yet efficient alternative for Bayesian X-ray spectral fitting.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Voice-based interaction has emerged as a natural and intuitive modality for controlling IoT devices. However, speech-driven edge devices face a fundamental trade-off between cloud-based solutions, which offer stronger language understanding capabilities at the cost of latency, connectivity dependence, and privacy concerns, and edge-based solutions, which provide low latency and improved privacy but are limited by computational constraints. This paper presents ASTA, an adaptive speech-to-action solution that dynamically routes voice commands between edge and cloud inference to balance performance and system resource utilization. ASTA integrates on-device automatic speech recognition and lightweight offline language-model inference with cloud-based LLM processing, guided by real-time system metrics such as CPU workload, device temperature, and network latency. A metric-aware routing mechanism selects the inference path at runtime, while a rule-based command validation and repair component ensures successful end-to-end command execution. We implemented our solution on an NVIDIA Jetson-based edge platform and evaluated it using a diverse dataset of 80 spoken commands. Experimental results show that ASTA successfully routes all input commands for execution, achieving a balanced distribution between online and offline inference. The system attains an ASR accuracy of 62.5% and generates executable commands without repair for only 47.5% of inputs, highlighting the importance of the repair mechanism in improving robustness. These results suggest that adaptive edge-cloud orchestration is a viable approach for resilient and resource-aware voice-controlled IoT systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We study the computation of lower and upper probabilities of hitting a target set of states for imprecise Markov chains. For these, transition uncertainty is modelled by a convex set of transition matrices. In the precise case, hitting probabilities are the minimal nonnegative solution of a linear system and admit a closed-form expression. We study the notion of reachability in the imprecise setting. The literature review highlights few different definitions of lower reachability; thus we explore the relations among them, presenting examples to clarify their logical implications. Using this revised definition of reachability for imprecise Markov chain, we partition the state space into classes of states whose hitting probabilities are trivially zero or one and those which require further computation. For these nontrivial states, we show that lower and upper hitting probabilities are the unique solutions of two nonlinear fixed-point equations. For the practical computation of lower and upper hitting probabilities, we propose iterative algorithms that alternate between solving a linear system and choosing an extreme point from the set of transition matrices. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, in practice, these algorithms converge in substantially fewer iterations than the theoretically established worst-case bound.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As efficient alternatives to softmax Attention, linear State-Space Models (SSMs) achieve constant memory and linear compute, but maintain only a lossy, fading summary of the past, often leading to inferior performance in recall-oriented tasks. We propose Gated KalmaNet (GKA), a layer that accounts for the full past while maintaining SSM-style efficiency. We ground our approach in the Kalman Filter (KF) framework, which provides a principled solution for optimal inference in dynamical systems. We show that several existing SSM layers (DeltaNet, Gated DeltaNet, and Kimi Delta Attention) are approximations to the KF recurrence that assume identity error covariance, thereby ignoring how past measurements (keys and values) should optimally influence state updates. In contrast, GKA computes the exact Kalman gain by maintaining the full error covariance. Under a steady-state assumption that enables parallelization, this reduces to solving an online ridge regression problem with constant memory and linear compute cost. A critical insight is that standard KF equations are numerically unstable in low-precision environments (like bfloat16) and hard to parallelize on modern hardware. We address this through: (1) adaptive regularization with input-dependent gating to control the condition number of the ridge regression for numerical stability, and (2) Chebyshev Iteration, which we show is more stable than conventional iterative solvers in low-precision settings. We further develop hardware-aware chunk-wise kernels to enable efficient training. Empirically, GKA outperforms existing SSM layers (like Mamba2 and Gated DeltaNet) on short-context tasks and achieves more than 10\% relative improvement on long-context RAG and LongQA tasks up to 128k tokens.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reinforcement learning (RL) systems have countless applications, from energy-grid management to protein design. However, such real-world scenarios are often extremely difficult, combinatorial in nature, and require complex coordination between multiple agents. This level of complexity can cause even state-of-the-art RL systems, trained until convergence, to hit a performance ceiling which they are unable to break out of with zero-shot inference. Meanwhile, many digital or simulation-based applications allow for an inference phase that utilises a specific time and compute budget to explore multiple attempts before outputting a final solution. In this work, we show that such an inference phase employed at execution time, and the choice of a corresponding inference strategy, are key to breaking the performance ceiling observed in complex multi-agent RL problems. Our main result is striking: we can obtain up to a 126% and, on average, a 45% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art across 17 tasks, using only a couple seconds of extra wall-clock time during execution. We also demonstrate promising compute scaling properties, supported by over 60k experiments, making it the largest study on inference strategies for complex RL to date.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Stellar flares are an intense stellar activity that can significantly impact the atmospheric composition of the surrounding planets and even the possible existence of life. During such events, the radiative energy of the star is primarily concentrated in the optical and X-ray bands, with the X-ray flux potentially increasing by tens or even hundreds of times. Einstein Probe (EP) detected a new X-ray transient EP J2322.1-0301 on 27 September 2024. Its spatial localization shows a high positional coincidence with the nearby high proper motion K-type star PM J23221-0301. Follow-up X-ray observations confirmed the flux enhancement of the source, while optical spectroscopic monitoring revealed time-variable features, particularly the disappearance of the H-alpha emission line. This X-ray flare is consistent with a characteristic fast-rise-exponential-decay (FRED) light curve, with a rise timescale of 1.4 ks, a decay timescale of 5.7 ks, and a total duration of about 7.1 ks. The peak luminosity in the 0.5-4.0 keV energy band reached about 1.3 x 10^31 erg s^-1, with a total energy release of about 9.1 x 10^34 erg, consistent with the empirical energy correlations observed in magnetic-reconnection-driven stellar flares, as inferred from the multitemperature plasma structure and H-alpha-X-ray energy correlation. This discovery underscores EP's capability in understanding stellar magnetic activity via observing stellar transients.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapidly growing demand for high-quality data in Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified the need for scalable, reliable, and semantically rich data preparation pipelines. However, current practices remain dominated by ad-hoc scripts and loosely specified workflows, which lack principled abstractions, hinder reproducibility, and offer limited support for model-in-the-loop data generation. To address these challenges, we present DataFlow, a unified and extensible LLM-driven data preparation framework. DataFlow is designed with system-level abstractions that enable modular, reusable, and composable data transformations, and provides a PyTorch-style pipeline construction API for building debuggable and optimizable dataflows. The framework consists of nearly 200 reusable operators and six domain-general pipelines spanning text, mathematical reasoning, code, Text-to-SQL, agentic RAG, and large-scale knowledge extraction. To further improve usability, we introduce DataFlow-Agent, which automatically translates natural-language specifications into executable pipelines via operator synthesis, pipeline planning, and iterative verification. Across six representative use cases, DataFlow consistently improves downstream LLM performance. Our math, code, and text pipelines outperform curated human datasets and specialized synthetic baselines, achieving up to +3\% execution accuracy in Text-to-SQL over SynSQL, +7\% average improvements on code benchmarks, and 1--3 point gains on MATH, GSM8K, and AIME. Moreover, a unified 10K-sample dataset produced by DataFlow enables base models to surpass counterparts trained on 1M Infinity-Instruct data. These results demonstrate that DataFlow provides a practical and high-performance substrate for reliable, reproducible, and scalable LLM data preparation, and establishes a system-level foundation for future data-centric AI development.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Neural rendering for interactive applications requires translating geometric and material properties (G-buffer) to photorealistic images with realistic lighting on a frame-by-frame basis. While recent diffusion-based approaches show promise for G-buffer-conditioned image synthesis, they face critical limitations: single-image models like RGBX generate frames independently without temporal consistency, while video models like DiffusionRenderer are too computationally expensive for most consumer gaming sets ups and require complete sequences upfront, making them unsuitable for interactive applications where future frames depend on user input. We introduce FrameDiffuser, an autoregressive neural rendering framework that generates temporally consistent, photorealistic frames by conditioning on G-buffer data and the models own previous output. After an initial frame, FrameDiffuser operates purely on incoming G-buffer data, comprising geometry, materials, and surface properties, while using its previously generated frame for temporal guidance, maintaining stable, temporal consistent generation over hundreds to thousands of frames. Our dual-conditioning architecture combines ControlNet for structural guidance with ControlLoRA for temporal coherence. A three-stage training strategy enables stable autoregressive generation. We specialize our model to individual environments, prioritizing consistency and inference speed over broad generalization, demonstrating that environment-specific training achieves superior photorealistic quality with accurate lighting, shadows, and reflections compared to generalized approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increased availability of genetic data has transformed genomics research, but raised many privacy concerns regarding its handling due to its sensitive nature. This work explores the use of language models (LMs) for the generation of synthetic genetic mutation profiles, leveraging differential privacy (DP) for the protection of sensitive genetic data. We empirically evaluate the privacy guarantees of our DP modes by introducing a novel Biologically-Informed Hybrid Membership Inference Attack (biHMIA), which combines traditional black box MIA with contextual genomics metrics for enhanced attack power. Our experiments show that both small and large transformer GPT-like models are viable synthetic variant generators for small-scale genomics, and that our hybrid attack leads, on average, to higher adversarial success compared to traditional metric-based MIAs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models often face a three-way trade-off among detection accuracy, inference latency, and deployment cost when used in real-world safety-sensitive applications. This paper introduces Prefix Probing, a black-box harmful content detection method that compares the conditional log-probabilities of "agreement/execution" versus "refusal/safety" opening prefixes and leverages prefix caching to reduce detection overhead to near first-token latency. During inference, the method requires only a single log-probability computation over the probe prefixes to produce a harmfulness score and apply a threshold, without invoking any additional models or multi-stage inference. To further enhance the discriminative power of the prefixes, we design an efficient prefix construction algorithm that automatically discovers highly informative prefixes, substantially improving detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Prefix Probing achieves detection effectiveness comparable to mainstream external safety models while incurring only minimal computational cost and requiring no extra model deployment, highlighting its strong practicality and efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in reinforcement learning for large language models have converged on increasing complexity: multi-stage training pipelines, dynamic hyperparameter schedules, and curriculum learning strategies. This raises a fundamental question: \textbf{Is this complexity necessary?} We present \textbf{JustRL}, a minimal approach using single-stage training with fixed hyperparameters that achieves state-of-the-art performance on two 1.5B reasoning models (54.9\% and 64.3\% average accuracy across nine mathematical benchmarks) while using 2$\times$ less compute than sophisticated approaches. The same hyperparameters transfer across both models without tuning, and training exhibits smooth, monotonic improvement over 4,000+ steps without the collapses or plateaus that typically motivate interventions. Critically, ablations reveal that adding ``standard tricks'' like explicit length penalties and robust verifiers may degrade performance by collapsing exploration. These results suggest that the field may be adding complexity to solve problems that disappear with a stable, scaled-up baseline. We release our models and code to establish a simple, validated baseline for the community.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> API integration is a cornerstone of our digital infrastructure, enabling software systems to connect and interact. However, as shown by many studies, writing or generating correct code to invoke APIs, particularly web APIs, is challenging. Although large language models (LLMs) have become popular in software development, their effectiveness in automating the generation of web API integration code remains unexplored. In order to address this, we present WAPIIBench, a dataset and evaluation pipeline designed to assess the ability of LLMs to generate web API invocation code. Our experiments with several open-source LLMs reveal that generating API invocations poses a significant challenge, resulting in hallucinated endpoints, incorrect argument usage, and other errors. None of the evaluated open-source models was able to solve more than 40% of the tasks. Motivated by those findings, we explore the potential of constrained decoding for generating API invocations. To this end, we propose an automatic translation from API specifications to constraints. Our approach prevents violations of API usage rules and significantly increases the overall correctness of the generated code, on average by 90% and 135%, depending on the provided starter code.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Crowdsourced model evaluation platforms, such as Chatbot Arena, enable real-time evaluation from human perspectives to assess the quality of model responses. In the coding domain, manually examining the quality of LLM-generated content is extremely challenging, as it requires understanding long chunks of raw code and deliberately simulating code execution. To this end, we introduce BigCodeArena, an open human evaluation platform for code generation backed by a comprehensive and on-the-fly execution environment. Built on top of Chatbot Arena, BigCodeArena enables the execution of LLM-generated code and allows humans to interact with the execution process and outcomes. We collected over 14,000 raw code-centric conversation sessions across 10 widely used LLMs, spanning 10 languages and 8 types of execution environments. Among these conversations, we identified more than 4,700 multi-turn samples with pairwise human preferences. Further analysis uncovers underexplored preferences of LLMs in fine-grained domains characterized by tasks, languages, and frameworks. To systematically examine code understanding and generation capabilities of frontier LLMs, we curated two benchmarks based on the collected data, namely BigCodeReward and AutoCodeArena. For BigCodeReward, we post-processed the 4,700 conversations and evaluated the consistency between reward models and human preferences. The evaluation shows that most LLMs have superior performance in judging coding preferences when the execution results are available. Inspired by these findings, we propose AutoCodeArena, an automatic Elo rating benchmark designed to assess the coding quality of LLMs without human involvement. We find that proprietary LLMs like GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Claude-Opus-4 still lead in code generation performance among recent emerging models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Agentic AI systems, built upon large language models (LLMs) and deployed in multi-agent configurations, are redefining intelligence, autonomy, collaboration, and decision-making across enterprise and societal domains. This review presents a structured analysis of Trust, Risk, and Security Management (TRiSM) in the context of LLM-based Agentic Multi-Agent Systems (AMAS). We begin by examining the conceptual foundations of Agentic AI and highlight its architectural distinctions from traditional AI agents. We then adapt and extend the AI TRiSM framework for Agentic AI, structured around key pillars: \textit{ Explainability, ModelOps, Security, Privacy} and \textit{their Lifecycle Governance}, each contextualized to the challenges of AMAS. A risk taxonomy is proposed to capture the unique threats and vulnerabilities of Agentic AI, ranging from coordination failures to prompt-based adversarial manipulation. To support practical assessment in Agentic AI works, we introduce two novel metrics: the Component Synergy Score (CSS), which quantifies the quality of inter-agent collaboration, and the Tool Utilization Efficacy (TUE), which evaluates the efficiency of tool use within agent workflows. We further discuss strategies for improving explainability in Agentic AI, as well as approaches to enhancing security and privacy through encryption, adversarial robustness, and regulatory compliance. The review concludes with a research roadmap for the responsible development and deployment of Agentic AI, highlighting key directions to align emerging systems with TRiSM principles-ensuring safety, transparency, and accountability in their operation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Astrophysical black holes are likely to be surrounded by various forms of matter in the form of disks or halos. While a number of studies have examined the impact of an environment on the lensing of light or gravitational waves from cosmological sources, these have, thus far, been carried out in either a Newtonian or post-Newtonian framework where the environment is superimposed on the black-hole spacetime. By using an exact solution in general relativity describing a black hole embedded within a realistic halo of Hernquist matter distribution, we study deflection angles and image amplification in a fully relativistic setup. It is shown that large ``bumps'', that also arise at the Newtonian and post-Newtonian levels, track the transition scale set by the halo parameters that control the strong-lensing upturn and can significantly adjust the inferences made for either the source or lens in various contexts. As an application, we consider ``echoes'' of gravitational waves, sourced by astrophysical lenses rather than being intrinsic to the compact object that produces the signal.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce Stackelberg Learning from Human Feedback (SLHF), a new framework for preference optimization. SLHF frames the alignment problem as a sequential-move game between two policies: a Leader, which commits to an action, and a Follower, which responds conditionally on the Leader's action. This approach decomposes preference optimization into a refinement problem for the Follower and an optimization problem against an adversary for the Leader. Unlike Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which assigns scalar rewards to actions, or Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF), which seeks a simultaneous-move equilibrium, SLHF leverages the asymmetry of sequential play to capture richer preference structures. The sequential design of SLHF naturally enables inference-time refinement, as the Follower learns to improve the Leader's actions, and these refinements can be leveraged through iterative sampling. We compare the solution concepts of SLHF, RLHF, and NLHF, and lay out key advantages in consistency, data sensitivity, and robustness to intransitive preferences. Experiments on large language models demonstrate that SLHF achieves strong alignment across diverse preference datasets, scales from 0.5B to 8B parameters, and yields inference-time refinements that transfer across model families without further fine-tuning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) dominate the far-infrared and sub-millimetre number counts, but single-dish surveys suffer from poor angular resolution, complicating mult-wavelength counterpart identification. Prior-driven deblending techniques require extensive fine-tuning and struggle to process large fields. This work aims to develop a fast, reliable deep-learning based deconvolution and denoising super-resolution (SR) technique. We employ a transformer neural network to improve the resolution of Herschel/SPIRE 500 $μ$m observations by a factor 4.5, using Spitzer/MIPS 24$μ$m and Herschel/SPIRE 250, 350, 500$μ$m images. Trained on SIDES and SHARK simulations, we injected instrumental noise into the input simulated images, while keeping the target images noise-free to enhance de-noising capabilities of our method.   We evaluated the performance on simulated test sets and real JCMT/SCUBA-2 450 $μ$m observations in the COSMOS field which have superior resolution compared to Herschel. Our SR method achieves an inference time of $1s/deg^2$ on consumer GPUs, much faster than traditional deblending techniques. Using the simulation test sets, we show that fluxes of the extracted sources from the super-resolved image are accurate to within 5% for sources with an intrinsic flux $\gtrsim$ 8 mJy, which is a substantial improvement compared to blind extraction on the native images. Astrometric error is low ($\lesssim$ 1" vs 12" pixel scale). Reliability is $\gtrsim$ 90% for sources $>$3 mJy and $>$90% of sources with intrinsic fluxes $\gtrsim5$ mJy are recovered. Applied to real 500 $μ$m observations, fluxes of the extracted sources from the super-resolved map agree well with SCUBA-2 measured fluxes for sources $\geq$10 mJy. Our technique enables SR over hundreds of $deg^2$ without the need for fine-tuning, facilitating statistical analysis of DSFGs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Learning-based model predictive control has emerged as a powerful approach for handling complex dynamics in mechatronic systems, enabling data-driven performance improvements while respecting safety constraints. However, when computational resources are severely limited, as in battery-powered tools with embedded processors, existing approaches struggle to meet real-time requirements. In this paper, we address the problem of real-time torque control for impact wrenches, where high-frequency control updates are necessary to accurately track the fast transients occurring during periodic impact events, while maintaining high-performance safety-critical control that mitigates harmful vibrations and component wear. The key novelty of the approach is that we combine data-driven model augmentation through Gaussian process regression with neural network approximation of the resulting control policy. This insight allows us to deploy predictive control on resource-constrained embedded platforms while maintaining both constraint satisfaction and microsecond-level inference times. The proposed framework is evaluated through numerical simulations and hardware experiments on a custom impact wrench testbed. The results show that our approach successfully achieves real-time control suitable for high-frequency operation while maintaining constraint satisfaction and improving tracking accuracy compared to baseline PID control.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Future telescopes such as the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE) will enable mid-infrared characterisation of the atmospheres of nearby rocky exoplanets. Whilst 4D spatial and temporal variations of Earth as an exoplanet are below spectroscopic detection limits, such variability is planet-specific. We investigate LIFE's ability to detect 4D variability in the atmospheres of tidally locked exoplanets. We create daily synthetic LIFE observations of Proxima Centauri b in a 1:1 and an eccentric 3:2 spin-orbit resonance (SOR), using LIFEsim on spectra from daily 3D climate-chemistry model output of an aquaplanet with Earth-like composition. Hemispheric distributions of temperature, clouds, and chemical species determine spectral signatures and variability with orbital phase angle. Such variability dictates the extent to which parameters can be reliably inferred from snapshot spectra at arbitrary viewing geometries. In the 1:1 SOR, MIR spectra vary significantly with viewing geometry and indirectly probe atmospheric circulation. Nightside temperature inversions generate O3, CO2, and H2O emission features, though these lie below LIFE's detection threshold, and instead O3 features disappear at certain phase angles. In contrast, the 3:2 SOR yields a more homogeneous atmosphere with weaker phase variability but enhanced bolometric flux due to eccentric heating. Phase-resolved LIFE observations confidently distinguish between the SORs and capture seasonal O3 variability for golden targets like Proxima Centauri b. In case of abiotic O2/O3 build-up, the O3 variability presents a potential false positive scenario. Hence, LIFE can disentangle different spin-orbit states and resolve 4D atmospheric variability, enabling daily characterisation of the 4D physical and chemical state of nearby terrestrial worlds. Importantly, this characterisation requires phase-resolved rather than snapshot spectra.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) set the state of the art in visual generation, yet their quadratic self-attention cost fundamentally limits scaling to long token sequences. Recent Top-K sparse attention approaches reduce the computation of DiTs by compressing tokens into block-wise representation and selecting a small set of relevant key blocks, but still suffer from (i) quadratic selection cost on compressed tokens and (ii) increasing K required to maintain model quality as sequences grow. We identify that their inefficiency is due to the single-level design, as a single coarse level is insufficient to represent the global structure. In this paper, we introduce Log-linear Sparse Attention (LLSA), a trainable sparse attention mechanism for extremely long token sequences that reduces both selection and attention costs from quadratic to log-linear complexity by utilizing a hierarchical structure. LLSA performs hierarchical Top-K selection, progressively adopting sparse Top-K selection with the indices found at the previous level, and introduces a Hierarchical KV Enrichment mechanism that preserves global context while using fewer tokens of different granularity during attention computation. To support efficient training, we develop a high-performance GPU implementation that uses only sparse indices for both the forward and backward passes, eliminating the need for dense attention masks. We evaluate LLSA on high-resolution pixel-space image generation without using patchification and VAE encoding. LLSA accelerates attention inference by 28.27x and DiT training by 6.09x on 256x256 pixel token sequences, while maintaining generation quality. The results demonstrate that LLSA offers a promising direction for training long-sequence DiTs efficiently. Code is available at: https://github.com/SingleZombie/LLSA

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Spatial transcriptomics (ST) enables simultaneous mapping of tissue morphology and spatially resolved gene expression, offering unique opportunities to study tumor microenvironment heterogeneity. Here, we introduce a computational framework that predicts spatial pathway activity directly from hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained histology images at microscale resolution 55 and 100 um. Using image features derived from a computational pathology foundation model, we found that TGFb signaling was the most accurately predicted pathway across three independent breast and lung cancer ST datasets. In 87-88% of reliably predicted cases, the resulting spatial TGFb activity maps reflected the expected contrast between tumor and adjacent non-tumor regions, consistent with the known role of TGFb in regulating interactions within the tumor microenvironment. Notably, linear and nonlinear predictive models performed similarly, suggesting that image features may relate to pathway activity in a predominantly linear fashion or that nonlinear structure is small relative to measurement noise. These findings demonstrate that features extracted from routine histopathology may recover spatially coherent and biologically interpretable pathway patterns, offering a scalable strategy for integrating image-based inference with ST information in tumor microenvironment studies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Wildfires pose an increasingly severe threat to air quality, yet quantifying their causal impact remains challenging due to unmeasured meteorological and geographic confounders. Moreover, wildfire impacts on air quality may exhibit heterogeneous effects across pollution levels, which conventional mean-based causal methods fail to capture. To address these challenges, we develop a Quantile-based Latent Spatial Confounder Model (QLSCM) that substitutes conditional expectations with conditional quantiles, enabling causal analysis across the entire outcome distribution. We establish the causal interpretation of QLSCM theoretically, prove the identifiability of causal effects, and demonstrate estimator consistency under mild conditions. Simulations confirm the bias correction capability and the advantage of quantile-based inference over mean-based approaches. Applying our method to contiguous US wildfire and air quality data, we uncover important heterogeneous effects: fire radiative power exerts significant positive causal effects on aerosol optical depth at high quantiles in Western states like California and Oregon, while insignificant at lower quantiles. This indicates that wildfire impacts on air quality primarily manifest during extreme pollution events. Regional analyses reveal that Western and Northwestern regions experience the strongest causal effects during such extremes. These findings provide critical insights for environmental policy by identifying where and when mitigation efforts would be most effective.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce Refusal Steering, an inference-time method to exercise fine-grained control over Large Language Models refusal behaviour on politically sensitive topics without retraining. We replace fragile pattern-based refusal detection with an LLM-as-a-judge that assigns refusal confidence scores and we propose a ridge-regularized variant to compute steering vectors that better isolate the refusal--compliance direction. On Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking, our method removes the refusal behaviour of the model around politically sensitive topics while maintaining safety on JailbreakBench and near-baseline performance on general benchmarks. The approach generalizes across 4B and 80B models and can also induce targeted refusals when desired. We analize the steering vectors and show that refusal signals concentrate in deeper layers of the transformer and are distributed across many dimensions. Together, these results demonstrate that activation steering can remove political refusal behaviour while retaining safety alignment for harmful content, offering a practical path to controllable, transparent moderation at inference time.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper provides clear and practical guidance on the specification of imputation models when multiple imputation is used in conjunction with doubly robust estimation methods for causal inference. Through theoretical arguments and targeted simulations, we demonstrate that if a confounder has missing data, the corresponding imputation model must include all variables appearing in either the propensity score model or the outcome model, in addition to both the exposure and the outcome, and that these variables must enter the imputation model in the same functional form as in the final analysis. Violating these conditions can lead to biased treatment effect estimates, even when both components of the doubly robust estimator are correctly specified. We present a mathematical framework for doubly robust estimation combined with multiple imputation, establish the theoretical requirements for proper imputation in this setting, and demonstrate the consequences of misspecification through simulation. Based on these findings, we offer concrete recommendations to ensure valid inference when using multiple imputation with doubly robust methods in applied causal analyses.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> API misuse in code generated by large language models (LLMs) presents a serious and growing challenge in software development, as although LLMs demonstrate impressive code generation capabilities, their interactions with complex library APIs are often error-prone and can lead to software failures and vulnerabilities. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale study of API misuse patterns in LLM-generated code by analyzing both method selection and parameter usage across Python and Java, using three representative LLMs: StarCoder-7B, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B, and GitHub Copilot. Based on extensive manual annotation of 3,209 method-level and 3,492 parameter-level misuses, we identify and categorize four recurring misuse types by building on and refining prior API misuse taxonomies. Our evaluation of the three LLMs reveals persistent challenges in API usage, particularly hallucination and intent misalignment. To address these issues, we propose Dr.Fix, an LLM-based automatic repair approach guided by our taxonomy, which improves repair accuracy compared to baseline prompting and existing repair methods, achieving gains of up to 38.4 BLEU and 40% exact match on benchmark datasets. This work offers important insights into the current limitations of LLMs in API usage and points to directions for improving automated misuse repair in code generation systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a major chronic respiratory disease with persistent airflow limitation, is a leading global cause of disability and mortality. Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely collected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the early detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over time. However, most current AI models for COPD diagnosis are limited to outputting classification results without providing a rationale for their diagnostic process, while current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot understand spirograms yet, which severely limits their clinical trust and adoption. To tackle this challenge, we leverage a cohort of 234,028 individuals from the UK Biobank (UKB) to propose SpiroLLM, the first multimodal large language model that can understand spirogram. The model extracts morphological features from respiratory curves via a SpiroEncoder and aligns them with PFT numerical values in a unified latent space using a SpiroProjector, ultimately empowering a large language model to generate a comprehensive diagnostic report. Experimental results confirm that SpiroLLM achieved a diagnostic AUROC of 0.8977 (95% CI: 0.88-0.91). In a robustness test with missing core data, it maintained a 100% valid response rate, far surpassing the 13.4% of a text-only model and showcasing the superiority of its multimodal design. This work demonstrates the substantial potential of deeply fusing physiological signals with large language models, establishing a new paradigm for the next generation of interpretable and reliable clinical decision support tools.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion models have shown remarkable capacity in image synthesis based on their U-shaped architecture and convolutional neural networks (CNN) as basic blocks. The locality of the convolution operation in CNN may limit the model's ability to understand long-range semantic information. To address this issue, we propose Yuan-TecSwin, a text-conditioned diffusion model with Swin-transformer in this work. The Swin-transformer blocks take the place of CNN blocks in the encoder and decoder, to improve the non-local modeling ability in feature extraction and image restoration. The text-image alignment is improved with a well-chosen text encoder, effective utilization of text embedding, and careful design in the incorporation of text condition. Using an adapted time step to search in different diffusion stages, inference performance is further improved by 10%. Yuan-TecSwin achieves the state-of-the-art FID score of 1.37 on ImageNet generation benchmark, without any additional models at different denoising stages. In a side-by-side comparison, we find it difficult for human interviewees to tell the model-generated images from the human-painted ones.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present Cornserve, an efficient online serving system for an emerging class of multimodal models called Any-to-Any models. Any-to-Any models accept combinations of text and multimodal data (e.g., image, video, audio) as input and also generate combinations of text and multimodal data as output, introducing request type, computation path, and computation scaling heterogeneity in model serving.   Cornserve allows model developers to describe the computation graph of generic Any-to-Any models, which consists of heterogeneous components such as multimodal encoders, autoregressive models like Large Language Models (LLMs), and multimodal generators like Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). Given this, Cornserve's planner automatically finds an optimized deployment plan for the model, including whether and how to disaggregate the model into smaller components based on model and workload characteristics. Cornserve's distributed runtime then executes the model per the plan, efficiently handling Any-to-Any model heterogeneity during online serving. Evaluations show that Cornserve can efficiently serve diverse Any-to-Any models and workloads, delivering up to 3.81$\times$ throughput improvement and up to 5.79$\times$ tail latency reduction over existing solutions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Images shared online strongly influence emotions and public well-being. Understanding the emotions an image elicits is therefore vital for fostering healthier and more sustainable digital communities, especially during public crises. We study Visual Emotion Elicitation (VEE), predicting the set of emotions that an image evokes in viewers. We introduce VAEER, an interpretable multi-label VEE framework that combines attention-inspired cue extraction with knowledge-grounded reasoning. VAEER isolates salient visual foci and contextual signals, aligns them with structured affective knowledge, and performs per-emotion inference to yield transparent, emotion-specific rationales. Across three heterogeneous benchmarks, including social imagery and disaster-related photos, VAEER achieves state-of-the-art results with up to 19% per-emotion improvements and a 12.3% average gain over strong CNN and VLM baselines. Our findings highlight interpretable multi-label emotion elicitation as a scalable foundation for responsible visual media analysis and emotionally sustainable online ecosystems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Contrastive learning has demonstrated promising potential in recommender systems. Existing methods typically construct sparser views by randomly perturbing the original interaction graph, as they have no idea about the authentic user preferences. Owing to the sparse nature of recommendation data, this paradigm can only capture insufficient semantic information. To address the issue, we propose InfoDCL, a novel diffusion-based contrastive learning framework for recommendation. Rather than injecting randomly sampled Gaussian noise, we employ a single-step diffusion process that integrates noise with auxiliary semantic information to generate signals and feed them to the standard diffusion process to generate authentic user preferences as contrastive views. Besides, based on a comprehensive analysis of the mutual influence between generation and preference learning in InfoDCL, we build a collaborative training objective strategy to transform the interference between them into mutual collaboration. Additionally, we employ multiple GCN layers only during inference stage to incorporate higher-order co-occurrence information while maintaining training efficiency. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that InfoDCL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our InfoDCL offers an effective solution for enhancing recommendation performance and suggests a novel paradigm for applying diffusion method in contrastive learning frameworks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The quadratic computational complexity of MultiHead SelfAttention (MHSA) remains a fundamental bottleneck in scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) for longcontext tasks. While sparse and linearized attention mechanisms attempt to mitigate this, they often compromise the representation of global dependencies or fail to capture multiscale semantic granularity effectively. In this paper, we propose Multiscale Aggregated Hierarchical Attention (MAHA), a novel architectural framework that reformulates the attention mechanism through hierarchical decomposition and mathematically rigorous aggregation. Unlike conventional approaches that treat token interactions at a single resolution, MAHA dynamically partitions the input sequence into hierarchical scales via learnable downsampling operators. The core innovation lies in its aggregation strategy: we model the fusion of scalespecific attention matrices as a resource allocation problem, solved via a convex optimization framework or a Nash equilibriumbased gametheoretic approach. This ensures a theoretically optimal balance between local nuance and global context fidelity. Implemented within a hybrid dilatedconvolutional transformer backbone, MAHA utilizes differentiable optimization layers to enable endtoend training. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that MAHA achieves superior scalability; empirical FLOPs analysis confirms an 81% reduction in computational cost at a sequence length of 4096 compared to standard attention. This work bridges the gap between optimization theory and sequence modeling, offering a scalable solution for nextgeneration LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained attention for aligning large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The actor-only variants of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are widely applied for their efficiency. These algorithms incorporate a clipping mechanism to improve stability. Besides, a regularization term, such as the reverse KL-divergence or a more general \(f\)-divergence, is introduced to prevent policy drift. Despite their empirical success, a rigorous theoretical understanding of the problem and the algorithm's properties is limited. This paper advances the theoretical foundations of the PPO-Clip algorithm by analyzing a deterministic actor-only PPO algorithm within the general RL setting with \(f\)-divergence regularization under the softmax policy parameterization. We derive a non-uniform Lipschitz smoothness condition and a Łojasiewicz inequality for the considered problem. Based on these, a non-asymptotic linear convergence rate to the globally optimal policy is established for the forward KL-regularizer. Furthermore, stationary convergence and local linear convergence are derived for the reverse KL-regularizer.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present a dynamic reconstruction system that receives a casual monocular RGB video as input, and outputs a complete and persistent reconstruction of the scene. In other words, we reconstruct not only the the currently visible parts of the scene, but also all previously viewed parts, which enables replaying the complete reconstruction across all timesteps.   Our method decomposes the scene into a set of rigid 3D primitives, which are assumed to be moving throughout the scene. Using estimated dense 2D correspondences, we jointly infer the rigid motion of these primitives through an optimisation pipeline, yielding a 4D reconstruction of the scene, i.e. providing 3D geometry dynamically moving through time. To achieve this, we also introduce a mechanism to extrapolate motion for objects that become invisible, employing motion-grouping techniques to maintain continuity.   The resulting system enables 4D spatio-temporal awareness, offering capabilities such as replayable 3D reconstructions of articulated objects through time, multi-object scanning, and object permanence. On object scanning and multi-object datasets, our system significantly outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved from simple chatbots into sophisticated agents capable of automating complex real-world tasks, where browsing and reasoning over live web content is key to assessing retrieval and cognitive skills. Existing benchmarks like BrowseComp and xBench-DeepSearch emphasize complex reasoning searches requiring multi-hop synthesis but neglect Fuzzy Exploratory Search, namely queries that are vague and multifaceted, where users seek the most relevant webpage rather than a single factual answer. To address this gap, we introduce Needle in the Web, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate modern search agents and LLM-based systems on their ability to retrieve and reason over real-world web content in response to ambiguous, exploratory queries under varying levels of difficulty. Needle in the Web comprises 663 questions spanning seven distinct domains. To ensure high query quality and answer uniqueness, we employ a flexible methodology that reliably generates queries of controllable difficulty based on factual claims of web contents. We benchmark three leading LLMs and three agent-based search systems on Needle in the Web, finding that most models struggle: many achieve below 35% accuracy, and none consistently excel across domains or difficulty levels. These findings reveal that Needle in the Web presents a significant challenge for current search systems and highlights the open problem of effective fuzzy retrieval under semantic ambiguity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for code vulnerability detection, their reliability and robustness across diverse vulnerability types have become a pressing concern. In traditional adversarial settings, code obfuscation has long been used as a general strategy to bypass auditing tools, preserving exploitability without tampering with the tools themselves. Numerous efforts have explored obfuscation methods and tools, yet their capabilities differ in terms of supported techniques, granularity, and programming languages, making it difficult to systematically assess their impact on LLM-based vulnerability detection. To address this gap, we provide a structured systematization of obfuscation techniques and evaluate them under a unified framework. Specifically, we categorize existing obfuscation methods into three major classes (layout, data flow, and control flow) covering 11 subcategories and 19 concrete techniques. We implement these techniques across four programming languages (Solidity, C, C++, and Python) using a consistent LLM-driven approach, and evaluate their effects on 15 LLMs spanning four model families (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Qwen, and LLaMA), as well as on two coding agents (GitHub Copilot and Codex). Our findings reveal both positive and negative impacts of code obfuscation on LLM-based vulnerability detection, highlighting conditions under which obfuscation leads to performance improvements or degradations. We further analyze these outcomes with respect to vulnerability characteristics, code properties, and model attributes. Finally, we outline several open problems and propose future directions to enhance the robustness of LLMs for real-world vulnerability detection.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents with advanced capabilities for understanding, reasoning, and interacting across diverse tasks. The addition of memory further enhances them by enabling continuity across interactions, learning from past experiences, and improving the relevance of actions and responses over time; termed as memory-enhanced personalization. Although such personalization through memory offers clear benefits, it also introduces risks of bias. While several previous studies have highlighted bias in ML and LLMs, bias due to memory-enhanced personalized agents is largely unexplored. Using recruitment as an example use case, we simulate the behavior of a memory-enhanced personalized agent, and study whether and how bias is introduced and amplified in and across various stages of operation. Our experiments on agents using safety-trained LLMs reveal that bias is systematically introduced and reinforced through personalization, emphasizing the need for additional protective measures or agent guardrails in memory-enhanced LLM-based AI agents.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deploying local large language models and vision-language models on edge devices requires balancing accuracy with constrained computational and energy budgets. Although graphics processors dominate modern artificial-intelligence deployment, most consumer hardware--including laptops, desktops, industrial controllers, and embedded systems--relies on central processing units. Despite this, the computational laws governing central-processing-unit-only inference for local language and vision-language workloads remain largely unexplored. We systematically benchmark large language and vision-language models on two representative central-processing-unit tiers widely used for local inference: a MacBook Pro M2, reflecting mainstream laptop-class deployment, and a Raspberry Pi 5, representing constrained, low-power embedded settings. Using a unified methodology based on continuous sampling of processor and memory usage together with area-under-curve integration, we characterize how computational load scales with input text length for language models and with image resolution for vision-language models. We uncover two empirical scaling laws: (1) computational cost for language-model inference scales approximately linearly with token length; and (2) vision-language models exhibit a preprocessing-driven "resolution knee", where compute remains constant above an internal resolution clamp and decreases sharply below it. Beyond these laws, we show that quantum-inspired compression reduces processor and memory usage by up to 71.9% and energy consumption by up to 62%, while preserving or improving semantic accuracy. These results provide a systematic quantification of multimodal central-processing-unit-only scaling for local language and vision-language workloads, and they identify model compression and input-resolution preprocessing as effective, low-cost levers for sustainable edge inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This study investigated the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for simplifying biomedical texts to enhance health literacy. Using a public dataset, which included plain language adaptations of biomedical abstracts, we developed and evaluated several approaches, specifically a baseline approach using a prompt template, a two AI agent approach, and a fine-tuning approach. We selected OpenAI gpt-4o and gpt-4o mini models as baselines for further research. We evaluated our approaches with quantitative metrics, such as Flesch-Kincaid grade level, SMOG Index, SARI, and BERTScore, G-Eval, as well as with qualitative metric, more precisely 5-point Likert scales for simplicity, accuracy, completeness, brevity. Results showed a superior performance of gpt-4o-mini and an underperformance of FT approaches. G-Eval, a LLM based quantitative metric, showed promising results, ranking the approaches similarly as the qualitative metric.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have achieved impressive zero-shot recognition performance but remain highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations, posing significant risks in safety-critical scenarios. Previous training-time defenses rely on adversarial fine-tuning, which requires labeled data and costly retraining, while existing test-time strategies fail to reliably distinguish between clean and adversarial inputs, thereby preventing both adversarial robustness and clean accuracy from reaching their optimum. To address these limitations, we propose Test-Time Padding (TTP), a lightweight defense framework that performs adversarial detection followed by targeted adaptation at inference. TTP identifies adversarial inputs via the cosine similarity shift between CLIP feature embeddings computed before and after spatial padding, yielding a universal threshold for reliable detection across architectures and datasets. For detected adversarial cases, TTP employs trainable padding to restore disrupted attention patterns, coupled with a similarity-aware ensemble strategy for a more robust final prediction. For clean inputs, TTP leaves them unchanged by default or optionally integrates existing test-time adaptation techniques for further accuracy gains. Comprehensive experiments on diverse CLIP backbones and fine-grained benchmarks show that TTP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art test-time defenses, delivering substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without compromising clean accuracy. The code for this paper will be released soon.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> When a single pilot is responsible for managing a multi-drone system, the task may demand varying levels of autonomy, from direct control of individual UAVs, to group-level coordination, to fully autonomous swarm behaviors for accomplishing high-level tasks. Enabling such flexible interaction requires a framework that supports multiple modes of shared autonomy. As language models continue to improve in reasoning and planning, they provide a natural foundation for such systems, reducing pilot workload by enabling high-level task delegation through intuitive, language-based interfaces. In this paper we present TACOS (Task-Agnostic COordinator of a multi-drone System), a unified framework that enables high-level natural language control of multi-UAV systems through Large Language Models (LLMs). TACOS integrates three key capabilities into a single architecture: a one-to-many natural language interface for intuitive user interaction, an intelligent coordinator for translating user intent into structured task plans, and an autonomous agent that executes plans interacting with the real world. TACOS allows a LLM to interact with a library of executable APIs, bridging semantic reasoning with real-time multi-robot coordination. We demonstrate the system on a real-world multi-drone system, and conduct an ablation study to assess the contribution of each module.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Existing diffusion-based video generation methods are fundamentally constrained by sequential computation and long-horizon inconsistency, limiting their practical adoption in real-time, streaming audio-driven avatar synthesis. We present Live Avatar, an algorithm-system co-designed framework that enables efficient, high-fidelity, and infinite-length avatar generation using a 14-billion-parameter diffusion model. Our approach introduces Timestep-forcing Pipeline Parallelism (TPP), a distributed inference paradigm that pipelines denoising steps across multiple GPUs, effectively breaking the autoregressive bottleneck and ensuring stable, low-latency real-time streaming. To further enhance temporal consistency and mitigate identity drift and color artifacts, we propose the Rolling Sink Frame Mechanism (RSFM), which maintains sequence fidelity by dynamically recalibrating appearance using a cached reference image. Additionally, we leverage Self-Forcing Distribution Matching Distillation to facilitate causal, streamable adaptation of large-scale models without sacrificing visual quality. Live Avatar demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, reaching 20 FPS end-to-end generation on 5 H800 GPUs, and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to achieve practical, real-time, high-fidelity avatar generation at this scale. Our work establishes a new paradigm for deploying advanced diffusion models in industrial long-form video synthesis applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The processing of omnidirectional 360-degree images poses significant challenges for object detection due to inherent spatial distortions, wide fields of view, and ultra-high-resolution inputs. Conventional detectors such as YOLO are optimised for standard image sizes (for example, 640x640 pixels) and often struggle with the computational demands of 4K or higher-resolution imagery typical of 360-degree vision. To address these limitations, we introduce YOLO11-4K, an efficient real-time detection framework tailored for 4K panoramic images. The architecture incorporates a novel multi-scale detection head with a P2 layer to improve sensitivity to small objects often missed at coarser scales, and a GhostConv-based backbone to reduce computational complexity without sacrificing representational power. To enable evaluation, we manually annotated the CVIP360 dataset, generating 6,876 frame-level bounding boxes and producing a publicly available, detection-ready benchmark for 4K panoramic scenes. YOLO11-4K achieves 0.95 mAP at 0.50 IoU with 28.3 milliseconds inference per frame, representing a 75 percent latency reduction compared to YOLO11 (112.3 milliseconds), while also improving accuracy (mAP at 0.50 of 0.95 versus 0.908). This balance of efficiency and precision enables robust object detection in expansive 360-degree environments, making the framework suitable for real-world high-resolution panoramic applications. While this work focuses on 4K omnidirectional images, the approach is broadly applicable to high-resolution detection tasks in autonomous navigation, surveillance, and augmented reality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Humans assess image quality through a perception-reasoning cascade, integrating sensory cues with implicit reasoning to form self-consistent judgments. In this work, we investigate how a model can acquire both human-like and self-consistent reasoning capability for blind image quality assessment (BIQA). We first collect human evaluation data that capture several aspects of human perception-reasoning pipeline. Then, we adopt reinforcement learning, using human annotations as reward signals to guide the model toward human-like perception and reasoning. To enable the model to internalize self-consistent reasoning capability, we design a reward that drives the model to infer the image quality purely from self-generated descriptions. Empirically, our approach achieves score prediction performance comparable to state-of-the-art BIQA systems under general metrics, including Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. In addition to the rating score, we assess human-model alignment using ROUGE-1 to measure the similarity between model-generated and human perception-reasoning chains. On over 1,000 human-annotated samples, our model reaches a ROUGE-1 score of 0.512 (cf. 0.443 for baseline), indicating substantial coverage of human explanations and marking a step toward human-like interpretable reasoning in BIQA.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present a Bayesian comparative analysis of five cosmological models: $Λ$CDM, $w$CDM, $w_0w_a$CDM, $φ$CDM (with scalar-field dark energy), and an interacting dark energy scenario (the $ξ$-index model), to investigate dark energy evolution and the Hubble tension. Utilizing the latest data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2 (Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, BAO), Pantheon+ (Type Ia Supernovae, SNIa), and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data (including lensing) from \textit{Planck} and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), we report three key findings. First, the Hubble constant ($H_0$) inferred from the combined data consistently aligns with early-universe measurements across all models, indicating a persistent Hubble tension. Second, we find compelling evidence for dynamical dark energy: early-universe (CMB) constraints favor a phantom phase (with an equation-of-state parameter $w < -1$), while late-universe (BAO/SNIa) data prefer quintessence ($w > -1$). Third, the full dataset suggests a late-time interaction between dark energy and matter. Our results demonstrate that dark energy evolves with cosmic time, challenging the cosmological constant paradigm.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantised neural networks (QNNs) shrink models and reduce inference energy through low-bit arithmetic, yet most still depend on a running statistics batch normalisation (BN) layer, preventing true integer-only deployment. Prior attempts remove BN by parameter folding or tailored initialisation; while helpful, they rarely recover BN's stability and accuracy and often impose bespoke constraints. We present a BN-free, fully integer QNN trained via a progressive, layer-wise distillation scheme that slots into existing low-bit pipelines. Starting from a pretrained BN-enabled teacher, we use layer-wise targets and progressive compensation to train a student that performs inference exclusively with integer arithmetic and contains no BN operations. On ImageNet with AlexNet, the BN-free model attains competitive Top-1 accuracy under aggressive quantisation. The procedure integrates directly with standard quantisation workflows, enabling end-to-end integer-only inference for resource-constrained settings such as edge and embedded devices.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across various tasks, yet their high computational demands pose deployment challenges, especially on consumer-grade hardware. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models provide an efficient solution through selective activation of parameter subsets, which reduces computation requirements. Despite this efficiency, state-of-the-art MoE models still require substantial memory beyond typical consumer GPU capacities. Traditional offloading methods that transfer model weights between CPU and GPU introduce latency, limiting inference performance. This paper presents a novel CPU-GPU collaborative inference framework that incorporates an expert caching mechanism on the GPU to reduce data transfer requirements and enable faster inference through cache hits. Computations are offloaded to CPU for efficient cache miss handling, which benefits from CPU multithreading optimizations. The evaluations of our framework demonstrate performance improvements and highlight the potential of CPU-GPU collaboration to maximize hardware utilization for single-request inference scenarios on consumer-grade systems. The implementation of our framework is available at https://github.com/elsa-lab/MoE-CPU-GPU-Collaborative-Inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trusted to perform automated code review and static analysis at scale, supporting tasks such as vulnerability detection, summarization, and refactoring. In this paper, we identify and exploit a critical vulnerability in LLM-based code analysis: an abstraction bias that causes models to overgeneralize familiar programming patterns and overlook small, meaningful bugs. Adversaries can exploit this blind spot to hijack the control flow of the LLM's interpretation with minimal edits and without affecting actual runtime behavior. We refer to this attack as a Familiar Pattern Attack (FPA).   We develop a fully automated, black-box algorithm that discovers and injects FPAs into target code. Our evaluation shows that FPAs are not only effective against basic and reasoning models, but are also transferable across model families (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google), and universal across programming languages (Python, C, Rust, Go). Moreover, FPAs remain effective even when models are explicitly warned about the attack via robust system prompts. Finally, we explore positive, defensive uses of FPAs and discuss their broader implications for the reliability and safety of code-oriented LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current artificial intelligence systems, despite remarkable capabilities in text generation and pattern recognition, exhibit a fundamental architectural limitation: they resolve ambiguity prematurely. This premature semantic collapse -- the tendency to collapse multiple valid interpretations into a single output -- stems from classical identity assumptions embedded in standard neural architectures. We propose Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR), a computational framework that treats ambiguity retention as a valid reasoning mode rather than a defect to be eliminated. NRR introduces three core principles: (1) Non-Identity ($A \neq A$) -- the same symbol refers to different entities across contexts; (2) Approximate Identity ($A \approx A$) -- entities share partial structural overlap without being identical; and (3) Non-Resolution -- conflicting interpretations can coexist without forced convergence. We formalize these principles through three architectural components: Multi-Vector Embeddings for context-dependent representation, Non-Collapsing Attention for parallel interpretation retention, and Contextual Identity Tracking (CIT) for maintaining $A \neq A$ across inference. We demonstrate NRR's advantages through case studies in paradox handling, creative generation, and context-dependent reasoning. Crucially, we provide a minimal empirical validation on a synthetic context-shift task where an NRR-lite model achieves 90.9% out-of-distribution accuracy compared to 9.1% for standard architectures, demonstrating that ambiguity preservation enables structural generalization. NRR challenges the assumption that meaning must collapse to be useful, offering a foundation for AI systems capable of sophisticated ambiguity handling and creative reasoning. The question is not whether AI should resolve ambiguity, but when, how, and under whose control.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Optimizing CUDA kernels is a challenging and labor-intensive task, given the need for hardware-software co-design expertise and the proprietary nature of high-performance kernel libraries. While recent large language models (LLMs) combined with evolutionary algorithms show promise in automatic kernel optimization, existing approaches often fall short in performance due to their suboptimal agent designs and mismatched evolution representations. This work identifies these mismatches and proposes cuPilot, a strategy-coordinated multi-agent framework that introduces strategy as an intermediate semantic representation for kernel evolution. Key contributions include a strategy-coordinated evolution algorithm, roofline-guided prompting, and strategy-level population initialization. Experimental results show that the generated kernels by cuPilot achieve an average speed up of 3.09$\times$ over PyTorch on a benchmark of 100 kernels. On the GEMM tasks, cuPilot showcases sophisticated optimizations and achieves high utilization of critical hardware units. The generated kernels are open-sourced at https://github.com/champloo2878/cuPilot-Kernels.git.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the ongoing quest for hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural nets, there is an increasing interest in neural architectures that can learn how to solve discrete reasoning or optimization problems from natural inputs, a task that Large Language Models seem to struggle with.   Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems.   Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact inference gives access to maximum accuracy.   Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Software development is undergoing a fundamental transformation as vibe coding becomes widespread, with large portions of contemporary codebases now being generated by Artificial Intelligence (AI). The disconnect between rapid adoption and limited conceptual understanding highlights the need for an inquiry into this emerging paradigm. Drawing on an intent perspective and historical analysis, we define vibe coding as a software development paradigm where humans and Generative AI (GenAI) engage in collaborative flow to co-create software artifacts through natural language dialogue, shifting the mediation of developer intent from deterministic instruction to probabilistic inference. By intent mediation, we refer to the fundamental process through which developers translate their conceptual goals into representations that computational systems can execute. Our results show that vibe coding redistributes epistemic labor between humans and machines, shifting expertise from technical implementation toward collaborative orchestration. We identify key opportunities, including democratization, acceleration, and systemic leverage, alongside risks such as black-box codebases, responsibility gaps, and ecosystem bias. We conclude with a research agenda spanning human-, technology-, and organization-centered directions to guide future investigations of this paradigm.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Conventional evaluation methods for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) lack interpretability and are often insufficient to fully disclose significant capability gaps across models. To address this, we introduce AuditDM, an automated framework that actively discovers and rectifies MLLM failure modes by auditing their divergence. AuditDM fine-tunes an MLLM as an auditor via reinforcement learning to generate challenging questions and counterfactual images that maximize disagreement among target models. Once trained, the auditor uncovers diverse, interpretable exemplars that reveal model weaknesses and serve as annotation-free data for rectification. When applied to SoTA models like Gemma-3 and PaliGemma-2, AuditDM discovers more than 20 distinct failure types. Fine-tuning on these discoveries consistently improves all models across 16 benchmarks, and enables a 3B model to surpass its 28B counterpart. Our results suggest that as data scaling hits diminishing returns, targeted model auditing offers an effective path to model diagnosis and improvement.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) with explicit reasoning capabilities excel at mathematical reasoning yet still commit process errors, such as incorrect calculations, brittle logic, and superficially plausible but invalid steps. In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Reasoner, an on-policy joint training framework designed to enhance reasoning by co-evolving an LLM reasoner and an LLM-based discriminator through adversarial reinforcement learning. A compute-efficient review schedule partitions each reasoning chain into logically complete slices of comparable length, and the discriminator evaluates each slice's soundness with concise, structured justifications. Learning couples complementary signals: the LLM reasoner is rewarded for logically consistent steps that yield correct answers, while the discriminator earns rewards for correctly detecting errors or distinguishing traces in the reasoning process. This produces dense, well-calibrated, on-policy step-level rewards that supplement sparse exact-match signals, improving credit assignment, increasing sample efficiency, and enhancing overall reasoning quality of LLMs. Across various mathematical benchmarks, the method delivers consistent gains over strong baselines with standard RL post-training. Specifically, on AIME24, we improve DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from 54.0 to 61.3 (+7.3) and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B from 43.7 to 53.7 (+10.0). The modular discriminator also enables flexible reward shaping for objectives such as teacher distillation, preference alignment, and mathematical proof-based reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Prior studies investigating the internal workings of LLMs have uncovered sparse subnetworks, often referred to as circuits, that are responsible for performing specific tasks. Additionally, it has been shown that model performance improvement through fine-tuning often results from the strengthening of existing circuits in the model. Taken together, these findings suggest the possibility of intervening directly on such circuits to make precise, task-targeted updates. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method called Constructive Circuit Amplification which identifies pivotal tokens from model reasoning traces as well as model components responsible for the desired task, and updates only those components. Applied to mathematical reasoning, it improves accuracy by up to +11.4% across multiple models while modifying as little as 1.59% of model components, with minimal impact on other abilities as measured by MMLU, TriviaQA, and TruthfulQA. These results demonstrate that targeted capabilities can be reliably enhanced by selectively updating a sparse set of model components.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper examines the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), a framework for improving the reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Standard practice across domains from robotics to language is to first pretrain a policy on a large-scale demonstration dataset, and then finetune this policy, typically with reinforcement learning (RL), in order to improve performance on deployment domains. This finetuning step has proved critical in achieving human or super-human performance, yet while much attention has been given to developing more effective finetuning algorithms, little attention has been given to ensuring the pretrained policy is an effective initialization for RL finetuning. In this work we seek to understand how the pretrained policy affects finetuning performance, and how to pretrain policies in order to ensure they are effective initializations for finetuning. We first show theoretically that standard behavioral cloning (BC) -- which trains a policy to directly match the actions played by the demonstrator -- can fail to ensure coverage over the demonstrator's actions, a minimal condition necessary for effective RL finetuning. We then show that if, instead of exactly fitting the observed demonstrations, we train a policy to model the posterior distribution of the demonstrator's behavior given the demonstration dataset, we do obtain a policy that ensures coverage over the demonstrator's actions, enabling more effective finetuning. Furthermore, this policy -- which we refer to as the posterior behavioral cloning (PostBC) policy -- achieves this while ensuring pretrained performance is no worse than that of the BC policy. We then show that PostBC is practically implementable with modern generative models in robotic control domains -- relying only on standard supervised learning -- and leads to significantly improved RL finetuning performance on both realistic robotic control benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, as compared to standard behavioral cloning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models, such as Imagen, Stable Diffusion, and FLUX, have led to remarkable improvements in visual quality. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality of training data. Web-crawled and synthetic image datasets often contain low-quality or redundant samples, which lead to degraded visual fidelity, unstable training, and inefficient computation. Hence, effective data selection is crucial for improving data efficiency. Existing approaches rely on costly manual curation or heuristic scoring based on single-dimensional features in Text-to-Image data filtering. Although meta-learning based method has been explored in LLM, there is no adaptation for image modalities. To this end, we propose **Alchemist**, a meta-gradient-based framework to select a suitable subset from large-scale text-image data pairs. Our approach automatically learns to assess the influence of each sample by iteratively optimizing the model from a data-centric perspective. Alchemist consists of two key stages: data rating and data pruning. We train a lightweight rater to estimate each sample's influence based on gradient information, enhanced with multi-granularity perception. We then use the Shift-Gsampling strategy to select informative subsets for efficient model training. Alchemist is the first automatic, scalable, meta-gradient-based data selection framework for Text-to-Image model training. Experiments on both synthetic and web-crawled datasets demonstrate that Alchemist consistently improves visual quality and downstream performance. Training on an Alchemist-selected 50% of the data can outperform training on the full dataset.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generation-time text watermarking embeds statistical signals into text for traceability of AI-generated content. We explore *post-hoc watermarking* where an LLM rewrites existing text while applying generation-time watermarking, to protect copyrighted documents, or detect their use in training or RAG via watermark radioactivity. Unlike generation-time approaches, which is constrained by how LLMs are served, this setting offers additional degrees of freedom for both generation and detection. We investigate how allocating compute (through larger rephrasing models, beam search, multi-candidate generation, or entropy filtering at detection) affects the quality-detectability trade-off. Our strategies achieve strong detectability and semantic fidelity on open-ended text such as books. Among our findings, the simple Gumbel-max scheme surprisingly outperforms more recent alternatives under nucleus sampling, and most methods benefit significantly from beam search. However, most approaches struggle when watermarking verifiable text such as code, where we counterintuitively find that smaller models outperform larger ones. This study reveals both the potential and limitations of post-hoc watermarking, laying groundwork for practical applications and future research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reward models (RMs) are essential for training large language models (LLMs), but remain underexplored for omni models that handle interleaved image and text sequences. We introduce Multimodal RewardBench 2 (MMRB2), the first comprehensive benchmark for reward models on multimodal understanding and (interleaved) generation. MMRB2 spans four tasks: text-to-image, image editing, interleaved generation, and multimodal reasoning ("thinking-with-images"), providing 1,000 expert-annotated preference pairs per task from 23 models and agents across 21 source tasks. MMRB2 is designed with: (1) practical but challenging prompts; (2) responses from state-of-the-art models and agents; and (3) preference pairs with strong human-expert consensus, curated via an ensemble filtering strategy. Using MMRB2, we study existing judges for each subtask, including multimodal LLM-as-a-judge and models trained with human preferences. The latest Gemini 3 Pro attains 75-80% accuracy. GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro reach 66-75% accuracy, compared to >90% for humans, yet surpass the widely used GPT-4o (59%). The best performing open-source model Qwen3-VL-32B achieves similar accuracies as Gemini 2.5 Flash (64%). We also show that MMRB2 performance strongly correlates with downstream task success using Best-of-N sampling and conduct an in-depth analysis that shows key areas to improve the reward models going forward.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) unlock world-knowledge-aware video understanding through pretraining on internet-scale data and have already shown promise on tasks such as movie analysis and video question answering. However, deploying VLLMs for downstream tasks such as video recommendation remains challenging, since real systems require multi-video inputs, lightweight backbones, low-latency sequential inference, and rapid response. In practice, (1) decode-only generation yields high latency for sequential inference, (2) typical interfaces do not support multi-video inputs, and (3) constraining outputs to language discards fine-grained visual details that matter for downstream vision tasks. We argue that these limitations stem from the absence of a representation that preserves pixel-level detail while leveraging world knowledge. We present LinkedOut, a representation that extracts VLLM world knowledge directly from video to enable fast inference, supports multi-video histories, and removes the language bottleneck. LinkedOut extracts semantically grounded, knowledge-aware tokens from raw frames using VLLMs, guided by promptable queries and optional auxiliary modalities. We introduce a cross-layer knowledge fusion MoE that selects the appropriate level of abstraction from the rich VLLM features, enabling personalized, interpretable, and low-latency recommendation. To our knowledge, LinkedOut is the first VLLM-based video recommendation method that operates on raw frames without handcrafted labels, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. Interpretability studies and ablations confirm the benefits of layer diversity and layer-wise fusion, pointing to a practical path that fully leverages VLLM world-knowledge priors and visual reasoning for downstream vision tasks such as recommendation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Equipping large language models (LLMs) with search engines via reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective approach for building search agents. However, overreliance on search introduces unnecessary cost and risks exposure to noisy or malicious content, while relying solely on parametric knowledge risks hallucination. The central challenge is to develop agents that adaptively balance parametric knowledge with external search, invoking search only when necessary. Prior work mitigates search overuse by shaping rewards around the number of tool calls. However, these penalties require substantial reward engineering, provide ambiguous credit assignment, and can be exploited by agents that superficially reduce calls. Moreover, evaluating performance solely through call counts conflates necessary and unnecessary search, obscuring the measurement of true adaptive behavior. To address these limitations, we first quantify the self-knowledge awareness of existing search agents via an F1-based decision metric, revealing that methods such as Search-R1 often overlook readily available parametric knowledge. Motivated by these findings, we propose AdaSearch, a simple two-stage, outcome-driven RL framework that disentangles problem solving from the decision of whether to invoke search, and makes this decision process explicit and interpretable. This transparency is crucial for high-stakes domains such as finance and medical question answering, yet is largely neglected by prior approaches. Experiments across multiple model families and sizes demonstrate that AdaSearch substantially improves knowledge-boundary awareness, reduces unnecessary search calls, preserves strong task performance, and offers more transparent, interpretable decision behaviors.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> AI safety and alignment research has predominantly been focused on methods for safeguarding individual AI systems, resting on the assumption of an eventual emergence of a monolithic Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The alternative AGI emergence hypothesis, where general capability levels are first manifested through coordination in groups of sub-AGI individual agents with complementary skills and affordances, has received far less attention. Here we argue that this patchwork AGI hypothesis needs to be given serious consideration, and should inform the development of corresponding safeguards and mitigations. The rapid deployment of advanced AI agents with tool-use capabilities and the ability to communicate and coordinate makes this an urgent safety consideration. We therefore propose a framework for distributional AGI safety that moves beyond evaluating and aligning individual agents. This framework centers on the design and implementation of virtual agentic sandbox economies (impermeable or semi-permeable), where agent-to-agent transactions are governed by robust market mechanisms, coupled with appropriate auditability, reputation management, and oversight to mitigate collective risks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver exceptional performance across natural language tasks but demand substantial computational resources, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Existing compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning, often degrade critical linguistic properties and lack formal guarantees for preserving model behavior. We propose Temporal Logic-Guided Large Language Model Compression (TOGGLE), a novel framework that leverages Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to formally specify and enforce linguistic properties during compression. TOGGLE employs an STL robustness-guided Bayesian optimization to systematically explore layer-wise quantization and pruning configurations, generating compressed models that formally satisfy specified linguistic constraints without retraining or fine-tuning. Evaluating TOGGLE on four LLM architectures (GPT-2, DeepSeek-V2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B, and Mistral 7B), we achieve up to 3.3x reduction in computational costs (FLOPs) and up to a 68.8% reduction in model size while satisfying all linguistic properties. TOGGLE represents the first integration of formal methods into LLM compression, enabling efficient, verifiable deployment of LLMs on edge hardware.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The convergence of artificial AI and XR technologies (AI XR) promises innovative applications across many domains. However, the sensitive nature of data (e.g., eye-tracking) used in these systems raises significant privacy concerns, as adversaries can exploit these data and models to infer and leak personal information through membership inference attacks (MIA) and re-identification (RDA) with a high success rate. Researchers have proposed various techniques to mitigate such privacy attacks, including differential privacy (DP). However, AI XR datasets often contain numerous features, and applying DP uniformly can introduce unnecessary noise to less relevant features, degrade model accuracy, and increase inference time, limiting real-time XR deployment. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework combining explainable AI (XAI) and DP-enabled privacy-preserving mechanisms to defend against privacy attacks. Specifically, we leverage post-hoc explanations to identify the most influential features in AI XR models and selectively apply DP to those features during inference. We evaluate our XAI-guided DP approach on three state-of-the-art AI XR models and three datasets: cybersickness, emotion, and activity classification. Our results show that the proposed method reduces MIA and RDA success rates by up to 43% and 39%, respectively, for cybersickness tasks while preserving model utility with up to 97% accuracy using Transformer models. Furthermore, it improves inference time by up to ~2x compared to traditional DP approaches. To demonstrate practicality, we deploy the XAI-guided DP AI XR models on an HTC VIVE Pro headset and develop a user interface (UI), namely PrivateXR, allowing users to adjust privacy levels (e.g., low, medium, high) while receiving real-time task predictions, protecting user privacy during XR gameplay.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled the training of large language model (LLM) agents to interact with the environment and to solve multi-turn long-horizon tasks. However, the RL-trained agents often struggle in tasks that require active exploration and fail to efficiently adapt from trial-and-error experiences. In this paper, we present LaMer, a general Meta-RL framework that enables LLM agents to actively explore and learn from the environment feedback at test time. LaMer consists of two key components: (i) a cross-episode training framework to encourage exploration and long-term rewards optimization; and (ii) in-context policy adaptation via reflection, allowing the agent to adapt their policy from task feedback signal without gradient update. Experiments across diverse environments show that LaMer significantly improves performance over RL baselines, with 11%, 14%, and 19% performance gains on Sokoban, MineSweeper and Webshop, respectively. Moreover, LaMer also demonstrates better generalization to more challenging or previously unseen tasks compared to the RL-trained agents. Overall, our results demonstrate that Meta-RL provides a principled approach to induce exploration in language agents, enabling more robust adaptation to novel environments through learned exploration strategies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based language models have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, yet their high inference latency poses a significant challenge for real-timeand large-scale deployment. While existing caching mechanisms,such as token-level key-value caches, offer speedups in autore-gressive decoding, they are limited in scope and applicability. In this paper, we present LLMCache, a novel layer-wise caching framework that accelerates transformer inference by reusing intermediate activations based on semantic similarity of input sequences. Unlike prior work, LLMCache is model-agnostic,operates across both encoder and decoder architectures, and supports caching at arbitrary transformer layers. We introduce a lightweight fingerprinting mechanism for matching seman-tically similar inputs and propose adaptive eviction strategies to manage cache staleness. Experiments on BERT and GPT-2 across SQuAD, WikiText-103, and OpenBookQA show up to 3.1 X speedup in inference time with <0.5% accuracy degradation. Our results highlight LLMCache as a practical and general-purpose solution for optimizing transformer inference in real-world applications

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Time-critical networking requires low-latency decisions from sparse and bursty telemetry, where fixed-step neural inference waste computation. We introduce Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS), a two-state neuron whose variables correspond to normalised queue occupancy and a recovery resource. NOS combines a saturating excitability nonlinearity for finite buffers, service and damping leaks, graph-local inputs with per-link gates and delays, and differentiable resets compatible with surrogate gradients and neuromorphic deployment. We establish existence and uniqueness of subthreshold equilibria, derive Jacobian-based local stability tests, and obtain a scalar network stability threshold that separates topology from node physics through a Perron-mode spectral condition. A stochastic arrival model aligned with telemetry smoothing links NOS responses to classical queueing behaviour while explaining increased variability near stability margins. Across chain, star, and scale-free graphs, NOS improves early-warning F1 and detection latency over MLP, RNN, GRU, and temporal-GNN baselines under a common residual-based protocol, while providing practical calibration and stability rules suited to resource-constrained networking deployments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the evolving landscape of traffic management and vehicle surveillance, efficient license plate detection and recognition are indispensable. Historically, many methodologies have tackled this challenge, but consistent real-time accuracy, especially in diverse environments, remains elusive. This study examines the performance of YOLOv8 variants on License Plate Recognition (LPR) and Character Recognition tasks, crucial for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems. Two distinct datasets were employed for training and evaluation, yielding notable findings. The YOLOv8 Nano variant demonstrated a precision of 0.964 and mAP50 of 0.918 on the LPR task, while the YOLOv8 Small variant exhibited a precision of 0.92 and mAP50 of 0.91 on the Character Recognition task. A custom method for character sequencing was introduced, effectively sequencing the detected characters based on their x-axis positions. An optimized pipeline, utilizing YOLOv8 Nano for LPR and YOLOv8 Small for Character Recognition, is proposed. This configuration not only maintains computational efficiency but also ensures high accuracy, establishing a robust foundation for future real-world deployments on edge devices within Intelligent Transportation Systems. This effort marks a significant stride towards the development of smarter and more efficient urban infrastructures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern LLM applications such as deep-research assistants, coding agents, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, repeatedly process long prompt histories containing shared document or code chunks, creating significant pressure on the Key Value (KV) cache, which must operate within limited memory while sustaining high throughput and low latency. Prefix caching partially alleviates some of these costs by reusing KV cache for previously processed tokens, but limited by strict prefix matching. Position-independent caching (PIC) enables chunk-level reuse at arbitrary positions, but requires selective recomputation and positional-encoding (PE) adjustments. However, because these operations vary across queries, KV for the same chunk diverges across requests. Moreover, without page alignment, chunk KV layouts diverge in memory, preventing page sharing. These issues result in only modest HBM savings even when many requests reuse the same content.   We present MEPIC, a memory-efficient PIC system that enables chunk KV reuse across positions, requests, and batches. MEPIC aligns chunk KV to paged storage, shifts recomputation from token- to block-level so only the first block is request-specific, removes positional encodings via Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) fusion in the attention kernel, and makes remaining blocks fully shareable. These techniques eliminate most duplicate chunk KV in HBM, reducing usage by up to 2x over state-of-the-art PIC at comparable latency and accuracy, and up to 5x for long prompts, without any model changes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational components of modern software systems. As their influence grows, concerns about fairness have become increasingly pressing. Prior work has proposed metamorphic testing to detect fairness issues, applying input transformations to uncover inconsistencies in model behavior. This paper introduces an alternative perspective for testing counterfactual fairness in LLMs, proposing a structured and intent-aware framework coined CAFFE (Counterfactual Assessment Framework for Fairness Evaluation). Inspired by traditional non-functional testing, CAFFE (1) formalizes LLM-Fairness test cases through explicitly defined components, including prompt intent, conversational context, input variants, expected fairness thresholds, and test environment configuration, (2) assists testers by automatically generating targeted test data, and (3) evaluates model responses using semantic similarity metrics. Our experiments, conducted on three different architectural families of LLM, demonstrate that CAFFE achieves broader bias coverage and more reliable detection of unfair behavior than existing metamorphic approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Translating natural language (NL) into a formal language such as temporal logic (TL) is integral for human communication with robots and autonomous systems. State-of-the-art approaches decompose the task into a lifting of atomic propositions (APs) phase and a translation phase. However, existing methods struggle with accurate lifting, the existence of co-references, and learning from limited data. In this paper, we propose a framework for NL to TL translation called Grammar Forced Translation (GraFT). The framework is based on the observation that previous work solves both the lifting and translation steps by letting a language model iteratively predict tokens from its full vocabulary. In contrast, GraFT reduces the complexity of both tasks by restricting the set of valid output tokens from the full vocabulary to only a handful in each step. The solution space reduction is obtained by exploiting the unique properties of each problem. We also provide a theoretical justification for why the solution space reduction leads to more efficient learning. We evaluate the effectiveness of GraFT using the CW, GLTL, and Navi benchmarks. Compared with state-of-the-art translation approaches, it can be observed that GraFT the end-to-end translation accuracy by 5.49% and out-of-domain translation accuracy by 14.06% on average.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) grounds large language models (LLMs) in external evidence, but fails when retrieved sources conflict or contain outdated or subjective information. Prior work address these issues independently but lack unified reasoning supervision. We propose a reasoning-trace-augmented RAG framework that adds structured, interpretable reasoning across three stages : (1) document-level adjudication, (2) conflict analysis, and (3) grounded synthesis, producing citation-linked answers or justified refusals. A Conflict-Aware Trust-Score (CATS) pipeline is introduced which evaluates groundedness, factual correctness, refusal accuracy, and conflict-behavior alignment using an LLM-as-a-Judge. Our 539-query reasoning dataset and evaluation pipeline establish a foundation for conflict-aware, interpretable RAG systems. Experimental results demonstrate substantial gains over baselines, most notably with Qwen, where Supervised Fine-Tuning improved End-to-End answer correctness from 0.069 to 0.883 and behavioral adherence from 0.074 to 0.722.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, the Multi-stage Edge Server Upgrade (M-ESU) is proposed as a new network planning problem, involving the upgrading of an existing multi-access edge computing (MEC) system through multiple stages (e.g., over several years). More precisely, the problem considers two key decisions: (i) whether to deploy additional edge servers or upgrade those already installed, and (ii) how tasks should be offloaded so that the average number of tasks that meet their delay requirement is maximized. The framework specifically involves: (i) deployment of new servers combined with capacity upgrades for existing servers, and (ii) the optimal task offloading to maximize the average number of tasks with a delay requirement. It also considers the following constraints: (i) budget per stage, (ii) server deployment and upgrade cost (in $) and cost depreciation rate, (iii) computation resource of servers, (iv) number of tasks and their growth rate (in %), and (v) the increase in task sizes and stricter delay requirements over time. We present two solutions: a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and an efficient heuristic algorithm (M-ESU/H). MILP yields the optimal solution for small networks, whereas M-ESU/H is used in large-scale networks. For small networks, the simulation results show that the solution computed by M-ESU/H is within 1.25% of the optimal solution while running several orders of magnitude faster. For large networks, M-ESU/H is compared against three alternative heuristic solutions that consider only server deployment, or giving priority to server deployment or upgrade. Our experiments show that M-ESU/H yields up to 21.57% improvement in task satisfaction under identical budget and demand growth conditions, confirming its scalability and practical value for long-term MEC systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While comments are non-functional elements of source code, Large Language Models (LLM) frequently rely on them to perform Software Engineering (SE) tasks. Yet, where in the model this reliance resides, and how it affects performance, remains poorly understood. We present the first concept-level interpretability study of LLMs in SE, analyzing three tasks - code completion, translation, and refinement - through the lens of internal comment representation. Using Concept Activation Vectors (CAV), we show that LLMs not only internalize comments as distinct latent concepts but also differentiate between subtypes such as Javadocs, inline, and multiline comments. By systematically activating and deactivating these concepts in the LLMs' embedding space, we observed significant, model-specific, and task-dependent shifts in performance ranging from -90% to +67%. Finally, we conducted a controlled experiment using the same set of code inputs, prompting LLMs to perform 10 distinct SE tasks while measuring the activation of the comment concept within their latent representations. We found that code summarization consistently triggered the strongest activation of comment concepts, whereas code completion elicited the weakest sensitivity. These results open a new direction for building SE tools and models that reason about and manipulate internal concept representations rather than relying solely on surface-level input.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Natural language (NL) to temporal logic (TL) translation enables engineers to specify, verify, and enforce system behaviors without manually crafting formal specifications-an essential capability for building trustworthy autonomous systems. While existing NL-to-TL translation frameworks have demonstrated encouraging initial results, these systems either explicitly assume access to accurate atom grounding or suffer from low grounded translation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework for Grounding Natural Language Into System Signatures for Temporal Logic translation called GinSign. The framework introduces a grounding model that learns the abstract task of mapping NL spans onto a given system signature: given a lifted NL specification and a system signature $\mathcal{S}$, the classifier must assign each lifted atomic proposition to an element of the set of signature-defined atoms $\mathcal{P}$. We decompose the grounding task hierarchically -- first predicting predicate labels, then selecting the appropriately typed constant arguments. Decomposing this task from a free-form generation problem into a structured classification problem permits the use of smaller masked language models and eliminates the reliance on expensive LLMs. Experiments across multiple domains show that frameworks which omit grounding tend to produce syntactically correct lifted LTL that is semantically nonequivalent to grounded target expressions, whereas our framework supports downstream model checking and achieves grounded logical-equivalence scores of $95.5\%$, a $1.4\times$ improvement over SOTA.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Autonomous driving has long relied on modular "Perception-Decision-Action" pipelines, where hand-crafted interfaces and rule-based components often break down in complex or long-tailed scenarios. Their cascaded design further propagates perception errors, degrading downstream planning and control. Vision-Action (VA) models address some limitations by learning direct mappings from visual inputs to actions, but they remain opaque, sensitive to distribution shifts, and lack structured reasoning or instruction-following capabilities. Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal learning has motivated the emergence of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks, which integrate perception with language-grounded decision making. By unifying visual understanding, linguistic reasoning, and actionable outputs, VLAs offer a pathway toward more interpretable, generalizable, and human-aligned driving policies. This work provides a structured characterization of the emerging VLA landscape for autonomous driving. We trace the evolution from early VA approaches to modern VLA frameworks and organize existing methods into two principal paradigms: End-to-End VLA, which integrates perception, reasoning, and planning within a single model, and Dual-System VLA, which separates slow deliberation (via VLMs) from fast, safety-critical execution (via planners). Within these paradigms, we further distinguish subclasses such as textual vs. numerical action generators and explicit vs. implicit guidance mechanisms. We also summarize representative datasets and benchmarks for evaluating VLA-based driving systems and highlight key challenges and open directions, including robustness, interpretability, and instruction fidelity. Overall, this work aims to establish a coherent foundation for advancing human-compatible autonomous driving systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as epistemic partners in everyday reasoning, yet their errors remain predominantly analyzed through predictive metrics rather than through their interpretive effects on human judgment. This study examines how different forms of epistemic failure emerge, are masked, and are tolerated in human AI interaction, where failure is understood as a relational breakdown shaped by model-generated plausibility and human interpretive judgment. We conducted a three round, multi LLM evaluation using interdisciplinary tasks and progressively differentiated assessment frameworks to observe how evaluators interpret model responses across linguistic, epistemic, and credibility dimensions. Our findings show that LLM errors shift from predictive to hermeneutic forms, where linguistic fluency, structural coherence, and superficially plausible citations conceal deeper distortions of meaning. Evaluators frequently conflated criteria such as correctness, relevance, bias, groundedness, and consistency, indicating that human judgment collapses analytical distinctions into intuitive heuristics shaped by form and fluency. Across rounds, we observed a systematic verification burden and cognitive drift. As tasks became denser, evaluators increasingly relied on surface cues, allowing erroneous yet well formed answers to pass as credible. These results suggest that error is not solely a property of model behavior but a co-constructed outcome of generative plausibility and human interpretive shortcuts. Understanding AI epistemic failure therefore requires reframing evaluation as a relational interpretive process, where the boundary between system failure and human miscalibration becomes porous. The study provides implications for LLM assessment, digital literacy, and the design of trustworthy human AI communication.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We study portfolio selection with a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) constraint under distribution shift and serial dependence. While Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (DRO) offers tractable protection via an ambiguity ball around empirical data, choosing the ball radius is delicate: large radii are conservative, small radii risk violation under regime change. We propose a shift-aware Gaussian-supremum (GS) validation framework for Wasserstein-DRO CVaR portfolios, building on the work by Lam and Qian (2019). Phase I of the framework generates a candidate path by solving the exact reformulation of the robust CVaR constraint over a grid of Wasserstein radii. Phase II of the framework learns a target deployment law $Q$ by density-ratio reweighting of a time-ordered validation fold, computes weighted CVaR estimates, and calibrates a simultaneous upper confidence band via a block multiplier bootstrap to account for dependence. We select the least conservative feasible portfolio (or abstain if the effective sample size collapses). Theoretically, we extend the normalized GS validator to non-i.i.d. financial data: under weak dependence and regularity of the weighted scores, any portfolio passing our validator satisfies the CVaR limit under $Q$ with probability at least $1-β$; the Wasserstein term contributes a deterministic margin $(δ/α)\|x\|_*$. Empirical results indicate improved return-risk trade-offs versus the naive baseline.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> [...] This paper presents AutoRAN, an automated, intent-driven framework for zero-touch provisioning of open, programmable cellular networks. Leveraging cloud-native principles, AutoRAN employs virtualization, declarative infrastructure-as-code templates, and disaggregated micro-services to abstract physical resources and protocol stacks. Its orchestration engine integrates Language Models (LLMs) to translate high-level intents into machine-readable configurations, enabling closed-loop control via telemetry-driven observability. Implemented on a multi-architecture OpenShift cluster with heterogeneous compute (x86/ARM CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs) and multi-vendor Radio Access Network (RAN) hardware (Foxconn, NI), AutoRAN automates deployment of O-RAN-compliant stacks-including OpenAirInterface, NVIDIA ARC RAN, Open5GS core, and O-RAN Software Community (OSC) RIC components-using CI/CD pipelines. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoRAN is capable of deploying an end-to-end Private 5G network in less than 60 seconds with 1.6 Gbps throughput, validating its ability to streamline configuration, accelerate testing, and reduce manual intervention with similar performance than non cloud-based implementations. With its novel LLM-assisted intent translation mechanism, and performance-optimized automation workflow for multi-vendor environments, AutoRAN has the potential of advancing the robustness of next-generation cellular supply chains through reproducible, intent-based provisioning across public and private deployments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The integrity of many contemporary AI systems is compromised by the misuse of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) models to obscure systems that remain heavily dependent on human labor. We define this structural dependency as Human-Instead-of-AI (HISOAI), an ethically problematic and economically unsustainable design in which human workers function as concealed operational substitutes rather than intentional, high-value collaborators. To address this issue, we introduce the AI-First, Human-Empowered (AFHE) paradigm, which requires AI systems to demonstrate a quantifiable level of functional independence prior to deployment. This requirement is formalized through the AI Autonomy Coefficient, measuring the proportion of tasks completed without mandatory human intervention. We further propose the AFHE Deployment Algorithm, an algorithmic gate that enforces a minimum autonomy threshold during offline evaluation and shadow deployment. Our results show that the AI Autonomy Coefficient effectively identifies HISOAI systems with an autonomy level of 0.38, while systems governed by the AFHE framework achieve an autonomy level of 0.85. We conclude that AFHE provides a metric-driven approach for ensuring verifiable autonomy, transparency, and sustainable operational integrity in modern AI systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Practical distributed quantum computing and error correction require quantum networks with high-qubit-rate, high-fidelity, and low-reconfiguration-latency. Unfortunately, current approaches are limited by fundamental constraints: single-channel entanglement rates remain at the MHz level with millisecond-level reconfiguration, which is insufficient for fault-tolerant distributed quantum computing. Here, we propose a quantum network architecture that leverages reconfigurable quantum interfaces and wavelength-selective switches to overcome bandwidth and latency constraints. By tuning the frequency and temporal modes of photonic qubits across dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) channels, our protocol achieves an entanglement generation rate of up to 183.4 MHz based on our comprehensive modeling of the networked cold atom computing systems. Our architecture enables nanosecond-scale network reconfiguration with low loss, low infidelity, and high dimensionality. Our modeling and simulation are designed for deployable distributed quantum computing and error correction, integrating the quantum interface, network switching, circuit compilation, and execution into a unified framework. The proposed architecture is fully compatible with industry-standard DWDM infrastructure, providing a scalable and cost-effective foundation for distributed quantum computing.

OpenNER contains 36 NER corpora that span 52 languages, human-annotated in varying named entity ontologies. We correct annotation format issues, standardize the original datasets into a uniform representation with consistent entity type names across corpora, and provide the collection in a structure that enables research in multilingual and multi-ontology NER. We provide baseline results using three pretrained multilingual language models and two large language models to compare the performance of recent models and facilitate future research in NER. We find that no single model is best in all languages and that significant work remains to obtain high performance from LLMs on the NER task.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Voice-based interaction has emerged as a natural and intuitive modality for controlling IoT devices. However, speech-driven edge devices face a fundamental trade-off between cloud-based solutions, which offer stronger language understanding capabilities at the cost of latency, connectivity dependence, and privacy concerns, and edge-based solutions, which provide low latency and improved privacy but are limited by computational constraints. This paper presents ASTA, an adaptive speech-to-action solution that dynamically routes voice commands between edge and cloud inference to balance performance and system resource utilization. ASTA integrates on-device automatic speech recognition and lightweight offline language-model inference with cloud-based LLM processing, guided by real-time system metrics such as CPU workload, device temperature, and network latency. A metric-aware routing mechanism selects the inference path at runtime, while a rule-based command validation and repair component ensures successful end-to-end command execution. We implemented our solution on an NVIDIA Jetson-based edge platform and evaluated it using a diverse dataset of 80 spoken commands. Experimental results show that ASTA successfully routes all input commands for execution, achieving a balanced distribution between online and offline inference. The system attains an ASR accuracy of 62.5% and generates executable commands without repair for only 47.5% of inputs, highlighting the importance of the repair mechanism in improving robustness. These results suggest that adaptive edge-cloud orchestration is a viable approach for resilient and resource-aware voice-controlled IoT systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapidly growing demand for high-quality data in Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified the need for scalable, reliable, and semantically rich data preparation pipelines. However, current practices remain dominated by ad-hoc scripts and loosely specified workflows, which lack principled abstractions, hinder reproducibility, and offer limited support for model-in-the-loop data generation. To address these challenges, we present DataFlow, a unified and extensible LLM-driven data preparation framework. DataFlow is designed with system-level abstractions that enable modular, reusable, and composable data transformations, and provides a PyTorch-style pipeline construction API for building debuggable and optimizable dataflows. The framework consists of nearly 200 reusable operators and six domain-general pipelines spanning text, mathematical reasoning, code, Text-to-SQL, agentic RAG, and large-scale knowledge extraction. To further improve usability, we introduce DataFlow-Agent, which automatically translates natural-language specifications into executable pipelines via operator synthesis, pipeline planning, and iterative verification. Across six representative use cases, DataFlow consistently improves downstream LLM performance. Our math, code, and text pipelines outperform curated human datasets and specialized synthetic baselines, achieving up to +3\% execution accuracy in Text-to-SQL over SynSQL, +7\% average improvements on code benchmarks, and 1--3 point gains on MATH, GSM8K, and AIME. Moreover, a unified 10K-sample dataset produced by DataFlow enables base models to surpass counterparts trained on 1M Infinity-Instruct data. These results demonstrate that DataFlow provides a practical and high-performance substrate for reliable, reproducible, and scalable LLM data preparation, and establishes a system-level foundation for future data-centric AI development.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) is a novel multi-layer network model recognized for its efficiency in neuromorphic computing, where synapses between neurons are trained linearly. Computations in KAN are performed by generating a polynomial vector from the state vector and layer-wise trained synapses, enabling efficient processing. While KAN can be implemented on quantum computers using block encoding and Quantum Signal Processing, these methods require fault-tolerant quantum devices, making them impractical for current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware. We propose the Enhanced Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (EVQKAN) to overcome this limitation, which emulates KAN through variational quantum algorithms. The EVQKAN ansatz employs a tiling technique to emulate layer matrices, leading to significantly higher accuracy compared to conventional Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (VQKAN) and Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), even with a smaller number of layers. EVQKAN achieves superior performance with a single-layer architecture, whereas QNN and VQKAN typically struggle. Additionally, EVQKAN eliminates the need for Quantum Signal Processing, enhancing its robustness to noise and making it well-suited for practical deployment on NISQ-era quantum devices.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantum Machine Learning models typically require expensive on-chip training procedures and often lack efficient gradient estimation methods. By employing Pauli propagation, it is possible to derive a symbolic representation of observables as analytic functions of a circuit's parameters. Although the number of terms in such functional representations grows rapidly with circuit depth, suitable choices of ansatz and controlled truncations on Pauli weights and frequency components yield accurate yet tractable estimators of the target observables. With the right ansatz design, this approach can be extended to system sizes beyond the reach of classical simulation, enabling scalable training for larger quantum systems. This also enables a form of classical pre-training through gradient-based optimization prior to deployment on quantum hardware. The proposed approach is demonstrated on the Variational Quantum Eigensolver for obtaining the ground state of a spin model, showing that accurate results can be achieved with a scalable and computationally efficient procedure.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models often face a three-way trade-off among detection accuracy, inference latency, and deployment cost when used in real-world safety-sensitive applications. This paper introduces Prefix Probing, a black-box harmful content detection method that compares the conditional log-probabilities of "agreement/execution" versus "refusal/safety" opening prefixes and leverages prefix caching to reduce detection overhead to near first-token latency. During inference, the method requires only a single log-probability computation over the probe prefixes to produce a harmfulness score and apply a threshold, without invoking any additional models or multi-stage inference. To further enhance the discriminative power of the prefixes, we design an efficient prefix construction algorithm that automatically discovers highly informative prefixes, substantially improving detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Prefix Probing achieves detection effectiveness comparable to mainstream external safety models while incurring only minimal computational cost and requiring no extra model deployment, highlighting its strong practicality and efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in reinforcement learning for large language models have converged on increasing complexity: multi-stage training pipelines, dynamic hyperparameter schedules, and curriculum learning strategies. This raises a fundamental question: \textbf{Is this complexity necessary?} We present \textbf{JustRL}, a minimal approach using single-stage training with fixed hyperparameters that achieves state-of-the-art performance on two 1.5B reasoning models (54.9\% and 64.3\% average accuracy across nine mathematical benchmarks) while using 2$\times$ less compute than sophisticated approaches. The same hyperparameters transfer across both models without tuning, and training exhibits smooth, monotonic improvement over 4,000+ steps without the collapses or plateaus that typically motivate interventions. Critically, ablations reveal that adding ``standard tricks'' like explicit length penalties and robust verifiers may degrade performance by collapsing exploration. These results suggest that the field may be adding complexity to solve problems that disappear with a stable, scaled-up baseline. We release our models and code to establish a simple, validated baseline for the community.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rapid proliferation of edge computing, Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) has become increasingly important for secure device authentication. However, practical deployment of deep learning-based RFFI models is hindered by a critical challenge: their performance often degrades significantly when applied across receivers with different hardware characteristics due to distribution shifts introduced by receiver variation. To address this, we investigate the source-data-free cross-receiver RFFI (SCRFFI) problem, where a model pretrained on labeled signals from a source receiver must adapt to unlabeled signals from a target receiver, without access to any source-domain data during adaptation. We first formulate a novel constrained pseudo-labeling-based SCRFFI adaptation framework, and provide a theoretical analysis of its generalization performance. Our analysis highlights a key insight: the target-domain performance is highly sensitive to the quality of the pseudo-labels generated during adaptation. Motivated by this, we propose Momentum Soft pseudo-label Source Hypothesis Transfer (MS-SHOT), a new method for SCRFFI that incorporates momentum-center-guided soft pseudo-labeling and enforces global structural constraints to encourage confident and diverse predictions. Notably, MS-SHOT effectively addresses scenarios involving label shift or unknown, non-uniform class distributions in the target domain -- a significant limitation of prior methods. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MS-SHOT consistently outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and robustness, offering a practical and scalable solution for source-data-free cross-receiver adaptation in RFFI.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> API integration is a cornerstone of our digital infrastructure, enabling software systems to connect and interact. However, as shown by many studies, writing or generating correct code to invoke APIs, particularly web APIs, is challenging. Although large language models (LLMs) have become popular in software development, their effectiveness in automating the generation of web API integration code remains unexplored. In order to address this, we present WAPIIBench, a dataset and evaluation pipeline designed to assess the ability of LLMs to generate web API invocation code. Our experiments with several open-source LLMs reveal that generating API invocations poses a significant challenge, resulting in hallucinated endpoints, incorrect argument usage, and other errors. None of the evaluated open-source models was able to solve more than 40% of the tasks. Motivated by those findings, we explore the potential of constrained decoding for generating API invocations. To this end, we propose an automatic translation from API specifications to constraints. Our approach prevents violations of API usage rules and significantly increases the overall correctness of the generated code, on average by 90% and 135%, depending on the provided starter code.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Crowdsourced model evaluation platforms, such as Chatbot Arena, enable real-time evaluation from human perspectives to assess the quality of model responses. In the coding domain, manually examining the quality of LLM-generated content is extremely challenging, as it requires understanding long chunks of raw code and deliberately simulating code execution. To this end, we introduce BigCodeArena, an open human evaluation platform for code generation backed by a comprehensive and on-the-fly execution environment. Built on top of Chatbot Arena, BigCodeArena enables the execution of LLM-generated code and allows humans to interact with the execution process and outcomes. We collected over 14,000 raw code-centric conversation sessions across 10 widely used LLMs, spanning 10 languages and 8 types of execution environments. Among these conversations, we identified more than 4,700 multi-turn samples with pairwise human preferences. Further analysis uncovers underexplored preferences of LLMs in fine-grained domains characterized by tasks, languages, and frameworks. To systematically examine code understanding and generation capabilities of frontier LLMs, we curated two benchmarks based on the collected data, namely BigCodeReward and AutoCodeArena. For BigCodeReward, we post-processed the 4,700 conversations and evaluated the consistency between reward models and human preferences. The evaluation shows that most LLMs have superior performance in judging coding preferences when the execution results are available. Inspired by these findings, we propose AutoCodeArena, an automatic Elo rating benchmark designed to assess the coding quality of LLMs without human involvement. We find that proprietary LLMs like GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Claude-Opus-4 still lead in code generation performance among recent emerging models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Agentic AI systems, built upon large language models (LLMs) and deployed in multi-agent configurations, are redefining intelligence, autonomy, collaboration, and decision-making across enterprise and societal domains. This review presents a structured analysis of Trust, Risk, and Security Management (TRiSM) in the context of LLM-based Agentic Multi-Agent Systems (AMAS). We begin by examining the conceptual foundations of Agentic AI and highlight its architectural distinctions from traditional AI agents. We then adapt and extend the AI TRiSM framework for Agentic AI, structured around key pillars: \textit{ Explainability, ModelOps, Security, Privacy} and \textit{their Lifecycle Governance}, each contextualized to the challenges of AMAS. A risk taxonomy is proposed to capture the unique threats and vulnerabilities of Agentic AI, ranging from coordination failures to prompt-based adversarial manipulation. To support practical assessment in Agentic AI works, we introduce two novel metrics: the Component Synergy Score (CSS), which quantifies the quality of inter-agent collaboration, and the Tool Utilization Efficacy (TUE), which evaluates the efficiency of tool use within agent workflows. We further discuss strategies for improving explainability in Agentic AI, as well as approaches to enhancing security and privacy through encryption, adversarial robustness, and regulatory compliance. The review concludes with a research roadmap for the responsible development and deployment of Agentic AI, highlighting key directions to align emerging systems with TRiSM principles-ensuring safety, transparency, and accountability in their operation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce Refusal Steering, an inference-time method to exercise fine-grained control over Large Language Models refusal behaviour on politically sensitive topics without retraining. We replace fragile pattern-based refusal detection with an LLM-as-a-judge that assigns refusal confidence scores and we propose a ridge-regularized variant to compute steering vectors that better isolate the refusal--compliance direction. On Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking, our method removes the refusal behaviour of the model around politically sensitive topics while maintaining safety on JailbreakBench and near-baseline performance on general benchmarks. The approach generalizes across 4B and 80B models and can also induce targeted refusals when desired. We analize the steering vectors and show that refusal signals concentrate in deeper layers of the transformer and are distributed across many dimensions. Together, these results demonstrate that activation steering can remove political refusal behaviour while retaining safety alignment for harmful content, offering a practical path to controllable, transparent moderation at inference time.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> API misuse in code generated by large language models (LLMs) presents a serious and growing challenge in software development, as although LLMs demonstrate impressive code generation capabilities, their interactions with complex library APIs are often error-prone and can lead to software failures and vulnerabilities. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale study of API misuse patterns in LLM-generated code by analyzing both method selection and parameter usage across Python and Java, using three representative LLMs: StarCoder-7B, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B, and GitHub Copilot. Based on extensive manual annotation of 3,209 method-level and 3,492 parameter-level misuses, we identify and categorize four recurring misuse types by building on and refining prior API misuse taxonomies. Our evaluation of the three LLMs reveals persistent challenges in API usage, particularly hallucination and intent misalignment. To address these issues, we propose Dr.Fix, an LLM-based automatic repair approach guided by our taxonomy, which improves repair accuracy compared to baseline prompting and existing repair methods, achieving gains of up to 38.4 BLEU and 40% exact match on benchmark datasets. This work offers important insights into the current limitations of LLMs in API usage and points to directions for improving automated misuse repair in code generation systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a major chronic respiratory disease with persistent airflow limitation, is a leading global cause of disability and mortality. Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely collected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the early detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over time. However, most current AI models for COPD diagnosis are limited to outputting classification results without providing a rationale for their diagnostic process, while current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot understand spirograms yet, which severely limits their clinical trust and adoption. To tackle this challenge, we leverage a cohort of 234,028 individuals from the UK Biobank (UKB) to propose SpiroLLM, the first multimodal large language model that can understand spirogram. The model extracts morphological features from respiratory curves via a SpiroEncoder and aligns them with PFT numerical values in a unified latent space using a SpiroProjector, ultimately empowering a large language model to generate a comprehensive diagnostic report. Experimental results confirm that SpiroLLM achieved a diagnostic AUROC of 0.8977 (95% CI: 0.88-0.91). In a robustness test with missing core data, it maintained a 100% valid response rate, far surpassing the 13.4% of a text-only model and showcasing the superiority of its multimodal design. This work demonstrates the substantial potential of deeply fusing physiological signals with large language models, establishing a new paradigm for the next generation of interpretable and reliable clinical decision support tools.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present Cornserve, an efficient online serving system for an emerging class of multimodal models called Any-to-Any models. Any-to-Any models accept combinations of text and multimodal data (e.g., image, video, audio) as input and also generate combinations of text and multimodal data as output, introducing request type, computation path, and computation scaling heterogeneity in model serving.   Cornserve allows model developers to describe the computation graph of generic Any-to-Any models, which consists of heterogeneous components such as multimodal encoders, autoregressive models like Large Language Models (LLMs), and multimodal generators like Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). Given this, Cornserve's planner automatically finds an optimized deployment plan for the model, including whether and how to disaggregate the model into smaller components based on model and workload characteristics. Cornserve's distributed runtime then executes the model per the plan, efficiently handling Any-to-Any model heterogeneity during online serving. Evaluations show that Cornserve can efficiently serve diverse Any-to-Any models and workloads, delivering up to 3.81$\times$ throughput improvement and up to 5.79$\times$ tail latency reduction over existing solutions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The quadratic computational complexity of MultiHead SelfAttention (MHSA) remains a fundamental bottleneck in scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) for longcontext tasks. While sparse and linearized attention mechanisms attempt to mitigate this, they often compromise the representation of global dependencies or fail to capture multiscale semantic granularity effectively. In this paper, we propose Multiscale Aggregated Hierarchical Attention (MAHA), a novel architectural framework that reformulates the attention mechanism through hierarchical decomposition and mathematically rigorous aggregation. Unlike conventional approaches that treat token interactions at a single resolution, MAHA dynamically partitions the input sequence into hierarchical scales via learnable downsampling operators. The core innovation lies in its aggregation strategy: we model the fusion of scalespecific attention matrices as a resource allocation problem, solved via a convex optimization framework or a Nash equilibriumbased gametheoretic approach. This ensures a theoretically optimal balance between local nuance and global context fidelity. Implemented within a hybrid dilatedconvolutional transformer backbone, MAHA utilizes differentiable optimization layers to enable endtoend training. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that MAHA achieves superior scalability; empirical FLOPs analysis confirms an 81% reduction in computational cost at a sequence length of 4096 compared to standard attention. This work bridges the gap between optimization theory and sequence modeling, offering a scalable solution for nextgeneration LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained attention for aligning large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The actor-only variants of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are widely applied for their efficiency. These algorithms incorporate a clipping mechanism to improve stability. Besides, a regularization term, such as the reverse KL-divergence or a more general \(f\)-divergence, is introduced to prevent policy drift. Despite their empirical success, a rigorous theoretical understanding of the problem and the algorithm's properties is limited. This paper advances the theoretical foundations of the PPO-Clip algorithm by analyzing a deterministic actor-only PPO algorithm within the general RL setting with \(f\)-divergence regularization under the softmax policy parameterization. We derive a non-uniform Lipschitz smoothness condition and a Łojasiewicz inequality for the considered problem. Based on these, a non-asymptotic linear convergence rate to the globally optimal policy is established for the forward KL-regularizer. Furthermore, stationary convergence and local linear convergence are derived for the reverse KL-regularizer.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved from simple chatbots into sophisticated agents capable of automating complex real-world tasks, where browsing and reasoning over live web content is key to assessing retrieval and cognitive skills. Existing benchmarks like BrowseComp and xBench-DeepSearch emphasize complex reasoning searches requiring multi-hop synthesis but neglect Fuzzy Exploratory Search, namely queries that are vague and multifaceted, where users seek the most relevant webpage rather than a single factual answer. To address this gap, we introduce Needle in the Web, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate modern search agents and LLM-based systems on their ability to retrieve and reason over real-world web content in response to ambiguous, exploratory queries under varying levels of difficulty. Needle in the Web comprises 663 questions spanning seven distinct domains. To ensure high query quality and answer uniqueness, we employ a flexible methodology that reliably generates queries of controllable difficulty based on factual claims of web contents. We benchmark three leading LLMs and three agent-based search systems on Needle in the Web, finding that most models struggle: many achieve below 35% accuracy, and none consistently excel across domains or difficulty levels. These findings reveal that Needle in the Web presents a significant challenge for current search systems and highlights the open problem of effective fuzzy retrieval under semantic ambiguity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing deployment of massive active antenna arrays in low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites necessitates computationally efficient and adaptive precoding techniques to mitigate dynamic channel variations and enhance spectral efficiency. Regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding is widely used in multi-user MIMO systems; however, its real-time implementation is limited by the computationally intensive inversion of the Gram matrix. In this work, we develop a low-complexity framework that integrates the Woodbury (WB) formula with adaptive randomized singular value decomposition (arSVD) to efficiently update the Gram matrix inverse as the satellite moves along its orbit. By leveraging low-rank perturbations, the WB formula reduces inversion complexity, while arSVD dynamically extracts dominant singular components, further enhancing computational efficiency. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves computational savings of up to 61\% compared to conventional RZF precoding with full matrix inversion, while incurring only a modest degradation in sum-rate performance. These results demonstrate that WB-arSVD offers a scalable and efficient solution for next-generation satellite communications, facilitating real-time deployment in power-constrained environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for code vulnerability detection, their reliability and robustness across diverse vulnerability types have become a pressing concern. In traditional adversarial settings, code obfuscation has long been used as a general strategy to bypass auditing tools, preserving exploitability without tampering with the tools themselves. Numerous efforts have explored obfuscation methods and tools, yet their capabilities differ in terms of supported techniques, granularity, and programming languages, making it difficult to systematically assess their impact on LLM-based vulnerability detection. To address this gap, we provide a structured systematization of obfuscation techniques and evaluate them under a unified framework. Specifically, we categorize existing obfuscation methods into three major classes (layout, data flow, and control flow) covering 11 subcategories and 19 concrete techniques. We implement these techniques across four programming languages (Solidity, C, C++, and Python) using a consistent LLM-driven approach, and evaluate their effects on 15 LLMs spanning four model families (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Qwen, and LLaMA), as well as on two coding agents (GitHub Copilot and Codex). Our findings reveal both positive and negative impacts of code obfuscation on LLM-based vulnerability detection, highlighting conditions under which obfuscation leads to performance improvements or degradations. We further analyze these outcomes with respect to vulnerability characteristics, code properties, and model attributes. Finally, we outline several open problems and propose future directions to enhance the robustness of LLMs for real-world vulnerability detection.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents with advanced capabilities for understanding, reasoning, and interacting across diverse tasks. The addition of memory further enhances them by enabling continuity across interactions, learning from past experiences, and improving the relevance of actions and responses over time; termed as memory-enhanced personalization. Although such personalization through memory offers clear benefits, it also introduces risks of bias. While several previous studies have highlighted bias in ML and LLMs, bias due to memory-enhanced personalized agents is largely unexplored. Using recruitment as an example use case, we simulate the behavior of a memory-enhanced personalized agent, and study whether and how bias is introduced and amplified in and across various stages of operation. Our experiments on agents using safety-trained LLMs reveal that bias is systematically introduced and reinforced through personalization, emphasizing the need for additional protective measures or agent guardrails in memory-enhanced LLM-based AI agents.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deploying local large language models and vision-language models on edge devices requires balancing accuracy with constrained computational and energy budgets. Although graphics processors dominate modern artificial-intelligence deployment, most consumer hardware--including laptops, desktops, industrial controllers, and embedded systems--relies on central processing units. Despite this, the computational laws governing central-processing-unit-only inference for local language and vision-language workloads remain largely unexplored. We systematically benchmark large language and vision-language models on two representative central-processing-unit tiers widely used for local inference: a MacBook Pro M2, reflecting mainstream laptop-class deployment, and a Raspberry Pi 5, representing constrained, low-power embedded settings. Using a unified methodology based on continuous sampling of processor and memory usage together with area-under-curve integration, we characterize how computational load scales with input text length for language models and with image resolution for vision-language models. We uncover two empirical scaling laws: (1) computational cost for language-model inference scales approximately linearly with token length; and (2) vision-language models exhibit a preprocessing-driven "resolution knee", where compute remains constant above an internal resolution clamp and decreases sharply below it. Beyond these laws, we show that quantum-inspired compression reduces processor and memory usage by up to 71.9% and energy consumption by up to 62%, while preserving or improving semantic accuracy. These results provide a systematic quantification of multimodal central-processing-unit-only scaling for local language and vision-language workloads, and they identify model compression and input-resolution preprocessing as effective, low-cost levers for sustainable edge inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This study investigated the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for simplifying biomedical texts to enhance health literacy. Using a public dataset, which included plain language adaptations of biomedical abstracts, we developed and evaluated several approaches, specifically a baseline approach using a prompt template, a two AI agent approach, and a fine-tuning approach. We selected OpenAI gpt-4o and gpt-4o mini models as baselines for further research. We evaluated our approaches with quantitative metrics, such as Flesch-Kincaid grade level, SMOG Index, SARI, and BERTScore, G-Eval, as well as with qualitative metric, more precisely 5-point Likert scales for simplicity, accuracy, completeness, brevity. Results showed a superior performance of gpt-4o-mini and an underperformance of FT approaches. G-Eval, a LLM based quantitative metric, showed promising results, ranking the approaches similarly as the qualitative metric.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> When a single pilot is responsible for managing a multi-drone system, the task may demand varying levels of autonomy, from direct control of individual UAVs, to group-level coordination, to fully autonomous swarm behaviors for accomplishing high-level tasks. Enabling such flexible interaction requires a framework that supports multiple modes of shared autonomy. As language models continue to improve in reasoning and planning, they provide a natural foundation for such systems, reducing pilot workload by enabling high-level task delegation through intuitive, language-based interfaces. In this paper we present TACOS (Task-Agnostic COordinator of a multi-drone System), a unified framework that enables high-level natural language control of multi-UAV systems through Large Language Models (LLMs). TACOS integrates three key capabilities into a single architecture: a one-to-many natural language interface for intuitive user interaction, an intelligent coordinator for translating user intent into structured task plans, and an autonomous agent that executes plans interacting with the real world. TACOS allows a LLM to interact with a library of executable APIs, bridging semantic reasoning with real-time multi-robot coordination. We demonstrate the system on a real-world multi-drone system, and conduct an ablation study to assess the contribution of each module.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> High-temperature solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) are a potential core power-to-X (P2X) technology due to their unparalleled system efficiencies, that can exceed 85 % when excess heat from exothermic downstream processes is available. Recent advancements in materials, cell and stack design have enabled the deployment of megawatt (MW) scale demonstration plants and gigawatt (GW) scale manufacturing capacities. Consequently, key challenges to industrial-scale adoption scale now increasingly lie at the system level. Unlike previous SOEC reviews focused on materials and stack-level innovations, this work uniquely addresses emerging interdisciplinary system-level challenges and highlights the need for a paradigm shift. Several key insights are identified. Pressurized operation plays a crucial role in enhancing SOEC system performance and enabling better process integration. The dynamic capabilities of SOECs are better than often assumed and can further be improved via advanced operating strategies and modularization. Balance-of-plant (BoP) component costs rival stack capital expenditure, emphasizing the need for cost reductions through economies of scale via mass production and cross-industry synergies. Co-electrolysis remains at a lower technology readiness level and lacks MW scale demonstration. Furthermore, demonstrated integration with downstream processes across entire P2X chains remains scarce. Future research and development strategies are proposed, offering a roadmap to overcome these challenges and accelerate SOEC commercialization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantised neural networks (QNNs) shrink models and reduce inference energy through low-bit arithmetic, yet most still depend on a running statistics batch normalisation (BN) layer, preventing true integer-only deployment. Prior attempts remove BN by parameter folding or tailored initialisation; while helpful, they rarely recover BN's stability and accuracy and often impose bespoke constraints. We present a BN-free, fully integer QNN trained via a progressive, layer-wise distillation scheme that slots into existing low-bit pipelines. Starting from a pretrained BN-enabled teacher, we use layer-wise targets and progressive compensation to train a student that performs inference exclusively with integer arithmetic and contains no BN operations. On ImageNet with AlexNet, the BN-free model attains competitive Top-1 accuracy under aggressive quantisation. The procedure integrates directly with standard quantisation workflows, enabling end-to-end integer-only inference for resource-constrained settings such as edge and embedded devices.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across various tasks, yet their high computational demands pose deployment challenges, especially on consumer-grade hardware. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models provide an efficient solution through selective activation of parameter subsets, which reduces computation requirements. Despite this efficiency, state-of-the-art MoE models still require substantial memory beyond typical consumer GPU capacities. Traditional offloading methods that transfer model weights between CPU and GPU introduce latency, limiting inference performance. This paper presents a novel CPU-GPU collaborative inference framework that incorporates an expert caching mechanism on the GPU to reduce data transfer requirements and enable faster inference through cache hits. Computations are offloaded to CPU for efficient cache miss handling, which benefits from CPU multithreading optimizations. The evaluations of our framework demonstrate performance improvements and highlight the potential of CPU-GPU collaboration to maximize hardware utilization for single-request inference scenarios on consumer-grade systems. The implementation of our framework is available at https://github.com/elsa-lab/MoE-CPU-GPU-Collaborative-Inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trusted to perform automated code review and static analysis at scale, supporting tasks such as vulnerability detection, summarization, and refactoring. In this paper, we identify and exploit a critical vulnerability in LLM-based code analysis: an abstraction bias that causes models to overgeneralize familiar programming patterns and overlook small, meaningful bugs. Adversaries can exploit this blind spot to hijack the control flow of the LLM's interpretation with minimal edits and without affecting actual runtime behavior. We refer to this attack as a Familiar Pattern Attack (FPA).   We develop a fully automated, black-box algorithm that discovers and injects FPAs into target code. Our evaluation shows that FPAs are not only effective against basic and reasoning models, but are also transferable across model families (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google), and universal across programming languages (Python, C, Rust, Go). Moreover, FPAs remain effective even when models are explicitly warned about the attack via robust system prompts. Finally, we explore positive, defensive uses of FPAs and discuss their broader implications for the reliability and safety of code-oriented LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Underwater acoustic (UWA) communications are essential for high-speed marine data transmission but remain severely constrained by limited bandwidth, significant propagation loss, and sparse multipath structures. Conventional underwater acoustic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems primarily utilize spatial diversity but suffer from limited array resolution, causing angular ambiguity and insufficient spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). This paper addresses these limitations through acoustic Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (aRIS) to actively generate orthogonally distinguishable virtual paths, significantly enhancing spatial DoFs and channel capacity. An ocean-specific DoF-channel coupling model is established, explicitly deriving conditions for spatial rank enhancement. Subsequently, the optimal geometric locus, termed the Light-Point, is analytically identified, where deploying a single aRIS maximizes DoFs by introducing two and three additional resolvable paths in deep-sea and shallow-sea environments, respectively. Furthermore, an active simultaneous transmitting and reflecting (ASTAR) aRIS architecture with independent beam control and adaptive beam-tracking mechanism integrating unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and acoustic intensity gradient sensing is proposed. Extensive simulations validate the proposed joint aRIS deployment and beamforming framework, demonstrating substantial UWA channel capacity improvements-up to 265% and 170% in shallow-sea and deep-sea scenarios, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> An alternative extreme learning machine -ELM- paradigm is presented exploiting random non-linearities -RN, named RN-ELM, instead of a conventional fixed node non-linearity. This method is implemented on a hybrid neural engine, with the physical layer realized by an integrated silicon photonic mesh and the digital layer by a simple regression algorithm. Non-linearities are intrinsically non-power depended and are generated through non-linear frequency to power mapping offered by optical filters. The numerical evaluation is based on an experimentally derived transfer function of an all-pass filter, implemented on a silicon reconfigurable photonic integrated chip -RPIC. RN-ELM is evaluated in a twofold manner; first as a machine learning scheme, where the expressivity offered by multiple, yet random, activation functions lead to a compact and highly simplified design with 5 optical filters, offering state-of-the-art performance in time-series prediction tasks with minimum hardware requirements. The second scenario entails its deployment as a physical unclonable function -PUF, for authentication applications directly in the physical layer. In this case, the random activation functions are associated with unavoidable, fabrication related waveguide imperfections that can act as hardware signatures. Numerical results reveal a probability of cloning as low as 10e-15, which corresponds to a highly secure authentication token.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Optimizing CUDA kernels is a challenging and labor-intensive task, given the need for hardware-software co-design expertise and the proprietary nature of high-performance kernel libraries. While recent large language models (LLMs) combined with evolutionary algorithms show promise in automatic kernel optimization, existing approaches often fall short in performance due to their suboptimal agent designs and mismatched evolution representations. This work identifies these mismatches and proposes cuPilot, a strategy-coordinated multi-agent framework that introduces strategy as an intermediate semantic representation for kernel evolution. Key contributions include a strategy-coordinated evolution algorithm, roofline-guided prompting, and strategy-level population initialization. Experimental results show that the generated kernels by cuPilot achieve an average speed up of 3.09$\times$ over PyTorch on a benchmark of 100 kernels. On the GEMM tasks, cuPilot showcases sophisticated optimizations and achieves high utilization of critical hardware units. The generated kernels are open-sourced at https://github.com/champloo2878/cuPilot-Kernels.git.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for interpreting multivariate time-series data, yet their application to real-world battery energy storage system (BESS) operation and maintenance remains largely unexplored. Here, we present TimeSeries2Report (TS2R), a prompting framework that converts raw lithium-ion battery operational time-series into structured, semantically enriched reports, enabling LLMs to reason, predict, and make decisions in BESS management scenarios. TS2R encodes short-term temporal dynamics into natural language through a combination of segmentation, semantic abstraction, and rule-based interpretation, effectively bridging low-level sensor signals with high-level contextual insights. We benchmark TS2R across both lab-scale and real-world datasets, evaluating report quality and downstream task performance in anomaly detection, state-of-charge prediction, and charging/discharging management. Compared with vision-, embedding-, and text-based prompting baselines, report-based prompting via TS2R consistently improves LLM performance in terms of across accuracy, robustness, and explainability metrics. Notably, TS2R-integrated LLMs achieve expert-level decision quality and predictive consistency without retraining or architecture modification, establishing a practical path for adaptive, LLM-driven battery intelligence.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Growing concerns about fairness, privacy, robustness, and transparency have made it a central expectation of AI governance that automated decisions be explainable by institutions and intelligible to affected parties. We introduce the Smart Data Portfolio (SDP) framework, which treats data categories as productive but risk-bearing assets, formalizing input governance as an information-risk trade-off. Within this framework, we define two portfolio-level quantities, Informational Return and Governance-Adjusted Risk, whose interaction characterizes data mixtures and generates a Governance-Efficient Frontier. Regulators shape this frontier through risk caps, admissible categories, and weight bands that translate fairness, privacy, robustness, and provenance requirements into measurable constraints on data allocation while preserving model flexibility. A telecommunications illustration shows how different AI services require distinct portfolios within a common governance structure. The framework offers a familiar portfolio logic as an input-level explanation layer suited to the large-scale deployment of AI systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We develop a resource-efficient methodology for measuring economic outlook in news text that combines document embeddings with synthetic training data generated by large language models. Applied to 27 million news articles, the resulting indicator significantly improves GDP growth forecast accuracy and captures sentiment shifts weeks before official releases, proving particularly valuable during crises. The indicator outperforms both survey-based benchmarks and traditional dictionary methods and is interpretable, allowing identification of specific drivers of economic sentiment. Our approach addresses key institutional constraints: it performs sentiment classification locally, enabling analysis of proprietary news content without transmission to external services while requiring minimal computational resources compared to direct LLM classification. The methodology generalizes to other countries and restricted data environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multi-agent systems have demonstrated the ability to improve performance on a variety of predictive tasks by leveraging collaborative decision making. However, the lack of effective evaluation methodologies has made it difficult to estimate the risk of bias, making deployment of such systems unsafe in high stakes domains such as consumer finance, where biased decisions can translate directly into regulatory breaches and financial loss. To address this challenge, we need to develop fairness evaluation methodologies for multi-agent predictive systems and measure the fairness characteristics of these systems in the financial tabular domain. Examining fairness metrics using large-scale simulations across diverse multi-agent configurations, with varying communication and collaboration mechanisms, we reveal patterns of emergent bias in financial decision-making that cannot be traced to individual agent components, indicating that multi-agent systems may exhibit genuinely collective behaviors. Our findings highlight that fairness risks in financial multi-agent systems represent a significant component of model risk, with tangible impacts on tasks such as credit scoring and income estimation. We advocate that multi-agent decision systems must be evaluated as holistic entities rather than through reductionist analyses of their constituent components.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Ontology matching (OM) enables semantic interoperability between different ontologies and resolves their conceptual heterogeneity by aligning related entities. OM systems currently have two prevailing design paradigms: conventional knowledge-based expert systems and newer machine learning-based predictive systems. While large language models (LLMs) and LLM agents have revolutionised data engineering and have been applied creatively in many domains, their potential for OM remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel agent-powered LLM-based design paradigm for OM systems. With consideration of several specific challenges in leveraging LLM agents for OM, we propose a generic framework, namely Agent-OM (Agent for Ontology Matching), consisting of two Siamese agents for retrieval and matching, with a set of OM tools. Our framework is implemented in a proof-of-concept system. Evaluations of three Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks over state-of-the-art OM systems show that our system can achieve results very close to the long-standing best performance on simple OM tasks and can significantly improve the performance on complex and few-shot OM tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In clinical machine learning, the coexistence of multiple models with comparable performance -- a manifestation of the Rashomon Effect -- poses fundamental challenges for trustworthy deployment and evaluation. Small, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, coupled with high-dimensional and weakly identified clinical features, amplify this multiplicity and make conventional validation schemes unreliable. As a result, selecting among equally performing models becomes uncertain, particularly when resource constraints and operational priorities are not considered by conventional metrics like F1 score. To address these issues, we propose two complementary tools for robust model assessment and selection: Intervention Efficiency (IE) and the Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF). IE is a capacity-aware metric that quantifies how efficiently a model identifies actionable true positives when only limited interventions are feasible, thereby linking predictive performance with clinical utility. PVF introduces a structured approach to assess the stability of models under data perturbations, identifying models whose performance remains most invariant across noisy or shifted validation sets. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world healthcare datasets show that using these tools facilitates the selection of models that generalize more robustly and align with capacity constraints, offering a new direction for tackling the Rashomon Effect in clinical settings.

With the rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), and particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), new possibilities emerge to find and explore literature. We introduce ASK (Assistant for Scientific Knowledge), an AI-driven scholarly literature search and exploration system that follows a neuro-symbolic approach. ASK aims to provide active support to researchers in finding relevant scholarly literature by leveraging vector search, LLMs, and knowledge graphs. The system allows users to input research questions in natural language and retrieve relevant articles.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) has long been envisioned as a complementary tool for synthetic chemists. However, existing frameworks often lack mechanisms to allow interaction with human experts, limiting their ability to integrate chemists' insights. In this work, we introduce Synthelite, a synthesis planning framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to directly propose retrosynthetic transformations. Synthelite can generate end-to-end synthesis routes by harnessing the intrinsic chemical knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, while allowing expert intervention through natural language prompts. Our experiments demonstrate that Synthelite can flexibly adapt its planning trajectory to diverse user-specified constraints, achieving up to 95\% success rates in both strategy-constrained and starting-material-constrained synthesis tasks. Additionally, Synthelite exhibits the ability to account for chemical feasibility during route design. We envision Synthelite to be both a useful tool and a step toward a paradigm where LLMs are the central orchestrators of synthesis planning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The use of Large Language Models (LLM) by providers of cybersecurity and digital infrastructures of all kinds is an ongoing development. It is suggested and on an experimental basis used to write the code for the systems, and potentially fed with sensitive data or what would otherwise be considered trade secrets. Outside of these obvious points, this paper asks how AI can negatively affect cybersecurity and law when used for the design and deployment of security infrastructure by its developers.   Firstly, the paper discusses the use of LLMs in security, either directly or indirectly, and briefly tackles other types of AI. It then lists norms in cybersecurity, then a range of legal cybersecurity obligations from the European Union, to create a frame of reference. Secondly, the paper describes how LLMs may fail to fulfil both legal obligations and best practice in cybersecurity is given, and the paper ends with some economic and practical consequences for this development, with some notions of solutions as well.   The paper finds that using LLMs comes with many risks, many of which are against good security practice, and the legal obligations in security regulation. This is because of the inherent weaknesses of LLMs, most of which are mitigated if replaced with symbolic AI. Both also have issues fulfilling basic traceability obligations and practice. Solutions are secondary systems surrounding LLM based AI, fulfilment of security norms beyond legal requirements and simply not using such technology in certain situations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current token-sequence-based Large Language Models (LLMs) are not well-suited for directly processing 3D Boundary Representation (Brep) models that contain complex geometric and topological information. We propose BrepLLM, the first framework that enables LLMs to parse and reason over raw Brep data, bridging the modality gap between structured 3D geometry and natural language. BrepLLM employs a two-stage training pipeline: Cross-modal Alignment Pre-training and Multi-stage LLM Fine-tuning. In the first stage, an adaptive UV sampling strategy converts Breps into graphs representation with geometric and topological information. We then design a hierarchical BrepEncoder to extract features from geometry (i.e., faces and edges) and topology, producing both a single global token and a sequence of node tokens. Then we align the global token with text embeddings from a frozen CLIP text encoder (ViT-L/14) via contrastive learning. In the second stage, we integrate the pretrained BrepEncoder into an LLM. We then align its sequence of node tokens using a three-stage progressive training strategy: (1) training an MLP-based semantic mapping from Brep representation to 2D with 2D-LLM priors. (2) performing fine-tuning of the LLM. (3) designing a Mixture-of-Query Experts (MQE) to enhance geometric diversity modeling. We also construct Brep2Text, a dataset comprising 269,444 Brep-text question-answer pairs. Experiments show that BrepLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on 3D object classification and captioning tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) in biomedicine face a fundamental conflict between static parameter knowledge and the dynamic nature of clinical evidence. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by grounding generation in external data, yet it introduces new complexities in latency and architecture. This survey synthesizes the biomedical RAG landscape (2020-2025), classifying systems into naive, advanced, and modular paradigms. Beyond a technological taxonomy, we formalize the biomedical RAG trilemma, identifying the inherent trade-offs between reasoning depth, inference latency, and data privacy that constrain current clinical deployment. We analyze how recent agentic workflows enhance diagnostic reasoning but risk prohibitive latency, and how privacy constraints dictate the choice between powerful cloud-based models and local deployment. Finally, we outline the alignment gap in multimodal RAG and propose future directions for self-correcting, verifiable clinical agents.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper examines aspirational requirements for software addressing mixed-integer optimization problems constrained by the nonlinear Shallow Water partial differential equations (PDEs), motivated by applications such as river-flow management in hydropower cascades. Realistic deployment of such software would require the simultaneous treatment of nonlinear and potentially non-smooth PDE dynamics, limited theoretical guarantees on the existence and regularity of control-to-state mappings under varying boundary conditions, and computational performance compatible with operational decision-making. In addition, practical settings motivate consideration of uncertainty arising from forecasts of demand, inflows, and environmental conditions. At present, the theoretical foundations, numerical optimization methods, and large-scale scientific computing tools required to address these challenges in a unified and tractable manner remain the subject of ongoing research across the associated research communities. Rather than proposing a complete solution, this work uses the problem as a case study to identify and organize the mathematical, algorithmic, and computational components that would be necessary for its realization. The resulting framework highlights open challenges and intermediate research directions, and may inform both more circumscribed related problems and the design of future large-scale collaborative efforts aimed at addressing such objectives.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) holds immense potential to streamline clinical documentation, such as digitizing handwritten prescriptions and reports, thereby increasing patient throughput and reducing costs in resource-constrained sectors like rural healthcare. However, realizing this utility is currently obstructed by significant technical barriers: strict data privacy constraints, limited computational resources, and severe acoustic domain shifts. We quantify this gap by showing that a robust multilingual model (IndicWav2Vec) degrades to a stark 40.94% Word Error Rate (WER) when deployed on real-world clinical audio (Gram Vaani), rendering it unusable for practical applications. To address these challenges and bring ASR closer to deployment, we propose an efficient, privacy-preserving adaptation framework. We employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable continual learning from incoming data streams directly on edge devices, ensuring patient data confidentiality. Our strategy yields a 17.1% relative improvement in WER on the target domain. Furthermore, by integrating multi-domain experience replay, we reduce catastrophic forgetting by 47% compared to naive adaptation. These results demonstrate a viable pathway for building reliable, self-improving ASR systems that can operate effectively within the constraints of high-impact real-world environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Computational stylometry studies writing style through quantitative textual patterns, enabling applications such as authorship attribution, identity linking, and plagiarism detection. Existing supervised and contrastive approaches often rely on datasets with spurious correlations, conflating style with topic. Despite the relevance of language modeling to these tasks, the pre-training of modern large language models (LLMs) has been underutilized in general authorship analysis. We introduce an unsupervised framework that uses the log-probabilities of an LLM to measure style transferability between two texts. This framework takes advantage of the extensive CLM pre-training and in-context capabilities of modern LLMs. Our approach avoids explicit supervision with spuriously correlated data. Our method substantially outperforms unsupervised prompting-based baselines at similar model sizes and exceeds contrastively trained models when controlling for topical overlap. Our framework's performance improves with model size. In the case of authorship verification, we present an additional mechanism that increases test-time computation to improve accuracy; enabling flexible trade-offs between computational cost and task performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) frequently produce false refusals, declining benign requests that contain terms resembling unsafe queries. We address this challenge by introducing two comprehensive benchmarks: the Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (XSB) for single-turn prompts, annotated with "Focus" keywords that identify refusal-inducing triggers, and the Multi-turn Scenario-based Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (MS-XSB), which systematically evaluates refusal calibration in realistic, context-rich dialog settings. Our benchmarks reveal that exaggerated refusals persist across diverse recent LLMs and are especially pronounced in complex, multi-turn scenarios. To mitigate these failures, we leverage post-hoc explanation methods to identify refusal triggers and deploy three lightweight, model-agnostic approaches, ignore-word instructions, prompt rephrasing, and attention steering, at inference time, all without retraining or parameter access. Experiments on four instruction-tuned Llama models demonstrate that these strategies substantially improve compliance on safe prompts while maintaining robust safety protections. Our findings establish a reproducible framework for diagnosing and mitigating exaggerated refusals, highlighting practical pathways to safer and more helpful LLM deployments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we present the first detailed analysis of how training hyperparameters -- such as learning rate, weight decay, momentum, and batch size -- influence robustness against both transfer-based and query-based attacks. Supported by theory and experiments, our study spans a variety of practical deployment settings, including centralized training, ensemble learning, and distributed training. We uncover a striking dichotomy: for transfer-based attacks, decreasing the learning rate significantly enhances robustness by up to $64\%$. In contrast, for query-based attacks, increasing the learning rate consistently leads to improved robustness by up to $28\%$ across various settings and data distributions. Leveraging these findings, we explore -- for the first time -- the training hyperparameter space to jointly enhance robustness against both transfer-based and query-based attacks. Our results reveal that distributed models benefit the most from hyperparameter tuning, achieving a remarkable tradeoff by simultaneously mitigating both attack types more effectively than other training setups.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Attention is the dominant source of latency during long-context LLM inference, an increasingly popular workload with reasoning models and RAG. We propose Kascade, a training-free sparse attention method that leverages known observations such as 1) post-softmax attention is intrinsically sparse, and 2) the identity of high-weight keys is stable across nearby layers. Kascade computes exact Top-k indices in a small set of anchor layers, then reuses those indices in intermediate reuse layers. The anchor layers are selected algorithmically, via a dynamic-programming objective that maximizes cross-layer similarity over a development set, allowing easy deployment across models. The method incorporates efficient implementation constraints (e.g. tile-level operations), across both prefill and decode attention. The Top-k selection and reuse in Kascade is head-aware and we show in our experiments that this is critical for high accuracy. Kascade achieves up to 4.1x speedup in decode attention and 2.2x speedup in prefill attention over FlashAttention-3 baseline on H100 GPUs while closely matching dense attention accuracy on long-context benchmarks such as LongBench and AIME-24.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantifying predictive uncertainty is essential for safe and trustworthy real-world AI deployment. Yet, fully nonparametric estimation of conditional distributions remains challenging for multivariate targets. We propose Tomographic Quantile Forests (TQF), a nonparametric, uncertainty-aware, tree-based regression model for multivariate targets. TQF learns conditional quantiles of directional projections $\mathbf{n}^{\top}\mathbf{y}$ as functions of the input $\mathbf{x}$ and the unit direction $\mathbf{n}$. At inference, it aggregates quantiles across many directions and reconstructs the multivariate conditional distribution by minimizing the sliced Wasserstein distance via an efficient alternating scheme with convex subproblems. Unlike classical directional-quantile approaches that typically produce only convex quantile regions and require training separate models for different directions, TQF covers all directions with a single model without imposing convexity restrictions. We evaluate TQF on synthetic and real-world datasets, and release the source code on GitHub.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Agentic systems, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), assist network engineers with network configuration synthesis and network troubleshooting tasks. For network troubleshooting, progress is hindered by the absence of standardized and accessible benchmarks for evaluating LLM agents in dynamic network settings at low operational effort. We present NIKA, the largest public benchmark to date for LLM-driven network incident diagnosis and troubleshooting. NIKA targets both domain experts and especially AI researchers alike, providing zero-effort replay of real-world network scenarios, and establishing well-defined agent-network interfaces for quick agent prototyping. NIKA comprises hundreds of curated network incidents, spanning five network scenarios, from data centers to ISP networks, and covers 54 representative network issues. Lastly, NIKA is modular and extensible by design, offering APIs to facilitate the integration of new network scenarios and failure cases. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLM agents on NIKA and find that while larger models succeed more often in detecting network issues, they still struggle to localize faults and identify root causes. NIKA is open-source and available to the community: https://github.com/sands-lab/nika.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As the automotive industry shifts its focus toward software-defined vehicles, the need for faster and reliable software development continues to grow. However, traditional methods show their limitations. The rise of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), introduces new opportunities to automate automotive software development tasks such as requirement analysis and code generation. However, due to the complexity of automotive systems, where software components must interact with each other seamlessly, challenges remain in software integration and system-level validation. In this paper, we propose to combine GenAI with model-driven engineering to automate automotive software development. Our approach uses LLMs to convert free-text requirements into event chain descriptions and to generate platform-independent software components that realize the required functionality. At the same time, formal models are created based on event chain descriptions to support system validation and the generation of integration code for integrating generated software components in the whole vehicle system through middleware. This approach increases development automation while enabling formal analysis to improve system reliability. As a proof of concept, we used GPT-4o to implement our method and tested it in the CARLA simulation environment with ROS2 middleware. We evaluated the system in a simple Autonomous Emergency Braking scenario.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Stories are a fundamental aspect of human experience. Engaging deeply with stories and spotting plot holes -- inconsistencies in a storyline that break the internal logic or rules of a story's world -- requires nuanced reasoning skills, including tracking entities and events and their interplay, abstract thinking, pragmatic narrative understanding, commonsense and social reasoning, and theory of mind. As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly generate, interpret, and modify text, rigorously assessing their narrative consistency and deeper language understanding becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks focus mainly on surface-level comprehension. In this work, we propose plot hole detection in stories as a proxy to evaluate language understanding and reasoning in LLMs. We introduce FlawedFictionsMaker, a novel algorithm to controllably and carefully synthesize plot holes in human-written stories. Using this algorithm, we construct a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' plot hole detection abilities in stories -- FlawedFictions -- , which is robust to contamination, with human filtering ensuring high quality. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle in accurately solving FlawedFictions regardless of the reasoning effort allowed, with performance significantly degrading as story length increases. Finally, we show that LLM-based story summarization and story generation are prone to introducing plot holes, with more than 50% and 100% increases in plot hole detection rates with respect to human-written originals.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As Large Language Models (LLMs) expand beyond text, integrating speech as a native modality has given rise to SpeechLLMs, which aim to translate spoken language directly, thereby bypassing traditional transcription-based pipelines. Whether this integration improves speech-to-text translation quality over established cascaded architectures, however, remains an open question. We present Hearing to Translate, the first comprehensive test suite rigorously benchmarking 5 state-of-the-art SpeechLLMs against 16 strong direct and cascade systems that couple leading speech foundation models (SFM), with multilingual LLMs. Our analysis spans 16 benchmarks, 13 language pairs, and 9 challenging conditions, including disfluent, noisy, and long-form speech. Across this extensive evaluation, we find that cascaded systems remain the most reliable overall, while current SpeechLLMs only match cascades in selected settings and SFMs lag behind both, highlighting that integrating an LLM, either within the model or in a pipeline, is essential for high-quality speech translation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> State-of-the-art Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models can generate visually impressive results, yet they still frequently fail to compose complex scenes or follow logical temporal instructions. In this paper, we argue that many errors, including apparent motion failures, originate from the model's inability to construct a semantically correct or logically consistent initial frame. We introduce Factorized Video Generation (FVG), a pipeline that decouples these tasks by decomposing the Text-to-Video generation into three specialized stages: (1) Reasoning, where a Large Language Model (LLM) rewrites the video prompt to describe only the initial scene, resolving temporal ambiguities; (2) Composition, where a Text-to-Image (T2I) model synthesizes a high-quality, compositionally-correct anchor frame from this new prompt; and (3) Temporal Synthesis, where a video model, finetuned to understand this anchor, focuses its entire capacity on animating the scene and following the prompt. Our decomposed approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the T2V CompBench benchmark and significantly improves all tested models on VBench2. Furthermore, we show that visual anchoring allows us to cut the number of sampling steps by 70% without any loss in performance, leading to a substantial speed-up in sampling. Factorized Video Generation offers a simple yet practical path toward more efficient, robust, and controllable video synthesis

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The RPKI is crucial for securing the routing system of the Internet. With the RPKI, owners of Internet resources can make cryptographically backed claims, for example about the legitimate origin of their IP space. Thousands of networks use this information to detect malicious or accidental route hijacks. The RPKI consists out of 100 distributed repositories. However, public reports claim that some of these repositories are unreliable. A current Internet-Draft suggests best practices on how to operate these repositories, with the goal to improve deployment quality.   Inspired by this draft, we take a first look at the operational practices of repositories of the RPKI. We mainly focus on the distribution of RPKI information. We find that there is a wide variety in deployment practices, of which some might risk the availability of parts of the information in the RPKI. This study creates a baseline for measuring the maturity of RPKI repositories in the future.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Novelty assessment is a central yet understudied aspect of peer review, particularly in high volume fields like NLP where reviewer capacity is increasingly strained. We present a structured approach for automated novelty evaluation that models expert reviewer behavior through three stages: content extraction from submissions, retrieval and synthesis of related work, and structured comparison for evidence based assessment. Our method is informed by a large scale analysis of human written novelty reviews and captures key patterns such as independent claim verification and contextual reasoning. Evaluated on 182 ICLR 2025 submissions with human annotated reviewer novelty assessments, the approach achieves 86.5% alignment with human reasoning and 75.3% agreement on novelty conclusions - substantially outperforming existing LLM based baselines. The method produces detailed, literature aware analyses and improves consistency over ad hoc reviewer judgments. These results highlight the potential for structured LLM assisted approaches to support more rigorous and transparent peer review without displacing human expertise. Data and code are made available.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LLM-based agents can autonomously accomplish complex tasks across various domains. However, to further cultivate capabilities such as adaptive behavior and long-term decision-making, training on static datasets built from human-level knowledge is insufficient. These datasets are costly to construct and lack both dynamism and realism. A growing consensus is that agents should instead interact directly with environments and learn from experience through reinforcement learning. We formalize this iterative process as the Generation-Execution-Feedback (GEF) loop, where environments generate tasks to challenge agents, return observations in response to agents' actions during task execution, and provide evaluative feedback on rollouts for subsequent learning. Under this paradigm, environments function as indispensable producers of experiential data, highlighting the need to scale them toward greater complexity, realism, and interactivity. In this survey, we systematically review representative methods for environment scaling from a pioneering environment-centric perspective and organize them along the stages of the GEF loop, namely task generation, task execution, and feedback. We further analyze implementation frameworks, challenges, and applications, consolidating fragmented advances and outlining future research directions for agent intelligence.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose a collaborative edge-to-server inference framework for vision-language models (VLMs) that reduces the communication cost while maintaining inference accuracy. In typical deployments, visual data captured at edge devices (clients) is transmitted to the server for VLM inference. However, resizing the original image (global image) to match the vision encoder's input resolution often discards fine-grained details, leading to accuracy degradation. To overcome this limitation, we design a two-stage framework. In the first stage, the server performs inference on the global image and identifies a region of interest (RoI) using the VLM's internal attention. The min-entropy of the output tokens is then computed as a confidence measure to determine whether retransmission is required. If the min-entropy exceeds a predefined threshold, the server requests the edge device to send a detail-preserved local image of the RoI. The server then refines its inference by jointly leveraging the global and local images. This selective retransmission strategy ensures that only essential visual content is transmitted. Experiments across multiple VLM architectures show that the proposed framework significantly reduces communication cost while maintaining inference accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Managing extensive context remains a critical bottleneck for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in applications like long-document question answering and autonomous agents where lengthy inputs incur high computational costs and introduce noise. Existing compression techniques often disrupt local coherence through discrete token removal or rely on implicit latent encoding that suffers from positional bias and incompatibility with closed-source APIs. To address these limitations, we introduce the EDU-based Context Compressor, a novel explicit compression framework designed to preserve both global structure and fine-grained details. Our approach reformulates context compression as a structure-then-select process. First, our LingoEDU transforms linear text into a structural relation tree of Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) which are anchored strictly to source indices to eliminate hallucination. Second, a lightweight ranking module selects query-relevant sub-trees for linearization. To rigorously evaluate structural understanding, we release StructBench, a manually annotated dataset of 248 diverse documents. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art structural prediction accuracy and significantly outperforms frontier LLMs while reducing costs. Furthermore, our structure-aware compression substantially enhances performance across downstream tasks ranging from long-context tasks to complex Deep Search scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The cognitive process of Search-as-Learning (SAL) is most effective when searching promotes active encoding of information. The rise of LLMs-based chatbots, which provide instant answers, introduces a trade-off between efficiency and depth of processing. Such answer-centric approaches accelerate information access, but they also raise concerns about shallower learning. To examine these issues in the context of SAL, we conducted a large-scale survey of educators and students to capture perceived risks and benefits of LLM-based chatbots. In addition, we adopted the encoding-storage paradigm to design a within-subjects experiment, where participants (N=92) engaged in SAL tasks using three different modalities: books, search engines, and chatbots. Our findings provide a counterintuitive insight into stakeholder concerns: while LLM-based chatbots and search engines validated perceived benefits on learning efficiency by outperforming book-based search in immediate conceptual understanding, they did not result in a long-term inferiority as feared. Our study provides insights for designing human-AI collaborative learning systems that promote cognitive engagement by balancing learning efficiency and long-term knowledge retention.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Early prediction of battery cycle life is essential for accelerating battery research, manufacturing, and deployment. Although machine learning methods have shown encouraging results, progress is hindered by data scarcity and heterogeneity arising from diverse aging conditions. In other fields, foundation models (FMs) trained on diverse datasets have achieved broad generalization through transfer learning, but no FMs have been reported for battery cycle life prediction yet. Here we present the Pretrained Battery Transformer (PBT), the first FM for battery life prediction, developed through domain-knowledge-encoded mixture-of-expert layers. Validated on the largest public battery life database, PBT learns transferable representations from 13 lithium-ion battery (LIB) datasets, outperforming existing models by an average of 19.8%. With transfer learning, PBT achieves state-of-the-art performance across 15 diverse datasets encompassing various operating conditions, formation protocols, and chemistries of LIBs. This work establishes a foundation model pathway for battery lifetime prediction, paving the way toward universal battery lifetime prediction systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper addresses the challenge of achieving optimal Quality of Information (QoI) in non-dedicated vehicular mobile crowdsensing (NVMCS) systems. The key obstacles are the interrelated issues of sensing coverage, sensing reliability, and the dynamic participation of vehicles. To tackle these, we propose QUIDS, a QUality-informed Incentive-driven multi-agent Dispatching System, which ensures high sensing coverage and reliability under budget constraints. QUIDS introduces a novel metric, Aggregated Sensing Quality (ASQ), to quantitatively capture QoI by integrating both coverage and reliability. We also develop a Mutually Assisted Belief-aware Vehicle Dispatching algorithm that estimates sensing reliability and allocates incentives under uncertainty, further improving ASQ. Evaluation using real-world data from a metropolitan NVMCS deployment shows QUIDS improves ASQ by 38% over non-dispatching scenarios and by 10% over state-of-the-art methods. It also reduces reconstruction map errors by 39-74% across algorithms. By jointly optimizing coverage and reliability via a quality-informed incentive mechanism, QUIDS enables low-cost, high-quality urban monitoring without dedicated infrastructure, applicable to smart-city scenarios like traffic and environmental sensing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Decentralized large language model (LLM) inference promises transparent and censorship resistant access to advanced AI, yet existing verification approaches struggle to scale to modern models. Proof of Quality (PoQ) replaces cryptographic verification of computation with consensus over output quality, but the original formulation ignores heterogeneous computational costs across inference and evaluator nodes. This paper introduces a cost-aware PoQ framework that integrates explicit efficiency measurements into the reward mechanism for both types of nodes. The design combines ground truth token level F1, lightweight learned evaluators, and GPT based judgments within a unified evaluation pipeline, and adopts a linear reward function that balances normalized quality and cost.   Experiments on extractive question answering and abstractive summarization use five instruction tuned LLMs ranging from TinyLlama-1.1B to Llama-3.2-3B and three evaluation models spanning cross encoder and bi encoder architectures. Results show that a semantic textual similarity bi encoder achieves much higher correlation with both ground truth and GPT scores than cross encoders, indicating that evaluator architecture is a critical design choice for PoQ. Quality-cost analysis further reveals that the largest models in the pool are also the most efficient in terms of quality per unit latency. Monte Carlo simulations over 5\,000 PoQ rounds demonstrate that the cost-aware reward scheme consistently assigns higher average rewards to high quality low cost inference models and to efficient evaluators, while penalizing slow low quality nodes. These findings suggest that cost-aware PoQ provides a practical foundation for economically sustainable decentralized LLM inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Channel prediction is a key technology for improving the performance of various functions such as precoding, adaptive modulation, and resource allocation in MIMO-OFDM systems. Especially in high-mobility scenarios with fast time-varying channels, it is crucial for resisting channel aging and ensuring communication quality. However, existing methods suffer from high complexity and the inability to accurately model the temporal variations of channels. To address this issue, this paper proposes CPMamba -- an efficient channel prediction framework based on the selective state space model. The proposed CPMamba architecture extracts features from historical channel state information (CSI) using a specifically designed feature extraction and embedding network and employs stacked residual Mamba modules for temporal modeling. By leveraging an input-dependent selective mechanism to dynamically adjust state transitions, it can effectively capture the long-range dependencies between the CSIs while maintaining a linear computational complexity. Simulation results under the 3GPP standard channel model demonstrate that CPMamba achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy across all scenarios, along with superior generalization and robustness. Compared to existing baseline models, CPMamba reduces the number of parameters by approximately 50 percent while achieving comparable or better performance, thereby significantly lowering the barrier for practical deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this fast-evolving area of LLMs, our paper discusses the significant security risk presented by prompt injection attacks. It focuses on small open-sourced models, specifically the LLaMA family of models. We introduce novel defense mechanisms capable of generating automatic defenses and systematically evaluate said generated defenses against a comprehensive set of benchmarked attacks. Thus, we empirically demonstrated the improvement proposed by our approach in mitigating goal-hijacking vulnerabilities in LLMs. Our work recognizes the increasing relevance of small open-sourced LLMs and their potential for broad deployments on edge devices, aligning with future trends in LLM applications. We contribute to the greater ecosystem of open-source LLMs and their security in the following: (1) assessing present prompt-based defenses against the latest attacks, (2) introducing a new framework using a seed defense (Chain Of Thoughts) to refine the defense prompts iteratively, and (3) showing significant improvements in detecting goal hijacking attacks. Out strategies significantly reduce the success rates of the attacks and false detection rates while at the same time effectively detecting goal-hijacking capabilities, paving the way for more secure and efficient deployments of small and open-source LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Resource-constrained IoT devices increasingly rely on deep learning models, however, these models experience significant accuracy drops due to domain shifts when encountering variations in lighting, weather, and seasonal conditions. While cloud-based retraining can address this issue, many IoT deployments operate with limited connectivity and energy constraints, making traditional fine-tuning approaches impractical. We explore this challenge through the lens of wildlife ecology, where camera traps must maintain accurate species classification across changing seasons, weather, and habitats without reliable connectivity. We introduce WildFit, an autonomous in-situ adaptation framework that leverages the key insight that background scenes change more frequently than the visual characteristics of monitored species. WildFit combines background-aware synthesis to generate training samples on-device with drift-aware fine-tuning that triggers model updates only when necessary to conserve resources. Our background-aware synthesis surpasses efficient baselines by 7.3% and diffusion models by 3.0% while being orders of magnitude faster, our drift-aware fine-tuning achieves Pareto optimality with 50% fewer updates and 1.5% higher accuracy, and the end-to-end system outperforms domain adaptation approaches by 20-35% while consuming only 11.2 Wh over 37 days-enabling battery-powered deployment.
