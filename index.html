                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cache side channel attacks are a sophisticated and persistent threat that exploit vulnerabilities in modern processors to extract sensitive information. These attacks leverage weaknesses in shared computational resources, particularly the last level cache, to infer patterns in data access and execution flows, often bypassing traditional security defenses. Such attacks are especially dangerous as they can be executed remotely without requiring physical access to the victim's device. This study focuses on a specific class of these threats: fingerprinting attacks, where an adversary monitors and analyzes the behavior of co-located processes via cache side channels. This can potentially reveal confidential information, such as encryption keys or user activity patterns. A comprehensive threat model illustrates how attackers sharing computational resources with target systems exploit these side channels to compromise sensitive data. To mitigate such risks, a hybrid deep learning model is proposed for detecting cache side channel attacks. Its performance is compared with five widely used deep learning models: Multi-Layer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Network, Simple Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory, and Gated Recurrent Unit. The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid model achieves a detection rate of up to 99.96%. These findings highlight the limitations of existing models, the need for enhanced defensive mechanisms, and directions for future research to secure sensitive data against evolving side channel threats.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Integrating coded caching (CC) into multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications can significantly enhance the achievable degrees of freedom (DoF) in wireless networks. This paper investigates a practical cache-aided asymmetric MIMO configuration with cache ratio $\gamma$, where a server equipped with $L$ transmit antennas communicates with $K$ users, each having $G_k$ receive antennas. We propose three content-aware MIMO-CC strategies: the \emph{min-G} scheme, which treats the system as symmetric by assuming all users have the same number of antennas, equal to the smallest among them; the \emph{Grouping} scheme, which maximizes spatial multiplexing gain separately within each user subset at the cost of some global caching gain; and the \emph{Phantom} scheme, which dynamically redistributes spatial resources using virtual or ``phantom'' antennas at the users, bridging the performance gains of the min-$G$ and Grouping schemes. These strategies jointly optimize the number of users, $\Omega$, and the parallel streams decoded by each user, $\beta_k$, ensuring linear decodability for all target users. Analytical and numerical results confirm that the proposed schemes achieve significant DoF improvements across various system configurations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> GPU hardware is vastly underutilized. Even resource-intensive AI applications have diverse resource profiles that often leave parts of GPUs idle. While colocating applications can improve utilization, current spatial sharing systems lack performance guarantees. Providing predictable performance guarantees requires a deep understanding of how applications contend for shared GPU resources such as block schedulers, compute units, L1/L2 caches, and memory bandwidth. We propose a methodology to profile resource interference of GPU kernels across these dimensions and discuss how to build GPU schedulers that provide strict performance guarantees while colocating applications to minimize cost.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Smart helpers (SHs) have been proposed to improve content delivery delays and alleviate high fronthaul loads in fog radio access networks (F-RANs). They offer an alternative to deploying additional enhanced remote radio heads (RRHs), which are often infeasible due to site constraints.} The optimal placement of SHs can significantly increase the number of users they serve which leads to enhanced cache efficiency and improved content delivery delay. In this letter, we optimize SH placement within an F-RAN to maximize the cache hit rate and further reduce the content delivery latency. We model the SH cache hit rate as a function of outage probability and user density distribution. We develop a function to estimate user density distribution leveraging the radial basis functions (RBFs) method and optimize SH placement utilizing the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. \an{Our} numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in maximizing the \an{SH cache hit rate}, thereby improving delivery delays and fronthaul loads of the network.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the classical caching problem, when a requested page is not present in the cache (i.e., a "miss"), it is assumed to travel from the backing store into the cache "before" the next request arrives. However, in many real-life applications, such as content delivery networks, this assumption is unrealistic.   The "delayed-hits" model for caching, introduced by Atre, Sherry, Wang, and Berger, accounts for the latency between a missed cache request and the corresponding arrival from the backing store. This theoretical model has two parameters: the "delay" $Z$, representing the ratio between the retrieval delay and the inter-request delay in an application, and the "cache size" $k$, as in classical caching. Classical caching corresponds to $Z=1$, whereas larger values of $Z$ model applications where retrieving missed requests is expensive. Despite the practical relevance of the delayed-hits model, its theoretical underpinnings are still poorly understood.   We present the first tight theoretical guarantee for optimizing delayed-hits caching: The "Least Recently Used" algorithm, a natural, deterministic, online algorithm widely used in practice, is $O(Zk)$-competitive, meaning it incurs at most $O(Zk)$ times more latency than the (offline) optimal schedule. Our result extends to any so-called "marking" algorithm.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern embedded systems are evolving toward complex, heterogeneous architectures to accommodate increasingly demanding applications. Driven by SWAP-C constraints, this shift has led to consolidating multiple systems onto single hardware platforms. Static Partitioning Hypervisors offer a promising solution to partition hardware resources and provide spatial isolation between critical workloads. However, shared resources like the Last-Level Cache and system bus can introduce temporal interference between virtual machines (VMs), negatively impacting performance and predictability. Over the past decade, academia and industry have developed interference mitigation techniques, such as cache partitioning and memory bandwidth reservation. However, configuring these techniques is complex and time-consuming. Cache partitioning requires balancing cache sections across VMs, while memory bandwidth reservation needs tuning bandwidth budgets and periods. Testing all configurations is impractical and often leads to suboptimal results. Moreover, understanding how these techniques interact is limited, as their combined use can produce compounded or conflicting effects on performance. Static analysis tools estimating worst-case execution times offer guidance for configuring mitigation techniques but often fail to capture the complexity of modern multi-core systems. They typically focus on limited shared resources while neglecting others, such as IOMMUs and interrupt controllers. To address these challenges, we present SP-IMPact, an open-source framework for analyzing and guiding interference mitigation configurations. SP-IMPact supports (i) cache coloring and (ii) memory bandwidth reservation, while evaluating their interactions and cumulative impact. By providing insights on real hardware, SP-IMPact helps optimize configurations for mixed-criticality systems, ensuring performance and predictability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We study content caching with recommendations in a wireless network where the users are connected through a base station equipped with a finite-capacity cache. We assume a fixed set of contents with unknown user preferences and content popularities. The base station can cache a subset of the contents and can also recommend subsets of the contents to different users in order to encourage them to request the recommended contents. Recommendations, depending on their acceptability, can thus be used to increase cache hits. We first assume that the users' recommendation acceptabilities are known and formulate the cache hit optimization problem as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB). We propose a UCB-based algorithm to decide which contents to cache and recommend and provide an upper bound on the regret of this algorithm. Subsequently, we consider a more general scenario where the users' recommendation acceptabilities are also unknown and propose another UCB-based algorithm that learns these as well. We numerically demonstrate the performance of our algorithms and compare these to state-of-the-art algorithms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multi-antenna coded caching (CC) with multicast beamforming typically relies on a complex successive interference cancellation (SIC) structure to decode a superposition of multiple streams received by each user. Signal-level CC schemes require the regeneration and cancellation of interfering signals at the physical layer of each receiver, which complicates practical implementations. To address this, we propose a bit-level multicast scheduling scheme enabling linear, SIC-free decoding of parallel streams by repeatedly transmitting data terms with linearly independent coefficients. Two reference strategies and a novel sparse strategy are considered for constructing the coefficient matrix. The reference cases include the random strategy, which lacks control over matrix construction, and the equal-distant strategy, which balances users' interference and data terms equally. In contrast, the sparse strategy minimizes the number of multicast streams transmitted in parallel during each interval. This approach simplifies both the decoding process and the beamforming design by decoupling the desired data terms for each user and reducing the number of SINR constraints, respectively. To further enhance the symmetric rate, a successive projection algorithm is applied to exploit channel properties and optimize user ordering. With the coefficient matrix and optimized user ordering in place, multicast beamformers are devised to aggregate desired data from relevant multicast streams. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the sparse strategy and user scheduling, demonstrating significant gains in symmetric rate.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We examine the use of different randomisation policies for stochastic gradient algorithms used in sampling, based on first-order (or overdamped) Langevin dynamics, the most popular of which is known as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics. Conventionally, this algorithm is combined with a specific stochastic gradient strategy, called Robbins-Monro. In this work, we study an alternative strategy, Random Reshuffling, and show convincingly that it leads to improved performance via: a) a proof of reduced bias in the Wasserstein metric for strongly convex, gradient Lipschitz potentials; b) an analytical demonstration of reduced bias for a Gaussian model problem; and c) an empirical demonstration of reduced bias in numerical experiments for some logistic regression problems. This is especially important since Random Reshuffling is typically more efficient due to memory access and cache reasons. Such acceleration for the Random Reshuffling policy is familiar from the optimisation literature on stochastic gradient descent.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Existing weight-activation quantization methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily address channel-wise outliers but often neglect token-wise outliers, which limits the accuracy of quantized models. In this work, we propose PrefixQuant, a novel quantization method that achieves state-of-the-art performance across various precision levels (W4A4KV4 and W4A8KV4) and granularities (dynamic and static quantization) by effectively isolating token-wise outliers. First, PrefixQuant eliminates token-wise outliers by prefixing outlier tokens in the KV cache, a process that is training-free and highly efficient (e.g., 1 minutes for Llama-3-70B). Second, PrefixQuant introduces new trainable parameters for block-wise training to compensate for quantization error. Our experiments show that PrefixQuant significantly outperforms existing dynamic quantization methods, even under coarser static quantization settings. For instance, PrefixQuant achieves an average accuracy improvement of +3.08 and +2.85 points over SpinQuant (dynamic quantization) on five zero-shot reasoning tasks under dynamic and static quantization settings, respectively, on W4A4KV4 Llama-3-8B. Additionally, we demonstrate up to 2.74x prefilling speedup and 2.16x decoding speedup for LLMs using W4A4 PrefixQuant. Our code is available at https://github.com/ChenMnZ/PrefixQuant.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We consider a system with a local cache connected to a backend server and an end user population. A set of contents are stored at the the server where they continuously get updated. The local cache keeps copies, potentially stale, of a subset of the contents. The users make content requests to the local cache which either can serve the local version if available or can fetch a fresh version or can wait for additional requests before fetching and serving a fresh version. Serving a stale version of a content incurs an age-of-version(AoV) dependent ageing cost, fetching it from the server incurs a fetching cost, and making a request wait incurs a per unit time waiting cost. We focus on the optimal actions subject to the cache capacity constraint at each decision epoch, aiming at minimizing the long term average cost. We pose the problem as a Restless Multi-armed Bandit(RMAB) Problem and propose a Whittle index based policy which is known to be asymptotically optimal. We explicitly characterize the Whittle indices. We numerically evaluate the proposed policy and also compare it to a greedy policy. We show that it is close to the optimal policy and substantially outperforms the exising policies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce and study a multi-class online resource allocation problem with group fairness guarantees. The problem involves allocating a fixed amount of resources to a sequence of agents, each belonging to a specific group. The primary objective is to ensure fairness across different groups in an online setting. We focus on three fairness notions: one based on quantity and two based on utility. To achieve fair allocations, we develop two threshold-based online algorithms, proving their optimality under two fairness notions and near-optimality for the more challenging one. Additionally, we demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between group fairness and individual welfare using a novel representative function-based approach. To address this trade-off, we propose a set-aside multi-threshold algorithm that reserves a portion of the resource to ensure fairness across groups while utilizing the remaining resource to optimize efficiency under utility-based fairness notions. This algorithm is proven to achieve the Pareto-optimal trade-off. We also demonstrate that our problem can model a wide range of real-world applications, including network caching and cloud computing, and empirically evaluate our proposed algorithms in the network caching problem using real datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As is known, hybrid quadratic and subquadratic attention models in multi-head architectures have surpassed both Transformer and Linear RNN models , with these works primarily focusing on reducing KV complexity and improving efficiency. For further research on expressiveness, we introduce our series of models distilled from Qwen 2.5, based on pure native RWKV-7 attention, which aims to make RNN more expressive and demonstrates state tracking ability beyond transformers. We work with QRWK 32B based on RWKV-6 architecture, another approach that reduces the entire knowledge processing time to just 8 hours using 16 AMD MI300X GPUs while maintaining Qwen 2.5's performance. In fact, the distillation process can utilize any LLM, not just Qwen, and enables knowledge transfer from larger LLMs to smaller ones with more fewer tokens. We will explain the detailed process and share our insights on building more powerful foundation models. Please note that this is an ongoing work that will be updated continuously.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Tag-based browsing is a popular interaction model for navigating digital libraries. According to this model, users select descriptive tags to filter resources in the collections. Typical implementations of the model are based on inverted indexes. However, these implementations can require a considerable amount of set operations to update the browsing state. To palliate this inconven-ience, it is possible to adopt suitable cache strategies. In this paper we describe and compare two of these strategies: (i) a query-based strategy, according to which previously computed browsing states are indexed by sets of selected tags; and (ii) a resource-based strategy, according to which browsing states are in-dexed by sets of filtered resources. Our comparison focused on runtime perfor-mance, and was carried out empirically, using a real-world web-based collec-tion in the field of digital humanities. The results obtained show that the re-source-based strategy clearly outperforms the query-based one.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models have excelled in various domains but face efficiency challenges due to the growing Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-sequence inference. Recent efforts aim to reduce KV cache size by evicting vast non-critical cache elements during runtime while preserving generation quality. However, these methods typically allocate compression budgets uniformly across all attention heads, ignoring the unique attention patterns of each head. In this paper, we establish a theoretical loss upper bound between pre- and post-eviction attention output, explaining the optimization target of prior cache eviction methods, while guiding the optimization of adaptive budget allocation. Base on this, we propose {\it Ada-KV}, the first head-wise adaptive budget allocation strategy. It offers plug-and-play benefits, enabling seamless integration with prior cache eviction methods. Extensive evaluations on 13 datasets from Ruler and 16 datasets from LongBench, all conducted under both question-aware and question-agnostic scenarios, demonstrate substantial quality improvements over existing methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Coded caching leverages the differences in user cache memories to achieve gains that scale with the total cache size, alleviating network congestion due to high-quality content requests. Additionally, distributing transmitters over a wide area can mitigate the adverse effects of path loss. In this work, we consider a partially connected network where the channel between distributed transmitters (helpers) and users is modeled as a distributed MIMO Gaussian broadcast channel. We propose a novel delivery scheme consisting of two phases: partitioning and transmission. In the partitioning phase, users with identical cache profiles are partitioned into the minimum number of sets, such that users within each set can successfully decode their desired message from a joint transmission enabled by MIMO precoding. To optimally partition the users, we employ the branch and bound method. In the transmission phase, each partition is treated as a single entity, and codewords are multicast to partitions with distinct cache profiles. The proposed delivery scheme is applicable to any partially connected network, and while the partitioning is optimal, the overall delivery scheme, including transmission, is heuristic. Interestingly, simulation results show that its performance closely approximates that of the fully connected optimal solution.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNNs) have gained widespread attention due to their applicability in diverse domains such as traffic network prediction, epidemiological forecasting, and social network analysis. In this paper, we present ReInc, a system designed to enable efficient and scalable training of DGNNs on large-scale graphs. ReInc introduces key innovations that capitalize on the unique combination of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) inherent in DGNNs. By reusing intermediate results and incrementally computing aggregations across consecutive graph snapshots, ReInc significantly enhances computational efficiency. To support these optimizations, ReInc incorporates a novel two-level caching mechanism with a specialized caching policy aligned to the DGNN execution workflow. Additionally, ReInc addresses the challenges of managing structural and temporal dependencies in dynamic graphs through a new distributed training strategy. This approach eliminates communication overheads associated with accessing remote features and redistributing intermediate results. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInc achieves up to an order of magnitude speedup compared to state-of-the-art frameworks, tested across various dynamic GNN architectures and real-world graph datasets.

The doorway arrival phase and the release operation both run in constant-time. Waiting threads use local spinning and only a single waiting element is required per thread, regardless of the number of locks a thread might hold at a given time. While our lock does not provide strict FIFO admission, it bounds bypass and has strong anti-starvation properties. The lock is compact, space efficient, and has been intentionally designed to be readily usable in real-world general purpose computing environments such as the linux kernel, pthreads, or C++. We show the lock exhibits high throughput under contention and low latency in the uncontended case. The performance of Reciprocating Locks is competitive with and often better than the best state-of-the-art scalable spin locks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding the hydrodynamics of microswimmers in viscoelastic fluids and confined environments is crucial for interpreting their behaviour in natural settings and designing synthetic microswimmers for practical applications like cargo transport. In this study, we explore the hydrodynamics of a concentric active compound particle - a model microswimmer (a squirmer) positioned at the centre of a viscoelastic fluid droplet (a model cargo) suspended in another viscoelastic medium. We consider the Oldroyd-B constitutive model to characterize the fluids and employ a perturbative approach in the Deborah number to analyze viscoelastic effects analytically, assuming a small Capillary number so that the droplet remains spherical and does not deform. We examine three cases: (i) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in a Newtonian fluid, (ii) a squirmer confined within a Newtonian fluid droplet suspended in a viscoelastic fluid, and (iii) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in another viscoelastic fluid. Our findings reveal that the swimming speeds of the squirmer and the droplet are determined by the complex interplay of viscoelasticity, the size ratio of the droplet to the squirmer (confinement strength), and the viscosity ratio of the surrounding fluid to the droplet fluid. A critical aspect of this interaction is the positioning of stagnation points within the fluid flow, which governs the distribution of polymeric stress. This distribution, in turn, plays a crucial role in determining the influence of viscoelasticity on the squirmer's dynamics. Our analysis suggests that viscoelastic effects can either enhance or hinder the swimming speed of the squirmer when confined in a droplet, depending on the specific configuration of the system.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> View materialization, index selection, and plan caching are well-known techniques for optimization of query processing in database systems. The essence of these tasks is to select and save a subset of the most useful candidates (views/indexes/plans) for reuse within given space/time budget constraints. In this paper, we propose a unified view on these selection problems. We make a detailed analysis of the root causes of their complexity and summarize techniques to address them. Our survey provides a modern classification of selection algorithms known in the literature, including the latest ones based on Machine Learning. We provide a ground for reuse of the selection techniques between different optimization scenarios and highlight challenges and promising directions in the field. Based on our analysis we derive a method to exponentially accelerate some of the state-of-the-art selection algorithms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Registers are the fastest memory components within the GPU's complex memory hierarchy, accessed by names rather than addresses. They are managed entirely by the compiler through a process called register allocation, during which the compiler attempts to cache predictable data from thread-local memory into thread-private registers. Computing the permanent of a sparse matrix poses a challenge for compilers, as optimizing this process is hindered by the unpredictable distribution of nonzero elements, which only become known at runtime. In this work, we employ fully-automated code generation to address this, producing highly optimized kernels tailored to the matrix's sparsity pattern. State-of-the-art permanent computation algorithms require each thread to store a private array, denoted x, of size n. We first propose a technique that fully stores these arrays in registers, with inclusion and exclusion kernels generated for each column. To minimize control divergence and reduce the number of unique kernels within a warp, we exploit the internal structure of Gray codes, which are also used in the state-of-the-art algorithm. Our second technique reduces register pressure by utilizing both registers and global memory and introduces a matrix ordering and partitioning strategy for greater efficiency. On synthetic matrices, this approach achieves a 31x speedup over state-of-the-art CPU implementations on 112 cores, and an 8x speedup compared to our traditional GPU implementation. For real-world matrices, these speedups are 24.9x and 4.9x.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> KV cache is a widely used acceleration technique for large language models (LLMs) inference. However, its memory requirement grows rapidly with input length. Previous studies have reduced the size of KV cache by either removing the same number of unimportant tokens for all attention heads or by allocating differentiated KV cache budgets for pre-identified attention heads. However, due to the importance of attention heads varies across different tasks, the pre-identified attention heads fail to adapt effectively to various downstream tasks. To address this issue, we propose Task-KV, a method that leverages the semantic differentiation of attention heads to allocate differentiated KV cache budgets across various tasks. We demonstrate that attention heads far from the semantic center (called heterogeneous heads) make an significant contribution to task outputs and semantic understanding. In contrast, other attention heads play the role of aggregating important information and focusing reasoning. Task-KV allocates full KV cache budget to heterogeneous heads to preserve comprehensive semantic information, while reserving a small number of recent tokens and attention sinks for non-heterogeneous heads. Furthermore, we innovatively introduce middle activations to preserve key contextual information aggregated from non-heterogeneous heads. To dynamically perceive semantic differences among attention heads, we design a semantic separator to distinguish heterogeneous heads from non-heterogeneous ones based on their distances from the semantic center. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks and different model architectures demonstrate that Task-KV significantly outperforms existing baseline methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Coded caching is a promising technique to effectively reduce peak traffic by using local caches and the multicast gains generated by these local caches. We prefer to design a coded caching scheme with the subpacketization $F$ and transmission load $R$ as small as possible since these are the key metrics for evaluating the implementation complexity and transmission efficiency of the scheme, respectively. However, most of the existing coded caching schemes have large subpacketizations which grow exponentially with the number of users $K$, and there are a few schemes with linear subpacketizations which have large transmission loads. In this paper, we focus on studying the linear subpacketization, i.e., $K=F$, coded caching scheme with low transmission load. Specifically, we first introduce a new combinatorial structure called non-half-sum disjoint packing (NHSDP) which can be used to generate a coded caching scheme with $K=F$. Then a class of new schemes is obtained by constructing NHSDP. Theoretical and numerical comparisons show that (i) compared to the existing schemes with linear subpacketization (to the number of users), the proposed scheme achieves a lower load; (ii) compared to some existing schemes with polynomial subpacketization, the proposed scheme can also achieve a lower load in some cases; (iii) compared to some existing schemes with exponential subpacketization, the proposed scheme has loads close to those of these schemes in some cases. Moreover, the new concept of NHSDP is closely related to the classical combinatorial structures such as cyclic difference packing (CDP), non-three-term arithmetic progressions (NTAP), and perfect hash family (PHF). These connections indicate that NHSDP is an important combinatorial structure in the field of combinatorial design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-language models (VLMs) show remarkable performance in multimodal tasks. However, excessively long multimodal inputs lead to oversized Key-Value (KV) caches, resulting in significant memory consumption and I/O bottlenecks. Previous KV quantization methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) may alleviate these issues but overlook the attention saliency differences of multimodal tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we investigate the attention-aware token saliency patterns in VLM and propose AKVQ-VL. AKVQ-VL leverages the proposed Text-Salient Attention (TSA) and Pivot-Token-Salient Attention (PSA) patterns to adaptively allocate bit budgets. Moreover, achieving extremely low-bit quantization requires effectively addressing outliers in KV tensors. AKVQ-VL utilizes the Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT) to construct outlier-free KV caches, thereby reducing quantization difficulty. Evaluations of 2-bit quantization on 12 long-context and multimodal tasks demonstrate that AKVQ-VL maintains or even improves accuracy, outperforming LLM-oriented methods. AKVQ-VL can reduce peak memory usage by 2.13x, support up to 3.25x larger batch sizes and 2.46x throughput.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Key-Value (KV) cache facilitates efficient large language models (LLMs) inference by avoiding recomputation of past KVs. As the batch size and context length increase, the oversized KV caches become a significant memory bottleneck, highlighting the need for efficient compression. Existing KV quantization rely on fine-grained quantization or the retention of a significant portion of high bit-widths caches, both of which compromise compression ratio and often fail to maintain robustness at extremely low average bit-widths. In this work, we explore the potential of rotation technique for 2-bit KV quantization and propose RotateKV, which achieves accurate and robust performance through the following innovations: (i) Outlier-Aware Rotation, which utilizes channel-reordering to adapt the rotations to varying channel-wise outlier distributions without sacrificing the computational efficiency of the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform (FWHT); (ii) Pre-RoPE Grouped-Head Rotation, which mitigates the impact of rotary position embedding (RoPE) on proposed outlier-aware rotation and further smooths outliers across heads; (iii) Attention-Sink-Aware Quantization, which leverages the massive activations to precisely identify and protect attention sinks. RotateKV achieves less than 0.3 perplexity (PPL) degradation with 2-bit quantization on WikiText-2 using LLaMA-2-13B, maintains strong CoT reasoning and long-context capabilities, with less than 1.7\% degradation on GSM8K, outperforming existing methods even at lower average bit-widths. RotateKV also showcases a 3.97x reduction in peak memory usage, supports 5.75x larger batch sizes, and achieves a 2.32x speedup in decoding stage.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have excelled in various applications, yet serving them at scale is challenging due to their substantial resource demands and high latency. Our real-world studies reveal that over 60% of user requests to LLMs have semantically similar counterparts, suggesting the potential for knowledge sharing among requests. However, naively caching and reusing past responses leads to large quality degradation. In this paper, we introduce EchoLM, an in-context caching system that leverages historical requests as examples to guide response generation, enabling selective offloading of requests to more efficient LLMs. However, enabling this real-time knowledge transfer leads to intricate tradeoffs between response quality, latency, and system throughput at scale. For a new request, EchoLM identifies similar, high-utility examples and efficiently prepends them to the input for better response. At scale, EchoLM adaptively routes requests to LLMs of varying capabilities, accounting for response quality and serving loads. EchoLM employs a cost-aware cache replay mechanism to improve example quality and coverage offline, maximizing cache utility and runtime efficiency. Evaluations on millions of open-source requests demonstrate that EchoLM has a throughput improvement of 1.4-5.9x while reducing latency by 28-71% without hurting response quality on average.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Language-queried target sound extraction (TSE) aims to extract specific sounds from mixtures based on language queries. Traditional fully-supervised training schemes require extensively annotated parallel audio-text data, which are labor-intensive. We introduce a parallel-data-free training scheme, requiring only unlabelled audio clips for TSE model training by utilizing the contrastive language-audio pre-trained model (CLAP). In a vanilla parallel-data-free training stage, target audio is encoded using the pre-trained CLAP audio encoder to form a condition embedding, while during testing, user language queries are encoded by CLAP text encoder as the condition embedding. This vanilla approach assumes perfect alignment between text and audio embeddings, which is unrealistic. Two major challenges arise from training-testing mismatch: the persistent modality gap between text and audio and the risk of overfitting due to the exposure of rich acoustic details in target audio embedding during training. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented strategy. Specifically, we create an embedding cache using audio captions generated by a large language model (LLM). During training, target audio embeddings retrieve text embeddings from this cache to use as condition embeddings, ensuring consistent modalities between training and testing and eliminating information leakage. Extensive experiment results show that our retrieval-augmented approach achieves consistent and notable performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art with better generalizability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> CXL (Compute Express Link) is an emerging open industry-standard interconnect between processing and memory devices that is expected to revolutionize the way systems are designed in the near future. It enables cache-coherent shared memory pools in a disaggregated fashion at unprecedented scales, allowing algorithms to interact with a variety of storage devices using simple loads and stores. Alongside unleashing unique opportunities for a wide range of applications, CXL introduces new challenges of data management and crash consistency. Alas, CXL lacks an adequate programming model, which makes reasoning about the correctness and expected behaviors of algorithms and systems on top of it nearly impossible.   In this work, we present CXL0, the first programming model for concurrent programs running on top of CXL. We propose a high-level abstraction for CXL memory accesses and formally define operational semantics on top of that abstraction. We perform initial measurements that provide practical insight into CXL0. We provide a set of general transformations that adapt concurrent algorithms to the new disruptive technology. These transformations enhance linearizable algorithms with durability under a general partial-failure model. We provide an additional transformation for algorithms designed for persistent main memory and full-system crashes. We believe that this work will serve as a stepping stone for systems design and modeling on top of CXL, and support the development of future models as software and hardware evolve.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To support the growing demand for data-intensive and low-latency IoT applications, Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) is emerging as an effective edge-computing approach enabling the execution of delay-sensitive processing tasks close to end-users. However, most of the existing works on resource allocation and service placement in MEC systems overlook the unique characteristics of new IoT use cases. For instance, many IoT applications require the periodic execution of computing tasks on real-time data streams that originate from devices dispersed over a wide area. Thus, users requesting IoT services are typically distant from the data producers. To fill this gap, the contribution of this work is two-fold. Firstly, we propose a MEC-compliant architectural solution to support the operation of multiple IoT service providers over a common MEC platform deployment, which enables the steering and shaping of IoT data transport within the platform. Secondly, we model the problem of service placement and data management in the proposed MEC-based solution taking into account the dependencies at the data level between IoT services and sensing resources. Our model also considers that caches can be deployed on MEC hosts, to allow the sharing of the same data between different IoT services with overlapping geographical scope, and provides support for IoT services with heterogeneous QoS requirements, such as different frequencies of periodic task execution. Due to the complexity of the optimisation problem, a heuristic algorithm is proposed using linear relaxation and rounding techniques. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach, especially when traffic demands generated by the service requests are not uniform.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) networks enable large-scale data collection by leveraging the ubiquity of mobile devices. However, frequent sensing and data transmission can lead to significant resource consumption. To mitigate this issue, edge caching has been proposed as a solution for storing recently collected data. Nonetheless, this approach may compromise data freshness. In this paper, we investigate the trade-off between re-using cached task results and re-sensing tasks in cache-enabled MCS networks, aiming to minimize system latency while maintaining information freshness. To this end, we formulate a weighted delay and age of information (AoI) minimization problem, jointly optimizing sensing decisions, user selection, channel selection, task allocation, and caching strategies. The problem is a mixed-integer non-convex programming problem which is intractable. Therefore, we decompose the long-term problem into sequential one-shot sub-problems and design a framework that optimizes system latency, task sensing decision, and caching strategy subproblems. When one task is re-sensing, the one-shot problem simplifies to the system latency minimization problem, which can be solved optimally. The task sensing decision is then made by comparing the system latency and AoI. Additionally, a Bayesian update strategy is developed to manage the cached task results. Building upon this framework, we propose a lightweight and time-efficient algorithm that makes real-time decisions for the long-term optimization problem. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of our approach.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language model (LLM) inference workload dominates a wide variety of modern AI applications, ranging from multi-turn conversation to document analysis. Balancing fairness and efficiency is critical for managing diverse client workloads with varying prefix patterns. Unfortunately, existing fair scheduling algorithms for LLM serving, such as Virtual Token Counter (VTC), fail to take prefix locality into consideration and thus suffer from poor performance. On the other hand, locality-aware scheduling algorithms in existing LLM serving frameworks tend to maximize the prefix cache hit rate without considering fair sharing among clients.   This paper introduces the first locality-aware fair scheduling algorithm, Deficit Longest Prefix Match (DLPM), which can maintain a high degree of prefix locality with a fairness guarantee. We also introduce a novel algorithm, Double Deficit LPM (D$^2$LPM), extending DLPM for the distributed setup that can find a balance point among fairness, locality, and load-balancing. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates the superior performance of DLPM and D$^2$LPM in ensuring fairness while maintaining high throughput (up to 2.87$\times$ higher than VTC) and low per-client (up to 7.18$\times$ lower than state-of-the-art distributed LLM serving system) latency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform zero-shot learning on unseen tasks and few-shot learning on complex reasoning tasks. However, resource-limited mobile edge networks struggle to support long-context LLM serving for LLM agents during multi-round interactions with users. Unlike stateless computation offloading and static service offloading in edge computing, optimizing LLM serving at edge servers is challenging because LLMs continuously learn from context which raises accuracy, latency, and resource consumption dynamics. In this paper, we propose a joint model caching and inference offloading framework that utilizes test-time deep reinforcement learning (T2DRL) to optimize deployment and execution strategies for long-context LLM serving. In this framework, we analyze the performance convergence and design an optimization problem considering the utilization of context windows in LLMs. Furthermore, the T2DRL algorithm can learn in both the training phase and the testing phase to proactively manage cached models and service requests and adapt to context changes and usage patterns during execution. To further enhance resource allocation efficiency, we propose a double Dutch auction (DDA) mechanism, which dynamically matches supply and demand while maximizing social welfare. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the T2DRL algorithm can reduce system costs by at least 30% compared to baselines while guaranteeing the performance of LLM agents in real-world perception and reasoning tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce Sigma, an efficient large language model specialized for the system domain, empowered by a novel architecture including DiffQKV attention, and pre-trained on our meticulously collected system domain data. DiffQKV attention significantly enhances the inference efficiency of Sigma by optimizing the Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) components in the attention mechanism differentially, based on their varying impacts on the model performance and efficiency indicators. Specifically, we (1) conduct extensive experiments that demonstrate the model's varying sensitivity to the compression of K and V components, leading to the development of differentially compressed KV, and (2) propose augmented Q to expand the Q head dimension, which enhances the model's representation capacity with minimal impacts on the inference speed. Rigorous theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that DiffQKV attention significantly enhances efficiency, achieving up to a 33.36% improvement in inference speed over the conventional grouped-query attention (GQA) in long-context scenarios. We pre-train Sigma on 6T tokens from various sources, including 19.5B system domain data that we carefully collect and 1T tokens of synthesized and rewritten data. In general domains, Sigma achieves comparable performance to other state-of-arts models. In the system domain, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark AIMicius, where Sigma demonstrates remarkable performance across all tasks, significantly outperforming GPT-4 with an absolute improvement up to 52.5%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The measurement of plutonium isotopes, 239Pu and 240Pu, at 670 kV on the compact accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) system at the Centro Nacional de Aceleradores (CNA) in Seville, Spain, is now a reality. In this work, we present first Pu AMS results for environmental samples: a sediment core collected in a submarine canyon in the Mediterranean coast of the Spanish region of Palomares, affected by a nuclear accident in 1966. From the study of the 240Pu/239Pu atomic ratio profile, showing on average levels lower than 11%, we confirm that the weapon-grade plutonium released on land during the accident, with a characteristic 240Pu/239Pu atomic ratio of 5.8%, has found its way into the marine environment. A two-plutonium sources mixture model (Palomares and fallout) is used to elucidate the percentage of the plutonium coming from the accident. As a validation exercise of the Pu AMS measuring technique and in order to obtain the 238Pu/(239+240)Pu activity ratios, samples were also studied by alpha-spectrometry (AS). The obtained AS 239+240Pu activity concentration results fit in with the AMS ones in a wide dynamic range, thus validating the AMS technique.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present a novel yet simple and comprehensive DNS cache POisoning Prevention System (POPS), designed to integrate as a module in Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS). POPS addresses statistical DNS poisoning attacks, including those documented from 2002 to the present, and offers robust protection against similar future threats. It consists of two main components: a detection module that employs three simple rules, and a mitigation module that leverages the TC flag in the DNS header to enhance security. Once activated, the mitigation module has zero false positives or negatives, correcting any such errors on the side of the detection module.   We first analyze POPS against historical DNS services and attacks, showing that it would have mitigated all network-based statistical poisoning attacks, yielding a success rate of only 0.0076% for the adversary. We then simulate POPS on traffic benchmarks (PCAPs) incorporating current potential network-based statistical poisoning attacks, and benign PCAPs; the simulated attacks still succeed with a probability of 0.0076%. This occurs because five malicious packets go through before POPS detects the attack and activates the mitigation module. In addition, POPS completes its task using only 20%-50% of the time required by other tools (e.g., Suricata or Snort), and after examining just 5%-10% as many packets. Furthermore, it successfully identifies DNS cache poisoning attacks-such as fragmentation attacks-that both Suricata and Snort fail to detect, underscoring its superiority in providing comprehensive DNS protection.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In modern large language models (LLMs), increasing the context length is crucial for improving comprehension and coherence in long-context, multi-modal, and retrieval-augmented language generation. While many recent transformer models attempt to extend their context length over a million tokens, they remain impractical due to the quadratic time and space complexities. Although recent works on linear and sparse attention mechanisms can achieve this goal, their real-world applicability is often limited by the need to re-train from scratch and significantly worse performance. In response, we propose a novel approach, Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP), which reduces the time complexity of the attention mechanism to $O(T \log T)$ and the space complexity to $O(T)$, where $T$ is the sequence length. We notice a pattern in the attention scores of pretrained LLMs where tokens close together tend to have similar scores, which we call ``attention locality''. Based on this observation, we utilize a novel tree-search-like algorithm that estimates the top-$k$ key tokens for a given query on the fly, which is mathematically guaranteed to have better performance than random attention pruning. In addition to improving the time complexity of the attention mechanism, we further optimize GPU memory usage by implementing KV cache offloading, which stores only $O(\log T)$ tokens on the GPU while maintaining similar decoding throughput. Experiments on benchmarks show that HiP, with its training-free nature, significantly reduces both prefill and decoding latencies, as well as memory usage, while maintaining high-quality generation with minimal degradation. HiP enables pretrained LLMs to scale up to millions of tokens on commodity GPUs, potentially unlocking long-context LLM applications previously deemed infeasible.

However, LLMs are sensitive to the position of relevant information within contexts and tend to generate incorrect responses when such information is placed in the middle, known as `Lost in the Middle' phenomenon. In this paper, we introduce a framework that generates consistent outputs for decoder-only models, irrespective of the input context order. Experimental results for three open domain question answering tasks demonstrate position invariance, where the model is not sensitive to input context order, and superior robustness to irrelevent passages compared to prevailing approaches for RAG pipelines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large-scale language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in language processing tasks, yet their deployment is often hindered by high memory demands and computational complexity. Although low-bit quantization techniques, such as 4-bit quantization, present a potential solution, they frequently lead to significant accuracy degradation or require substantial effort for such aggressive quantization approaches. To overcome these challenges, we introduce QRazor, a reliable and effortless quantization scheme designed to enable 4-bit quantization for weights, activations, and KV cache in transformer-based LLMs. The scheme involves two main stages: quantization and compression. During the quantization stage, weights, activations, and KV cache values are quantized with wider 8 or 16-bit integers as a basis to achieve nearly identical accuracy to the original full-precision LLM models, using the absolute max scaling. Subsequently, all data are compressed to 4-bit using our proposed significant data razoring (SDR) technique, which retains only the four most salient bits while discarding the others. Furthermore, we present an integer-based arithmetic unit dedicated to QRazor, enabling direct low-precision arithmetic operations without decompressing the SDR data. Despite the reduced quantization effort, QRazor achieves LLM accuracies better or comparable to state-of-the-art 4-bit methods. By also validating the hardware efficiency, our decompression-free arithmetic unit achieves 61.2% and 57.8% reduction in area and power consumption, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Delivering an immersive experience to virtual reality (VR) users through wireless connectivity offers the freedom to engage from anywhere at any time. Nevertheless, it is challenging to ensure seamless wireless connectivity that delivers real-time and high-quality videos to the VR users. This paper proposes a field of view (FoV) aware caching for mobile edge computing (MEC)-enabled wireless VR network. In particular, the FoV of each VR user is cached/prefetched at the base stations (BSs) based on the caching strategies tailored to each BS. Specifically, decentralized and personalized federated learning (DP-FL) based caching strategies with guarantees are presented. Considering VR systems composed of multiple VR devices and BSs, a DP-FL caching algorithm is implemented at each BS to personalize content delivery for VR users. The utilized DP-FL algorithm guarantees a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound on the conditional average cache hit. Further, to reduce the cost of communicating gradients, one-bit quantization of the stochastic gradient descent (OBSGD) is proposed, and a convergence guarantee of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ is obtained for the proposed algorithm, where $T$ is the number of iterations. Additionally, to better account for the wireless channel dynamics, the FoVs are grouped into multicast or unicast groups based on the number of requesting VR users. The performance of the proposed DP-FL algorithm is validated through realistic VR head-tracking dataset, and the proposed algorithm is shown to have better performance in terms of average delay and cache hit as compared to baseline algorithms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Although applications involving long-context inputs are crucial for the effective utilization of large language models (LLMs), they also result in increased computational costs and reduced performance. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient, training-free prompt compression method that retains key information within compressed prompts. We identify specific attention heads in transformer-based LLMs, which we designate as evaluator heads, that are capable of selecting tokens in long inputs that are most significant for inference. Building on this discovery, we develop EHPC, an Evaluator Head-based Prompt Compression method, which enables LLMs to rapidly "skim through" input prompts by leveraging only the first few layers with evaluator heads during the pre-filling stage, subsequently passing only the important tokens to the model for inference. EHPC achieves state-of-the-art results across two mainstream benchmarks: prompt compression and long-context inference acceleration. Consequently, it effectively reduces the complexity and costs associated with commercial API calls. We further demonstrate that EHPC attains competitive results compared to key-value cache-based acceleration methods, thereby highlighting its potential to enhance the efficiency of LLMs for long-context tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This technical report presents Yi-Lightning, our latest flagship large language model (LLM). It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall on Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in specialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts. Yi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, featuring advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with optimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses comprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for multi-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling. Furthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a four-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training, post-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing infrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment and inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further evaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates competitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable disparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic human preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of conventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent and powerful AI systems for practical applications. Yi-Lightning is now available through our developer platform at https://platform.lingyiwanwu.com.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work explores a multiple transmit antenna setting in a multi-access coded caching (MACC) network where each user accesses more than one cache. A MACC network has $K$ users and $K$ caches, and each user has access to $r < K$ consecutive caches in a cyclic wrap-around manner. There are $L$ antennas at the server, and each cache has a normalized size of $M/N \leq 1$. The cyclic wrap-around MACC network with a single antenna at the server has been a well-investigated topic, and several coded caching schemes and improved lower bounds on the performance are known for the same. However, this MACC network has not yet been studied under multi-antenna settings in the coded caching literature. We study the multi-antenna MACC problem and propose a solution for the same by constructing a pair of arrays called caching and delivery arrays. We present three constructions of caching and delivery arrays for different scenarios and obtain corresponding multi-antenna MACC schemes for the same. Two schemes resulting from the above constructions achieve optimal performance under uncoded placement and one-shot delivery. The optimality is shown by matching the performance of the multi-antenna MACC scheme to that of an optimal multi-antenna scheme for a dedicated cache network having an identical number of users, and each user has a normalized cache size of $rM/N$. Further, as a special case, one of the proposed schemes subsumes an existing optimal MACC scheme for the single-antenna setting.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid advancement in large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, raising concerns about the misuse of AI-generated content and making it critical to detect it. However, the task remains challenging, particularly in unseen domains or with unfamiliar LLMs. Leveraging LLM next-token distribution outputs offers a theoretically appealing approach for detection, as they encapsulate insights from the models' extensive pre-training on diverse corpora. Despite its promise, zero-shot methods that attempt to operationalize these outputs have met with limited success. We hypothesize that one of the problems is that they use the mean to aggregate next-token distribution metrics across tokens, when some tokens are naturally easier or harder to predict and should be weighted differently. Based on this idea, we propose the Perplexity Attention Weighted Network (PAWN), which uses the last hidden states of the LLM and positions to weight the sum of a series of features based on metrics from the next-token distribution across the sequence length. Although not zero-shot, our method allows us to cache the last hidden states and next-token distribution metrics on disk, greatly reducing the training resource requirements. PAWN shows competitive and even better performance in-distribution than the strongest baselines (fine-tuned LMs) with a fraction of their trainable parameters. Our model also generalizes better to unseen domains and source models, with smaller variability in the decision boundary across distribution shifts. It is also more robust to adversarial attacks, and if the backbone has multilingual capabilities, it presents decent generalization to languages not seen during supervised training, with LLaMA3-1B reaching a mean macro-averaged F1 score of 81.46% in cross-validation with nine languages.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present an all-silicon source of near-infrared linearly-polarized single photons, fabricated by nanoscale positioning of a color center in a silicon-on-insulator microcavity. The color center consists of a single W center, created at a well-defined position by Si$^{+}$ ion implantation through a 150 nm-diameter nanohole in a mask. A circular Bragg grating cavity resonant with the W's zero-phonon line at 1217 nm is fabricated at the same location as the nanohole. Under above-gap continuous-wave excitation, a very clean photon antibunching behavior ($g{^2} \leq 0.06$) is observed over the entire power range, which highlights the absence of parasitic emitters. Purcell-enhancement of W's zero-phonon emission provides both a record-high photoluminescence count rate among Si color centers (ca $1.2 \times 10^{6}$ counts/s) and apparent Debye-Waller factor around 99%. We also demonstrate the triggered emission of single photons with 93% purity under weak pulsed laser excitation. At high pulsed laser power, we reveal a detrimental effect of repumping processes, that could be mitigated using selective pumping schemes in the future. These results represent a major step towards on-demand sources of indistinguishable near-infrared single photons within silicon photonics chips.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we study the coded caching scheme for the $(L, K, M, N)$ multi-user information retrieval (MIR) system, which consists of a content library containing $N$ files, a base station (BS) with $L$ antennas that cannot access the library, and $K$ single-antenna users, each of which can cache at most $M$ files from the library. The users communicate with the others assisted by the BS to decode their required files. In this paper, we focus on designing a coded caching scheme with low communication latency measured by normalized delivery time (NDT), computational complexity, and subpacketizations. When $\frac{KM}{N}\geq L$ we first simply the precoding matrix in the downlink step to an identity matrix and use the multiple-antenna placement delivery array (MAPDA), which was originally proposed for the multiple-input single-output networks, to generate several new schemes for MIR system. Compared to the existing schemes, both the theoretical and numerical analyses show that our new schemes achieve much lower computational complexity and smaller subpacketizations with the same NDT.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern GPUs, with their specialized hardware like tensor cores, are essential for demanding AI and deep learning applications. This study presents a comprehensive, multi-level microbenchmarking analysis of the NVIDIA Hopper GPU architecture, delving into its performance characteristics and novel features. We benchmark Hopper's memory subsystem latency and throughput, comparing its L2 partitioned cache behavior and global memory access patterns against recent GPU generations, Ampere and Ada Lovelace. Our analysis reveals significant performance differences and architectural improvements in Hopper. A core contribution of this work is a detailed evaluation of Hopper's fourth-generation tensor cores, including their FP8 precision support and the novel asynchronous wgmma instructions, assessing their impact on matrix multiply-accumulate operations. We further investigate the performance implications of other key Hopper innovations: DPX instructions for accelerating dynamic programming algorithms, distributed shared memory (DSM) for inter-SM communication, and the Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA) for asynchronous data movement. This multi-level approach encompasses instruction-level microbenchmarks, library-level analysis of the Transformer Engine, and application-level benchmarks of tensor core performance within large language models. Our findings provide valuable, in-depth insights for software developers seeking to optimize performance and develop accurate performance models for the Hopper architecture, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of its potential for accelerating AI and other computationally intensive workloads.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Continuous Integration (CI) consists of an automated build process involving continuous compilation, testing, and packaging of the software system. While CI comes up with several advantages related to quality and time to delivery, CI also presents several challenges addressed by a large body of research. To better understand the literature so as to help practitioners find solutions for their problems and guide future research, we conduct a systematic review of 97 studies on build optimization published between 2006 and 2024, which we summarized according to their goals, methodologies, used datasets, and leveraged metrics. The identified build optimization studies focus on two main challenges: (1) long build durations, and (2) build failures. To meet the first challenge, existing studies have developed a range of techniques, including predicting build outcome and duration, selective build execution, and build acceleration using caching or repairing performance smells. The causes of build failures have been the subject of several studies, leading to the development of techniques for predicting build script maintenance and automating repair. Recent studies have also focused on predicting flaky build failures caused by environmental issues. The majority of these techniques use machine learning algorithms and leverage build metrics, which we classify into five categories. Additionally, we identify eight publicly available build datasets for build optimization research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Caching is an efficient technique to reduce peak traffic by storing popular content in local caches. Placement delivery array (PDA) proposed by Yan et al. is a combinatorial structure to design coded caching schemes with uncoded placement and one-shot linear delivery. By taking the $m$-fold Cartesian product of a small base PDA, Wang et al. constructed a big PDA while maintaining the memory ratio and transmission load unchanged, which achieves linear growth in both the number of users and coded caching gain. In order to achieve exponential growth in both the number of users and coded caching gain, in this paper we propose a PDA construction by taking the union operation of the cache configurations from the $m$-fold Cartesian product of a base PDA. The resulting PDA leads to a coded caching scheme with subpacketization increasing sub-exponentially with the number of users while keeping the load constant for fixed memory ratio. By applying the proposed construction to existing base PDAs, three new coded caching schemes are obtained, which cover some existing schemes as special cases and can achieve lower load with simultaneously lower subpacketization for some memory ratios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLM) have revolutionized natural language processing, but their inference demands substantial resources, while under-utilizing high-end accelerators like GPUs. A major bottleneck arises from the attention mechanism, which requires storing large key-value caches, limiting the maximum achievable throughput way below the available computing resources. Current approaches attempt to mitigate this issue through memory-efficient attention and paging mechanisms, but remained constrained by the assumption that all operations must be performed on high-end accelerators.   In this work, we propose Glinthawk, a two-tiered architecture that decouples the attention mechanism from the rest of the Transformer model. This approach allows the memory requirements for attention to scale independently, enabling larger batch sizes and more efficient use of the high-end accelerators. We prototype Glinthawk with NVIDIA T4 GPUs as one tier and standard CPU VMs as the other. Compared to a traditional single-tier setup, it improves throughput by $5.9\times$ and reduces cost of generation by $2.8\times$. For longer sequence lengths, it achieves $16.3\times$ throughput improvement at $2.4\times$ less cost. Our evaluation shows that this architecture can tolerate moderate network latency with minimal performance degradation, making it highly effective for latency-tolerant, throughput-oriented applications such as batch processing. We shared our prototype publicly at \url{https://github.com/microsoft/glinthawk}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We consider a two-layer hierarchical coded caching network where a server with a library of $N$ files is connected to $K_1$ mirrors, each having a cache memory of size $M_1$. Each mirror is further connected to $K_2$ users, each equipped with a dedicated cache of size $M_2$. In this paper, we propose two distinct coded caching schemes based on coded placement, corresponding to two distinct memory pairs, \( (M_1, M_2) \). We show that the proposed schemes outperform the existing schemes at these memory points given by the proposed schemes for smaller values of $K_2$. In setups where mirrors are positioned near each other, avoiding signal interference is crucial. This can be ensured by having all mirrors transmit using orthogonal carrier frequencies. To compare our schemes with existing ones, we used the composite rate metric, which accurately represents the total bandwidth utilized in such setups. The composite rate is given by $\overline{R} = R_1 + K_1 R_2$, where $R_1$ is the rate from the server to the mirrors, and $R_2$ is the rate from the mirrors to the users, with respect to $M_1$ and $M_2$.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Latency is a major concern for web rendering engines like those in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. These engines reduce latency by using an incremental layout algorithm to redraw the page when the user interacts with it. In such an algorithm, elements that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty; only the dirty elements need be processed to draw the next frame, dramatically reducing latency. However, the standard incremental layout algorithm must search the page for dirty elements, accessing a number of auxiliary elements in the process. These auxiliary elements add cache misses and stalled cycles, and are responsible for a sizable fraction of all layout latency. We introduce a new, faster incremental layout algorithm called Spineless Traversal. Spineless Traversal uses a more computationally demanding priority queue algorithm to avoid the need to access auxiliary nodes and thus reduces cache traffic and stalls. This leads to dramatic speedups on the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, or animations. Moreover, thanks to numerous low-level optimizations, we are able to make Spineless Traversal competitive across the whole spectrum of incremental layout workloads. As a result, across 2216 benchmarks, Spineless Traversal is faster on 78.2% of the benchmark, with a mean speedup of 3.23x concentrated in the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, and animations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The growing popularity of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has led to its widespread application in various visual downstream tasks. To enhance CLIP's effectiveness and versatility, efficient few-shot adaptation techniques have been widely adopted. Among these approaches, training-free methods, particularly caching methods exemplified by Tip-Adapter, have gained attention for their lightweight adaptation without the need for additional fine-tuning. In this paper, we revisit Tip-Adapter from a kernel perspective, showing that caching methods function as local adapters and are connected to a well-established kernel literature. Drawing on this insight, we offer a theoretical understanding of how these methods operate and suggest multiple avenues for enhancing the Tip-Adapter baseline. Notably, our analysis shows the importance of incorporating global information in local adapters. Therefore, we subsequently propose a global method that learns a proximal regularizer in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) using CLIP as a base learner. Our method, which we call ProKeR (Proximal Kernel ridge Regression), has a closed form solution and achieves state-of-the-art performances across 11 datasets in the standard few-shot adaptation benchmark.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Disaggregating memory from compute offers the opportunity to better utilize stranded memory in cloud data centers. It is important to cache data in the compute nodes and maintain cache coherence across multiple compute nodes. However, the limited computing power on disaggregated memory servers makes traditional cache coherence protocols suboptimal, particularly in the case of stranded memory. This paper introduces SELCC; a Shared-Exclusive Latch Cache Coherence protocol that maintains cache coherence without imposing any computational burden on the remote memory side. It aligns the state machine of the shared-exclusive latch protocol with the MSI protocol by introducing lazy latch-release and invalidation messages, thereby ensuring both atomicity of data access and cache coherence. SELCC embeds cache-ownership metadata directly into the RDMA latch word, enabling efficient cache ownership management via RDMA atomic operations. SELCC can serve as an abstraction layer over disaggregated memory with APIs that resemble main-memory accesses. A concurrent B-tree and three transaction concurrency control algorithms are realized using SELCC's abstraction layer. Experimental results show that SELCC significantly outperforms Remote-Procedure-Call-based protocols for cache coherence under limited remote computing power. Applications on SELCC achieve comparable or superior performance over disaggregated memory compared to competitors.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We examine a two-layered hierarchical coded caching problem, a configuration addressed in existing research. This involves a server connected to $K_1$ mirrors, each of which serves $K_2$ users. The mirrors and the users are equipped with caches of size $M_1$ and $M_2$, respectively. We propose a hierarchical coded caching scheme with coded placements that outperforms existing schemes. To ensure a fair comparison, we introduce the notion of composite rate, defined as $\overline{R} = R_1 + K_1 R_2$, where $R_1$ is the rate from the server to mirrors and $R_2$ is the rate from mirrors to users. The composite rate has not been discussed before in the literature and is pertinent when mirrors transmit with different carrier frequencies. For the proposed scheme, we show a trade-off between the global memory $\overline{M}=K_1M_1+K_1K_2M_2$ of the system and the composite rate and compare with the existing schemes. Additionally, we conduct this comparative analysis by plotting $R_1$ + $R_2$ against global memory, which is particularly beneficial for systems wherein each mirror can utilize the same carrier frequency, given their significant spatial separation. Additionally, we propose an optimized scheme for the specific case of a single mirror, showing improved performance in this scenario.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper considers wireless device-to-device (D2D) coded caching in a multiaccess network, where the users communicate with each other and each user can access multiple cache nodes. Access topologies derived from two combinatorial designs known as the $t$-design and $t$-group divisible design ($t$-GDD), referred to as the $t$-design and $t$-GDD topologies respectively, which subsume a few other known topologies, have been studied for the multiaccess coded caching (MACC) network by Cheng \textit{et al.} in \cite{MACC_des}. These access topologies are extended to a multiaccess D2D coded caching (MADCC) network and novel MADCC schemes are proposed. MADCC network has been studied so far only for the cyclic wrap-around topology. Apart from the proposed novel MADCC schemes, MADCC schemes are also derived from the existing MACC schemes in \cite{MACC_des}. To compare the performance of different MADCC schemes, the metrics of load per user and subpacketization level are used while keeping the number of caches and cache memory size same. The proposed MADCC scheme with $t$-design topology performs better in terms of subpacketization level while achieving the same load per user compared to the MADCC scheme derived from the MACC scheme with $t$-design topology in \cite{MACC_des}. The proposed MADCC scheme with $t$-GDD topology performs better in terms of load per user while achieving the same subpacketization level compared to the MADCC scheme derived from the MACC scheme with $t$-GDD topology in \cite{MACC_des} in some cases. Compared to the existing MADCC scheme with cyclic wrap-around topology, the proposed MADCC scheme with $t$-design topology performs better in terms of load per user, and the proposed MADCC scheme with $t$-GDD topology performs better in terms of subpacketization level at the expense of an increase in load per user.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The CXL-based solid-state drive (CXL-SSD) provides a promising approach towards scaling the main memory capacity at low cost. However, the CXL-SSD faces performance challenges due to the long flash access latency and unpredictable events such as garbage collection in the SSD device, stalling the host processor and wasting compute cycles. Although the CXL interface enables the byte-granular data access to the SSD, accessing flash chips is still at page granularity due to physical limitations. The mismatch of access granularity causes significant unnecessary I/O traffic to flash chips, worsening the suboptimal end-to-end data access performance. In this paper, we present SkyByte, an efficient CXL-based SSD that employs a holistic approach to address the aforementioned challenges by co-designing the host operating system (OS) and SSD controller. To alleviate the long memory stall when accessing the CXL-SSD, SkyByte revisits the OS context switch mechanism and enables opportunistic context switches upon the detection of long access delays. To accommodate byte-granular data accesses, SkyByte architects the internal DRAM of the SSD controller into a cacheline-level write log and a page-level data cache, and enables data coalescing upon log cleaning to reduce the I/O traffic to flash chips. SkyByte also employs optimization techniques that include adaptive page migration for exploring the performance benefits of fast host memory by promoting hot pages in CXL-SSD to the host. We implement SkyByte with a CXL-SSD simulator and evaluate its efficiency with various data-intensive applications. Our experiments show that SkyByte outperforms current CXL-based SSD by 6.11X, and reduces the I/O traffic to flash chips by 23.08X on average. SkyByte also reaches 75% of the performance of the ideal case that assumes unlimited DRAM capacity in the host, which offers an attractive cost-effective solution.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Let k be a field, let G be an affine algebraic k-group and V a finite-dimensional G-module. We say V is rigid if the socle series and radical series coincide for the action of G on each indecomposable summand of V; say V is geometrically rigid (resp. absolutely rigid) if V is rigid after base change of G and V to k (resp. any field extension of k). We show that all simple G-modules are geometrically rigid, though not in general absolutely rigid. More precisely, we show that if V is a simple G-module, then there is a finite purely inseparable extension kV /k naturally attached to V such that V is absolutely rigid as a G-module after base change to kV. The proof turns on an investigation of algebras of the form K otimes E where K and E are field extensions of k; we give an example of such an algebra which is not rigid as a module over itself. We establish the existence of the purely inseparable field extension kV /k through an analogous version for artinian algebras.   In the second half of the paper we apply recent results on the structure and representation theory of pseudo-reductive groups to give a concrete description of kV when G is smooth and connected. Namely, we combine the main structure theorem of the Conrad-Prasad classification of pseudo-reductive G together with our previous high weight theory. For V a simple G-module, we calculate the minimal field of definition of the geometric Jacobson radical of EndG(V) in terms of the high weight of V and the Conrad-Prasad classification data; this gives a concrete construction of the field kV as a subextension of the minimal field of definition of the geometric unipotent radical of G. We also observe that the Conrad-Prasad classification can be used to hone the dimension formula for V we had previously established; we also use it to give a description of EndG(V) which includes a dimension formula.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The network interface adapter (NIC) is a critical component of a modern cloud server which occupies a unique position. Not only is network performance vital to the efficient operation of the machine, but unlike application-oriented compute accelerators like GPUs, the network subsystem must react to unpredictable events like the arrival of a network packet and communicate with the appropriate application end point with minimal latency. Current approaches to server stacks navigate a trade-off between flexibility, efficiency, and performance: the fastest kernel-bypass approaches dedicate cores to applications, busy-wait on receive queues, etc. while more flexible approaches appropriate to more dynamic workload mixes incur much greater software overhead on the data path. However, we reject this trade-off, which we ascribe to an arbitrary (and sub-optimal) split in system state between the OS and the NIC. Instead, by exploiting the properties of cache-coherent interconnects and integrating the NIC closely with the OS kernel, we can achieve something surprising: performance for RPC workloads better than the fastest kernel-bypass approaches without sacrificing the robustness and dynamic adaptation of kernel-based network subsystems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) increasingly play an important role in a wide range of information processing and management tasks. Many of these tasks are performed in large batches or even offline, and the performance indictor for which is throughput. These tasks usually show the characteristic of prefix sharing, where different prompt input can partially show the common prefix. However, the existing LLM inference engines tend to optimize the streaming requests and show limitations of supporting the large batched tasks with the prefix sharing characteristic. The existing solutions use the LRU-based cache to reuse the KV context of common prefix between requests. The KV context that are about to be reused may prematurely evicted with the implicit cache management. Besides, the streaming oriented systems do not leverage the request-batch information and can not mix the decoding tokens with the prefill chunks to the best for the batched scenarios, and thus fails to saturate the GPU. We propose BatchLLM to address the above problems. BatchLLM explicitly identifies the common prefixes globally. The requests sharing the same prefix will be scheduled together to reuse the KV context the best. BatchLLM reorders the requests and schedules the requests with larger ratio of decoding first to better mix the decoding tokens with the latter prefill chunks, and applies memory-centric token batching to enlarge the token-batch sizes, which helps to increase the GPU utilization. Finally, BatchLLM optimizes the prefix-shared Attention kernel with horizontal fusion to reduce tail effect and kernel launch overhead. Extensive evaluation shows that BatchLLM outperforms vLLM and SGLang by 1.3$\times$ to 10.8$\times$ on a set of microbenchmarks and a typical industry workload under different hardware environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In-cache computing technology transforms existing caches into long-vector compute units and offers low-cost alternatives to building expensive vector engines for mobile CPUs. Unfortunately, existing long-vector Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) extensions, such as RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) and Arm Scalable Vector Extension (SVE), provide only one-dimensional strided and random memory accesses. While this is sufficient for typical vector engines, it fails to effectively utilize the large Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) widths of in-cache vector engines. This is because mobile data-parallel kernels expose limited parallelism across a single dimension.   Based on our analysis of mobile vector kernels, we introduce a long-vector Multi-dimensional Vector ISA Extension (MVE) for mobile in-cache computing. MVE achieves high SIMD resource utilization and enables flexible programming by abstracting cache geometry and data layout. The proposed ISA features multi-dimensional strided and random memory accesses and efficient dimension-level masked execution to encode parallelism across multiple dimensions. Using a wide range of data-parallel mobile workloads, we demonstrate that MVE offers significant performance and energy reduction benefits of 2.9x and 8.8x, on average, compared to the SIMD units of a commercial mobile processor, at an area overhead of 3.6%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Dielectrics featuring a high relative permittivity, i.e., high-k dielectrics, have become the standard insulators in gate architectures, enhancing the electrical performance of both room temperature and cryogenic electronics. This study delves into the cryogenic (3 K) performance of high-k dielectrics commonly used as gate insulators. We fabricated Al2O3 and HfO2 layers via Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) and we extrapolated relative permittivity (k) and dielectric strength (E_BD) from AC (100 Hz to 100 kHz) and DC measurements on metal-insulator-metal capacitors. Our findings reveal a strong dependence of HfO2 cryogenic performance on the ALD growth temperature, while the latter shows a negligible impact on Al2O3. We estimated a ~9 % and ~14 % reduction of the relative permittivity of HfO2 and Al2O3, respectively, from 300 K to 3 K. Additionally, we designed and fabricated Al2O3/HfO2 bilayers and we checked their properties at cryogenic temperatures. The study also investigates the impact of the patterning method, namely, UV or electron-beam lithography (acceleration voltage of 10, 20, or 30 kV), on the high-k dielectric properties.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Memory-disk synchronization is a critical technology for ensuring data correctness, integrity, and security, especially in systems that handle sensitive information like financial transactions and medical records. We propose SYNC+SYNC, a group of attacks that exploit the memory-disk synchronization primitives. SYNC+SYNC works by subtly varying the timing of synchronization on the write buffer, offering several advantages: 1) implemented purely in software, enabling deployment on any hardware devices; 2) resilient against existing cache partitioning and randomization techniques; 3) unaffected by prefetching techniques and cache replacement strategies. We present the principles of SYNC+SYNC through the implementation of two write covert channel protocols, using either a single file or page, and introduce three enhanced strategies that utilize multiple files and pages. The feasibility of these channels is demonstrated in both cross-process and cross-sandbox scenarios across diverse operating systems (OSes). Experimental results show that, the average rate can reach 2.036 Kb/s (with a peak rate of 14.762 Kb/s) and the error rate is 0% on Linux; when running on macOS, the average rate achieves 10.211 Kb/s (with a peak rate of 253.022 Kb/s) and the error rate is 0.004%. To the best of our knowledge, SYNC+SYNC is the first high-speed write covert channel for software cache.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mobile edge Large Language Model (LLM) deployments face inherent constraints, such as limited computational resources and network bandwidth. Although Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates some challenges by integrating external knowledge bases, inefficient cache management can still result in high retrieval latency and frequent cache updates. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Contextual Caching (ACC) framework that anticipates user needs by proactively caching semantically relevant data for mobile-edge LLMs. ACC utilizes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) module to refine cache replacement policies, balancing user context, document similarity, and the overhead associated with cache misses. Experimental results demonstrate that ACC increases cache hit rates to over 80\% after only 11 training episodes, outperforming FIFO, LRU, and semantic-only caching while reducing retrieval latency by up to 40\%. In particular, ACC also reduces local caching overhead (i.e., the cost of updating the cache when a miss occurs) by as much as 55\%, enabling scalable, low-latency LLM services in resource-constrained edge environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Building autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) with optimized efficiency and adaptive capabilities-able to respond to changing task demands and dynamic environments-is a strongly desired goal for advancing construction robotics. Such robots can play a critical role in enabling automation, reducing operational carbon footprints, and supporting modular construction processes. Inspired by the adaptive autonomy of living organisms, we introduce interoception, which centers on the robot's internal state representation, as a foundation for developing self-reflection and conscious learning to enable continual learning and adaptability in robotic agents. In this paper, we factorize internal state variables and mathematical properties as "cognitive dissonance" in shared control paradigms, where human interventions occasionally occur. We offer a new perspective on how interoception can help build adaptive motion planning in AMRs by integrating the legacy of heuristic costs from grid/graph-based algorithms with recent advances in neuroscience and reinforcement learning. Declarative and procedural knowledge extracted from human semantic inputs is encoded into a hypergraph model that overlaps with the spatial configuration of onsite layout for path planning. In addition, we design a velocity-replay module using an encoder-decoder architecture with few-shot learning to enable robots to replicate velocity profiles in contextualized scenarios for multi-robot synchronization and handover collaboration. These "cached" knowledge representations are demonstrated in simulated environments for multi-robot motion planning and stacking tasks. The insights from this study pave the way toward artificial general intelligence in AMRs, fostering their progression from complexity to competence in construction automation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model is one of the most popular models in the world. However, serving diffusion models at the entire image level faces several problems, especially when there are multiple candidate resolutions. First, image based serving system prevents requests with different resolutions from batching together. On the other hand, requests with hybrid resolutions also indicate diverse locality features, which makes it hard to apply the same cache policy to all of them. To this end, we propose PATCHEDSERVE, A Patch Management Framework for SLO-Optimized Hybrid Resolution Diffusion Serving that provides a patch-level management strategy to gather hybrid resolution requests into batches. Specifically, PATCHEDSERVE incorporates a novel patch-based processing workflow, significantly enhancing throughput for hybrid resolution inputs. Furthermore, PATCHEDSERVE designs a patch-level cache reuse policy to fully exploit the redundancy in diffusion. In addition, PATCHEDSERVE features an SLO-aware scheduling algorithm with lightweight online latency prediction, achieving higher SLO satisfaction rates. We show that PATCHEDSERVE can achieve 30.1 % higher SLO satisfaction compared to SOTA diffusion serving system while not hurt the image quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents a Micro-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-enhanced content management system for disaster scenarios where communication infrastructure is generally compromised. Utilizing a hybrid network of stationary and mobile Micro-UAVs, this system aims to provide crucial content access to isolated communities. In the developed architecture, stationary anchor UAVs, equipped with vertical and lateral links, serve users in individual disaster-affected communities. and mobile micro-ferrying UAVs, with enhanced mobility, extend coverage across multiple such communities. The primary goal is to devise a content dissemination system that dynamically learns caching policies to maximize content accessibility to users left without communication infrastructure. The core contribution is an adaptive content dissemination framework that employs a decentralized Top-k Multi-Armed Bandit learning approach for efficient UAV caching decisions. This approach accounts for geo-temporal variations in content popularity and diverse user demands. Additionally, a Selective Caching Algorithm is proposed to minimize redundant content copies by leveraging inter-UAV information sharing. Through functional verification and performance evaluation, the proposed framework demonstrates improved system performance and adaptability across varying network sizes, micro-UAV swarms, and content popularity distributions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle - enabled content management architecture that is suitable for critical content access in communities of users that are communication-isolated during diverse types of disaster scenarios. The proposed architecture leverages a hybrid network of stationary anchor UAVs and mobile Micro-UAVs for ubiquitous content dissemination. The anchor UAVs are equipped with both vertical and lateral communication links, and they serve local users, while the mobile micro-ferrying UAVs extend coverage across communities with increased mobility. The focus is on developing a content dissemination system that dynamically learns optimal caching policies to maximize content availability. The core innovation is an adaptive content dissemination framework based on distributed Federated Multi-Armed Bandit learning. The goal is to optimize UAV content caching decisions based on geo-temporal content popularity and user demand variations. A Selective Caching Algorithm is also introduced to reduce redundant content replication by incorporating inter-UAV information sharing. This method strategically preserves the uniqueness in user preferences while amalgamating the intelligence across a distributed learning system. This approach improves the learning algorithm's ability to adapt to diverse user preferences. Functional verification and performance evaluation confirm the proposed architecture's utility across different network sizes, UAV swarms, and content popularity patterns.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The expansion of large language models (LLMs) with hundreds of billions of parameters presents significant challenges to computational resources, particularly data movement and memory bandwidth. Long-context LLMs, which process sequences of tens of thousands of tokens, further increase the demand on the memory system as the complexity in attention layers and key-value cache sizes is proportional to the context length. Processing-in-Memory (PIM) maximizes memory bandwidth by moving compute to the data and can address the memory bandwidth challenges; however, PIM is not necessarily scalable to accelerate long-context LLM because of limited per-module memory capacity and the inflexibility of fixed-functional unit PIM architecture and static memory management. In this work, we propose LoL-PIM which is a multi-node PIM architecture that accelerates long context LLM through hardware-software co-design. In particular, we propose how pipeline parallelism can be exploited across a multi-PIM module while a direct PIM access (DPA) controller (or DMA for PIM) is proposed that enables dynamic PIM memory management and results in efficient PIM utilization across a diverse range of context length. We developed an MLIR-based compiler for LoL-PIM extending a commercial PIM-based compiler where the software modifications were implemented and evaluated, while the hardware changes were modeled in the simulator. Our evaluations demonstrate that LoL-PIM significantly improves throughput and reduces latency for long-context LLM inference, outperforming both multi-GPU and GPU-PIM systems (up to 8.54x and 16.0x speedup, respectively), thereby enabling more efficient deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As multicore hardware is becoming increasingly common in real-time systems, traditional scheduling techniques that assume a single worst-case execution time for a task are no longer adequate, since they ignore the impact of shared resources on execution time. When tasks execute concurrently on different cores, their execution times often vary substantially with their allocated budgets of shared resources, such as cache and memory bandwidth. Even under a specific resource allocation, the resource use pattern of a task also changes with time during a job execution. It is therefore important to consider the relationship between multicore resources and execution time in task modeling and scheduling algorithm design.   In this paper, we propose a much more precise execution model for DAG-based real-time tasks that captures the time-varying resource use characteristics of a task under different budgets of shared resources. We present a generative resource profiling algorithm that efficiently predicts, from limited measurement data, the resource profile of a task at any time during its execution under a given resource budget. The generative profiles can then be used to construct the execution models for tasks, using which one can make informed resource allocation decisions. We further introduce a multicore resource allocation and deadline decomposition co-design technique for DAG-based tasks that leverages the generated execution models to jointly allocate resources and deadlines to subtasks, to maximize resource efficiency and schedulability. Our evaluation results show that our generative profiling algorithm achieves high accuracy while being efficient, and that our co-allocation technique substantially improves schedulability compared to a state-of-the-art deadline decomposition method.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are widely used across various applications, but their substantial computational requirements pose significant challenges, particularly in terms of HBM bandwidth bottlenecks and inter-device communication overhead. In this paper, we present PRESERVE, a novel prefetching framework designed to optimize LLM inference by overlapping memory reads for model weights and KV-cache with collective communication operations. Through extensive experiments conducted on commercial AI accelerators, we demonstrate up to 1.6x end-to-end speedup on state-of-the-art, open-source LLMs. Additionally, we perform a design space exploration that identifies the optimal hardware configuration for the proposed method, showing a further 1.25x improvement in performance per cost by selecting the optimal L2 cache size. Our results show that PRESERVE has the potential to mitigate the memory bottlenecks and communication overheads, offering a solution to improve the performance and scalability of the LLM inference systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The influence of contextual input on the behavior of large language models (LLMs) has prompted the development of context attribution methods that aim to quantify each context span's effect on an LLM's generations. The leave-one-out (LOO) error, which measures the change in the likelihood of the LLM's response when a given span of the context is removed, provides a principled way to perform context attribution, but can be prohibitively expensive to compute for large models. In this work, we introduce AttriBoT, a series of novel techniques for efficiently computing an approximation of the LOO error for context attribution. Specifically, AttriBoT uses cached activations to avoid redundant operations, performs hierarchical attribution to reduce computation, and emulates the behavior of large target models with smaller proxy models. Taken together, AttriBoT can provide a >300x speedup while remaining more faithful to a target model's LOO error than prior context attribution methods. This stark increase in performance makes computing context attributions for a given response 30x faster than generating the response itself, empowering real-world applications that require computing attributions at scale. We release a user-friendly and efficient implementation of AttriBoT to enable efficient LLM interpretability as well as encourage future development of efficient context attribution methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficient key-value (KV) cache compression is critical for scaling transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) in long sequences and resource-limited settings. Existing methods evict tokens based on their positions or importance scores, but position-based strategies can miss crucial information outside predefined regions, while those relying on global importance scores resulting in strong regional biases, limiting the KV cache's overall context retention and potentially impairing the performance of LLMs on complex tasks. Our wavelet analysis reveals that as tokens approach the end of sequence, their contributions to generation gradually increase and tends to diverge more from neighboring tokens, indicating a smooth transition with increasing complexity and variability from distant to nearby context. Motivated by this observation, we propose TreeKV, an intuitive, training-free method that employs a tree structure for smooth cache compression. TreeKV maintains a fixed cache size, allowing LLMs to deliver high-quality output even in long text scenarios. Unlike most compression methods, TreeKV is applicable to both the generation and prefilling stages. TreeKV consistently surpasses all baseline models in language modeling tasks on PG19 and OpenWebText2, allowing LLMs trained with short context window to generalize to longer window with a 16x cache reduction. On the Longbench benchmark, TreeKV achieves the best performance with only 6\% of the budget at optimal efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Tissue homeostasis, the biological process of maintaining a steady state in tissue via control of cell proliferation, death, and metabolic function, is essential for the development, growth, maintenance, and proper function of living organisms. Disruptions to this process can lead to serious diseases and even death. In this study, we use the vertex model for the cell-level description of tissue mechanics to investigate the impact of the tissue microenvironment and local mechanical properties of cells on homeostasis in confined epithelial tissues. We find a dynamic steady state, where the balance between cell divisions and removals sustains homeostasis. By characterising homeostasis in terms of cell count, tissue area, and the cells' neighbour count distribution, we identify the factors that govern regulated and ordered tissue growth. This work, therefore, sheds light on the mechanisms underlying tissue homeostasis and highlights the importance of mechanics in the control of biological processes such as tissue development and disease pathology.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose novel attention architectures, Multi-matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) and MFA-Key-Reuse (MFA-KR). Existing variants for standard Multi-Head Attention (MHA), including SOTA methods like MLA, fail to maintain as strong performance under stringent Key-Value cache (KV cache) constraints. MFA enhances model capacity by efficiently scaling up both the number and dimension of attention heads through low-rank matrix factorization in the Query-Key (QK) circuit. Extending MFA, MFA-KR further reduces memory requirements by repurposing the key cache as value through value projection re-parameterization. MFA's design enables strong model capacity when working under tight KV cache budget, while MFA-KR is suitable for even harsher KV cache limits with minor performance trade-off. Notably, in our extensive and large-scale experiments, the proposed architecture outperforms MLA and performs comparably to MHA, while reducing KV cache usage by up to 56% and 93.7%, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based models have emerged as one of the most widely used architectures for natural language processing, natural language generation, and image generation. The size of the state-of-the-art models has increased steadily reaching billions of parameters. These huge models are memory hungry and incur significant inference latency even on cutting edge AI-accelerators, such as GPUs. Specifically, the time and memory complexity of the attention operation is quadratic in terms of the total context length, i.e., prompt and output tokens. Thus, several optimizations such as key-value tensor caching and FlashAttention computation have been proposed to deliver the low latency demands of applications relying on such large models. However, these techniques do not cater to the computationally distinct nature of different phases during inference.   To that end, we propose LeanAttention, a scalable technique of computing self-attention for the token-generation phase (decode-phase) of decoder-only transformer models. LeanAttention enables scaling the attention mechanism implementation for the challenging case of long context lengths by re-designing the execution flow for the decode-phase. We identify that the associative property of online softmax can be treated as a reduction operation thus allowing us to parallelize the attention computation over these large context lengths. We extend the "stream-K" style reduction of tiled calculation to self-attention to enable parallel computation resulting in an average of 2.6x attention execution speedup over FlashAttention-2 and up to 8.33x speedup for 512k context lengths.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quick Merkle Database (QMDB) addresses longstanding bottlenecks in blockchain state management by integrating key-value (KV) and Merkle tree storage into a single unified architecture. QMDB delivers a significant throughput improvement over existing architectures, achieving up to 6X over the widely used RocksDB and 8X over NOMT, a leading verifiable database. Its novel append-only twig-based design enables one SSD read per state access, O(1) IOs for updates, and in-memory Merkleization on a memory footprint as small as 2.3 bytes per entry, enabling it to run on even modest consumer-grade PCs. QMDB scales seamlessly across both commodity and enterprise hardware, achieving up to 2.28 million state updates per second. This performance enables support for 1 million token transfers per second (TPS), marking QMDB as the first solution achieving such a milestone. QMDB has been benchmarked with workloads exceeding 15 billion entries (10X Ethereum's 2024 state) and has proven the capacity to scale to 280 billion entries on a single server. Furthermore, QMDB introduces historical proofs, unlocking the ability to query its blockchain's historical state at the latest block. QMDB not only meets the demands of current blockchains but also provides a robust foundation for building scalable, efficient, and verifiable decentralized applications across diverse use cases.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While Transformers and other sequence-parallelizable neural network architectures seem like the current state of the art in sequence modeling, they specifically lack state-tracking capabilities. These are important for time-series tasks and logical reasoning. Traditional RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs, as well as modern variants like sLSTM do have these capabilities at the cost of strictly sequential processing. While this is often seen as a strong limitation, we show how fast these networks can get with our hardware-optimization FlashRNN in Triton and CUDA, optimizing kernels to the register level on modern GPUs. We extend traditional RNNs with a parallelization variant that processes multiple RNNs of smaller hidden state in parallel, similar to the head-wise processing in Transformers. To enable flexibility on different GPU variants, we introduce a new optimization framework for hardware-internal cache sizes, memory and compute handling. It models the hardware in a setting using polyhedral-like constraints, including the notion of divisibility. This speeds up the solution process in our ConstrINT library for general integer constraint satisfaction problems (integer CSPs). We show that our kernels can achieve 50x speed-ups over a vanilla PyTorch implementation and allow 40x larger hidden sizes compared to our Triton implementation. Our open-source kernels and the optimization library are released here to boost research in the direction of state-tracking enabled RNNs and sequence modeling: \url{https://github.com/NX-AI/flashrnn}

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Authentication in TLS is predominately carried out with X.509 digital certificates issued by certificate authorities (CA). The centralized nature of current public key infrastructures, however, comes along with severe risks, such as single points of failure and susceptibility to cyber-attacks, potentially undermining the security and trustworthiness of the entire system. With Decentralized Identifiers (DID) alongside distributed ledger technology, it becomes technically feasible to prove ownership of a unique identifier without requiring an attestation of the proof's public key by a centralized and therefore vulnerable CA. This article presents DID Link, a novel authentication scheme for TLS 1.3 that empowers entities to authenticate in a TLS-compliant way with self-issued X.509 certificates that are equipped with ledger-anchored DIDs instead of CA-issued identifiers. It facilitates the exchange of tamper-proof and 3rd-party attested claims in the form of DID-bound Verifiable Credentials after the TLS handshake to complete the authentication with a full identification of the communication partner. A prototypical implementation shows comparable TLS handshake durations of DID Link if verification material is cached and reasonable prolongations if it is obtained from a ledger. The significant speed improvement of the resulting TLS channel over a widely used, DID-based alternative transport protocol on the application layer demonstrates the potential of DID Link to become a viable solution for the establishment of secure and trustful end-to-end communication links with decentrally managed digital identities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sparse GEneral Matrix-matrix Multiplication (SpGEMM) is a critical operation in many applications. Current multithreaded implementations are based on Gustavson's algorithm and often perform poorly on large matrices due to limited cache reuse by the accumulators. We present MAGNUS (Matrix Algebra for Gigantic NUmerical Systems), a novel algorithm to maximize data locality in SpGEMM. To generate locality, MAGNUS reorders the intermediate product into discrete cache-friendly chunks using a two-level hierarchical approach. The accumulator is applied to each chunk, where the chunk size is chosen such that the accumulator is cache-efficient. MAGNUS is input- and system-aware: based on the matrix characteristics and target system specifications, the optimal number of chunks is computed by minimizing the storage cost of the necessary data structures. MAGNUS allows for a hybrid accumulation strategy in which each chunk uses a different accumulator based on an input threshold. We consider two accumulators: an AVX-512 vectorized bitonic sorting algorithm and classical dense accumulation. An OpenMP implementation of MAGNUS is compared with several baselines for a variety of different matrices on three Intel x86 architectures. For matrices from the SuiteSparse collection, MAGNUS is faster than all the baselines in most cases and is orders of magnitude faster than Intel MKL for several matrices. For massive random matrices that model social network graphs, MAGNUS scales to the largest matrix sizes, while the baselines fail to do so. Furthermore, MAGNUS is close to the optimal bound for these matrices, regardless of the matrix size, structure, and density.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> High-level synthesis, source-to-source compilers, and various Design Space Exploration techniques for pragma insertion have significantly improved the Quality of Results of generated designs. These tools offer benefits such as reduced development time and enhanced performance. However, achieving high-quality results often requires additional manual code transformations and tiling selections, which are typically performed separately or as pre-processing steps. Although DSE techniques enable code transformation upfront, the vastness of the search space often limits the exploration of all possible code transformations, making it challenging to determine which transformations are necessary. Additionally, ensuring correctness remains challenging, especially for complex transformations and optimizations.   To tackle this obstacle, we first propose a comprehensive framework leveraging HLS compilers. Our system streamlines code transformation, pragma insertion, and tiles size selection for on-chip data caching through a unified optimization problem, aiming to enhance parallelization, particularly beneficial for computation-bound kernels. Them employing a novel Non-Linear Programming (NLP) approach, we simultaneously ascertain transformations, pragmas, and tile sizes, focusing on regular loop-based kernels. Our evaluation demonstrates that our framework adeptly identifies the appropriate transformations, including scenarios where no transformation is necessary, and inserts pragmas to achieve a favorable Quality of Results.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper investigates the shared-memory Graph Transposition (GT) problem, a fundamental graph algorithm that is widely used in graph analytics and scientific computing.   Previous GT algorithms have significant memory requirements that are proportional to the number of vertices and threads which obstructs their use on large graphs. Moreover, atomic memory operations have become comparably fast on recent CPU architectures, which creates new opportunities for improving the performance of concurrent atomic accesses in GT.   We design PoTra, a GT algorithm which leverages graph structure and processor and memory architecture to optimize locality and performance. PoTra limits the size of additional data structures close to CPU cache sizes and utilizes the skewed degree distribution of graph datasets to optimize locality and performance. We present the performance model of PoTra to explain the connection between cache and memory response times and graph locality.   Our evaluation of PoTra on three CPU architectures and 20 real-world and synthetic graph datasets with up to 128 billion edges demonstrates that PoTra achieves up to 8.7 times speedup compared to previous works and if there is a performance loss it remains limited to 15.7%, on average.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Private large language model (LLM) inference based on secure multi-party computation (MPC) offers cryptographically-secure protection for both user prompt and proprietary model weights. However, it suffers from large latency overhead especially for long input sequences. While key-value (KV) cache eviction algorithms have been proposed to reduce the computation and memory cost for plaintext inference, they are not designed for MPC and cannot benefit private inference easily. In this paper, we propose an accurate and MPC-friendly KV cache eviction framework, dubbed MPCache. MPCache is built on the observation that historical tokens in a long sequence may have different effects on the downstream decoding. Hence, MPCache combines a look-once static eviction algorithm to discard unimportant tokens and a query-aware dynamic selection algorithm to further select a small subset of tokens for attention computation. As existing dynamic selection algorithms incur too much latency, we propose a series of optimizations to drastically reduce the KV cache selection overhead, including MPC-friendly similarity approximation, hierarchical KV cache clustering, and cross-layer index sharing strategy. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MPCache consistently outperforms prior-art KV cache eviction baselines across different LLM generation tasks and achieves 1.8~2.01x and 3.39~8.37x decoding latency and communication reduction on different sequence lengths, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sequence parallelism (SP) serves as a prevalent strategy to handle long sequences that exceed the memory limit of a single device. However, for linear sequence modeling methods like linear attention, existing SP approaches do not take advantage of their right-product-first feature, resulting in sub-optimal communication efficiency and usability. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallelism (LASP), an efficient SP approach designed for linear attention-based transformer models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point ring-style communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead, comparing with existing SP methods. We enhance the computation efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPUs. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with very-long sequences. We also discuss the generalization of LASP on other linear sequence modeling methods. Extensive experiments on linear attention-based models are conducted with varying sequence lengths from 2K to 4096K. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K on 128 GPUs, which is 8$\times$ longer than existing SP methods. The code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/LASP.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Terahertz pulses generated by two-color laser plasmas have reported peak field strengths exceeding MV/cm, and when illuminating metal nanotips the near-field enhancement at the tip apex should result in extremely high bunch charges and electron energies via sub-cycle cold field emission. Here, electron emission from tungsten nanotips driven by THz pulses generated by a long filament air-plasma are reported. Electron energies up to 1.1 keV and bunch charges up to 2x$10^5$ electrons per pulse were detected, well below values expected for peak field calculated via the time averaged Poynting vector. Investigations revealed a failure in the use of the time-averaged Poynting vector when applied to long filament THz pulses, due to spatio-temporal restructuring of the THz pulse in the focus. Accounting for this restructuring significantly reduces the field strength to approximately 160 ~kV/cm, consistent with the observed electron bunch charges, peak energies and their dependence on the tip position in the THz focus. Despite these findings, our results surpass previous THz plasma-driven electron generation by an order of magnitude in both electron energy and bunch charge and a path to increasing these by an additional order of magnitude by modification of the THz optics is proposed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, diffusion-based methods have achieved great improvements in the video inpainting task. However, these methods still face many challenges, such as maintaining temporal consistency and the time-consuming issue. This paper proposes an advanced video inpainting framework using optical Flow-guided Efficient Diffusion, called FloED. Specifically, FloED employs a dual-branch architecture, where a flow branch first restores corrupted flow and a multi-scale flow adapter provides motion guidance to the main inpainting branch. Additionally, a training-free latent interpolation method is proposed to accelerate the multi-step denoising process using flow warping. Further introducing a flow attention cache mechanism, FLoED efficiently reduces the computational cost brought by incorporating optical flow. Comprehensive experiments in both background restoration and object removal tasks demonstrate that FloED outperforms state-of-the-art methods from the perspective of both performance and efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Serving large language models (LLMs) for massive users is challenged by the significant memory footprint of the transient state, known as the key-value (KV) cache, which scales with sequence length and number of requests. Instead of renting or buying more expensive GPUs, the load imbalance of the KV cache across GPUs, coupled with recent advances in inter-GPU communication, provides an opportunity to serve more requests via request migration. However, high migration overhead and unpredictable request patterns make it challenging. Therefore, this paper proposes MELL, a memory-efficient LLM serving system via multi-GPU KV cache management. It saves the number of GPUs needed in the system by considering the dynamic KV cache load and the costly request migration. Specifically, we first develop an adaptive request migration mechanism to balance the computational and communication overheads and adapt to diverse resource conditions. Then, we design an online algorithm tailored to a multi-LLM request and multi-GPU scheduling problem with migration enabled. It aims to minimise the required GPUs while limiting the number of migrations. Finally, we implement a prototype of MELL and demonstrate that it reduces the number of GPUs by 31% and increases the GPU utilization by 43% at most compared to existing LLM serving systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In our recent research, we have developed a framework called GraphSnapShot, which has been proven an useful tool for graph learning acceleration. GraphSnapShot is a framework for fast cache, storage, retrieval and computation for graph learning. It can quickly store and update the local topology of graph structure and allows us to track patterns in the structure of graph networks, just like take snapshots of the graphs. In experiments, GraphSnapShot shows efficiency, it can achieve up to 30% training acceleration and 73% memory reduction for lossless graph ML training compared to current baselines such as dgl.This technique is particular useful for large dynamic graph learning tasks such as social media analysis and recommendation systems to process complex relationships between entities.   The code for GraphSnapShot is publicly available at https://github.com/NoakLiu/GraphSnapShot.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Due to its flexible architecture, FPGAs support unique, deep hardware pipeline implementations for accelerating HPC applications. However, these devices are quite new in the HPC space, and thus, have been scarcely explored outside some specific scientific domain, such as machine learning or biological sequence alignment. The objective of this thesis is to characterize the FPGA-based solution for accelerating particle-mesh algorithms, in which the force applied to each particle is computed based on the fields deposited in a finite mesh (or grid). Our starting point is a 2D kinetic PIC plasma simulator called ZPIC that has the same core algorithm and functionalities as OSIRIS. To create an efficient hardware design, the program keeps the particles strictly sorted by tiles (a group of cells) and uses the local memory as an explicitly managed cache. We also create multiple copies of the local current buffer to solve dependencies during the deposition phase. The resulting pipeline was replicated multiple times to explore data parallelism and increase its throughput. We then compare our hardware solution against similar implementations on GPU and multicore CPUs, showing promising results in term of power efficiency and performance.   Keywords: FPGA, OpenCL, Kinetic Plasma Simulation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scaling language models to handle longer input sequences typically necessitates large key-value (KV) caches, resulting in substantial memory overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Tensor Product Attention (TPA), a novel attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions to represent queries, keys, and values compactly, significantly shrinking KV cache size at inference time. By factorizing these representations into contextual low-rank components (contextual factorization) and seamlessly integrating with RoPE, TPA achieves improved model quality alongside memory efficiency. Based on TPA, we introduce the Tensor ProducT ATTenTion Transformer (T6), a new model architecture for sequence modeling. Through extensive empirical evaluation of language modeling tasks, we demonstrate that T6 exceeds the performance of standard Transformer baselines including MHA, MQA, GQA, and MLA across various metrics, including perplexity and a range of renowned evaluation benchmarks. Notably, TPAs memory efficiency enables the processing of significantly longer sequences under fixed resource constraints, addressing a critical scalability challenge in modern language models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in personalized speech generation have brought synthetic speech increasingly close to the realism of target speakers' recordings, yet multimodal speaker generation remains on the rise. This paper introduces UniSpeaker, a unified approach for multimodality-driven speaker generation. Specifically, we propose a unified voice aggregator based on KV-Former, applying soft contrastive loss to map diverse voice description modalities into a shared voice space, ensuring that the generated voice aligns more closely with the input descriptions. To evaluate multimodality-driven voice control, we build the first multimodality-based voice control (MVC) benchmark, focusing on voice suitability, voice diversity, and speech quality. UniSpeaker is evaluated across five tasks using the MVC benchmark, and the experimental results demonstrate that UniSpeaker outperforms previous modality-specific models.

For this, we use the theory of Mac Lane-Vaqui\'e chains and abstract key polynomials. We then prove that a valued field $(K,v)$ is tame if and only if $vK$ is $p$-divisible, $Kv$ is perfect and every simple algebraic extension of $K$ admits a finite complete sequence of key polynomials. The properties $vK$ $p$-divisible and $Kv$ perfect are described by the Frobenius endomorphism on the associated graded ring. We also make considerations on simply defectless and algebraically maximal valued fields and purely inertial and purely ramified extensions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We investigate the performance of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based networks in urban environments characterized by blockages, focusing on their capability to support the service demands of mobile users. The UAV-base stations (UAV-BSs) are modeled using a two-dimensional (2-D) marked- Poisson point process (MPPP), where the marks represent the altitude of each UAV-BS. Leveraging stochastic geometry, we analyze the impact of blockages on network reliability by studying the meta distribution (MD) of the signal-to-interference noise ratio (SINR) for a specific reliability threshold and the association probabilities for both line-of-sight (LoS) and non line-of-sight (NLoS) UAV-BSs. Furthermore, to enhance the performance of mobile users, we propose a novel cache-based handover management strategy that dynamically selects the cell search time and delays the received signal strength (RSS)-based base station (BS) associations. This strategy aims to minimize unnecessary handovers (HOs) experienced by users by leveraging caching capabilities at user equipment (UE), thus reducing latency, ensuring seamless connectivity, and maintaining the quality of service (QoS). This study provides valuable insights into optimizing UAV network deployments to support the stringent requirements in the network, ensuring reliable, low-latency, and high-throughput communication for next-generation smart cities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Unlike non-volatile memory that resides on the processor memory bus, memory-semantic solid-state drives (SSDs) support both byte and block access granularity via PCIe or CXL interconnects. They provide scalable memory capacity using NAND flash at a much lower cost. In addition, they have different performance characteristics for their dual byte/block interface respectively, while offering essential memory semantics for upper-level software. Such a byte-accessible storage device provides new implications on the software system design.   In this paper, we develop a new file system, named ByteFS, by rethinking the design primitives of file systems and SSD firmware to exploit the advantages of both byte and block-granular data accesses. ByteFS supports byte-granular data persistence to retain the persistence nature of SSDs. It extends the core data structure of file systems by enabling dual byte/block-granular data accesses. To facilitate the support for byte-granular writes, \pname{} manages the internal DRAM of SSD firmware in a log-structured manner and enables data coalescing to reduce the unnecessary I/O traffic to flash chips. ByteFS also enables coordinated data caching between the host page cache and SSD cache for best utilizing the precious memory resource. We implement ByteFS on both a real programmable SSD and an emulated memory-semantic SSD for sensitivity study. Compared to state-of-the-art file systems for non-volatile memory and conventional SSDs, ByteFS outperforms them by up to 2.7$\times$, while preserving the essential properties of a file system. ByteFS also reduces the write traffic to SSDs by up to 5.1$\times$ by alleviating unnecessary writes caused by both metadata and data updates in file systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In cloud databases, cloud computation over sensitive data uploaded by clients inevitably causes concern about data security and privacy. Even when encryption primitives and trusted computing environments are integrated into query processing to safeguard the actual contents of the data, access patterns of algorithms can still leak private information about the data. Oblivious Random Access Memory (ORAM) and circuits are two generic approaches to address this issue, ensuring that access patterns of algorithms remain oblivious to the data. However, deploying these methods on insecure algorithms, particularly for multi-way join processing, is computationally expensive and inherently challenging.   In this paper, we propose a novel sorting-based algorithm for multi-way join processing that operates without relying on ORAM simulations or other security assumptions. Our algorithm is a non-trivial, provably oblivious composition of basic primitives, with time complexity matching the insecure worst-case optimal join algorithm, up to a logarithmic factor. Furthermore, it is cache-agnostic, with cache complexity matching the insecure lower bound, also up to a logarithmic factor. This clean and straightforward approach has the potential to be extended to other security settings and implemented in practical database systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the exponential rise in the use of cloud services, smart devices, and IoT devices, advanced cyber attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and ubiquitous. Furthermore, the rapid evolution of computing architectures and memory technologies has created an urgent need to understand and address hardware security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we review the current state of vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies in contemporary computing systems. We discuss cache side-channel attacks (including Spectre and Meltdown), power side-channel attacks (such as Simple Power Analysis, Differential Power Analysis, Correlation Power Analysis, and Template Attacks), and advanced techniques like Voltage Glitching and Electromagnetic Analysis to help understand and build robust cybersecurity defense systems and guide further research. We also examine memory encryption, focusing on confidentiality, granularity, key management, masking, and re-keying strategies. Additionally, we cover Cryptographic Instruction Set Architectures, Secure Boot, Root of Trust mechanisms, Physical Unclonable Functions, and hardware fault injection techniques. The paper concludes with an analysis of the RISC-V architecture's unique security challenges. The comprehensive analysis presented in this paper is essential for building resilient hardware security solutions that can protect against both current and emerging threats in an increasingly challenging security landscape.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We consider the problem of \textit{online sparse linear approximation}, where one predicts the best sparse approximation of a sequence of measurements in terms of linear combination of columns of a given measurement matrix. Such online prediction problems are ubiquitous, ranging from medical trials to web caching to resource allocation. The inherent difficulty of offline recovery also makes the online problem challenging. In this letter, we propose Follow-The-Approximate-Sparse-Leader, an efficient online meta-policy to address this online problem. Through a detailed theoretical analysis, we prove that under certain assumptions on the measurement sequence, the proposed policy enjoys a data-dependent sublinear upper bound on the static regret, which can range from logarithmic to square-root. Numerical simulations are performed to corroborate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed online policy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The $k$d-tree is one of the most widely used data structures to manage multi-dimensional data. Due to the ever-growing data volume, it is imperative to consider parallelism in $k$d-trees. However, we observed challenges in existing parallel kd-tree implementations, for both constructions and updates.   The goal of this paper is to develop efficient in-memory $k$d-trees by supporting high parallelism and cache-efficiency. We propose the Pkd-tree (Parallel $k$d-tree), a parallel $k$d-tree that is efficient both in theory and in practice. The Pkd-tree supports parallel tree construction, batch update (insertion and deletion), and various queries including k-nearest neighbor search, range query, and range count. We proved that our algorithms have strong theoretical bounds in work (sequential time complexity), span (parallelism), and cache complexity. Our key techniques include 1) an efficient construction algorithm that optimizes work, span, and cache complexity simultaneously, and 2) reconstruction-based update algorithms that guarantee the tree to be weight-balanced. With the new algorithmic insights and careful engineering effort, we achieved a highly optimized implementation of the Pkd-tree.   We tested Pkd-tree with various synthetic and real-world datasets, including both uniform and highly skewed data. We compare the Pkd-tree with state-of-the-art parallel $k$d-tree implementations. In all tests, with better or competitive query performance, Pkd-tree is much faster in construction and updates consistently than all baselines. We released our code.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various machine learning tasks, quickly becoming one of the most prevalent AI workloads. Yet the substantial memory requirement of LLMs significantly hinders their deployment for end users. Post-training quantization (PTQ) serves as one of the most hardware-efficient methods to mitigate the memory and computational demands of LLMs. Although the traditional integer (INT) datatype has received widespread adoption in PTQ methods, floating-point (FP) quantization has emerged as a viable alternative thanks to its effectiveness in fitting LLM numerical distributions. However, the FP datatype in sign-magnitude binary representation contains both positive and negative zero, which constrains its representation capability, particularly under low precision (3 and 4 bits). In this paper, we extend the basic FP datatype to perform Redundant Zero Remapping (RaZeR), which remaps the negative zero FP encoding to a set of pre-defined special values to maximally utilize FP quantization encodings and to better fit LLM numerical distributions. Through careful selection of special values, RaZeR outperforms conventional asymmetric INT quantization while achieving high computational efficiency. We demonstrate that RaZeR can be seamlessly integrated with quantization algorithms for both weights and KV-cache, including advanced methods with clipping and transformations, and consistently achieve better model accuracy. Additionally, we implement a fast GEMV kernel with fused dequantization that efficiently converts the 4-bit RaZeR value to FP16 through novel bit-level manipulation. On modern GPUs, our evaluation shows that RaZeR improves the GEMV speed by up to 7.56$\times$ compared to the FP16 implementation, while achieving up to 2.72$\times$ speedup in the LLM decoding throughput.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rapidly increasing rate of microlensing planet detections, microlensing modeling software faces significant challenges in computation efficiency. Here, we develop the Twinkle code, an efficient and robust binary-lens modeling software suite optimized for heterogeneous computing devices, especially GPUs. Existing microlensing codes have the issue of catastrophic cancellation that undermines the numerical stability and precision, and Twinkle resolves them by refining the coefficients of the binary-lens equation. We also devise an improved method for robustly identifying ghost images, thereby enhancing computational reliability. We have advanced the state of the art by optimizing Twinkle specifically for heterogeneous computing devices by taking into account the unique task and cache memory dispatching patterns of GPUs, while the compatibility with the traditional computing architectures of CPUs is still maintained. Twinkle has demonstrated an acceleration of approximately 2 orders of magnitude (>~100 times) on contemporary GPUs. The enhancement in computational speed of Twinkle will translate to the delivery of accurate and highly efficient data analysis for ongoing and upcoming microlensing projects. Both GPU and CPU versions of Twinkle are open-source and publicly available.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> One of the challenges in weak gravitational lensing by galaxies and clusters is to infer the projected mass density distribution from gravitational lensing measurements, which is known as inversion problem. We introduce a novel theoretical approach to solve the inversion problem. The cornerstone of the proposed method lies in a complex formalism that describes the lens mapping as quasi-conformal mapping with the Beltrami coefficient given by the negative of the reduced shear, which is, in principle, observable from the image ellipticities. We propose an algorithm called QCLens that is based on this complex formalism. QCLens computes the underlying quasi-conformal mapping with a finite element approach by reducing the problem to two elliptic partial differential equations solely depending on the reduced shear field. Experimental results for both the Schwarzschild and singular isothermal lens demonstrate the agreement of our proposed method with the analytically computable solutions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Fine-grained steering of language model outputs is essential for safety and reliability. Prompting and finetuning are widely used to achieve these goals, but interpretability researchers have proposed a variety of representation-based techniques as well, including sparse autoencoders (SAEs), linear artificial tomography, supervised steering vectors, linear probes, and representation finetuning. At present, there is no benchmark for making direct comparisons between these proposals. Therefore, we introduce AxBench, a large-scale benchmark for steering and concept detection, and report experiments on Gemma-2-2B and 9B. For steering, we find that prompting outperforms all existing methods, followed by finetuning. For concept detection, representation-based methods such as difference-in-means, perform the best. On both evaluations, SAEs are not competitive. We introduce a novel weakly-supervised representational method (Rank-1 Representation Finetuning; ReFT-r1), which is competitive on both tasks while providing the interpretability advantages that prompting lacks. Along with AxBench, we train and publicly release SAE-scale feature dictionaries for ReFT-r1 and DiffMean.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While the $\Lambda$CDM model succeeds on large scales, its validity on smaller scales remains uncertain. Recent works suggest that non-halo dark matter structures, such as filaments and walls, could significantly influence gravitational lensing and that the importance of these effects depends on the dark matter model: in warm dark matter scenarios, fewer low-mass objects form and thus their mass is redistributed into the cosmic-web. We investigate these effects on galaxy-galaxy lensing using fragmentation-free Warm Dark Matter (WDM) simulations with particle masses of m$_{\chi}$ = 1 keV and m$_{\chi}$ = 3 keV. Although these cosmological scenarios are already observationally excluded, the fraction of mass falling outside of haloes grows with the thermal velocity of the dark matter particles, which allows for the search for first-order effects. We create mock datasets, based on gravitationally-lensed systems from the BELLS-Gallery, incorporating non-halo contributions from these simulations to study their impact in comparison to mocks where the lens has a smooth mass distribution. Using Bayesian modelling, we find that perturbations from WDM non-halo structures produce an effect on the inferred parameters of the main lens and shift the reconstructed source position. However, these variations are subtle and are effectively absorbed by standard elliptical power-law lens models, making them challenging to distinguish from intrinsic lensing features. Most importantly, non-halo perturbation does not appear as a strong external shear term, which is commonly used in gravitational lensing analyses to represent large-scale perturbations. Our results demonstrate that while non-halo structures can affect the lensing analysis, the overall impact remains indistinguishable from variations of the main lens in colder WDM and CDM scenarios, where non-halo contributions are smaller.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Prior research on training grounded factuality classification models to detect hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) has relied on public natural language inference (NLI) data and synthetic data. However, conventional NLI datasets are not well-suited for document-level reasoning, which is critical for detecting LLM hallucinations. Recent approaches to document-level synthetic data generation involve iteratively removing sentences from documents and annotating factuality using LLM-based prompts. While effective, this method is computationally expensive for long documents and limited by the LLM's capabilities. In this work, we analyze the differences between existing synthetic training data used in state-of-the-art models and real LLM output claims. Based on our findings, we propose a novel approach for synthetic data generation, CG2C, that leverages multi-hop reasoning on context graphs extracted from documents. Our fact checker model, FactCG, demonstrates improved performance with more connected reasoning, using the same backbone models. Experiments show it even outperforms GPT-4-o on the LLM-Aggrefact benchmark with much smaller model size.

This paper introduces a novel methodology that uses recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) to create and edit OR solutions from non-expert user queries expressed using Natural Language. This reduces the need for domain expertise and the time to formulate a problem.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The radial positions of galaxies inferred from their measured redshift appear distorted due to their peculiar velocities. We argue that the contribution from stochastic velocities -- which gives rise to `Fingers-of-God' (FoG) anisotropy in the inferred maps -- does not lend itself to perturbative modelling already on scales targeted by current experiments. To get around this limitation, we propose to remove FoG using data-driven indicators of their abundance that are local in nature and thus avoid selection biases. In particular, we show that the scale where the measured power spectrum quadrupole changes sign is tightly anti-correlated with both the satellite fraction and the velocity dispersion, and can thus be used to select galaxy samples with fewer FoG. In addition, we show that maps of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich distortion of the cosmic microwave background frequency spectrum can be used to identify and discard many of the most problematic galaxies. These techniques could potentially extend the reach of perturbative models for galaxy clustering and improve reconstructions of the large-scale velocity and displacement fields from the redshift-space positions of galaxies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Confounding and exposure measurement error can introduce bias when drawing inference about the marginal effect of an exposure on an outcome of interest. While there are broad methodologies for addressing each source of bias individually, confounding and exposure measurement error frequently co-occur, and there is a need for methods that address them simultaneously. In this paper, corrected score methods are derived under classical additive measurement error to draw inference about marginal exposure effects using only measured variables. Three estimators are proposed based on g-formula, inverse probability weighting, and doubly-robust estimation techniques. The estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal, and the doubly-robust estimator is shown to exhibit its namesake property. The methods, which are implemented in the R package mismex, perform well in finite samples under both confounding and measurement error as demonstrated by simulation studies. The proposed doubly-robust estimator is applied to study the effects of two biomarkers on HIV-1 infection using data from the HVTN 505 preventative vaccine trial.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained attention due to their ability to understand and generate sophisticated human-like content. However, ensuring their safety is paramount as they might provide harmful and unsafe responses. Existing LLM testing frameworks address various safety-related concerns (e.g., drugs, terrorism, animal abuse) but often face challenges due to unbalanced and obsolete datasets. In this paper, we present ASTRAL, a tool that automates the generation and execution of test cases (i.e., prompts) for testing the safety of LLMs. First, we introduce a novel black-box coverage criterion to generate balanced and diverse unsafe test inputs across a diverse set of safety categories as well as linguistic writing characteristics (i.e., different style and persuasive writing techniques). Second, we propose an LLM-based approach that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), few-shot prompting strategies and web browsing to generate up-to-date test inputs. Lastly, similar to current LLM test automation techniques, we leverage LLMs as test oracles to distinguish between safe and unsafe test outputs, allowing a fully automated testing approach. We conduct an extensive evaluation on well-known LLMs, revealing the following key findings: i) GPT3.5 outperforms other LLMs when acting as the test oracle, accurately detecting unsafe responses, and even surpassing more recent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), as well as LLMs that are specifically tailored to detect unsafe LLM outputs (e.g., LlamaGuard); ii) the results confirm that our approach can uncover nearly twice as many unsafe LLM behaviors with the same number of test inputs compared to currently used static datasets; and iii) our black-box coverage criterion combined with web browsing can effectively guide the LLM on generating up-to-date unsafe test inputs, significantly increasing the number of unsafe LLM behaviors.

  Detection: A Comparative Analysis</h2>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cache side channel attacks are a sophisticated and persistent threat that exploit vulnerabilities in modern processors to extract sensitive information. These attacks leverage weaknesses in shared computational resources, particularly the last level cache, to infer patterns in data access and execution flows, often bypassing traditional security defenses. Such attacks are especially dangerous as they can be executed remotely without requiring physical access to the victim's device. This study focuses on a specific class of these threats: fingerprinting attacks, where an adversary monitors and analyzes the behavior of co-located processes via cache side channels. This can potentially reveal confidential information, such as encryption keys or user activity patterns. A comprehensive threat model illustrates how attackers sharing computational resources with target systems exploit these side channels to compromise sensitive data. To mitigate such risks, a hybrid deep learning model is proposed for detecting cache side channel attacks. Its performance is compared with five widely used deep learning models: Multi-Layer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Network, Simple Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory, and Gated Recurrent Unit. The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid model achieves a detection rate of up to 99.96%. These findings highlight the limitations of existing models, the need for enhanced defensive mechanisms, and directions for future research to secure sensitive data against evolving side channel threats.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Aligning language models with human values is crucial, especially as they become more integrated into everyday life. While models are often adapted to user preferences, it is equally important to ensure they align with moral norms and behaviours in real-world social situations. Despite significant progress in languages like English and Chinese, French has seen little attention in this area, leaving a gap in understanding how LLMs handle moral reasoning in this language. To address this gap, we introduce Histoires Morales, a French dataset derived from Moral Stories, created through translation and subsequently refined with the assistance of native speakers to guarantee grammatical accuracy and adaptation to the French cultural context. We also rely on annotations of the moral values within the dataset to ensure their alignment with French norms. Histoires Morales covers a wide range of social situations, including differences in tipping practices, expressions of honesty in relationships, and responsibilities toward animals. To foster future research, we also conduct preliminary experiments on the alignment of multilingual models on French and English data and the robustness of the alignment. We find that while LLMs are generally aligned with human moral norms by default, they can be easily influenced with user-preference optimization for both moral and immoral data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The growing computational demands of training large language models (LLMs) necessitate more efficient methods. Quantized training presents a promising solution by enabling low-bit arithmetic operations to reduce these costs. While FP8 precision has demonstrated feasibility, leveraging FP4 remains a challenge due to significant quantization errors and limited representational capacity. This work introduces the first FP4 training framework for LLMs, addressing these challenges with two key innovations: a differentiable quantization estimator for precise weight updates and an outlier clamping and compensation strategy to prevent activation collapse. To ensure stability, the framework integrates a mixed-precision training scheme and vector-wise quantization. Experimental results demonstrate that our FP4 framework achieves accuracy comparable to BF16 and FP8, with minimal degradation, scaling effectively to 13B-parameter LLMs trained on up to 100B tokens. With the emergence of next-generation hardware supporting FP4, our framework sets a foundation for efficient ultra-low precision training.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Investigating NLP through a philosophical lens has recently caught researcher's eyes as it connects computational methods with classical schools of philosophy. This paper introduces a philosophical approach inspired by the Hegelian Dialectic for LLMs' self-reflection, utilizing a self-dialectical approach to emulate internal critiques and then synthesize new ideas by resolving the contradicting points. Moreover, this paper investigates the effect of LLMs' temperature for generation by establishing a dynamic annealing approach, which promotes the creativity in the early stages and gradually refines it by focusing on the nuances, as well as a fixed temperature strategy for generation. Our proposed approach is examined to determine its ability to generate novel ideas from an initial proposition. Additionally, a Multi Agent Majority Voting (MAMV) strategy is leveraged to assess the validity and novelty of the generated ideas, which proves beneficial in the absence of domain experts. Our experiments show promise in generating new ideas and provide a stepping stone for future research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Traditional methods for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), rely on implicit principles, limiting interpretability. Constitutional AI (CAI) offers an explicit, rule-based framework for guiding model outputs. Building on this, we refine the Inverse Constitutional AI (ICAI) algorithm, which extracts constitutions from preference datasets. By improving principle generation, clustering, and embedding processes, our approach enhances the accuracy and generalizability of extracted principles across synthetic and real-world datasets. While in-context alignment yields modest improvements, our results highlight the potential of these principles to foster more transparent and adaptable alignment methods, offering a promising direction for future advancements beyond traditional fine-tuning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Apple Silicon has attracted much attention for its performance and role in machine learning (ML) training. Unlike NVIDIA GPUs, which have traditionally dominated ML training, Apple Silicon has a significant difference in memory architecture. It uses Unified Memory, which integrates CPU and GPU memory instead of separate CPU memory and GPU VRAM. However, it is difficult to tell whether Unified Memory means more performance benefits.   This paper investigates the performance differences by training several large language model (LLM) workloads end-to-end under different memory scenarios. The results show a significant performance gap between Apple Silicon and NVIDIA GPUs. This paper attributes this gap to system-level factors such as page faults, power consumption, and kernel launch time. In addition, the performance difference of basic linear algebra subprograms (BLAS) on the NVIDIA GPUs and Apple Silicon chips is analyzed to further explain the observed gap.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In population genetics and other application fields, models with intractable likelihood are common. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) or more generally Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) methods work by simulating instrumental data sets from the models under study and comparing them with the observed data set, using advanced machine learning tools for tasks such as model selection and parameter inference. The present work focuses on model criticism, and more specifically on Goodness of fit (GoF) tests, for intractable likelihood models. We introduce two new GoF tests: the pre-inference \gof tests whether the observed dataset is distributed from the prior predictive distribution, while the post-inference GoF tests whether there is a parameter value such that the observed dataset is distributed from the likelihood with that value. The pre-inference test can be used to prune a large set of models using a limited amount of simulations, while the post-inference test is used to assess the fit of a selected model. Both tests are based on the Local Outlier Factor (LOF, Breunig et al., 2000). This indicator was initially defined for outlier and novelty detection. It is able to quantify local density deviations, capturing subtleties that a more traditional k-NN-based approach may miss. We evaluated the performance of our two GoF tests on simulated datasets from three different model settings of varying complexity. We then illustrate the utility of these approaches on a dataset of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for the evaluation of complex evolutionary scenarios of modern human populations. Our dual-test GoF approach highlights the flexibility of our method: the pre-inference \gof test provides insight into model validity from a Bayesian perspective, while the post-inference test provides a more general and traditional view of assessing goodness of fit

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated significant potential in the field of time series forecasting, offering impressive capabilities in handling complex temporal data. However, their robustness and reliability in real-world applications remain under-explored, particularly concerning their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce a targeted adversarial attack framework for LLM-based time series forecasting. By employing both gradient-free and black-box optimization methods, we generate minimal yet highly effective perturbations that significantly degrade the forecasting accuracy across multiple datasets and LLM architectures. Our experiments, which include models like TimeGPT and LLM-Time with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa, and Mistral, show that adversarial attacks lead to much more severe performance degradation than random noise, and demonstrate the broad effectiveness of our attacks across different LLMs. The results underscore the critical vulnerabilities of LLMs in time series forecasting, highlighting the need for robust defense mechanisms to ensure their reliable deployment in practical applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the involvement of multiple programming languages in modern software development, cross-lingual code clone detection has gained traction within the software engineering community. Numerous studies have explored this topic, proposing various promising approaches. Inspired by the significant advances in machine learning in recent years, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated their ability to tackle various tasks, this paper revisits cross-lingual code clone detection. We evaluate the performance of five (05) LLMs and eight prompts (08) for the identification of cross-lingual code clones. Additionally, we compare these results against two baseline methods. Finally, we evaluate a pre-trained embedding model to assess the effectiveness of the generated representations for classifying clone and non-clone pairs. The studies involving LLMs and Embedding models are evaluated using two widely used cross-lingual datasets, XLCoST and CodeNet. Our results show that LLMs can achieve high F1 scores, up to 0.99, for straightforward programming examples. However, they not only perform less well on programs associated with complex programming challenges but also do not necessarily understand the meaning of "code clones" in a cross-lingual setting. We show that embedding models used to represent code fragments from different programming languages in the same representation space enable the training of a basic classifier that outperforms all LLMs by ~1 and ~20 percentage points on the XLCoST and CodeNet datasets, respectively. This finding suggests that, despite the apparent capabilities of LLMs, embeddings provided by embedding models offer suitable representations to achieve state-of-the-art performance in cross-lingual code clone detection.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large pre-trained models have achieved outstanding results in sequence modeling. The Transformer block and its attention mechanism have been the main drivers of the success of these models. Recently, alternative architectures, such as Selective Structured State Space Models (SSMs), have been proposed to address the inefficiencies of Transformers. This paper explores the compression of SSM-based models, particularly Mamba and its hybrids. We study the sensitivity of these models to the removal of selected components at different granularities to reduce the model size and computational overhead, thus improving their efficiency while maintaining accuracy. The proposed solutions, collectively referred to as Mamba-Shedder, achieve a speedup of up to 1.4x during inference, demonstrating that model efficiency can be improved by eliminating several redundancies with minimal impact on the overall model performance. The code is available at https://github.com/IntelLabs/Hardware-Aware-Automated-Machine-Learning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) excel in many natural language tasks, yet they struggle with complex mathemat-ical problem-solving, particularly in symbolic reasoning and maintaining consistent output. This study evalu-ates 10 LLMs with 7 to 8 billion parameters using 945 competition-level problems from the MATH dataset. The focus is on their ability to generate executable Python code as a step in their reasoning process, involving over 9,450 code executions. The research introduces an evaluation framework using mistral-large-2411 to rate answers on a 5-point scale, which helps address inconsistencies in mathematical notation. It also examines the impact of regenerating output token-by-token on refining results. The findings reveal a significant 34.5% per-formance gap between the top commercial model (gpt-4o-mini, scoring 83.7%) and the least effective open-source model (open-codestral-mamba:v0.1, scoring 49.2%). This disparity is especially noticeable in complex areas like Number Theory. While token-by-token regeneration slightly improved accuracy (+0.8%) for the model llama3.1:8b, it also reduced code execution time by 36.7%, highlighting a trade-off between efficiency and precision. The study also noted a consistent trend where harder problems correlated with lower accuracy across all models. Despite using controlled execution environments, less than 1% of the generated code was unsafe, and 3.17% of problems remained unsolved after 10 attempts, suggesting that hybrid reasoning methods may be beneficial.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, the advent of foundation models (FM) for digital pathology has relied heavily on scaling the pre-training datasets and the model size, yielding large and powerful models. While it resulted in improving the performance on diverse downstream tasks, it also introduced increased computational cost and inference time. In this work, we explore the distillation of a large foundation model into a smaller one, reducing the number of parameters by several orders of magnitude. Leveraging distillation techniques, our distilled model, H0-mini, achieves nearly comparable performance to large FMs at a significantly reduced inference cost. It is evaluated on several public benchmarks, achieving 3rd place on the HEST benchmark and 5th place on the EVA benchmark. Additionally, a robustness analysis conducted on the PLISM dataset demonstrates that our distilled model reaches excellent robustness to variations in staining and scanning conditions, significantly outperforming other state-of-the art models. This opens new perspectives to design lightweight and robust models for digital pathology, without compromising on performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce a Graph Transformer framework that serves as a general inverse physics engine on meshes, demonstrated through the challenging task of reconstructing aerodynamic flow fields from sparse surface measurements. While deep learning has shown promising results in forward physics simulation, inverse problems remain particularly challenging due to their ill-posed nature and the difficulty of propagating information from limited boundary observations. Our approach addresses these challenges by combining the geometric expressiveness of message-passing neural networks with the global reasoning of Transformers, enabling efficient learning of inverse mappings from boundary conditions to complete states. We evaluate this framework on a comprehensive dataset of steady-state RANS simulations around diverse airfoil geometries, where the task is to reconstruct full pressure and velocity fields from surface pressure measurements alone. The architecture achieves high reconstruction accuracy while maintaining fast inference times. We conduct experiments and provide insights into the relative importance of local geometric processing and global attention mechanisms in mesh-based inverse problems. We also find that the framework is robust to reduced sensor coverage. These results suggest that Graph Transformers can serve as effective inverse physics engines across a broader range of applications where complete system states must be reconstructed from limited boundary observations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Interpretability in reinforcement learning is crucial for ensuring AI systems align with human values and fulfill the diverse related requirements including safety, robustness and fairness. Building on recent approaches to encouraging sparsity and locality in neural networks, we demonstrate how the penalisation of non-local weights leads to the emergence of functionally independent modules in the policy network of a reinforcement learning agent. To illustrate this, we demonstrate the emergence of two parallel modules for assessment of movement along the X and Y axes in a stochastic Minigrid environment. Through the novel application of community detection algorithms, we show how these modules can be automatically identified and their functional roles verified through direct intervention on the network weights prior to inference. This establishes a scalable framework for reinforcement learning interpretability through functional modularity, addressing challenges regarding the trade-off between completeness and cognitive tractability of reinforcement learning explanations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent progress in manipulating individual quantum systems enables the exploration of resources of quantum origin in engines. One of the main remaining challenges consists in directly measuring the work extracted from such quantum engines. Here we probe the work extracted from a transmon superconducting qubit acting as a working medium. The engine is fueled by performing quantum measurements of an observable which does not commute with the bare qubit Hamiltonian. Using feedback, the engine acts as a quantum Maxwell demon working without a hot thermal source. In our implementation, the qubit working medium amplifies a coherent microwave field from which work is extracted. The latter is not only inferred from tomographic measurements of the qubit state but also directly monitored via heterodyne detection of the field quadratures. We demonstrate the long-term stability of the engine as well as its robustness to transmon decoherence, losses and drifts. To emphasize the role of feedback, we also study the breakdown of the engine in the open-loop configuration.

In this paper, we discuss three complementary Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches for triggering the creativity of app designers and inspiring them create better and more diverse UI designs. First, designers can prompt a Large Language Model (LLM) to directly generate and adjust UIs. Second, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) enables designers to effectively search a large screenshot dataset, e.g. from apps published in app stores. Third, a Diffusion Model (DM) can be trained to specifically generate UIs as inspirational images. We present an AI-inspired design process and discuss the implications and limitations of the approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Users can divulge sensitive information to proprietary LLM providers, raising significant privacy concerns. While open-source models, hosted locally on the user's machine, alleviate some concerns, models that users can host locally are often less capable than proprietary frontier models. Toward preserving user privacy while retaining the best quality, we propose Privacy-Conscious Delegation, a novel task for chaining API-based and local models. We utilize recent public collections of user-LLM interactions to construct a natural benchmark called PUPA, which contains personally identifiable information (PII). To study potential approaches, we devise PAPILLON, a multi-stage LLM pipeline that uses prompt optimization to address a simpler version of our task. Our best pipeline maintains high response quality for 85.5% of user queries while restricting privacy leakage to only 7.5%. We still leave a large margin to the generation quality of proprietary LLMs for future work. Our data and code will be available at https://github.com/siyan-sylvia-li/PAPILLON.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose a novel test procedure for comparing mean functions across two groups within the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) framework. Our proposed method is adept at handling sparsely and irregularly sampled functional data when observation times are random for each subject. Conventional approaches, which are built upon functional principal components analysis, usually assume a homogeneous covariance structure across groups. Nonetheless, justifying this assumption in real-world scenarios can be challenging. To eliminate the need for a homogeneous covariance structure, we first develop a linear approximation for the mean estimator under the RKHS framework; this approximation is a sum of i.i.d. random elements, which naturally leads to the desirable pointwise limiting distributions. Moreover, we establish weak convergence for the mean estimator, allowing us to construct a test statistic for the mean difference. Our method is easily implementable and outperforms some conventional tests in controlling type I errors across various settings. We demonstrate the finite sample performance of our approach through extensive simulations and two real-world applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various reasoning tasks but face significant challenges with complex, knowledge-intensive multi-hop queries, particularly those involving new or long-tail knowledge. Existing benchmarks often fail to fully address these challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce MINTQA (Multi-hop Question Answering on New and Tail Knowledge), a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in multi-hop reasoning across four critical dimensions: question handling strategy, sub-question generation, retrieval-augmented generation, and iterative or dynamic decomposition and retrieval. MINTQA comprises 10,479 question-answer pairs for evaluating new knowledge and 17,887 pairs for assessing long-tail knowledge, with each question equipped with corresponding sub-questions and answers. Our systematic evaluation of 22 state-of-the-art LLMs on MINTQA reveals significant limitations in their ability to handle complex knowledge base queries, particularly in handling new or unpopular knowledge. Our findings highlight critical challenges and offer insights for advancing multi-hop reasoning capabilities. The MINTQA benchmark is available at https://github.com/probe2/multi-hop/.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We investigate a family of gradient flows of positive and probability measures, focusing on the Hellinger-Kantorovich (HK) geometry, which unifies transport mechanism of Otto-Wasserstein, and the birth-death mechanism of Hellinger (or Fisher-Rao). A central contribution is a complete characterization of global exponential decay behaviors of entropy functionals (e.g. KL, $\chi^2$) under Otto-Wasserstein and Hellinger-type gradient flows. In particular, for the more challenging analysis of HK gradient flows on positive measures -- where the typical log-Sobolev arguments fail -- we develop a specialized shape-mass decomposition that enables new analysis results. Our approach also leverages the (Polyak-)\L{}ojasiewicz-type functional inequalities and a careful extension of classical dissipation estimates. These findings provide a unified and complete theoretical framework for gradient flows and underpin applications in computational algorithms for statistical inference, optimization, and machine learning.

We first build a dataset of abstract procedural building models paired with simulated point clouds and then learn the inverse mapping through a transformer. Given a point cloud, the trained transformer then infers the corresponding abstracted building in terms of a programmatic language description. This approach leverages expressive procedural models developed for gaming and animation, and thereby retains desirable properties such as efficient rendering of the inferred abstractions and strong priors for regularity and symmetry. Our approach achieves good reconstruction accuracy in terms of geometry and structure, as well as structurally consistent inpainting.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional power in various domains, including information retrieval. Most of the previous practices involve leveraging these models to create a single embedding for each query, each passage, or each document individually, a strategy exemplified and used by the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. While this method has proven effective, we argue that it falls short in fully capturing the nuanced intricacies of document-level texts due to its reliance on a relatively coarse-grained representation. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel, fine-grained approach aimed at enhancing the accuracy of relevance scoring for long documents. Our methodology firstly segments a long document into blocks, each of which is embedded using an LLM, for matching with the query representation. When calculating the relevance score, we aggregate the query-block relevance scores through a weighted sum method, yielding a comprehensive score for the query with the entire document. Despite its apparent simplicity, our experimental findings reveal that this approach outperforms standard representation methods and achieves a significant reduction in embedding generation latency. Moreover, by carefully optimizing pairwise loss functions, superior performances have been achieved.

However, ensuring harmlessness in these systems remains a critical challenge, particularly in advanced models like DeepSeek-R1. This paper examines the limitations of Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the primary approach for reducing harmful outputs in DeepSeek-R1 and compares it with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). While RL improves reasoning capabilities, it faces challenges such as reward hacking, generalization failures, language mixing, and high computational costs. We propose hybrid training approaches combining RL and SFT to achieve robust harmlessness reduction. Usage recommendations and future directions for deploying DeepSeek-R1 responsibly are also presented.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the Python ecosystem, the adoption of idiomatic constructs has been fostered because of their expressiveness, increasing productivity and even efficiency, despite controversial arguments concerning familiarity or understandability issues. Recent research contributions have proposed approaches -- based on static code analysis and transformation -- to automatically identify and enact refactoring opportunities of non-idiomatic code into idiomatic ones. Given the potential recently offered by Large Language Models (LLMs) for code-related tasks, in this paper, we present the results of a replication study in which we investigate GPT-4 effectiveness in recommending and suggesting idiomatic refactoring actions. Our results reveal that GPT-4 not only identifies idiomatic constructs effectively but frequently exceeds the benchmark in proposing refactoring actions where the existing baseline failed. A manual analysis of a random sample shows the correctness of the obtained recommendations. Our findings underscore the potential of LLMs to achieve tasks where, in the past, implementing recommenders based on complex code analyses was required.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) are pivotal in revolutionizing customer support and operations by integrating multiple modalities such as text, images, and audio. Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) is a recently proposed approach that combines pre-trained multimodal LLMs such as vision-language models with federated learning to create personalized, privacy-preserving AI systems. However, balancing the competing goals of personalization, generalization, and privacy remains a significant challenge. Over-personalization can lead to overfitting, reducing generalizability, while stringent privacy measures, such as differential privacy, can hinder both personalization and generalization. In this paper, we propose a Differentially Private Federated Prompt Learning (DP-FPL) approach to tackle this challenge by leveraging a low-rank adaptation scheme to capture generalization while maintaining a residual term that preserves expressiveness for personalization. To ensure privacy, we introduce a novel method where we apply local differential privacy to the two low-rank components of the local prompt, and global differential privacy to the global prompt. Our approach mitigates the impact of privacy noise on the model performance while balancing the tradeoff between personalization and generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over other benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as coding assistants, capable of generating source code from natural language prompts. With the increasing adoption of LLMs in software development, academic research and industry based projects are developing various tools, benchmarks, and metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-generated code. However, there is a lack of solutions evaluated through empirically grounded methods that incorporate practitioners perspectives to assess functionality, syntax, and accuracy in real world applications. To address this gap, we propose and develop a multi-model unified platform to generate and execute code based on natural language prompts. We conducted a survey with 60 software practitioners from 11 countries across four continents working in diverse professional roles and domains to evaluate the usability, performance, strengths, and limitations of each model. The results present practitioners feedback and insights into the use of LLMs in software development, including their strengths and weaknesses, key aspects overlooked by benchmarks and metrics, and a broader understanding of their practical applicability. These findings can help researchers and practitioners make informed decisions for systematically selecting and using LLMs in software development projects. Future research will focus on integrating more diverse models into the proposed system, incorporating additional case studies, and conducting developer interviews for deeper empirical insights into LLM-driven software development.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Rendering and inverse rendering are pivotal tasks in both computer vision and graphics. The rendering equation is the core of the two tasks, as an ideal conditional distribution transfer function from intrinsic properties to RGB images. Despite achieving promising results of existing rendering methods, they merely approximate the ideal estimation for a specific scene and come with a high computational cost. Additionally, the inverse conditional distribution transfer is intractable due to the inherent ambiguity. To address these challenges, we propose a data-driven method that jointly models rendering and inverse rendering as two conditional generation tasks within a single diffusion framework. Inspired by UniDiffuser, we utilize two distinct time schedules to model both tasks, and with a tailored dual streaming module, we achieve cross-conditioning of two pre-trained diffusion models. This unified approach, named Uni-Renderer, allows the two processes to facilitate each other through a cycle-consistent constrain, mitigating ambiguity by enforcing consistency between intrinsic properties and rendered images. Combined with a meticulously prepared dataset, our method effectively decomposition of intrinsic properties and demonstrates a strong capability to recognize changes during rendering. We will open-source our training and inference code to the public, fostering further research and development in this area.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRAG or Graph RAG) architectures aim to enhance language understanding and generation by leveraging external knowledge. However, effectively capturing and integrating the rich semantic information present in textual and structured data remains a challenge. To address this, a novel GRAG framework, Dynamic Graph Retrieval-Agumented Generation (DynaGRAG), is proposed to focus on enhancing subgraph representation and diversity within the knowledge graph. By improving graph density, capturing entity and relation information more effectively, and dynamically prioritizing relevant and diverse subgraphs and information within them, the proposed approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying semantic structure. This is achieved through a combination of de-duplication processes, two-step mean pooling of embeddings, query-aware retrieval considering unique nodes, and a Dynamic Similarity-Aware BFS (DSA-BFS) traversal algorithm. Integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) through hard prompting further enhances the learning of rich node and edge representations while preserving the hierarchical subgraph structure. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaGRAG, showcasing the significance of enhanced subgraph representation and diversity for improved language understanding and generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Tokenization is a fundamental component of large language models (LLMs), yet its influence on model scaling and performance is not fully explored. In this paper, we introduce Over-Tokenized Transformers, a novel framework that decouples input and output vocabularies to improve language modeling performance. Specifically, our approach scales up input vocabularies to leverage multi-gram tokens. Through extensive experiments, we uncover a log-linear relationship between input vocabulary size and training loss, demonstrating that larger input vocabularies consistently enhance model performance, regardless of model size. Using a large input vocabulary, we achieve performance comparable to double-sized baselines with no additional cost. Our findings highlight the importance of tokenization in scaling laws and provide practical insight for tokenizer design, paving the way for more efficient and powerful LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Test-time scaling, which is also often referred to as slow-thinking, has been demonstrated to enhance multi-step reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, despite its widespread utilization, the mechanisms underlying slow-thinking methods remain poorly understood. This paper explores the mechanisms of external slow-thinking from a theoretical standpoint. We begin by examining the snowball error effect within the LLM reasoning process and connect it to the likelihood of correct reasoning using information theory. Building on this, we show that external slow-thinking methods can be interpreted as strategies to mitigate the error probability. We further provide a comparative analysis of popular external slow-thinking approaches, ranging from simple to complex, highlighting their differences and interrelationships. Our findings suggest that the efficacy of these methods is not primarily determined by the specific framework employed, and that expanding the search scope or the model's internal reasoning capacity may yield more sustained improvements in the long term.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Stellar evolution modelling is fundamental to many areas of astrophysics including stellar populations in both nearby and distant galaxies. It is heavily influenced by chemical composition. Observations of distant galaxies and nucleosynthesis calculations show that $\alpha$-process elements are enriched faster than iron group elements. We present a dense grid of single-star models calculated using the BPASS stellar evolution code and covering masses ($0.1\le\mathrm{M/M}_\odot\le316$), metallicity mass fractions ($10^{-5} \le Z \le 0.04$) and $\alpha$-to-iron abundance ratios ($-0.2\le[\alpha/\mathrm{Fe}]\le+0.6$). By comparing Solar-scaled models to ones enriched in $\alpha$-process elements, we find that stellar radii, surface temperatures, Main Sequence lifetimes, supernova progenitor properties and supernova rates are all sensitive to changes in [$\alpha$/Fe]. Lifetimes of low-mass stars differ by up to 0.4 dex, while surface temperatures of massive stars at the end of the Main Sequence also differ by around 0.4 dex. Inferred supernova rates when [Fe/H] is unknown can be highly uncertain. Models with different [$\alpha$/Fe] but comparable iron abundances show smaller variations, indicating that while iron primarily defines the course of evolution; $\alpha$-enhancement nonetheless has an impact of up to 0.1 dex on stellar properties. Such changes are small for individual stars, but have a large cumulative effect when considering an entire stellar population as demonstrated by isochrone fitting to nearby clusters. Changes in radii and lifetimes have further consequences for a stellar population including binary stars, as they influence the timing, nature and occurrence rate of mass transfer events.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model powered by a large language model (LLM) provides a faster and more cost-effective solution for adapting to new data and knowledge. It also delivers more specialized responses compared to pre-trained LLMs. However, most existing approaches rely on retrieving prefix-sized chunks as references to support question-answering (Q/A). This approach is often deployed to address information needs at a single level of abstraction, as it struggles to generate answers across multiple levels of abstraction. In an RAG setting, while LLMs can summarize and answer questions effectively when provided with sufficient details, retrieving excessive information often leads to the 'lost in the middle' problem and exceeds token limitations. We propose a novel RAG approach that uses chunks of multiple abstraction levels (MAL), including multi-sentence-level, paragraph-level, section-level, and document-level. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in an under-explored scientific domain of Glycoscience. Compared to traditional single-level RAG approaches, our approach improves AI evaluated answer correctness of Q/A by 25.739\% on Glyco-related papers.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LLM-based tool agents offer natural language interfaces, enabling users to seamlessly interact with computing services. While REST APIs are valuable resources for building such agents, they must first be transformed into AI-compatible tools. Automatically generating AI-compatible tools from REST API documents can greatly streamline tool agent development and minimize user learning curves. However, API documentation often suffers from a lack of standardization, inconsistent schemas, and incomplete information. To address these issues, we developed \textbf{ToolFactory}, an open-source pipeline for automating tool generation from unstructured API documents. To enhance the reliability of the developed tools, we implemented an evaluation method to diagnose errors. Furthermore, we built a knowledge base of verified tools, which we leveraged to infer missing information from poorly documented APIs. We developed the API Extraction Benchmark, comprising 167 API documents and 744 endpoints in various formats, and designed a JSON schema to annotate them. This annotated dataset was utilized to train and validate ToolFactory. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of ToolFactory. We also demonstrated ToolFactory by creating a domain-specific AI agent for glycomaterials research. ToolFactory exhibits significant potential for facilitating the seamless integration of scientific REST APIs into AI workflows.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Local climate information is crucial for impact assessment and decision-making, yet coarse global climate simulations cannot capture small-scale phenomena. Current statistical downscaling methods infer these phenomena as temporally decoupled spatial patches. However, to preserve physical properties, estimating spatio-temporally coherent high-resolution weather dynamics for multiple variables across long time horizons is crucial. We present a novel generative framework that uses a score-based diffusion model trained on high-resolution reanalysis data to capture the statistical properties of local weather dynamics. After training, we condition on coarse climate model data to generate weather patterns consistent with the aggregate information. As this predictive task is inherently uncertain, we leverage the probabilistic nature of diffusion models and sample multiple trajectories. We evaluate our approach with high-resolution reanalysis information before applying it to the climate model downscaling task. We then demonstrate that the model generates spatially and temporally coherent weather dynamics that align with global climate output.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Materials discovery and development are critical for addressing global challenges. Yet, the exponential growth in materials science literature comprising vast amounts of textual data has created significant bottlenecks in knowledge extraction, synthesis, and scientific reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to accelerate materials research through automated analysis and prediction. Still, their effective deployment requires domain-specific adaptation for understanding and solving domain-relevant tasks. Here, we present LLaMat, a family of foundational models for materials science developed through continued pretraining of LLaMA models on an extensive corpus of materials literature and crystallographic data. Through systematic evaluation, we demonstrate that LLaMat excels in materials-specific NLP and structured information extraction while maintaining general linguistic capabilities. The specialized LLaMat-CIF variant demonstrates unprecedented capabilities in crystal structure generation, predicting stable crystals with high coverage across the periodic table. Intriguingly, despite LLaMA-3's superior performance in comparison to LLaMA-2, we observe that LLaMat-2 demonstrates unexpectedly enhanced domain-specific performance across diverse materials science tasks, including structured information extraction from text and tables, more particularly in crystal structure generation, a potential adaptation rigidity in overtrained LLMs. Altogether, the present work demonstrates the effectiveness of domain adaptation towards developing practically deployable LLM copilots for materials research. Beyond materials science, our findings reveal important considerations for domain adaptation of LLMs, such as model selection, training methodology, and domain-specific performance, which may influence the development of specialized scientific AI systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantifying the speed of linguistic change is challenging due to the fact that the historical evolution of languages is sparsely documented. Consequently, traditional methods rely on phylogenetic reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach to the problem through the analysis of language change as a stochastic process combining vertical descent, spatial interactions, and mutations in both dimensions. A notion of linguistic temperature emerges naturally from this analysis as a dimensionless measure of the propensity of a linguistic feature to undergo change. We demonstrate how temperatures of linguistic features can be inferred from their present-day geospatial distributions, without recourse to information about their phylogenies. Thus the evolutionary dynamics of language, operating across thousands of years, leaves a measurable geospatial signature. This signature licenses inferences about the historical evolution of languages even in the absence of longitudinal data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The study of adversarial defense still struggles to combat with advanced adversarial attacks. In contrast to most prior studies that rely on the diffusion model for test-time defense to remarkably increase the inference time, we propose Masked AutoEncoder Purifier (MAEP), which integrates Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) into an adversarial purifier framework for test-time purification. While MAEP achieves promising adversarial robustness, it particularly features model defense transferability and attack generalization without relying on using additional data that is different from the training dataset. To our knowledge, MAEP is the first study of adversarial purifier based on MAE. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can not only maintain clear accuracy with only a slight drop but also exhibit a close gap between the clean and robust accuracy. Notably, MAEP trained on CIFAR10 achieves state-of-the-art performance even when tested directly on ImageNet, outperforming existing diffusion-based models trained specifically on ImageNet.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) represent a significant advancement in integrating physical robots with AI-driven systems. We showcase the capabilities of our framework within the context of the real-world household competition. This research introduces a framework that utilizes RDMM (Robotics Decision-Making Models), which possess the capacity for decision-making within domain-specific contexts, as well as an awareness of their personal knowledge and capabilities. The framework leverages information to enhance the autonomous decision-making of the system. In contrast to other approaches, our focus is on real-time, on-device solutions, successfully operating on hardware with as little as 8GB of memory. Our framework incorporates visual perception models equipping robots with understanding of their environment. Additionally, the framework has integrated real-time speech recognition capabilities, thus enhancing the human-robot interaction experience. Experimental results demonstrate that the RDMM framework can plan with an 93\% accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce a new dataset consisting of 27k planning instances, as well as 1.3k text-image annotated samples derived from the competition. The framework, benchmarks, datasets, and models developed in this work are publicly available on our GitHub repository at https://github.com/shadynasrat/RDMM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Irony is a powerful figurative language (FL) on social media that can potentially mislead various NLP tasks, such as recommendation systems, misinformation checks, and sentiment analysis. Understanding the implicit meaning of this kind of subtle language is essential to mitigate irony's negative impact on NLP tasks. However, building models to understand irony presents a unique set of challenges, because irony is a complex form of language that often relies on context, tone, and subtle cues to convey meaning that is opposite or different from the literal interpretation. Large language models, such as ChatGPT, are increasingly able to capture implicit and contextual information. In this study, we investigate the generalization, reasoning and understanding ability of ChatGPT on irony detection across six different genre irony detection datasets. Our findings suggest that ChatGPT appears to show an enhanced language understanding and reasoning ability. But it needs to be very careful in prompt engineering design. Thus, we propose a prompt engineering design framework IDADP to achieve higher irony detection accuracy, improved understanding of irony, and more effective explanations compared to other state-of-the-art ChatGPT zero-shot approaches. And ascertain via experiments that the practice generated under the framework is likely to be the promised solution to resolve the generalization issues of LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While large language models (LLMs) have rapidly improved their performance on a broad number of tasks, they still often fall short on reasoning tasks. As LLMs become more integrated in diverse real-world tasks, advancing their reasoning capabilities is crucial to their effectiveness in nuanced, complex problems. Wang et al.'s self-consistency framework reveals that sampling multiple rationales before taking a majority vote reliably improves model performance across various closed-answer reasoning tasks. Standard methods based on this framework aggregate the final decisions of these rationales but fail to utilize the semantic information detailed in the step-by-step reasoning paths. Our work introduces semantic self-consistency, enhancing this approach by incorporating and analyzing both the reasoning paths of these rationales in addition to their final decisions before taking a majority vote. These methods not only improve the reliability of reasoning paths but also cause more robust performance on complex reasoning tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Science journalism reports current scientific discoveries to non-specialists, aiming to enable public comprehension of the state of the art. This task is challenging as the audience often lacks specific knowledge about the presented research. We propose a JRE-L framework that integrates three LLMs mimicking the writing-reading-feedback-revision loop. In JRE-L, one LLM acts as the journalist, another LLM as the general public reader, and the third LLM as an editor. The journalist's writing is iteratively refined by feedback from the reader and suggestions from the editor. Our experiments demonstrate that by leveraging the collaboration of two 7B and one 1.8B open-source LLMs, we can generate articles that are more accessible than those generated by existing methods, including prompting single advanced models such as GPT-4 and other LLM-collaboration strategies. Our code is publicly available at github.com/Zzoay/JRE-L.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Much is promised in relation to AI-supported software development. However, there has been limited evaluation effort in the research domain aimed at validating the true utility of such techniques, especially when compared to human coding outputs. We bridge this gap, where a benchmark dataset comprising 72 distinct software engineering tasks is used to compare the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) and human programmers in producing Python software code. GPT-4 is used as a representative LLM, where for the code generated by humans and this LLM, we evaluate code quality and adherence to Python coding standards, code security and vulnerabilities, code complexity and functional correctness. We use various static analysis benchmarks, including Pylint, Radon, Bandit and test cases. Among the notable outcomes, results show that human-generated code recorded higher ratings for adhering to coding standards than GPT-4. We observe security flaws in code generated by both humans and GPT-4, however, code generated by humans shows a greater variety of problems, but GPT-4 code included more severe outliers. Our results show that although GPT-4 is capable of producing coding solutions, it frequently produces more complex code that may need more reworking to ensure maintainability. On the contrary however, our outcomes show that a higher number of test cases passed for code generated by GPT-4 across a range of tasks than code that was generated by humans. That said, GPT-4 frequently struggles with complex problem-solving that involve in-depth domain knowledge. This study highlights the potential utility of LLMs for supporting software development, however, tasks requiring comprehensive, innovative or unconventional solutions, and careful debugging and error correction seem to be better developed by human programmers. We plot an agenda for the software engineering community.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we propose VideoLLaMA3, a more advanced multimodal foundation model for image and video understanding. The core design philosophy of VideoLLaMA3 is vision-centric. The meaning of "vision-centric" is two-fold: the vision-centric training paradigm and vision-centric framework design. The key insight of our vision-centric training paradigm is that high-quality image-text data is crucial for both image and video understanding. Instead of preparing massive video-text datasets, we focus on constructing large-scale and high-quality image-text datasets. VideoLLaMA3 has four training stages: 1) Vision Encoder Adaptation, which enables vision encoder to accept images of variable resolutions as input; 2) Vision-Language Alignment, which jointly tunes the vision encoder, projector, and LLM with large-scale image-text data covering multiple types (including scene images, documents, charts) as well as text-only data. 3) Multi-task Fine-tuning, which incorporates image-text SFT data for downstream tasks and video-text data to establish a foundation for video understanding. 4) Video-centric Fine-tuning, which further improves the model's capability in video understanding. As for the framework design, to better capture fine-grained details in images, the pretrained vision encoder is adapted to encode images of varying sizes into vision tokens with corresponding numbers, rather than a fixed number of tokens. For video inputs, we reduce the number of vision tokens according to their similarity so that the representation of videos will be more precise and compact. Benefit from vision-centric designs, VideoLLaMA3 achieves compelling performances in both image and video understanding benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Measuring the growth rate of large-scale structures ($f$) as a function of redshift has the potential to break degeneracies between modified gravity and dark energy models, when combined with expansion-rate probes. Direct estimates of peculiar velocities of galaxies have gained interest to estimate $f\sigma_8$. In particular, field-level methods can be used to fit the field nuisance parameter along with cosmological parameters simultaneously. This article aims to provide the community with an unified framework for the theoretical modeling of the likelihood-based field-level inference by performing fast field covariance calculations for velocity and density fields. Our purpose is to lay the foundations for non-linear extension of the likelihood-based method at the field level. We develop a generalized framework, implemented in the dedicated software flip to perform a likelihood-based inference of $f\sigma_8$. We derive a new field covariance model, which includes wide-angle corrections. We also include the models previously described in the literature inside our framework. We compare their performance against ours, we validate our model by comparing it with the two-point statistics of a recent N-body simulation. The tests we perform allow us to validate our software and determine the appropriate wavenumber range to integrate our covariance model and its validity in terms of separation. Our framework allows for a wider wavenumber coverage used in our calculations than previous works, which is particularly interesting for non-linear model extensions. Finally, our generalized framework allows us to efficiently perform a survey geometry-dependent Fisher forecast of the $f\sigma_8$ parameter. We show that the Fisher forecast method we developed gives an error bar that is 30 % closer to a full likelihood-based estimation than a standard volume Fisher forecast.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Network fault diagnosis is a core challenge in ensuring the stability and reliability of modern network operations. Traditional approaches, limited by their training on specific performance metrics for predefined scenarios, struggle to generalize across diverse faults and anomalies in varying network environments. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across various domains. Building on this success, we propose NetSemantic, a plug-and-play intelligent network fault diagnosis framework based on LLMs. NetSemantic transforms multimodal network information into unified textual representations, enabling LLMs to perform reasoning and generate efficient fault resolutions and health assessment reports. To further enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we introduce a novel symbolic representation method that transforms logically strong network information into symbols. Additionally, we propose a self-adaptive data updating mechanism that dynamically incorporates network information into a knowledge graph to ensure the validity and timeliness of the knowledge base. Experimental results demonstrate that NetSemantic excels in network fault diagnosis across various complex scenarios, significantly improving diagnostic accuracy and reliability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this study, we investigate the impact of dark matter (DM) on neutron stars (NSs) using a two-fluid formalism that treats nuclear matter (NM) and DM as gravitationally coupled components. Employing NM equations of state spanning a wide range of stiffness and a self-interacting asymmetric fermionic DM framework, we explore the emergence of DM core- and halo-dominated structures and their observational implications. Constraints from gravitational waves (GW170817), NICER X-ray measurements (PSR J0030+0451), and pulsar mass limits (PSR J0740+6620) delineate a consistent parameter space for DM properties derived from these multi-messenger observations. DM halo-dominated configurations, while consistent with PSR J0740+6620's mass limits and NICER's radius measurements for PSR J0030+0451, are ruled out by the tidal deformability bounds inferred from the GW170817 event. Consequently, the combined limits inferred from the observational data of GW170817, PSR J0030+0451, and PSR J0740+6620 support the plausibility of DM core-dominated configurations. Constraints on the DM self-interaction strength from galaxy cluster dynamics further refine the DM parameter space permitted by NS observations. This work bridges multi-messenger astrophysics and cosmology, providing insights into DM interactions and their implications for NS structure, evolution, and observational signatures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Enterprise level data is often distributed across multiple sources and identifying the correct set-of data-sources with relevant information for a knowledge request is a fundamental challenge. In this work, we define the novel task of routing an end-user query to the appropriate data-source, where the data-sources are databases. We synthesize datasets by extending existing datasets designed for NL-to-SQL semantic parsing. We create baselines on these datasets by using open-source LLMs, using both pre-trained and task specific embeddings fine-tuned using the training data. With these baselines we demonstrate that open-source LLMs perform better than embedding based approach, but suffer from token length limitations. Embedding based approaches benefit from task specific fine-tuning, more so when there is availability of data in terms of database specific questions for training. We further find that the task becomes more difficult (i) with an increase in the number of data-sources, (ii) having data-sources closer in terms of their domains,(iii) having databases without external domain knowledge required to interpret its entities and (iv) with ambiguous and complex queries requiring more fine-grained understanding of the data-sources or logical reasoning for routing to an appropriate source. This calls for the need for developing more sophisticated solutions to better address the task.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformers have emerged as the dominant architecture in the field of deep learning, with a broad range of applications and remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. While not yet fully understood, ICL has already proved to be an intriguing phenomenon, allowing transformers to learn in context -- without requiring further training. In this paper, we further advance the understanding of ICL by demonstrating that transformers can perform full Bayesian inference for commonly used statistical models in context. More specifically, we introduce a general framework that builds on ideas from prior fitted networks and continuous normalizing flows which enables us to infer complex posterior distributions for methods such as generalized linear models and latent factor models. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our ICL approach yields posterior samples that are similar in quality to state-of-the-art MCMC or variational inference methods not operating in context.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present an improved method for vetoing candidates of continuous gravitational-wave sources during all-sky searches utilizing the Frequency Hough pipeline. This approach leverages linear correlations between source parameters induced by the Earth Doppler effect, which can be effectively identified through the Hough Transform. Candidates that do not align with these patterns are considered spurious and can thus be vetoed, enhancing the depth and statistical significance of follow-up analyses. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive explanation of the method calibration, which intrinsically linked to the total duration of the observing run. On average, the procedure successfully vetoes $56\%$ of candidates. To assess the method performance, we conducted a Monte-Carlo simulation injecting fake continuous-wave signals into data from the third observing run of the LIGO detectors. This analysis allowed us to infer strain amplitude upper limits at a $90\%$ confidence level. We found that the optimal sensitivity is $h_0^{90\%} = 3.62^{+0.23}_{-0.22}\times 10^{-26}$ in the [128, 200] Hz band, which is within the most sensible frequency band of the LIGO detectors.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Translating Natural Language Queries into Structured Query Language (Text-to-SQL or NLQ-to-SQL) is a critical task extensively studied by both the natural language processing and database communities, aimed at providing a natural language interface to databases (NLIDB) and lowering the barrier for non-experts. Despite recent advancements made through the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), significant challenges remain. These include handling complex database schemas, resolving ambiguity in user queries, and generating SQL queries with intricate structures that accurately reflect the user's intent. In this work, we introduce E-SQL, a novel pipeline specifically designed to address these challenges through direct schema linking and candidate predicate augmentation. E-SQL enhances the natural language query by incorporating relevant database items (i.e., tables, columns, and values) and conditions directly into the question and SQL construction plan, bridging the gap between the query and the database structure. The pipeline leverages candidate predicate augmentation to mitigate erroneous or incomplete predicates in generated SQLs. Comprehensive evaluations on the BIRD benchmark illustrate that E-SQL achieves competitive performance, particularly excelling in complex queries with a 66.29% execution accuracy on the test set. A further observation from our experiments reveals that incorporating schema filtering into the translation pipeline does not have a positive impact on performance when the most advanced proprietary LLMs are used. Additionally, our experiments with small LLMs highlight the importance and positive impact of enriched questions on their performance. Without fine-tuning, single-prompt SQL generation using enriched questions with DeepSeek Coder 7B Instruct 1.5v achieves 56.45% execution accuracy on the BIRD development set.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Although many efforts have been made, it is still a challenge to balance the training budget, downstream performance, and the general capabilities of the LLMs in many applications. Training the whole model for downstream tasks is expensive, and could easily result in catastrophic forgetting. By introducing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), the training cost could be reduced, but it still suffers from forgetting, and limits the learning on the downstream tasks. To efficiently fine-tune the LLMs with less limitation to their downstream performance while mitigating the forgetting of general capabilities, we propose a novel mixture of expert (MoE) framework based on Soft LoRA and Identity Mixture (SLIM), that allows dynamic routing between LoRA adapters and skipping connection, enables the suppression of forgetting. We adopt weight-yielding with sliding clustering for better out-of-domain distinguish to enhance the routing. We also propose to convert the mixture of low-rank adapters to the model merging formulation and introduce fast dynamic merging of LoRA adapters to keep the general capabilities of the base model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SLIM is comparable to the state-of-the-art PEFT approaches on the downstream tasks while achieving the leading performance in mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we claim that spatial understanding is the keypoint in robot manipulation, and propose SpatialVLA to explore effective spatial representations for the robot foundation model. Specifically, we introduce Ego3D Position Encoding to inject 3D information into the input observations of the visual-language-action model, and propose Adaptive Action Grids to represent spatial robot movement actions with adaptive discretized action grids, facilitating learning generalizable and transferrable spatial action knowledge for cross-robot control. SpatialVLA is first pre-trained on top of a vision-language model with 1.1 Million real-world robot episodes, to learn a generalist manipulation policy across multiple robot environments and tasks. After pre-training, SpatialVLA is directly applied to perform numerous tasks in a zero-shot manner. The superior results in both simulation and real-world robots demonstrate its advantage of inferring complex robot motion trajectories and its strong in-domain multi-task generalization ability. We further show the proposed Adaptive Action Grids offer a new and effective way to fine-tune the pre-trained SpatialVLA model for new simulation and real-world setups, where the pre-learned action grids are re-discretized to capture robot-specific spatial action movements of new setups. The superior results from extensive evaluations demonstrate the exceptional in-distribution generalization and out-of-distribution adaptation capability, highlighting the crucial benefit of the proposed spatial-aware representations for generalist robot policy learning. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a prominent technique within the framework of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), efficiently reduces the computational burden associated with adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, thereby enabling resource-constrained fine-tuning. However, existing researches have shown that LoRA suffers from slow convergence. To address this limitation, we introduce Dimension-Sharding Adaptation (DiSHA), which expands the PEFT design space to even fewer trainable parameters and faster convergence. Within DiSHA's design space, we propose Block Affine Efficient Computation (Bone), a computationally efficient structure that delivers both high performance and efficiency. While certain DiSHA configurations may result in colinear updates to weight shards, we address this with Block Affine Transformation (Bat), a nonlinear variant of DiSHA. Bat introduces nonlinearity by combining trainable matrices with original weight shards in a nonlinear manner, inducing nonlinearity in matrix updates without introducing additional parameters. Empirical results show that Bone, under the DiSHA framework, consistently outperforms LoRA variants in both Natural Language Understanding and Natural Language Generation tasks, with significantly improved computational efficiency. Further analysis demonstrates that BAT enhances model capabilities by leveraging its nonlinear design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Serving systems for Large Language Models (LLMs) improve throughput by processing several requests concurrently. However, multiplexing hardware resources between concurrent requests involves non-trivial scheduling decisions. Practical serving systems typically implement these decisions at two levels: First, a load balancer routes requests to different servers which each hold a replica of the LLM. Then, on each server, an engine-level scheduler decides when to run a request, or when to queue or preempt it. Improved scheduling policies may benefit a wide range of LLM deployments and can often be implemented as "drop-in replacements" to a system's current policy. In this work, we survey scheduling techniques from the literature and from practical serving systems. We find that schedulers from the literature often achieve good performance but introduce significant complexity. In contrast, schedulers in practical deployments often leave easy performance gains on the table but are easy to implement, deploy and configure. This finding motivates us to introduce two new scheduling techniques, which are both easy to implement, and outperform current techniques on production workload traces.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We study the emergence of decoherent histories in isolated systems based on exact numerical integration of the Schr\"odinger equation for a Heisenberg chain. We reveal that the nature of the system, which we switch from (i) chaotic to (ii) interacting integrable to (iii) non-interacting integrable, strongly impacts decoherence. From a finite size scaling law we infer a strong exponential suppression of coherences for (i), a weak exponential suppression for (ii) and no exponential suppression for (iii) on a relevant short (nonequilibrium) time scale. Moreover, for longer times we find stronger decoherence for (i) but the opposite for (ii), hinting even at a possible power-law decay for (ii) at equilibrium time scales. This behaviour is encoded in the multi-time properties of the quantum histories and it can not be explained by environmentally induced decoherence. Our results suggest that chaoticity plays a crucial role in the emergence of classicality in finite size systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In tests of gravity using gravitational waves (GWs), GW events analyzed are often selected based on specific criteria, particularly the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, such event selection can introduce bias into parameter estimation unless the selection effect is appropriately taken into account in the analysis. In this paper, we investigate how event selection with certain prior information affects parameter inference within the scalar-tensor polarization framework, focusing on the measurement of the scalar mode amplitude parameters. We find that for the Tensor+Scalar(dipole) model, the amplitude of the scalar dipole radiation is overestimated when its true value is nonzero while there is no false deviation in the absence of the scalar mode. The same bias is expected to occur also for the Tensor+Scalar(quadrupole) model. However, error typically exceeds the bias as the scalar quadrupole mode is difficult to be distinguished from the tensor mode.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to video understanding presents significant challenges due to the need to model temporal relations across frames. Existing approaches adopt either implicit temporal modeling, relying solely on the LLM decoder, or explicit temporal modeling, employing auxiliary temporal encoders. To investigate this debate between the two paradigms, we propose the Stackable Temporal Encoder (STE). STE enables flexible explicit temporal modeling with adjustable temporal receptive fields and token compression ratios. Using STE, we systematically compare implicit and explicit temporal modeling across dimensions such as overall performance, token compression effectiveness, and temporal-specific understanding. We also explore STE's design considerations and broader impacts as a plug-in module and in image modalities. Our findings emphasize the critical role of explicit temporal modeling, providing actionable insights to advance video MLLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapidly expanding Internet of Things (IoT) landscape is shifting toward cloudless architectures, removing reliance on centralized cloud services but exposing devices directly to the internet and increasing their vulnerability to cyberattacks. Our research revealed an unexpected pattern of substantial Tor network traffic targeting cloudless IoT devices. suggesting that attackers are using Tor to anonymously exploit undisclosed vulnerabilities (possibly obtained from underground markets). To delve deeper into this phenomenon, we developed TORCHLIGHT, a tool designed to detect both known and unknown threats targeting cloudless IoT devices by analyzing Tor traffic. TORCHLIGHT filters traffic via specific IP patterns, strategically deploys virtual private server (VPS) nodes for cost-effective detection, and uses a chain-of-thought (CoT) process with large language models (LLMs) for accurate threat identification.   Our results are significant: for the first time, we have demonstrated that attackers are indeed using Tor to conceal their identities while targeting cloudless IoT devices. Over a period of 12 months, TORCHLIGHT analyzed 26 TB of traffic, revealing 45 vulnerabilities, including 29 zero-day exploits with 25 CVE-IDs assigned (5 CRITICAL, 3 HIGH, 16 MEDIUM, and 1 LOW) and an estimated value of approximately $312,000. These vulnerabilities affect around 12.71 million devices across 148 countries, exposing them to severe risks such as information disclosure, authentication bypass, and arbitrary command execution. The findings have attracted significant attention, sparking widespread discussion in cybersecurity circles, reaching the top 25 on Hacker News, and generating over 190,000 views.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> zero-shot learning is an essential part of computer vision. As a classical downstream task, zero-shot semantic segmentation has been studied because of its applicant value. One of the popular zero-shot semantic segmentation methods is based on the generative model Most new proposed works added structures on the same architecture to enhance this model. However, we found that, from the view of causal inference, the result of the original model has been influenced by spurious statistical relationships. Thus the performance of the prediction shows severe bias. In this work, we consider counterfactual methods to avoid the confounder in the original model. Based on this method, we proposed a new framework for zero-shot semantic segmentation. Our model is compared with baseline models on two real-world datasets, Pascal-VOC and Pascal-Context. The experiment results show proposed models can surpass previous confounded models and can still make use of additional structures to improve the performance. We also design a simple structure based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) in this work.

  Severity Drift as a Critical Process</h2>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces a continuous-time stochastic dynamical framework for understanding how large language models (LLMs) may self-amplify latent biases or toxicity through their own chain-of-thought reasoning. The model posits an instantaneous "severity" variable $x(t) \in [0,1]$ evolving under a stochastic differential equation (SDE) with a drift term $\mu(x)$ and diffusion $\sigma(x)$. Crucially, such a process can be consistently analyzed via the Fokker--Planck approach if each incremental step behaves nearly Markovian in severity space. The analysis investigates critical phenomena, showing that certain parameter regimes create phase transitions from subcritical (self-correcting) to supercritical (runaway severity). The paper derives stationary distributions, first-passage times to harmful thresholds, and scaling laws near critical points. Finally, it highlights implications for agents and extended LLM reasoning models: in principle, these equations might serve as a basis for formal verification of whether a model remains stable or propagates bias over repeated inferences.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language model-based multi-agent systems have shown great abilities across various tasks due to the collaboration of expert agents, each focusing on a specific domain. However, the impact of clumsy or even malicious agents, i.e., those who frequently make errors in their tasks, on the overall performance of the system remains underexplored. This paper investigates: (1) What is the resilience of various system structures (e.g., A$\rightarrow$B$\rightarrow$C, A$\leftrightarrow$B$\leftrightarrow$C) under faulty agents, on different downstream tasks? (2) How can we increase system resilience to defend against these agents? To simulate faulty agents, we propose two approaches, AutoTransform and AutoInject, which introduce mistakes into the agents' responses. We select four downstream tasks, including code generation, math problems, translation, and text evaluation. Results suggest that the hierarchical structure, i.e., A$\rightarrow$(B$\leftrightarrow$C), exhibits superior resilience with the lowest performance drop of $9.2\%$, compared to $26.0\%$ and $31.2\%$ of other two structures. Additionally, we improve the system resilience with two methods, introducing a mechanism for each agent to challenge others' outputs, and an additional agent to review and correct messages.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities in various scenarios. However, they suffer from much redundant information and are sensitive to the position of key information in long context scenarios. To address these challenges, we present Perception Compressor, a training-free prompt compression framework. It includes a perception retriever that leverages guiding questions and instruction to retrieve the most relevant demonstrations, a dual-slope ratio allocator to dynamically allocate compression ratios and open-book ratios, and a semi-guided iterative compression that retains key information at the token level while removing tokens that distract the LLM. We conduct extensive experiments on long context benchmarks, i.e., NaturalQuestions, LongBench, and MuSiQue. Experiment results show that Perception Compressor outperforms existing methods by a large margin, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised increasing concerns about their misuse in generating hate speech. Among all the efforts to address this issue, hate speech detectors play a crucial role. However, the effectiveness of different detectors against LLM-generated hate speech remains largely unknown. In this paper, we propose HateBench, a framework for benchmarking hate speech detectors on LLM-generated hate speech. We first construct a hate speech dataset of 7,838 samples generated by six widely-used LLMs covering 34 identity groups, with meticulous annotations by three labelers. We then assess the effectiveness of eight representative hate speech detectors on the LLM-generated dataset. Our results show that while detectors are generally effective in identifying LLM-generated hate speech, their performance degrades with newer versions of LLMs. We also reveal the potential of LLM-driven hate campaigns, a new threat that LLMs bring to the field of hate speech detection. By leveraging advanced techniques like adversarial attacks and model stealing attacks, the adversary can intentionally evade the detector and automate hate campaigns online. The most potent adversarial attack achieves an attack success rate of 0.966, and its attack efficiency can be further improved by $13-21\times$ through model stealing attacks with acceptable attack performance. We hope our study can serve as a call to action for the research community and platform moderators to fortify defenses against these emerging threats.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements but also raise concerns about cultural bias, often reflecting dominant narratives at the expense of under-represented subcultures. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of LLMs to recognize and accurately respond to the Little Traditions within Indian society, encompassing localized cultural practices and subcultures such as caste, kinship, marriage, and religion. Through a series of case studies, we assess whether LLMs can balance the interplay between dominant Great Traditions and localized Little Traditions. We explore various prompting strategies and further investigate whether using prompts in regional languages enhances the models cultural sensitivity and response quality. Our findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate an ability to articulate cultural nuances, they often struggle to apply this understanding in practical, context-specific scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze LLMs engagement with Indian subcultures, offering critical insights into the challenges of embedding cultural diversity in AI systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text watermarking for Large Language Models (LLMs) has made significant progress in detecting LLM outputs and preventing misuse. Current watermarking techniques offer high detectability, minimal impact on text quality, and robustness to text editing. However, current researches lack investigation into the imperceptibility of watermarking techniques in LLM services. This is crucial as LLM providers may not want to disclose the presence of watermarks in real-world scenarios, as it could reduce user willingness to use the service and make watermarks more vulnerable to attacks. This work is the first to investigate the imperceptibility of watermarked LLMs. We design an identification algorithm called Water-Probe that detects watermarks through well-designed prompts to the LLM. Our key motivation is that current watermarked LLMs expose consistent biases under the same watermark key, resulting in similar differences across prompts under different watermark keys. Experiments show that almost all mainstream watermarking algorithms are easily identified with our well-designed prompts, while Water-Probe demonstrates a minimal false positive rate for non-watermarked LLMs. Finally, we propose that the key to enhancing the imperceptibility of watermarked LLMs is to increase the randomness of watermark key selection. Based on this, we introduce the Water-Bag strategy, which significantly improves watermark imperceptibility by merging multiple watermark keys.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces a scalable Anomaly Detection Service with a generalizable API tailored for industrial time-series data, designed to assist Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) in managing cloud infrastructure. The service enables efficient anomaly detection in complex data streams, supporting proactive identification and resolution of issues. Furthermore, it presents an innovative approach to anomaly modeling in cloud infrastructure by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand key components, their failure modes, and behaviors. A suite of algorithms for detecting anomalies is offered in univariate and multivariate time series data, including regression-based, mixture-model-based, and semi-supervised approaches. We provide insights into the usage patterns of the service, with over 500 users and 200,000 API calls in a year. The service has been successfully applied in various industrial settings, including IoT-based AI applications. We have also evaluated our system on public anomaly benchmarks to show its effectiveness. By leveraging it, SREs can proactively identify potential issues before they escalate, reducing downtime and improving response times to incidents, ultimately enhancing the overall customer experience. We plan to extend the system to include time series foundation models, enabling zero-shot anomaly detection capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is commonly employed to tailor models to human preferences, especially to improve the safety of outputs from large language models (LLMs). Traditionally, this method depends on selecting preferred responses from pairs. However, due to the variability in human opinions and the challenges in directly comparing two responses, there is an increasing trend towards fine-grained annotation approaches that evaluate responses using multiple targeted metrics or rules. The challenge lies in efficiently choosing and applying these rules to handle the diverse range of preference data. In this paper, we propose a dynamic method that adaptively selects the most important rules for each response pair. We introduce a mathematical framework that utilizes the maximum discrepancy across paired responses and demonstrate theoretically that this approach maximizes the mutual information between the rule-based annotations and the underlying true preferences. We then train an 8B reward model using this adaptively labeled preference dataset and assess its efficacy using RewardBench. As of January 25, 2025, our model achieved the highest safety performance on the leaderboard, surpassing various larger models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The growing complexity of network traffic and demand for ultra-low latency communication require smarter packet traffic management. Existing Deep Learning-based queuing approaches struggle with dynamic network scenarios and demand high engineering effort. We propose AQM-LLM, distilling Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot learning, contextual understanding, and pattern recognition to improve Active Queue Management (AQM) [RFC 9330] with minimal manual effort. We consider a specific case where AQM is Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable Throughput (L4S) and our design of AQM-LLM builds on speculative decoding and reinforcement-based distilling of LLM by tackling congestion prevention in the L4S architecture using Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [RFC 9331] and periodic packet dropping. We develop a new open-source experimental platform by executing L4S-AQM on FreeBSD-14, providing interoperable modules to support LLM integration and facilitate IETF recognition through wider testing. Our extensive evaluations show L4S-LLM enhances queue management, prevents congestion, reduces latency, and boosts network performance, showcasing LLMs' adaptability and efficiency in uplifting AQM systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Safety alignment mechanism are essential for preventing large language models (LLMs) from generating harmful information or unethical content. However, cleverly crafted prompts can bypass these safety measures without accessing the model's internal parameters, a phenomenon known as black-box jailbreak. Existing heuristic black-box attack methods, such as genetic algorithms, suffer from limited effectiveness due to their inherent randomness, while recent reinforcement learning (RL) based methods often lack robust and informative reward signals. To address these challenges, we propose a novel black-box jailbreak method leveraging RL, which optimizes prompt generation by analyzing the embedding proximity between benign and malicious prompts. This approach ensures that the rewritten prompts closely align with the intent of the original prompts while enhancing the attack's effectiveness. Furthermore, we introduce a comprehensive jailbreak evaluation framework incorporating keywords, intent matching, and answer validation to provide a more rigorous and holistic assessment of jailbreak success. Experimental results show the superiority of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on several prominent open and closed-source LLMs, including Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, and GPT-4o-0806. Our method sets a new benchmark in jailbreak attack effectiveness, highlighting potential vulnerabilities in LLMs. The codebase for this work is available at https://github.com/Aegis1863/xJailbreak.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of using large language language models (LLMs) in passage ranking. The listwise approaches, such as RankGPT, have become new state-of-the-art in this task. However, the efficiency of RankGPT models is limited by the maximum context length and relatively high latency of LLM inference. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose PE-Rank, leveraging the single passage embedding as a good context compression for efficient listwise passage reranking. By treating each passage as a special token, we can directly input passage embeddings into LLMs, thereby reducing input length. Additionally, we introduce an inference method that dynamically constrains the decoding space to these special tokens, accelerating the decoding process. For adapting the model to reranking, we employ listwise learning to rank loss for training. Evaluation results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PE-Rank significantly improves efficiency in both prefilling and decoding, while maintaining competitive ranking effectiveness. The Code is available at https://github.com/liuqi6777/pe_rank.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Statistical inference for stochastic processes has advanced significantly due to applications in diverse fields, but challenges remain in high-dimensional settings where parameters are allowed to grow with the sample size. This paper analyzes a d-dimensional ergodic diffusion process under sparsity constraints, focusing on the adaptive Lasso estimator, which improves variable selection and bias over the standard Lasso. We derive conditions under which the adaptive Lasso achieves support recovery property and asymptotic normality for the drift parameter, with a focus on linear models. Explicit parameter relationships guide tuning for optimal performance, and a marginal estimator is proposed for p>>d scenarios under partial orthogonality assumption. Numerical studies confirm the adaptive Lasso's superiority over standard Lasso and MLE in accuracy and support recovery, providing robust solutions for high-dimensional stochastic processes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> 3D vision and spatial reasoning have long been recognized as preferable for accurately perceiving our three-dimensional world, especially when compared with traditional visual reasoning based on 2D images. Due to the difficulties in collecting high-quality 3D data, research in this area has only recently gained momentum. With the advent of powerful large language models (LLMs), multi-modal LLMs for 3D vision have been developed over the past few years. However, most of these models focus primarily on the vision encoder for 3D data. In this paper, we propose converting existing densely activated LLMs into mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, which have proven effective for multi-modal data processing. In addition to leveraging these models' instruction-following capabilities, we further enable embodied task planning by attaching a diffusion head, Pose-DiT, that employs a novel rectified flow diffusion scheduler. Experimental results on 3D question answering and task-planning tasks demonstrate that our 3D-MoE framework achieves improved performance with fewer activated parameters.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in various tasks but struggle with hallucination problems and lack of relevant knowledge, especially in deep complex reasoning and knowledge-intensive tasks. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which capture vast amounts of facts in a structured format, offer a reliable source of knowledge for reasoning. However, existing KG-based LLM reasoning methods face challenges like handling multi-hop reasoning, multi-entity questions, and effectively utilizing graph structures. To address these issues, we propose Paths-over-Graph (PoG), a novel method that enhances LLM reasoning by integrating knowledge reasoning paths from KGs, improving the interpretability and faithfulness of LLM outputs. PoG tackles multi-hop and multi-entity questions through a three-phase dynamic multi-hop path exploration, which combines the inherent knowledge of LLMs with factual knowledge from KGs. In order to improve the efficiency, PoG prunes irrelevant information from the graph exploration first and introduces efficient three-step pruning techniques that incorporate graph structures, LLM prompting, and a pre-trained language model (e.g., SBERT) to effectively narrow down the explored candidate paths. This ensures all reasoning paths contain highly relevant information captured from KGs, making the reasoning faithful and interpretable in problem-solving. PoG innovatively utilizes graph structure to prune the irrelevant noise and represents the first method to implement multi-entity deep path detection on KGs for LLM reasoning tasks. Comprehensive experiments on five benchmark KGQA datasets demonstrate PoG outperforms the state-of-the-art method ToG across GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 18.9%. Notably, PoG with GPT-3.5-Turbo surpasses ToG with GPT-4 by up to 23.9%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Algorithmic level developments like Convolutional Neural Networks, transformers, attention mechanism, Retrieval Augmented Generation and so on have changed Artificial Intelligence. Recent such development was observed by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks that suggested to challenge the fundamental concept of a Neural Network, thus change Multilayer Perceptron, and Convolutional Neural Networks. They received a good reception in terms of scientific modeling, yet had some drawbacks in terms of efficiency. In this paper, we train Convolutional Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (CKANs) with the ImageNet-1k dataset with 1.3 million images, MNIST dataset with 60k images and a tabular biological science related MoA dataset and test the promise of CKANs in terms of FLOPS, Inference Time, number of trainable parameters and training time against the accuracy, precision, recall and f-1 score they produce against the standard industry practice on CNN models. We show that the CKANs perform fair yet slower than CNNs in small size dataset like MoA and MNIST but are not nearly comparable as the dataset gets larger and more complex like the ImageNet.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Personalized news headline generation aims to provide users with attention-grabbing headlines that are tailored to their preferences. Prevailing methods focus on user-oriented content preferences, but most of them overlook the fact that diverse stylistic preferences are integral to users' panoramic interests, leading to suboptimal personalization. In view of this, we propose a novel Stylistic-Content Aware Personalized Headline Generation (SCAPE) framework. SCAPE extracts both content and stylistic features from headlines with the aid of large language model (LLM) collaboration. It further adaptively integrates users' long- and short-term interests through a contrastive learning-based hierarchical fusion network. By incorporating the panoramic interests into the headline generator, SCAPE reflects users' stylistic-content preferences during the generation process. Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset PENS demonstrate the superiority of SCAPE over baselines.

Despite recent advancements in LLMs, a significant gap remains in their ability to perform in-depth program analysis. This study introduces AUTOPATCH, an in-context learning approach designed to bridge this gap by enabling LLMs to automatically generate optimized code. Inspired by how programmers learn and apply knowledge to optimize software, AUTOPATCH incorporates three key components: (1) an analogy-driven framework to align LLM optimization with human cognitive processes, (2) a unified approach that integrates historical code examples and CFG analysis for context-aware learning, and (3) an automated pipeline for generating optimized code through in-context prompting. Experimental results demonstrate that AUTOPATCH achieves a 7.3% improvement in execution efficiency over GPT-4o across common generated executable code, highlighting its potential to advance automated program runtime optimization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose affine concept editing (ACE) as an approach for steering language models' behavior by intervening directly in activations. We begin with an affine decomposition of model activation vectors and show that prior methods for steering model behavior correspond to subsets of terms of this decomposition. We then provide a derivation of ACE and use it to control refusal behavior on ten different models, including Llama 3 70B. ACE combines affine subspace projection and activation addition to reliably control the model's refusal responses across prompt types. We evaluate the results using LLM-based scoring on a collection of harmful and harmless prompts. Our experiments demonstrate that ACE consistently achieves more precise control over model behavior than existing methods and generalizes to models where directional ablation via affine subspace projection alone produces incoherent outputs. Code for reproducing our results is available at https://github.com/EleutherAI/steering-llama3 .

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Artificial intelligence requires deliberate reasoning, temporal awareness, and effective constraint management, capabilities beyond the pattern-matching strengths of LLMs. LLMs struggle with planning tasks because of their reliance on associative reasoning, inability to self-verify, and inconsistent constraint awareness. We propose Multi-Agent Collaborative Intelligence (MACI), a framework centered on a meta-planner (MP) that orchestrates multiple agents to generate planner templates that define roles and constraints. These planners produce actionable workflows of role nodes and dependency constraints, enabling advanced temporal reasoning and adaptability.   MACI's three-tier architecture includes a meta-planning module for planner construction, common agents for general reasoning, and specialized agents for domain expertise. By decoupling planning from validation, it overcomes key LLM limitations. Evaluations demonstrate MACI's effective constraint satisfaction, conflict detection, and reasoning, positioning it as a robust solution for complex reasoning and planning tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> According to the stages-of-inference hypothesis, early layers of language models map their subword-tokenized input, which does not necessarily correspond to a linguistically meaningful segmentation, to more meaningful representations that form the model's ``inner vocabulary''. Prior analysis of this detokenization stage has predominantly relied on probing and interventions such as path patching, which involve selecting particular inputs, choosing a subset of components that will be patched, and then observing changes in model behavior. Here, we show that several important aspects of the detokenization stage can be understood purely by analyzing model weights, without performing any model inference steps. Specifically, we introduce an analytical decomposition of first-layer attention in GPT-2. Our decomposition yields interpretable terms that quantify the relative contributions of position-related, token-related, and mixed effects. By focusing on terms in this decomposition, we discover weight-based explanations of attention bias toward close tokens and attention for detokenization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but require careful alignment with human preferences. Traditional training-time methods finetune LLMs using human preference datasets but incur significant training costs and require repeated training to handle diverse user preferences. Test-time alignment methods address this by using reward models (RMs) to guide frozen LLMs without retraining. However, existing test-time approaches rely on trajectory-level RMs which are designed to evaluate complete responses, making them unsuitable for autoregressive text generation that requires computing next-token rewards from partial responses. To address this, we introduce GenARM, a test-time alignment approach that leverages the Autoregressive Reward Model--a novel reward parametrization designed to predict next-token rewards for efficient and effective autoregressive generation. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this parametrization can provably guide frozen LLMs toward any distribution achievable by traditional RMs within the KL-regularized reinforcement learning framework. Experimental results show that GenARM significantly outperforms prior test-time alignment baselines and matches the performance of training-time methods. Additionally, GenARM enables efficient weak-to-strong guidance, aligning larger LLMs with smaller RMs without the high costs of training larger models. Furthermore, GenARM supports multi-objective alignment, allowing real-time trade-offs between preference dimensions and catering to diverse user preferences without retraining.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities of generating texts resembling human language. However, they can be misused by criminals to create deceptive content, such as fake news and phishing emails, which raises ethical concerns. Watermarking is a key technique to address these concerns, which embeds a message (e.g., a bit string) into a text generated by an LLM. By embedding the user ID (represented as a bit string) into generated texts, we can trace generated texts to the user, known as content source tracing. The major limitation of existing watermarking techniques is that they achieve sub-optimal performance for content source tracing in real-world scenarios. The reason is that they cannot accurately or efficiently extract a long message from a generated text. We aim to address the limitations.   In this work, we introduce a new watermarking method for LLM-generated text grounded in pseudo-random segment assignment. We also propose multiple techniques to further enhance the robustness of our watermarking algorithm. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our method. Our experimental results show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness on benchmark datasets. For instance, when embedding a message of length 20 into a 200-token generated text, our method achieves a match rate of $97.6\%$, while the state-of-the-art work Yoo et al. only achieves $49.2\%$. Additionally, we prove that our watermark can tolerate edits within an edit distance of 17 on average for each paragraph under the same setting.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped natural language processing, powering applications from multi-hop retrieval and question answering to autonomous agent workflows. Yet, prompt engineering -- the task of crafting textual inputs to effectively direct LLMs -- remains difficult and labor-intensive, particularly for complex pipelines that combine multiple LLM calls with functional operations like retrieval and data formatting. We introduce LLM-AutoDiff: a novel framework for Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) that extends textual gradient-based methods (such as Text-Grad) to multi-component, potentially cyclic LLM architectures. Implemented within the AdalFlow library, LLM-AutoDiff treats each textual input as a trainable parameter and uses a frozen backward engine LLM to generate feedback-akin to textual gradients -- that guide iterative prompt updates. Unlike prior single-node approaches, LLM-AutoDiff inherently accommodates functional nodes, preserves time-sequential behavior in repeated calls (e.g., multi-hop loops), and combats the "lost-in-the-middle" problem by isolating distinct sub-prompts (instructions, formats, or few-shot examples). It further boosts training efficiency by focusing on error-prone samples through selective gradient computation. Across diverse tasks, including single-step classification, multi-hop retrieval-based QA, and agent-driven pipelines, LLM-AutoDiff consistently outperforms existing textual gradient baselines in both accuracy and training cost. By unifying prompt optimization through a graph-centric lens, LLM-AutoDiff offers a powerful new paradigm for scaling and automating LLM workflows - mirroring the transformative role that automatic differentiation libraries have long played in neural network research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Methods to ensure factual accuracy of text generated by large language models (LLM) in clinical medicine are lacking. VeriFact is an artificial intelligence system that combines retrieval-augmented generation and LLM-as-a-Judge to verify whether LLM-generated text is factually supported by a patient's medical history based on their electronic health record (EHR). To evaluate this system, we introduce VeriFact-BHC, a new dataset that decomposes Brief Hospital Course narratives from discharge summaries into a set of simple statements with clinician annotations for whether each statement is supported by the patient's EHR clinical notes. Whereas highest agreement between clinicians was 88.5%, VeriFact achieves up to 92.7% agreement when compared to a denoised and adjudicated average human clinican ground truth, suggesting that VeriFact exceeds the average clinician's ability to fact-check text against a patient's medical record. VeriFact may accelerate the development of LLM-based EHR applications by removing current evaluation bottlenecks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generative AI technology has become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, offering powerful capabilities to enhance productivity. However, these same capabilities can be exploited by adversaries for malicious purposes. While existing research on adversarial applications of generative AI predominantly focuses on cyberattacks, less attention has been given to attacks targeting deep learning models. In this paper, we introduce the use of generative AI for facilitating model-related attacks, including model extraction, membership inference, and model inversion. Our study reveals that adversaries can launch a variety of model-related attacks against both image and text models in a data-free and black-box manner, achieving comparable performance to baseline methods that have access to the target models' training data and parameters in a white-box manner. This research serves as an important early warning to the community about the potential risks associated with generative AI-powered attacks on deep learning models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Survey questions often ask respondents to select from ordered scales where the meanings of the categories are subjective, leaving each individual free to apply their own definitions in answering. This paper studies the use of these responses as an outcome variable in causal inference, accounting for variation in interpretation of the categories across individuals. I find that when a continuous treatment variable is statistically independent of both i) potential outcomes; and ii) heterogeneity in reporting styles, a nonparametric regression of response category number on that treatment variable recovers a quantity proportional to an average causal effect among individuals who are on the margin between successive response categories. The magnitude of a given regression coefficient is not meaningful on its own, but the ratio of local regression derivatives with respect to two such treatment variables identifies the relative magnitudes of convex averages of their effects. These results can be seen as limiting cases of analogous results for binary treatment variables, though comparisons of magnitude involving discrete treatments are not as readily interpretable outside of the limit. I obtain a partial identification result for comparisons involving discrete treatments under further assumptions. An empirical application illustrates the results by revisiting the effects of income comparisons on subjective well-being, without assuming cardinality or interpersonal comparability of responses.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep learning surrogate models have become pivotal in enabling model-driven materials discovery to achieve exceptional properties. However, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of predictions from these models, trained on limited and sparse material datasets remains a significant challenge. This study introduces an integrated deep learning framework for predicting the synthesis, microstructure, and mechanical properties of ceramic aerogels, leveraging physics-based models such as Lattice Boltzmann simulations for microstructure formation and stochastic finite element methods for mechanical property calculations. To address the computational demands of repeated physics-based simulations required for experimental calibration and material design, a linked surrogate model is developed, leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for stochastic microstructure generation and microstructure-to-mechanical property mapping. To overcome challenges associated with limited training datasets from expensive physical modeling, CNN training is formulated within a Bayesian inference framework, enabling robust uncertainty quantification in predictions. Numerical results highlight the strengths and limitations of the linked surrogate framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting properties of aerogels with pore sizes and morphologies similar to the training data (in-distribution) and its ability to interpolate to new microstructural features between training data (out-of-distribution).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mining and conveying actionable insights from complex data is a key challenge of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and storytelling. To address this challenge, we present a design space for actionable EDA and storytelling. Synthesizing theory and expert interviews, we highlight how semantic precision, rhetorical persuasion, and pragmatic relevance underpin effective EDA and storytelling. We also show how this design space subsumes common challenges in actionable EDA and storytelling, such as identifying appropriate analytical strategies and leveraging relevant domain knowledge. Building on the potential of LLMs to generate coherent narratives with commonsense reasoning, we contribute Jupybara, an AI-enabled assistant for actionable EDA and storytelling implemented as a Jupyter Notebook extension. Jupybara employs two strategies -- design-space-aware prompting and multi-agent architectures -- to operationalize our design space. An expert evaluation confirms Jupybara's usability, steerability, explainability, and reparability, as well as the effectiveness of our strategies in operationalizing the design space framework with LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper investigates the application of Time Series K-means (TS-K-means) within the context of causal inference and mechanism clustering of financial time series data. Traditional clustering approaches like K-means often rely on static distance metrics, such as Euclidean distance, which inadequately capture the temporal dependencies intrinsic to financial returns. By incorporating Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) as a distance metric, TS-K-means addresses this limitation, improving the robustness of clustering in time-dependent financial data. This study extends the Additive Noise Model Mixture Model (ANM-MM) framework by integrating TS-K-means, facilitating more accurate causal inference and mechanism clustering. The approach is validated through simulations and applied to real-world financial data, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the analysis of complex financial time series, particularly in identifying causal relationships and clustering data based on underlying generative mechanisms. The results show that TS-K-means outperforms traditional K-means, especially with smaller datasets, while maintaining robust causal direction detection as the dataset size changes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way forward for automating software engineering tasks, such as bug fixes, feature additions, etc., via multi-step LLM-based agentic workflows. However, existing metrics for evaluating such workflows, mainly build status and occasionally log analysis, are too sparse and limited in providing the information needed to assess the quality of changes made. In this work, we designed LLM-based critics to derive well-structured and rigorous intermediate/step-level, execution-free evaluation proxies for repo-level code changes. Importantly, we assume access to the gold test patch for the problem (i.e., reference-aware) to assess both semantics and executability of generated patches. With the gold test patch as a reference, we predict executability of all editing locations with an F1 score of 91.6%, aggregating which, we can predict the build status in 84.8% of the instances in SWE-bench. In particular, such an execution-focused LLM critic outperforms other reference-free and reference-aware LLM critics by 38.9% to 72.5%. Moreover, we demonstrate the usefulness of such a reference-aware framework in comparing patches generated by different agentic workflows. Finally, we open-source the library developed for this project, which allows further usage for either other agentic workflows or other benchmarks. The source code is available at https://github.com/amazon-science/code-agent-eval.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce a novel index, the Distribution of Cosine Similarity (DOCS), for quantitatively assessing the similarity between weight matrices in Large Language Models (LLMs), aiming to facilitate the analysis of their complex architectures. Leveraging DOCS, our analysis uncovers intriguing patterns in the latest open-source LLMs: adjacent layers frequently exhibit high weight similarity and tend to form clusters, suggesting depth-wise functional specialization. Additionally, we prove that DOCS is theoretically effective in quantifying similarity for orthogonal matrices, a crucial aspect given the prevalence of orthogonal initializations in LLMs. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of LLM architecture and behavior, offering tools with potential implications for developing more efficient and interpretable models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Fine-grained steering of language model outputs is essential for safety and reliability. Prompting and finetuning are widely used to achieve these goals, but interpretability researchers have proposed a variety of representation-based techniques as well, including sparse autoencoders (SAEs), linear artificial tomography, supervised steering vectors, linear probes, and representation finetuning. At present, there is no benchmark for making direct comparisons between these proposals. Therefore, we introduce AxBench, a large-scale benchmark for steering and concept detection, and report experiments on Gemma-2-2B and 9B. For steering, we find that prompting outperforms all existing methods, followed by finetuning. For concept detection, representation-based methods such as difference-in-means, perform the best. On both evaluations, SAEs are not competitive. We introduce a novel weakly-supervised representational method (Rank-1 Representation Finetuning; ReFT-r1), which is competitive on both tasks while providing the interpretability advantages that prompting lacks. Along with AxBench, we train and publicly release SAE-scale feature dictionaries for ReFT-r1 and DiffMean.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Prior research on training grounded factuality classification models to detect hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) has relied on public natural language inference (NLI) data and synthetic data. However, conventional NLI datasets are not well-suited for document-level reasoning, which is critical for detecting LLM hallucinations. Recent approaches to document-level synthetic data generation involve iteratively removing sentences from documents and annotating factuality using LLM-based prompts. While effective, this method is computationally expensive for long documents and limited by the LLM's capabilities. In this work, we analyze the differences between existing synthetic training data used in state-of-the-art models and real LLM output claims. Based on our findings, we propose a novel approach for synthetic data generation, CG2C, that leverages multi-hop reasoning on context graphs extracted from documents. Our fact checker model, FactCG, demonstrates improved performance with more connected reasoning, using the same backbone models. Experiments show it even outperforms GPT-4-o on the LLM-Aggrefact benchmark with much smaller model size.

Automated mathematical programming (AMP) has emerged to simplify this process, but existing systems have limitations. This paper introduces a novel methodology that uses recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) to create and edit OR solutions from non-expert user queries expressed using Natural Language. This reduces the need for domain expertise and the time to formulate a problem. The paper presents an end-to-end pipeline, named NL2OR, that generates solutions to OR problems from natural language input, and shares experimental results on several important OR problems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained attention due to their ability to understand and generate sophisticated human-like content. However, ensuring their safety is paramount as they might provide harmful and unsafe responses. Existing LLM testing frameworks address various safety-related concerns (e.g., drugs, terrorism, animal abuse) but often face challenges due to unbalanced and obsolete datasets. In this paper, we present ASTRAL, a tool that automates the generation and execution of test cases (i.e., prompts) for testing the safety of LLMs. First, we introduce a novel black-box coverage criterion to generate balanced and diverse unsafe test inputs across a diverse set of safety categories as well as linguistic writing characteristics (i.e., different style and persuasive writing techniques). Second, we propose an LLM-based approach that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), few-shot prompting strategies and web browsing to generate up-to-date test inputs. Lastly, similar to current LLM test automation techniques, we leverage LLMs as test oracles to distinguish between safe and unsafe test outputs, allowing a fully automated testing approach. We conduct an extensive evaluation on well-known LLMs, revealing the following key findings: i) GPT3.5 outperforms other LLMs when acting as the test oracle, accurately detecting unsafe responses, and even surpassing more recent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), as well as LLMs that are specifically tailored to detect unsafe LLM outputs (e.g., LlamaGuard); ii) the results confirm that our approach can uncover nearly twice as many unsafe LLM behaviors with the same number of test inputs compared to currently used static datasets; and iii) our black-box coverage criterion combined with web browsing can effectively guide the LLM on generating up-to-date unsafe test inputs, significantly increasing the number of unsafe LLM behaviors.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep learning models for autonomous driving, encompassing perception, planning, and control, depend on vast datasets to achieve their high performance. However, their generalization often suffers due to domain-specific data distributions, making an effective scene-based categorization of samples necessary to improve their reliability across diverse domains. Manual captioning, though valuable, is both labor-intensive and time-consuming, creating a bottleneck in the data annotation process. Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) present a compelling solution by automating image analysis and categorization through contextual queries, often without requiring retraining for new categories. In this study, we evaluate the capabilities of LVLMs, including GPT-4 and LLaVA, to understand and classify urban traffic scenes on both an in-house dataset and the BDD100K. We propose a scalable captioning pipeline that integrates state-of-the-art models, enabling a flexible deployment on new datasets. Our analysis, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative insights, demonstrates the effectiveness of LVLMs to understand urban traffic scenarios and highlights their potential as an efficient tool for data-driven advancements in autonomous driving.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Aligning language models with human values is crucial, especially as they become more integrated into everyday life. While models are often adapted to user preferences, it is equally important to ensure they align with moral norms and behaviours in real-world social situations. Despite significant progress in languages like English and Chinese, French has seen little attention in this area, leaving a gap in understanding how LLMs handle moral reasoning in this language. To address this gap, we introduce Histoires Morales, a French dataset derived from Moral Stories, created through translation and subsequently refined with the assistance of native speakers to guarantee grammatical accuracy and adaptation to the French cultural context. We also rely on annotations of the moral values within the dataset to ensure their alignment with French norms. Histoires Morales covers a wide range of social situations, including differences in tipping practices, expressions of honesty in relationships, and responsibilities toward animals. To foster future research, we also conduct preliminary experiments on the alignment of multilingual models on French and English data and the robustness of the alignment. We find that while LLMs are generally aligned with human moral norms by default, they can be easily influenced with user-preference optimization for both moral and immoral data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The growing computational demands of training large language models (LLMs) necessitate more efficient methods. Quantized training presents a promising solution by enabling low-bit arithmetic operations to reduce these costs. While FP8 precision has demonstrated feasibility, leveraging FP4 remains a challenge due to significant quantization errors and limited representational capacity. This work introduces the first FP4 training framework for LLMs, addressing these challenges with two key innovations: a differentiable quantization estimator for precise weight updates and an outlier clamping and compensation strategy to prevent activation collapse. To ensure stability, the framework integrates a mixed-precision training scheme and vector-wise quantization. Experimental results demonstrate that our FP4 framework achieves accuracy comparable to BF16 and FP8, with minimal degradation, scaling effectively to 13B-parameter LLMs trained on up to 100B tokens. With the emergence of next-generation hardware supporting FP4, our framework sets a foundation for efficient ultra-low precision training.

Moreover, this paper investigates the effect of LLMs' temperature for generation by establishing a dynamic annealing approach, which promotes the creativity in the early stages and gradually refines it by focusing on the nuances, as well as a fixed temperature strategy for generation. Our proposed approach is examined to determine its ability to generate novel ideas from an initial proposition. Additionally, a Multi Agent Majority Voting (MAMV) strategy is leveraged to assess the validity and novelty of the generated ideas, which proves beneficial in the absence of domain experts. Our experiments show promise in generating new ideas and provide a stepping stone for future research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Traditional methods for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), rely on implicit principles, limiting interpretability. Constitutional AI (CAI) offers an explicit, rule-based framework for guiding model outputs. Building on this, we refine the Inverse Constitutional AI (ICAI) algorithm, which extracts constitutions from preference datasets. By improving principle generation, clustering, and embedding processes, our approach enhances the accuracy and generalizability of extracted principles across synthetic and real-world datasets. While in-context alignment yields modest improvements, our results highlight the potential of these principles to foster more transparent and adaptable alignment methods, offering a promising direction for future advancements beyond traditional fine-tuning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Apple Silicon has attracted much attention for its performance and role in machine learning (ML) training. Unlike NVIDIA GPUs, which have traditionally dominated ML training, Apple Silicon has a significant difference in memory architecture. It uses Unified Memory, which integrates CPU and GPU memory instead of separate CPU memory and GPU VRAM. However, it is difficult to tell whether Unified Memory means more performance benefits.   This paper investigates the performance differences by training several large language model (LLM) workloads end-to-end under different memory scenarios. The results show a significant performance gap between Apple Silicon and NVIDIA GPUs. This paper attributes this gap to system-level factors such as page faults, power consumption, and kernel launch time. In addition, the performance difference of basic linear algebra subprograms (BLAS) on the NVIDIA GPUs and Apple Silicon chips is analyzed to further explain the observed gap.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated significant potential in the field of time series forecasting, offering impressive capabilities in handling complex temporal data. However, their robustness and reliability in real-world applications remain under-explored, particularly concerning their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce a targeted adversarial attack framework for LLM-based time series forecasting. By employing both gradient-free and black-box optimization methods, we generate minimal yet highly effective perturbations that significantly degrade the forecasting accuracy across multiple datasets and LLM architectures. Our experiments, which include models like TimeGPT and LLM-Time with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa, and Mistral, show that adversarial attacks lead to much more severe performance degradation than random noise, and demonstrate the broad effectiveness of our attacks across different LLMs. The results underscore the critical vulnerabilities of LLMs in time series forecasting, highlighting the need for robust defense mechanisms to ensure their reliable deployment in practical applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the involvement of multiple programming languages in modern software development, cross-lingual code clone detection has gained traction within the software engineering community. Numerous studies have explored this topic, proposing various promising approaches. Inspired by the significant advances in machine learning in recent years, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated their ability to tackle various tasks, this paper revisits cross-lingual code clone detection. We evaluate the performance of five (05) LLMs and eight prompts (08) for the identification of cross-lingual code clones. Additionally, we compare these results against two baseline methods. Finally, we evaluate a pre-trained embedding model to assess the effectiveness of the generated representations for classifying clone and non-clone pairs. The studies involving LLMs and Embedding models are evaluated using two widely used cross-lingual datasets, XLCoST and CodeNet. Our results show that LLMs can achieve high F1 scores, up to 0.99, for straightforward programming examples. However, they not only perform less well on programs associated with complex programming challenges but also do not necessarily understand the meaning of "code clones" in a cross-lingual setting. We show that embedding models used to represent code fragments from different programming languages in the same representation space enable the training of a basic classifier that outperforms all LLMs by ~1 and ~20 percentage points on the XLCoST and CodeNet datasets, respectively. This finding suggests that, despite the apparent capabilities of LLMs, embeddings provided by embedding models offer suitable representations to achieve state-of-the-art performance in cross-lingual code clone detection.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) excel in many natural language tasks, yet they struggle with complex mathemat-ical problem-solving, particularly in symbolic reasoning and maintaining consistent output. This study evalu-ates 10 LLMs with 7 to 8 billion parameters using 945 competition-level problems from the MATH dataset. The focus is on their ability to generate executable Python code as a step in their reasoning process, involving over 9,450 code executions. The research introduces an evaluation framework using mistral-large-2411 to rate answers on a 5-point scale, which helps address inconsistencies in mathematical notation. It also examines the impact of regenerating output token-by-token on refining results. The findings reveal a significant 34.5% per-formance gap between the top commercial model (gpt-4o-mini, scoring 83.7%) and the least effective open-source model (open-codestral-mamba:v0.1, scoring 49.2%). This disparity is especially noticeable in complex areas like Number Theory. While token-by-token regeneration slightly improved accuracy (+0.8%) for the model llama3.1:8b, it also reduced code execution time by 36.7%, highlighting a trade-off between efficiency and precision. The study also noted a consistent trend where harder problems correlated with lower accuracy across all models. Despite using controlled execution environments, less than 1% of the generated code was unsafe, and 3.17% of problems remained unsolved after 10 attempts, suggesting that hybrid reasoning methods may be beneficial.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large-scale deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) networks in the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band leads to spectrum congestion and requires multiple gateways to cover wide areas. This will increase cost, complexity, and energy consumption. TV White Spaces (TVWS) provides an abundant spectrum that is sufficient for low data rate IoT applications. This low-frequency band offers coverage over larger areas due to the ability of wireless signals to penetrate obstacles and terrain. In this paper, we examine the performance of narrowband data communications in TVWS through an outdoor experiment in a suburban area with line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation scenarios. We implement a software-defined radio (SDR) testbed and develop a GNU radio benchmark tool to perform outdoor experiments for TVWS narrowband data communication between a gateway and wireless nodes at various locations. The results reveal that the system can achieve a throughput of up to 97 Kbps with a packet error rate (PER) and packet loss rate (PLR) under 1% over NLOS paths, making it suitable for low-data rate applications. This work offers valuable insights for designing the physical layer of narrowband white space devices (WSDs). The developed benchmark tool will also greatly assist other researchers in evaluating the performance of SDR-based communication systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Judging the safety of an action, whether taken by a human or a system, must take into account the context in which the action takes place. Deleting an email from user's mailbox may or may not be appropriate depending on email's content, user's goals, or even available space. Systems today that make these judgements -- providing security against harmful or inappropriate actions -- rely on manually-crafted policies or user confirmation for each relevant context. With the upcoming deployment of systems like generalist agents, we argue that we must rethink security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain of agents and proposes contextual security for agents (Conseca), a framework to generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.

In this paper, we discuss three complementary Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches for triggering the creativity of app designers and inspiring them create better and more diverse UI designs. First, designers can prompt a Large Language Model (LLM) to directly generate and adjust UIs. Second, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) enables designers to effectively search a large screenshot dataset, e.g. from apps published in app stores. Third, a Diffusion Model (DM) can be trained to specifically generate UIs as inspirational images. We present an AI-inspired design process and discuss the implications and limitations of the approaches.

The framework's efficacy is demonstrated through a visual quality inspection (VQI) use case where images of assets are processed on edge devices, enabling real-time condition updates within an asset management system. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance benefits of different quantization methods, specifically static and dynamic signed-int8, on a Raspberry Pi 4, demonstrating significant inference time reductions compared to FP32 precision.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Users can divulge sensitive information to proprietary LLM providers, raising significant privacy concerns. While open-source models, hosted locally on the user's machine, alleviate some concerns, models that users can host locally are often less capable than proprietary frontier models. Toward preserving user privacy while retaining the best quality, we propose Privacy-Conscious Delegation, a novel task for chaining API-based and local models. We utilize recent public collections of user-LLM interactions to construct a natural benchmark called PUPA, which contains personally identifiable information (PII). To study potential approaches, we devise PAPILLON, a multi-stage LLM pipeline that uses prompt optimization to address a simpler version of our task. Our best pipeline maintains high response quality for 85.5% of user queries while restricting privacy leakage to only 7.5%. We still leave a large margin to the generation quality of proprietary LLMs for future work. Our data and code will be available at https://github.com/siyan-sylvia-li/PAPILLON.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various reasoning tasks but face significant challenges with complex, knowledge-intensive multi-hop queries, particularly those involving new or long-tail knowledge. Existing benchmarks often fail to fully address these challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce MINTQA (Multi-hop Question Answering on New and Tail Knowledge), a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in multi-hop reasoning across four critical dimensions: question handling strategy, sub-question generation, retrieval-augmented generation, and iterative or dynamic decomposition and retrieval. MINTQA comprises 10,479 question-answer pairs for evaluating new knowledge and 17,887 pairs for assessing long-tail knowledge, with each question equipped with corresponding sub-questions and answers. Our systematic evaluation of 22 state-of-the-art LLMs on MINTQA reveals significant limitations in their ability to handle complex knowledge base queries, particularly in handling new or unpopular knowledge. Our findings highlight critical challenges and offer insights for advancing multi-hop reasoning capabilities. The MINTQA benchmark is available at https://github.com/probe2/multi-hop/.

  Representations with Large Language Models</h2>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional power in various domains, including information retrieval. Most of the previous practices involve leveraging these models to create a single embedding for each query, each passage, or each document individually, a strategy exemplified and used by the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. While this method has proven effective, we argue that it falls short in fully capturing the nuanced intricacies of document-level texts due to its reliance on a relatively coarse-grained representation. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel, fine-grained approach aimed at enhancing the accuracy of relevance scoring for long documents. Our methodology firstly segments a long document into blocks, each of which is embedded using an LLM, for matching with the query representation. When calculating the relevance score, we aggregate the query-block relevance scores through a weighted sum method, yielding a comprehensive score for the query with the entire document. Despite its apparent simplicity, our experimental findings reveal that this approach outperforms standard representation methods and achieves a significant reduction in embedding generation latency. Moreover, by carefully optimizing pairwise loss functions, superior performances have been achieved.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Data-driven methods have shown great potential in solving challenging manipulation tasks; however, their application in the domain of deformable objects has been constrained, in part, by the lack of data. To address this lack, we propose PokeFlex, a dataset featuring real-world multimodal data that is paired and annotated. The modalities include 3D textured meshes, point clouds, RGB images, and depth maps. Such data can be leveraged for several downstream tasks, such as online 3D mesh reconstruction, and it can potentially enable underexplored applications such as the real-world deployment of traditional control methods based on mesh simulations. To deal with the challenges posed by real-world 3D mesh reconstruction, we leverage a professional volumetric capture system that allows complete 360{\deg} reconstruction. PokeFlex consists of 18 deformable objects with varying stiffness and shapes. Deformations are generated by dropping objects onto a flat surface or by poking the objects with a robot arm. Interaction wrenches and contact locations are also reported for the latter case. Using different data modalities, we demonstrated a use case for our dataset training models that, given the novelty of the multimodal nature of Pokeflex, constitute the state-of-the-art in multi-object online template-based mesh reconstruction from multimodal data, to the best of our knowledge. We refer the reader to our website ( https://pokeflex-dataset.github.io/ ) for further demos and examples.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in critical digital infrastructure introduces significant risks, necessitating a robust framework for systematically collecting AI incident data to prevent future incidents. Existing databases lack the granularity as well as the standardized structure required for consistent data collection and analysis, impeding effective incident management. This work proposes a standardized schema and taxonomy for AI incident databases, addressing these challenges by enabling detailed and structured documentation of AI incidents across sectors. Key contributions include developing a unified schema, introducing new fields such as incident severity, causes, and harms caused, and proposing a taxonomy for classifying AI incidents in critical digital infrastructure. The proposed solution facilitates more effective incident data collection and analysis, thus supporting evidence-based policymaking, enhancing industry safety measures, and promoting transparency. This work lays the foundation for a coordinated global response to AI incidents, ensuring trust, safety, and accountability in using AI across regions.

However, ensuring harmlessness in these systems remains a critical challenge, particularly in advanced models like DeepSeek-R1. This paper examines the limitations of Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the primary approach for reducing harmful outputs in DeepSeek-R1 and compares it with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). While RL improves reasoning capabilities, it faces challenges such as reward hacking, generalization failures, language mixing, and high computational costs. We propose hybrid training approaches combining RL and SFT to achieve robust harmlessness reduction. Usage recommendations and future directions for deploying DeepSeek-R1 responsibly are also presented.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the Python ecosystem, the adoption of idiomatic constructs has been fostered because of their expressiveness, increasing productivity and even efficiency, despite controversial arguments concerning familiarity or understandability issues. Recent research contributions have proposed approaches -- based on static code analysis and transformation -- to automatically identify and enact refactoring opportunities of non-idiomatic code into idiomatic ones. Given the potential recently offered by Large Language Models (LLMs) for code-related tasks, in this paper, we present the results of a replication study in which we investigate GPT-4 effectiveness in recommending and suggesting idiomatic refactoring actions. Our results reveal that GPT-4 not only identifies idiomatic constructs effectively but frequently exceeds the benchmark in proposing refactoring actions where the existing baseline failed. A manual analysis of a random sample shows the correctness of the obtained recommendations. Our findings underscore the potential of LLMs to achieve tasks where, in the past, implementing recommenders based on complex code analyses was required.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) are pivotal in revolutionizing customer support and operations by integrating multiple modalities such as text, images, and audio. Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) is a recently proposed approach that combines pre-trained multimodal LLMs such as vision-language models with federated learning to create personalized, privacy-preserving AI systems. However, balancing the competing goals of personalization, generalization, and privacy remains a significant challenge. Over-personalization can lead to overfitting, reducing generalizability, while stringent privacy measures, such as differential privacy, can hinder both personalization and generalization. In this paper, we propose a Differentially Private Federated Prompt Learning (DP-FPL) approach to tackle this challenge by leveraging a low-rank adaptation scheme to capture generalization while maintaining a residual term that preserves expressiveness for personalization. To ensure privacy, we introduce a novel method where we apply local differential privacy to the two low-rank components of the local prompt, and global differential privacy to the global prompt. Our approach mitigates the impact of privacy noise on the model performance while balancing the tradeoff between personalization and generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over other benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as coding assistants, capable of generating source code from natural language prompts. With the increasing adoption of LLMs in software development, academic research and industry based projects are developing various tools, benchmarks, and metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-generated code. However, there is a lack of solutions evaluated through empirically grounded methods that incorporate practitioners perspectives to assess functionality, syntax, and accuracy in real world applications. To address this gap, we propose and develop a multi-model unified platform to generate and execute code based on natural language prompts. We conducted a survey with 60 software practitioners from 11 countries across four continents working in diverse professional roles and domains to evaluate the usability, performance, strengths, and limitations of each model. The results present practitioners feedback and insights into the use of LLMs in software development, including their strengths and weaknesses, key aspects overlooked by benchmarks and metrics, and a broader understanding of their practical applicability. These findings can help researchers and practitioners make informed decisions for systematically selecting and using LLMs in software development projects. Future research will focus on integrating more diverse models into the proposed system, incorporating additional case studies, and conducting developer interviews for deeper empirical insights into LLM-driven software development.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> AI models are constantly evolving, with new versions released frequently. Human-AI interaction guidelines encourage notifying users about changes in model capabilities, ideally supported by thorough benchmarking. However, as AI systems integrate into domain-specific workflows, exhaustive benchmarking can become impractical, often resulting in silent or minimally communicated updates. This raises critical questions: Can users notice these updates? What cues do they rely on to distinguish between models? How do such changes affect their behavior and task performance? We address these questions through two studies in the context of facial recognition for historical photo identification: an online experiment examining users' ability to detect model updates, followed by a diary study exploring perceptions in a real-world deployment. Our findings highlight challenges in noticing AI model updates, their impact on downstream user behavior and performance, and how they lead users to develop divergent folk theories. Drawing on these insights, we discuss strategies for effectively communicating model updates in AI-infused systems.

To address this, a novel GRAG framework, Dynamic Graph Retrieval-Agumented Generation (DynaGRAG), is proposed to focus on enhancing subgraph representation and diversity within the knowledge graph. By improving graph density, capturing entity and relation information more effectively, and dynamically prioritizing relevant and diverse subgraphs and information within them, the proposed approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying semantic structure. This is achieved through a combination of de-duplication processes, two-step mean pooling of embeddings, query-aware retrieval considering unique nodes, and a Dynamic Similarity-Aware BFS (DSA-BFS) traversal algorithm. Integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) through hard prompting further enhances the learning of rich node and edge representations while preserving the hierarchical subgraph structure. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaGRAG, showcasing the significance of enhanced subgraph representation and diversity for improved language understanding and generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Tokenization is a fundamental component of large language models (LLMs), yet its influence on model scaling and performance is not fully explored. In this paper, we introduce Over-Tokenized Transformers, a novel framework that decouples input and output vocabularies to improve language modeling performance. Specifically, our approach scales up input vocabularies to leverage multi-gram tokens. Through extensive experiments, we uncover a log-linear relationship between input vocabulary size and training loss, demonstrating that larger input vocabularies consistently enhance model performance, regardless of model size. Using a large input vocabulary, we achieve performance comparable to double-sized baselines with no additional cost. Our findings highlight the importance of tokenization in scaling laws and provide practical insight for tokenizer design, paving the way for more efficient and powerful LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Test-time scaling, which is also often referred to as slow-thinking, has been demonstrated to enhance multi-step reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, despite its widespread utilization, the mechanisms underlying slow-thinking methods remain poorly understood. This paper explores the mechanisms of external slow-thinking from a theoretical standpoint. We begin by examining the snowball error effect within the LLM reasoning process and connect it to the likelihood of correct reasoning using information theory. Building on this, we show that external slow-thinking methods can be interpreted as strategies to mitigate the error probability. We further provide a comparative analysis of popular external slow-thinking approaches, ranging from simple to complex, highlighting their differences and interrelationships. Our findings suggest that the efficacy of these methods is not primarily determined by the specific framework employed, and that expanding the search scope or the model's internal reasoning capacity may yield more sustained improvements in the long term.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model powered by a large language model (LLM) provides a faster and more cost-effective solution for adapting to new data and knowledge. It also delivers more specialized responses compared to pre-trained LLMs. However, most existing approaches rely on retrieving prefix-sized chunks as references to support question-answering (Q/A). This approach is often deployed to address information needs at a single level of abstraction, as it struggles to generate answers across multiple levels of abstraction. In an RAG setting, while LLMs can summarize and answer questions effectively when provided with sufficient details, retrieving excessive information often leads to the 'lost in the middle' problem and exceeds token limitations. We propose a novel RAG approach that uses chunks of multiple abstraction levels (MAL), including multi-sentence-level, paragraph-level, section-level, and document-level. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in an under-explored scientific domain of Glycoscience. Compared to traditional single-level RAG approaches, our approach improves AI evaluated answer correctness of Q/A by 25.739\% on Glyco-related papers.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LLM-based tool agents offer natural language interfaces, enabling users to seamlessly interact with computing services. While REST APIs are valuable resources for building such agents, they must first be transformed into AI-compatible tools. Automatically generating AI-compatible tools from REST API documents can greatly streamline tool agent development and minimize user learning curves. However, API documentation often suffers from a lack of standardization, inconsistent schemas, and incomplete information. To address these issues, we developed \textbf{ToolFactory}, an open-source pipeline for automating tool generation from unstructured API documents. To enhance the reliability of the developed tools, we implemented an evaluation method to diagnose errors. Furthermore, we built a knowledge base of verified tools, which we leveraged to infer missing information from poorly documented APIs. We developed the API Extraction Benchmark, comprising 167 API documents and 744 endpoints in various formats, and designed a JSON schema to annotate them. This annotated dataset was utilized to train and validate ToolFactory. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of ToolFactory. We also demonstrated ToolFactory by creating a domain-specific AI agent for glycomaterials research. ToolFactory exhibits significant potential for facilitating the seamless integration of scientific REST APIs into AI workflows.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Causal language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their size poses significant challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Knowledge distillation, a widely-used technique for transferring knowledge from a large teacher model to a small student model, presents a promising approach for model compression. A significant remaining issue lies in the major differences between teacher and student models, namely the substantial capacity gap, mode averaging, and mode collapse, which pose barriers during distillation. To address these issues, we introduce $\textit{Temporally Adaptive Interpolated Distillation (TAID)}$, a novel knowledge distillation approach that dynamically interpolates student and teacher distributions through an adaptive intermediate distribution, gradually shifting from the student's initial distribution towards the teacher's distribution. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating TAID's ability to prevent mode collapse and empirically show its effectiveness in addressing the capacity gap while balancing mode averaging and mode collapse. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate TAID's superior performance across various model sizes and architectures in both instruction tuning and pre-training scenarios. Furthermore, we showcase TAID's practical impact by developing two state-of-the-art compact foundation models: $\texttt{TAID-LLM-1.5B}$ for language tasks and $\texttt{TAID-VLM-2B}$ for vision-language tasks. These results demonstrate TAID's effectiveness in creating high-performing and efficient models, advancing the development of more accessible AI technologies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While shared autonomy offers significant potential for assistive robotics, key questions remain about how to effectively map 2D control inputs to 6D robot motions. An intuitive framework should allow users to input commands effortlessly, with the robot responding as expected, without users needing to anticipate the impact of their inputs. In this article, we propose a dynamic input mapping framework that links joystick movements to motions on control frames defined along a trajectory encoded with canal surfaces. We evaluate our method in a user study with 20 participants, demonstrating that our input mapping framework reduces the workload and improves usability compared to a baseline mapping with similar motion encoding. To prepare for deployment in assistive scenarios, we built on the development from the accessible gaming community to select an accessible control interface. We then tested the system in an exploratory study, where three wheelchair users controlled the robot for both daily living activities and a creative painting task, demonstrating its feasibility for users closer to our target population.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Materials discovery and development are critical for addressing global challenges. Yet, the exponential growth in materials science literature comprising vast amounts of textual data has created significant bottlenecks in knowledge extraction, synthesis, and scientific reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to accelerate materials research through automated analysis and prediction. Still, their effective deployment requires domain-specific adaptation for understanding and solving domain-relevant tasks. Here, we present LLaMat, a family of foundational models for materials science developed through continued pretraining of LLaMA models on an extensive corpus of materials literature and crystallographic data. Through systematic evaluation, we demonstrate that LLaMat excels in materials-specific NLP and structured information extraction while maintaining general linguistic capabilities. The specialized LLaMat-CIF variant demonstrates unprecedented capabilities in crystal structure generation, predicting stable crystals with high coverage across the periodic table. Intriguingly, despite LLaMA-3's superior performance in comparison to LLaMA-2, we observe that LLaMat-2 demonstrates unexpectedly enhanced domain-specific performance across diverse materials science tasks, including structured information extraction from text and tables, more particularly in crystal structure generation, a potential adaptation rigidity in overtrained LLMs. Altogether, the present work demonstrates the effectiveness of domain adaptation towards developing practically deployable LLM copilots for materials research. Beyond materials science, our findings reveal important considerations for domain adaptation of LLMs, such as model selection, training methodology, and domain-specific performance, which may influence the development of specialized scientific AI systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Face detection is a computer vision application that increasingly demands lightweight models to facilitate deployment on devices with limited computational resources. Neural network pruning is a promising technique that can effectively reduce network size without significantly affecting performance. In this work, we propose a novel face detection pruning pipeline that leverages Filter Pruning via Geometric Median (FPGM) pruning, Soft Filter Pruning (SFP) and Bayesian optimization in order to achieve a superior trade-off between size and performance compared to existing approaches. FPGM pruning is a structured pruning technique that allows pruning the least significant filters in each layer, while SFP iteratively prunes the filters and allows them to be updated in any subsequent training step. Bayesian optimization is employed in order to optimize the pruning rates of each layer, rather than relying on engineering expertise to determine the optimal pruning rates for each layer. In our experiments across all three subsets of the WIDER FACE dataset, our proposed approach B-FPGM consistently outperforms existing ones in balancing model size and performance. All our experiments were applied to EResFD, the currently smallest (in number of parameters) well-performing face detector of the literature; a small ablation study with a second small face detector, EXTD, is also reported. The source code and trained pruned face detection models can be found at: https://github.com/IDTITI/B-FPGM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Denoising diffusion models have emerged as the go-to generative framework for solving inverse problems in imaging. A critical concern regarding these models is their performance on out-of-distribution tasks, which remains an under-explored challenge. Using a diffusion model on an out-of-distribution dataset, realistic reconstructions can be generated, but with hallucinating image features that are uniquely present in the training dataset. To address this discrepancy during train-test time and improve reconstruction accuracy, we introduce a novel sampling framework called Steerable Conditional Diffusion. Specifically, this framework adapts the diffusion model, concurrently with image reconstruction, based solely on the information provided by the available measurement. Utilising our proposed method, we achieve substantial enhancements in out-of-distribution performance across diverse imaging modalities, advancing the robust deployment of denoising diffusion models in real-world applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in dense retrieval have introduced vision-language model (VLM)-based retrievers, such as DSE and ColPali, which leverage document screenshots embedded as vectors to enable effective search and offer a simplified pipeline over traditional text-only methods. In this study, we propose three pixel poisoning attack methods designed to compromise VLM-based retrievers and evaluate their effectiveness under various attack settings and parameter configurations. Our empirical results demonstrate that injecting even a single adversarial screenshot into the retrieval corpus can significantly disrupt search results, poisoning the top-10 retrieved documents for 41.9% of queries in the case of DSE and 26.4% for ColPali. These vulnerability rates notably exceed those observed with equivalent attacks on text-only retrievers. Moreover, when targeting a small set of known queries, the attack success rate raises, achieving complete success in certain cases. By exposing the vulnerabilities inherent in vision-language models, this work highlights the potential risks associated with their deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) represent a significant advancement in integrating physical robots with AI-driven systems. We showcase the capabilities of our framework within the context of the real-world household competition. This research introduces a framework that utilizes RDMM (Robotics Decision-Making Models), which possess the capacity for decision-making within domain-specific contexts, as well as an awareness of their personal knowledge and capabilities. The framework leverages information to enhance the autonomous decision-making of the system. In contrast to other approaches, our focus is on real-time, on-device solutions, successfully operating on hardware with as little as 8GB of memory. Our framework incorporates visual perception models equipping robots with understanding of their environment. Additionally, the framework has integrated real-time speech recognition capabilities, thus enhancing the human-robot interaction experience. Experimental results demonstrate that the RDMM framework can plan with an 93\% accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce a new dataset consisting of 27k planning instances, as well as 1.3k text-image annotated samples derived from the competition. The framework, benchmarks, datasets, and models developed in this work are publicly available on our GitHub repository at https://github.com/shadynasrat/RDMM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing size of deep neural networks (DNNs) necessitates effective model compression to reduce their computational and memory footprints. Sparsity and quantization are two prominent compression methods that have been shown to reduce DNNs' computational and memory footprints significantly while preserving model accuracy. However, how these two methods interact when combined together remains a key question for developers, as many tacitly assume that they are orthogonal, meaning that their combined use does not introduce additional errors beyond those introduced by each method independently. In this paper, we provide the first mathematical proof that sparsity and quantization are non-orthogonal. We corroborate these results with experiments spanning a range of large language models, including the OPT and LLaMA model families (with 125M to 8B parameters), and vision models like ViT and ResNet. We show that the order in which we apply these methods matters because applying quantization before sparsity may disrupt the relative importance of tensor elements, which may inadvertently remove significant elements from a tensor. More importantly, we show that even if applied in the correct order, the compounded errors from sparsity and quantization can significantly harm accuracy. Our findings extend to the efficient deployment of large models in resource-constrained compute platforms to reduce serving cost, offering insights into best practices for applying these compression methods to maximize hardware resource efficiency without compromising accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Irony is a powerful figurative language (FL) on social media that can potentially mislead various NLP tasks, such as recommendation systems, misinformation checks, and sentiment analysis. Understanding the implicit meaning of this kind of subtle language is essential to mitigate irony's negative impact on NLP tasks. However, building models to understand irony presents a unique set of challenges, because irony is a complex form of language that often relies on context, tone, and subtle cues to convey meaning that is opposite or different from the literal interpretation. Large language models, such as ChatGPT, are increasingly able to capture implicit and contextual information. In this study, we investigate the generalization, reasoning and understanding ability of ChatGPT on irony detection across six different genre irony detection datasets. Our findings suggest that ChatGPT appears to show an enhanced language understanding and reasoning ability. But it needs to be very careful in prompt engineering design. Thus, we propose a prompt engineering design framework IDADP to achieve higher irony detection accuracy, improved understanding of irony, and more effective explanations compared to other state-of-the-art ChatGPT zero-shot approaches. And ascertain via experiments that the practice generated under the framework is likely to be the promised solution to resolve the generalization issues of LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While large language models (LLMs) have rapidly improved their performance on a broad number of tasks, they still often fall short on reasoning tasks. As LLMs become more integrated in diverse real-world tasks, advancing their reasoning capabilities is crucial to their effectiveness in nuanced, complex problems. Wang et al.'s self-consistency framework reveals that sampling multiple rationales before taking a majority vote reliably improves model performance across various closed-answer reasoning tasks. Standard methods based on this framework aggregate the final decisions of these rationales but fail to utilize the semantic information detailed in the step-by-step reasoning paths. Our work introduces semantic self-consistency, enhancing this approach by incorporating and analyzing both the reasoning paths of these rationales in addition to their final decisions before taking a majority vote. These methods not only improve the reliability of reasoning paths but also cause more robust performance on complex reasoning tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Science journalism reports current scientific discoveries to non-specialists, aiming to enable public comprehension of the state of the art. This task is challenging as the audience often lacks specific knowledge about the presented research. We propose a JRE-L framework that integrates three LLMs mimicking the writing-reading-feedback-revision loop. In JRE-L, one LLM acts as the journalist, another LLM as the general public reader, and the third LLM as an editor. The journalist's writing is iteratively refined by feedback from the reader and suggestions from the editor. Our experiments demonstrate that by leveraging the collaboration of two 7B and one 1.8B open-source LLMs, we can generate articles that are more accessible than those generated by existing methods, including prompting single advanced models such as GPT-4 and other LLM-collaboration strategies. Our code is publicly available at github.com/Zzoay/JRE-L.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Much is promised in relation to AI-supported software development. However, there has been limited evaluation effort in the research domain aimed at validating the true utility of such techniques, especially when compared to human coding outputs. We bridge this gap, where a benchmark dataset comprising 72 distinct software engineering tasks is used to compare the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) and human programmers in producing Python software code. GPT-4 is used as a representative LLM, where for the code generated by humans and this LLM, we evaluate code quality and adherence to Python coding standards, code security and vulnerabilities, code complexity and functional correctness. We use various static analysis benchmarks, including Pylint, Radon, Bandit and test cases. Among the notable outcomes, results show that human-generated code recorded higher ratings for adhering to coding standards than GPT-4. We observe security flaws in code generated by both humans and GPT-4, however, code generated by humans shows a greater variety of problems, but GPT-4 code included more severe outliers. Our results show that although GPT-4 is capable of producing coding solutions, it frequently produces more complex code that may need more reworking to ensure maintainability. On the contrary however, our outcomes show that a higher number of test cases passed for code generated by GPT-4 across a range of tasks than code that was generated by humans. That said, GPT-4 frequently struggles with complex problem-solving that involve in-depth domain knowledge. This study highlights the potential utility of LLMs for supporting software development, however, tasks requiring comprehensive, innovative or unconventional solutions, and careful debugging and error correction seem to be better developed by human programmers. We plot an agenda for the software engineering community.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we propose VideoLLaMA3, a more advanced multimodal foundation model for image and video understanding. The core design philosophy of VideoLLaMA3 is vision-centric. The meaning of "vision-centric" is two-fold: the vision-centric training paradigm and vision-centric framework design. The key insight of our vision-centric training paradigm is that high-quality image-text data is crucial for both image and video understanding. Instead of preparing massive video-text datasets, we focus on constructing large-scale and high-quality image-text datasets. VideoLLaMA3 has four training stages: 1) Vision Encoder Adaptation, which enables vision encoder to accept images of variable resolutions as input; 2) Vision-Language Alignment, which jointly tunes the vision encoder, projector, and LLM with large-scale image-text data covering multiple types (including scene images, documents, charts) as well as text-only data. 3) Multi-task Fine-tuning, which incorporates image-text SFT data for downstream tasks and video-text data to establish a foundation for video understanding. 4) Video-centric Fine-tuning, which further improves the model's capability in video understanding. As for the framework design, to better capture fine-grained details in images, the pretrained vision encoder is adapted to encode images of varying sizes into vision tokens with corresponding numbers, rather than a fixed number of tokens. For video inputs, we reduce the number of vision tokens according to their similarity so that the representation of videos will be more precise and compact. Benefit from vision-centric designs, VideoLLaMA3 achieves compelling performances in both image and video understanding benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Network fault diagnosis is a core challenge in ensuring the stability and reliability of modern network operations. Traditional approaches, limited by their training on specific performance metrics for predefined scenarios, struggle to generalize across diverse faults and anomalies in varying network environments. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across various domains. Building on this success, we propose NetSemantic, a plug-and-play intelligent network fault diagnosis framework based on LLMs. NetSemantic transforms multimodal network information into unified textual representations, enabling LLMs to perform reasoning and generate efficient fault resolutions and health assessment reports. To further enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we introduce a novel symbolic representation method that transforms logically strong network information into symbols. Additionally, we propose a self-adaptive data updating mechanism that dynamically incorporates network information into a knowledge graph to ensure the validity and timeliness of the knowledge base. Experimental results demonstrate that NetSemantic excels in network fault diagnosis across various complex scenarios, significantly improving diagnostic accuracy and reliability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Enterprise level data is often distributed across multiple sources and identifying the correct set-of data-sources with relevant information for a knowledge request is a fundamental challenge. In this work, we define the novel task of routing an end-user query to the appropriate data-source, where the data-sources are databases. We synthesize datasets by extending existing datasets designed for NL-to-SQL semantic parsing. We create baselines on these datasets by using open-source LLMs, using both pre-trained and task specific embeddings fine-tuned using the training data. With these baselines we demonstrate that open-source LLMs perform better than embedding based approach, but suffer from token length limitations. Embedding based approaches benefit from task specific fine-tuning, more so when there is availability of data in terms of database specific questions for training. We further find that the task becomes more difficult (i) with an increase in the number of data-sources, (ii) having data-sources closer in terms of their domains,(iii) having databases without external domain knowledge required to interpret its entities and (iv) with ambiguous and complex queries requiring more fine-grained understanding of the data-sources or logical reasoning for routing to an appropriate source. This calls for the need for developing more sophisticated solutions to better address the task.

These include handling complex database schemas, resolving ambiguity in user queries, and generating SQL queries with intricate structures that accurately reflect the user's intent. In this work, we introduce E-SQL, a novel pipeline specifically designed to address these challenges through direct schema linking and candidate predicate augmentation. E-SQL enhances the natural language query by incorporating relevant database items (i.e., tables, columns, and values) and conditions directly into the question and SQL construction plan, bridging the gap between the query and the database structure. The pipeline leverages candidate predicate augmentation to mitigate erroneous or incomplete predicates in generated SQLs. Comprehensive evaluations on the BIRD benchmark illustrate that E-SQL achieves competitive performance, particularly excelling in complex queries with a 66.29% execution accuracy on the test set. A further observation from our experiments reveals that incorporating schema filtering into the translation pipeline does not have a positive impact on performance when the most advanced proprietary LLMs are used. Additionally, our experiments with small LLMs highlight the importance and positive impact of enriched questions on their performance. Without fine-tuning, single-prompt SQL generation using enriched questions with DeepSeek Coder 7B Instruct 1.5v achieves 56.45% execution accuracy on the BIRD development set.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Although many efforts have been made, it is still a challenge to balance the training budget, downstream performance, and the general capabilities of the LLMs in many applications. Training the whole model for downstream tasks is expensive, and could easily result in catastrophic forgetting. By introducing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), the training cost could be reduced, but it still suffers from forgetting, and limits the learning on the downstream tasks. To efficiently fine-tune the LLMs with less limitation to their downstream performance while mitigating the forgetting of general capabilities, we propose a novel mixture of expert (MoE) framework based on Soft LoRA and Identity Mixture (SLIM), that allows dynamic routing between LoRA adapters and skipping connection, enables the suppression of forgetting. We adopt weight-yielding with sliding clustering for better out-of-domain distinguish to enhance the routing. We also propose to convert the mixture of low-rank adapters to the model merging formulation and introduce fast dynamic merging of LoRA adapters to keep the general capabilities of the base model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SLIM is comparable to the state-of-the-art PEFT approaches on the downstream tasks while achieving the leading performance in mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a prominent technique within the framework of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), efficiently reduces the computational burden associated with adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, thereby enabling resource-constrained fine-tuning. However, existing researches have shown that LoRA suffers from slow convergence. To address this limitation, we introduce Dimension-Sharding Adaptation (DiSHA), which expands the PEFT design space to even fewer trainable parameters and faster convergence. Within DiSHA's design space, we propose Block Affine Efficient Computation (Bone), a computationally efficient structure that delivers both high performance and efficiency. While certain DiSHA configurations may result in colinear updates to weight shards, we address this with Block Affine Transformation (Bat), a nonlinear variant of DiSHA. Bat introduces nonlinearity by combining trainable matrices with original weight shards in a nonlinear manner, inducing nonlinearity in matrix updates without introducing additional parameters. Empirical results show that Bone, under the DiSHA framework, consistently outperforms LoRA variants in both Natural Language Understanding and Natural Language Generation tasks, with significantly improved computational efficiency. Further analysis demonstrates that BAT enhances model capabilities by leveraging its nonlinear design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Serving systems for Large Language Models (LLMs) improve throughput by processing several requests concurrently. However, multiplexing hardware resources between concurrent requests involves non-trivial scheduling decisions. Practical serving systems typically implement these decisions at two levels: First, a load balancer routes requests to different servers which each hold a replica of the LLM. Then, on each server, an engine-level scheduler decides when to run a request, or when to queue or preempt it. Improved scheduling policies may benefit a wide range of LLM deployments and can often be implemented as "drop-in replacements" to a system's current policy. In this work, we survey scheduling techniques from the literature and from practical serving systems. We find that schedulers from the literature often achieve good performance but introduce significant complexity. In contrast, schedulers in practical deployments often leave easy performance gains on the table but are easy to implement, deploy and configure. This finding motivates us to introduce two new scheduling techniques, which are both easy to implement, and outperform current techniques on production workload traces.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to video understanding presents significant challenges due to the need to model temporal relations across frames. Existing approaches adopt either implicit temporal modeling, relying solely on the LLM decoder, or explicit temporal modeling, employing auxiliary temporal encoders. To investigate this debate between the two paradigms, we propose the Stackable Temporal Encoder (STE). STE enables flexible explicit temporal modeling with adjustable temporal receptive fields and token compression ratios. Using STE, we systematically compare implicit and explicit temporal modeling across dimensions such as overall performance, token compression effectiveness, and temporal-specific understanding. We also explore STE's design considerations and broader impacts as a plug-in module and in image modalities. Our findings emphasize the critical role of explicit temporal modeling, providing actionable insights to advance video MLLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapidly expanding Internet of Things (IoT) landscape is shifting toward cloudless architectures, removing reliance on centralized cloud services but exposing devices directly to the internet and increasing their vulnerability to cyberattacks. Our research revealed an unexpected pattern of substantial Tor network traffic targeting cloudless IoT devices. suggesting that attackers are using Tor to anonymously exploit undisclosed vulnerabilities (possibly obtained from underground markets). To delve deeper into this phenomenon, we developed TORCHLIGHT, a tool designed to detect both known and unknown threats targeting cloudless IoT devices by analyzing Tor traffic. TORCHLIGHT filters traffic via specific IP patterns, strategically deploys virtual private server (VPS) nodes for cost-effective detection, and uses a chain-of-thought (CoT) process with large language models (LLMs) for accurate threat identification.   Our results are significant: for the first time, we have demonstrated that attackers are indeed using Tor to conceal their identities while targeting cloudless IoT devices. Over a period of 12 months, TORCHLIGHT analyzed 26 TB of traffic, revealing 45 vulnerabilities, including 29 zero-day exploits with 25 CVE-IDs assigned (5 CRITICAL, 3 HIGH, 16 MEDIUM, and 1 LOW) and an estimated value of approximately $312,000. These vulnerabilities affect around 12.71 million devices across 148 countries, exposing them to severe risks such as information disclosure, authentication bypass, and arbitrary command execution. The findings have attracted significant attention, sparking widespread discussion in cybersecurity circles, reaching the top 25 on Hacker News, and generating over 190,000 views.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces a continuous-time stochastic dynamical framework for understanding how large language models (LLMs) may self-amplify latent biases or toxicity through their own chain-of-thought reasoning. The model posits an instantaneous "severity" variable $x(t) \in [0,1]$ evolving under a stochastic differential equation (SDE) with a drift term $\mu(x)$ and diffusion $\sigma(x)$. Crucially, such a process can be consistently analyzed via the Fokker--Planck approach if each incremental step behaves nearly Markovian in severity space. The analysis investigates critical phenomena, showing that certain parameter regimes create phase transitions from subcritical (self-correcting) to supercritical (runaway severity). The paper derives stationary distributions, first-passage times to harmful thresholds, and scaling laws near critical points. Finally, it highlights implications for agents and extended LLM reasoning models: in principle, these equations might serve as a basis for formal verification of whether a model remains stable or propagates bias over repeated inferences.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Incorporating responsible practices into software engineering (SE) for AI is essential to ensure ethical principles, societal impact, and accountability remain at the forefront of AI system design and deployment. This study investigates the ethical challenges and complexities inherent in responsible software engineering (RSE) for AI, underscoring the need for practical,scenario-driven operational guidelines. Given the complexity of AI and the relative inexperience of professionals in this rapidly evolving field, continuous learning and market adaptation are crucial. Through qualitative interviews with seven practitioners(conducted until saturation), quantitative surveys of 51 practitioners, and static validation of results with four industry experts in AI, this study explores how personal values, emerging roles, and awareness of AIs societal impact influence responsible decision-making in RSE for AI. A key finding is the gap between the current state of the art and actual practice in RSE for AI, particularly in the failure to operationalize ethical and responsible decision-making within the software engineering life cycle for AI. While ethical issues in RSE for AI largely mirror those found in broader SE process, the study highlights a distinct lack of operational frameworks and resources to guide RSE practices for AI effectively. The results reveal that current ethical guidelines are insufficiently implemented at the operational level, reinforcing the complexity of embedding ethics throughout the software engineering life cycle. The study concludes that interdisciplinary collaboration, H-shaped competencies(Ethical-Technical dual competence), and a strong organizational culture of ethics are critical for fostering RSE practices for AI, with a particular focus on transparency and accountability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language model-based multi-agent systems have shown great abilities across various tasks due to the collaboration of expert agents, each focusing on a specific domain. However, the impact of clumsy or even malicious agents, i.e., those who frequently make errors in their tasks, on the overall performance of the system remains underexplored. This paper investigates: (1) What is the resilience of various system structures (e.g., A$\rightarrow$B$\rightarrow$C, A$\leftrightarrow$B$\leftrightarrow$C) under faulty agents, on different downstream tasks? (2) How can we increase system resilience to defend against these agents? To simulate faulty agents, we propose two approaches, AutoTransform and AutoInject, which introduce mistakes into the agents' responses. We select four downstream tasks, including code generation, math problems, translation, and text evaluation. Results suggest that the hierarchical structure, i.e., A$\rightarrow$(B$\leftrightarrow$C), exhibits superior resilience with the lowest performance drop of $9.2\%$, compared to $26.0\%$ and $31.2\%$ of other two structures. Additionally, we improve the system resilience with two methods, introducing a mechanism for each agent to challenge others' outputs, and an additional agent to review and correct messages.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities in various scenarios. However, they suffer from much redundant information and are sensitive to the position of key information in long context scenarios. To address these challenges, we present Perception Compressor, a training-free prompt compression framework. It includes a perception retriever that leverages guiding questions and instruction to retrieve the most relevant demonstrations, a dual-slope ratio allocator to dynamically allocate compression ratios and open-book ratios, and a semi-guided iterative compression that retains key information at the token level while removing tokens that distract the LLM. We conduct extensive experiments on long context benchmarks, i.e., NaturalQuestions, LongBench, and MuSiQue. Experiment results show that Perception Compressor outperforms existing methods by a large margin, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised increasing concerns about their misuse in generating hate speech. Among all the efforts to address this issue, hate speech detectors play a crucial role. However, the effectiveness of different detectors against LLM-generated hate speech remains largely unknown. In this paper, we propose HateBench, a framework for benchmarking hate speech detectors on LLM-generated hate speech. We first construct a hate speech dataset of 7,838 samples generated by six widely-used LLMs covering 34 identity groups, with meticulous annotations by three labelers. We then assess the effectiveness of eight representative hate speech detectors on the LLM-generated dataset. Our results show that while detectors are generally effective in identifying LLM-generated hate speech, their performance degrades with newer versions of LLMs. We also reveal the potential of LLM-driven hate campaigns, a new threat that LLMs bring to the field of hate speech detection. By leveraging advanced techniques like adversarial attacks and model stealing attacks, the adversary can intentionally evade the detector and automate hate campaigns online. The most potent adversarial attack achieves an attack success rate of 0.966, and its attack efficiency can be further improved by $13-21\times$ through model stealing attacks with acceptable attack performance. We hope our study can serve as a call to action for the research community and platform moderators to fortify defenses against these emerging threats.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements but also raise concerns about cultural bias, often reflecting dominant narratives at the expense of under-represented subcultures. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of LLMs to recognize and accurately respond to the Little Traditions within Indian society, encompassing localized cultural practices and subcultures such as caste, kinship, marriage, and religion. Through a series of case studies, we assess whether LLMs can balance the interplay between dominant Great Traditions and localized Little Traditions. We explore various prompting strategies and further investigate whether using prompts in regional languages enhances the models cultural sensitivity and response quality. Our findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate an ability to articulate cultural nuances, they often struggle to apply this understanding in practical, context-specific scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze LLMs engagement with Indian subcultures, offering critical insights into the challenges of embedding cultural diversity in AI systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text watermarking for Large Language Models (LLMs) has made significant progress in detecting LLM outputs and preventing misuse. Current watermarking techniques offer high detectability, minimal impact on text quality, and robustness to text editing. However, current researches lack investigation into the imperceptibility of watermarking techniques in LLM services. This is crucial as LLM providers may not want to disclose the presence of watermarks in real-world scenarios, as it could reduce user willingness to use the service and make watermarks more vulnerable to attacks. This work is the first to investigate the imperceptibility of watermarked LLMs. We design an identification algorithm called Water-Probe that detects watermarks through well-designed prompts to the LLM. Our key motivation is that current watermarked LLMs expose consistent biases under the same watermark key, resulting in similar differences across prompts under different watermark keys. Experiments show that almost all mainstream watermarking algorithms are easily identified with our well-designed prompts, while Water-Probe demonstrates a minimal false positive rate for non-watermarked LLMs. Finally, we propose that the key to enhancing the imperceptibility of watermarked LLMs is to increase the randomness of watermark key selection. Based on this, we introduce the Water-Bag strategy, which significantly improves watermark imperceptibility by merging multiple watermark keys.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces a scalable Anomaly Detection Service with a generalizable API tailored for industrial time-series data, designed to assist Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) in managing cloud infrastructure. The service enables efficient anomaly detection in complex data streams, supporting proactive identification and resolution of issues. Furthermore, it presents an innovative approach to anomaly modeling in cloud infrastructure by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand key components, their failure modes, and behaviors. A suite of algorithms for detecting anomalies is offered in univariate and multivariate time series data, including regression-based, mixture-model-based, and semi-supervised approaches. We provide insights into the usage patterns of the service, with over 500 users and 200,000 API calls in a year. The service has been successfully applied in various industrial settings, including IoT-based AI applications. We have also evaluated our system on public anomaly benchmarks to show its effectiveness. By leveraging it, SREs can proactively identify potential issues before they escalate, reducing downtime and improving response times to incidents, ultimately enhancing the overall customer experience. We plan to extend the system to include time series foundation models, enabling zero-shot anomaly detection capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is commonly employed to tailor models to human preferences, especially to improve the safety of outputs from large language models (LLMs). Traditionally, this method depends on selecting preferred responses from pairs. However, due to the variability in human opinions and the challenges in directly comparing two responses, there is an increasing trend towards fine-grained annotation approaches that evaluate responses using multiple targeted metrics or rules. The challenge lies in efficiently choosing and applying these rules to handle the diverse range of preference data. In this paper, we propose a dynamic method that adaptively selects the most important rules for each response pair. We introduce a mathematical framework that utilizes the maximum discrepancy across paired responses and demonstrate theoretically that this approach maximizes the mutual information between the rule-based annotations and the underlying true preferences. We then train an 8B reward model using this adaptively labeled preference dataset and assess its efficacy using RewardBench. As of January 25, 2025, our model achieved the highest safety performance on the leaderboard, surpassing various larger models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has set a new standard in interactive image segmentation, offering robust performance across various tasks. However, its significant computational requirements limit its deployment in real-time or resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel knowledge distillation approach, KD SAM, which incorporates both encoder and decoder optimization through a combination of Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Perceptual Loss. This dual-loss framework captures structural and semantic features, enabling the student model to maintain high segmentation accuracy while reducing computational complexity. Based on the model evaluation on datasets, including Kvasir-SEG, ISIC 2017, Fetal Head Ultrasound, and Breast Ultrasound, we demonstrate that KD SAM achieves comparable or superior performance to the baseline models, with significantly fewer parameters. KD SAM effectively balances segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency, making it well-suited for real-time medical image segmentation applications in resource-constrained environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The growing complexity of network traffic and demand for ultra-low latency communication require smarter packet traffic management. Existing Deep Learning-based queuing approaches struggle with dynamic network scenarios and demand high engineering effort. We propose AQM-LLM, distilling Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot learning, contextual understanding, and pattern recognition to improve Active Queue Management (AQM) [RFC 9330] with minimal manual effort. We consider a specific case where AQM is Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable Throughput (L4S) and our design of AQM-LLM builds on speculative decoding and reinforcement-based distilling of LLM by tackling congestion prevention in the L4S architecture using Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [RFC 9331] and periodic packet dropping. We develop a new open-source experimental platform by executing L4S-AQM on FreeBSD-14, providing interoperable modules to support LLM integration and facilitate IETF recognition through wider testing. Our extensive evaluations show L4S-LLM enhances queue management, prevents congestion, reduces latency, and boosts network performance, showcasing LLMs' adaptability and efficiency in uplifting AQM systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Safety alignment mechanism are essential for preventing large language models (LLMs) from generating harmful information or unethical content. However, cleverly crafted prompts can bypass these safety measures without accessing the model's internal parameters, a phenomenon known as black-box jailbreak. Existing heuristic black-box attack methods, such as genetic algorithms, suffer from limited effectiveness due to their inherent randomness, while recent reinforcement learning (RL) based methods often lack robust and informative reward signals. To address these challenges, we propose a novel black-box jailbreak method leveraging RL, which optimizes prompt generation by analyzing the embedding proximity between benign and malicious prompts. This approach ensures that the rewritten prompts closely align with the intent of the original prompts while enhancing the attack's effectiveness. Furthermore, we introduce a comprehensive jailbreak evaluation framework incorporating keywords, intent matching, and answer validation to provide a more rigorous and holistic assessment of jailbreak success. Experimental results show the superiority of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on several prominent open and closed-source LLMs, including Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, and GPT-4o-0806. Our method sets a new benchmark in jailbreak attack effectiveness, highlighting potential vulnerabilities in LLMs. The codebase for this work is available at https://github.com/Aegis1863/xJailbreak.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Semantic communications aim to enhance transmission efficiency by jointly optimizing source coding, channel coding, and modulation. While prior research has demonstrated promising performance in simulations, real-world implementations often face significant challenges, including noise variability and nonlinear distortions, leading to performance gaps. This article investigates these challenges in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based semantic communication system, focusing on the practical impacts of power amplifier (PA) nonlinearity and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) variations. Our analysis identifies frequency selectivity of the actual channel as a critical factor in performance degradation and demonstrates that targeted mitigation strategies can enable semantic systems to approach theoretical performance. By addressing key limitations in existing designs, we provide actionable insights for advancing semantic communications in practical wireless environments. This work establishes a foundation for bridging the gap between theoretical models and real-world deployment, highlighting essential considerations for system design and optimization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of using large language language models (LLMs) in passage ranking. The listwise approaches, such as RankGPT, have become new state-of-the-art in this task. However, the efficiency of RankGPT models is limited by the maximum context length and relatively high latency of LLM inference. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose PE-Rank, leveraging the single passage embedding as a good context compression for efficient listwise passage reranking. By treating each passage as a special token, we can directly input passage embeddings into LLMs, thereby reducing input length. Additionally, we introduce an inference method that dynamically constrains the decoding space to these special tokens, accelerating the decoding process. For adapting the model to reranking, we employ listwise learning to rank loss for training. Evaluation results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PE-Rank significantly improves efficiency in both prefilling and decoding, while maintaining competitive ranking effectiveness. The Code is available at https://github.com/liuqi6777/pe_rank.

The structural model can be identified by sign, zero, and narrative restrictions, including a novel solution, making it possible to use the three types of restrictions at once. The package facilitates predictive and structural analyses using impulse responses, forecast error variance and historical decompositions, forecasting and conditional forecasting, as well as analyses of structural shocks and fitted values. All this is complemented by colourful plots, user-friendly summary functions, and comprehensive documentation. The package was granted the Di Cook Open-Source Statistical Software Award by the Statistical Society of Australia in 2024.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> 3D vision and spatial reasoning have long been recognized as preferable for accurately perceiving our three-dimensional world, especially when compared with traditional visual reasoning based on 2D images. Due to the difficulties in collecting high-quality 3D data, research in this area has only recently gained momentum. With the advent of powerful large language models (LLMs), multi-modal LLMs for 3D vision have been developed over the past few years. However, most of these models focus primarily on the vision encoder for 3D data. In this paper, we propose converting existing densely activated LLMs into mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, which have proven effective for multi-modal data processing. In addition to leveraging these models' instruction-following capabilities, we further enable embodied task planning by attaching a diffusion head, Pose-DiT, that employs a novel rectified flow diffusion scheduler. Experimental results on 3D question answering and task-planning tasks demonstrate that our 3D-MoE framework achieves improved performance with fewer activated parameters.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in various tasks but struggle with hallucination problems and lack of relevant knowledge, especially in deep complex reasoning and knowledge-intensive tasks. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which capture vast amounts of facts in a structured format, offer a reliable source of knowledge for reasoning. However, existing KG-based LLM reasoning methods face challenges like handling multi-hop reasoning, multi-entity questions, and effectively utilizing graph structures. To address these issues, we propose Paths-over-Graph (PoG), a novel method that enhances LLM reasoning by integrating knowledge reasoning paths from KGs, improving the interpretability and faithfulness of LLM outputs. PoG tackles multi-hop and multi-entity questions through a three-phase dynamic multi-hop path exploration, which combines the inherent knowledge of LLMs with factual knowledge from KGs. In order to improve the efficiency, PoG prunes irrelevant information from the graph exploration first and introduces efficient three-step pruning techniques that incorporate graph structures, LLM prompting, and a pre-trained language model (e.g., SBERT) to effectively narrow down the explored candidate paths. This ensures all reasoning paths contain highly relevant information captured from KGs, making the reasoning faithful and interpretable in problem-solving. PoG innovatively utilizes graph structure to prune the irrelevant noise and represents the first method to implement multi-entity deep path detection on KGs for LLM reasoning tasks. Comprehensive experiments on five benchmark KGQA datasets demonstrate PoG outperforms the state-of-the-art method ToG across GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 18.9%. Notably, PoG with GPT-3.5-Turbo surpasses ToG with GPT-4 by up to 23.9%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Personalized news headline generation aims to provide users with attention-grabbing headlines that are tailored to their preferences. Prevailing methods focus on user-oriented content preferences, but most of them overlook the fact that diverse stylistic preferences are integral to users' panoramic interests, leading to suboptimal personalization. In view of this, we propose a novel Stylistic-Content Aware Personalized Headline Generation (SCAPE) framework. SCAPE extracts both content and stylistic features from headlines with the aid of large language model (LLM) collaboration. It further adaptively integrates users' long- and short-term interests through a contrastive learning-based hierarchical fusion network. By incorporating the panoramic interests into the headline generator, SCAPE reflects users' stylistic-content preferences during the generation process. Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset PENS demonstrate the superiority of SCAPE over baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Optimizing software performance through automated code refinement offers a promising avenue for enhancing execution speed and efficiency. Despite recent advancements in LLMs, a significant gap remains in their ability to perform in-depth program analysis. This study introduces AUTOPATCH, an in-context learning approach designed to bridge this gap by enabling LLMs to automatically generate optimized code. Inspired by how programmers learn and apply knowledge to optimize software, AUTOPATCH incorporates three key components: (1) an analogy-driven framework to align LLM optimization with human cognitive processes, (2) a unified approach that integrates historical code examples and CFG analysis for context-aware learning, and (3) an automated pipeline for generating optimized code through in-context prompting. Experimental results demonstrate that AUTOPATCH achieves a 7.3% improvement in execution efficiency over GPT-4o across common generated executable code, highlighting its potential to advance automated program runtime optimization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose affine concept editing (ACE) as an approach for steering language models' behavior by intervening directly in activations. We begin with an affine decomposition of model activation vectors and show that prior methods for steering model behavior correspond to subsets of terms of this decomposition. We then provide a derivation of ACE and use it to control refusal behavior on ten different models, including Llama 3 70B. ACE combines affine subspace projection and activation addition to reliably control the model's refusal responses across prompt types. We evaluate the results using LLM-based scoring on a collection of harmful and harmless prompts. Our experiments demonstrate that ACE consistently achieves more precise control over model behavior than existing methods and generalizes to models where directional ablation via affine subspace projection alone produces incoherent outputs. Code for reproducing our results is available at https://github.com/EleutherAI/steering-llama3 .

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Artificial intelligence requires deliberate reasoning, temporal awareness, and effective constraint management, capabilities beyond the pattern-matching strengths of LLMs. LLMs struggle with planning tasks because of their reliance on associative reasoning, inability to self-verify, and inconsistent constraint awareness. We propose Multi-Agent Collaborative Intelligence (MACI), a framework centered on a meta-planner (MP) that orchestrates multiple agents to generate planner templates that define roles and constraints. These planners produce actionable workflows of role nodes and dependency constraints, enabling advanced temporal reasoning and adaptability.   MACI's three-tier architecture includes a meta-planning module for planner construction, common agents for general reasoning, and specialized agents for domain expertise. By decoupling planning from validation, it overcomes key LLM limitations. Evaluations demonstrate MACI's effective constraint satisfaction, conflict detection, and reasoning, positioning it as a robust solution for complex reasoning and planning tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but require careful alignment with human preferences. Traditional training-time methods finetune LLMs using human preference datasets but incur significant training costs and require repeated training to handle diverse user preferences. Test-time alignment methods address this by using reward models (RMs) to guide frozen LLMs without retraining. However, existing test-time approaches rely on trajectory-level RMs which are designed to evaluate complete responses, making them unsuitable for autoregressive text generation that requires computing next-token rewards from partial responses. To address this, we introduce GenARM, a test-time alignment approach that leverages the Autoregressive Reward Model--a novel reward parametrization designed to predict next-token rewards for efficient and effective autoregressive generation. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this parametrization can provably guide frozen LLMs toward any distribution achievable by traditional RMs within the KL-regularized reinforcement learning framework. Experimental results show that GenARM significantly outperforms prior test-time alignment baselines and matches the performance of training-time methods. Additionally, GenARM enables efficient weak-to-strong guidance, aligning larger LLMs with smaller RMs without the high costs of training larger models. Furthermore, GenARM supports multi-objective alignment, allowing real-time trade-offs between preference dimensions and catering to diverse user preferences without retraining.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities of generating texts resembling human language. However, they can be misused by criminals to create deceptive content, such as fake news and phishing emails, which raises ethical concerns. Watermarking is a key technique to address these concerns, which embeds a message (e.g., a bit string) into a text generated by an LLM. By embedding the user ID (represented as a bit string) into generated texts, we can trace generated texts to the user, known as content source tracing. The major limitation of existing watermarking techniques is that they achieve sub-optimal performance for content source tracing in real-world scenarios. The reason is that they cannot accurately or efficiently extract a long message from a generated text. We aim to address the limitations.   In this work, we introduce a new watermarking method for LLM-generated text grounded in pseudo-random segment assignment. We also propose multiple techniques to further enhance the robustness of our watermarking algorithm. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our method. Our experimental results show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness on benchmark datasets. For instance, when embedding a message of length 20 into a 200-token generated text, our method achieves a match rate of $97.6\%$, while the state-of-the-art work Yoo et al. only achieves $49.2\%$. Additionally, we prove that our watermark can tolerate edits within an edit distance of 17 on average for each paragraph under the same setting.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped natural language processing, powering applications from multi-hop retrieval and question answering to autonomous agent workflows. Yet, prompt engineering -- the task of crafting textual inputs to effectively direct LLMs -- remains difficult and labor-intensive, particularly for complex pipelines that combine multiple LLM calls with functional operations like retrieval and data formatting. We introduce LLM-AutoDiff: a novel framework for Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) that extends textual gradient-based methods (such as Text-Grad) to multi-component, potentially cyclic LLM architectures. Implemented within the AdalFlow library, LLM-AutoDiff treats each textual input as a trainable parameter and uses a frozen backward engine LLM to generate feedback-akin to textual gradients -- that guide iterative prompt updates. Unlike prior single-node approaches, LLM-AutoDiff inherently accommodates functional nodes, preserves time-sequential behavior in repeated calls (e.g., multi-hop loops), and combats the "lost-in-the-middle" problem by isolating distinct sub-prompts (instructions, formats, or few-shot examples). It further boosts training efficiency by focusing on error-prone samples through selective gradient computation. Across diverse tasks, including single-step classification, multi-hop retrieval-based QA, and agent-driven pipelines, LLM-AutoDiff consistently outperforms existing textual gradient baselines in both accuracy and training cost. By unifying prompt optimization through a graph-centric lens, LLM-AutoDiff offers a powerful new paradigm for scaling and automating LLM workflows - mirroring the transformative role that automatic differentiation libraries have long played in neural network research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Methods to ensure factual accuracy of text generated by large language models (LLM) in clinical medicine are lacking. VeriFact is an artificial intelligence system that combines retrieval-augmented generation and LLM-as-a-Judge to verify whether LLM-generated text is factually supported by a patient's medical history based on their electronic health record (EHR). To evaluate this system, we introduce VeriFact-BHC, a new dataset that decomposes Brief Hospital Course narratives from discharge summaries into a set of simple statements with clinician annotations for whether each statement is supported by the patient's EHR clinical notes. Whereas highest agreement between clinicians was 88.5%, VeriFact achieves up to 92.7% agreement when compared to a denoised and adjudicated average human clinican ground truth, suggesting that VeriFact exceeds the average clinician's ability to fact-check text against a patient's medical record. VeriFact may accelerate the development of LLM-based EHR applications by removing current evaluation bottlenecks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Detecting and localizing anomalies in cyber-physical systems (CPS) has become increasingly challenging as systems grow in complexity, particularly due to varying sensor reliability and node failures in distributed environments. While federated learning (FL) provides a foundation for distributed model training, existing approaches often lack mechanisms to address these CPS-specific challenges. This paper introduces an enhanced FL framework with three key innovations: adaptive model aggregation based on sensor reliability, dynamic node selection for resource optimization, and Weibull-based checkpointing for fault tolerance. The proposed framework ensures reliable condition monitoring while tackling the computational and reliability challenges of industrial CPS deployments. Experiments on the NASA Bearing and Hydraulic System datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art FL methods, achieving 99.5% AUC-ROC in anomaly detection and maintaining accuracy even under node failures. Statistical validation using the Mann-Whitney U test confirms significant improvements, with a p-value less than 0.05, in both detection accuracy and computational efficiency across various operational scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mining and conveying actionable insights from complex data is a key challenge of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and storytelling. To address this challenge, we present a design space for actionable EDA and storytelling. Synthesizing theory and expert interviews, we highlight how semantic precision, rhetorical persuasion, and pragmatic relevance underpin effective EDA and storytelling. We also show how this design space subsumes common challenges in actionable EDA and storytelling, such as identifying appropriate analytical strategies and leveraging relevant domain knowledge. Building on the potential of LLMs to generate coherent narratives with commonsense reasoning, we contribute Jupybara, an AI-enabled assistant for actionable EDA and storytelling implemented as a Jupyter Notebook extension. Jupybara employs two strategies -- design-space-aware prompting and multi-agent architectures -- to operationalize our design space. An expert evaluation confirms Jupybara's usability, steerability, explainability, and reparability, as well as the effectiveness of our strategies in operationalizing the design space framework with LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way forward for automating software engineering tasks, such as bug fixes, feature additions, etc., via multi-step LLM-based agentic workflows. However, existing metrics for evaluating such workflows, mainly build status and occasionally log analysis, are too sparse and limited in providing the information needed to assess the quality of changes made. In this work, we designed LLM-based critics to derive well-structured and rigorous intermediate/step-level, execution-free evaluation proxies for repo-level code changes. Importantly, we assume access to the gold test patch for the problem (i.e., reference-aware) to assess both semantics and executability of generated patches. With the gold test patch as a reference, we predict executability of all editing locations with an F1 score of 91.6%, aggregating which, we can predict the build status in 84.8% of the instances in SWE-bench. In particular, such an execution-focused LLM critic outperforms other reference-free and reference-aware LLM critics by 38.9% to 72.5%. Moreover, we demonstrate the usefulness of such a reference-aware framework in comparing patches generated by different agentic workflows. Finally, we open-source the library developed for this project, which allows further usage for either other agentic workflows or other benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce a novel index, the Distribution of Cosine Similarity (DOCS), for quantitatively assessing the similarity between weight matrices in Large Language Models (LLMs), aiming to facilitate the analysis of their complex architectures. Leveraging DOCS, our analysis uncovers intriguing patterns in the latest open-source LLMs: adjacent layers frequently exhibit high weight similarity and tend to form clusters, suggesting depth-wise functional specialization. Additionally, we prove that DOCS is theoretically effective in quantifying similarity for orthogonal matrices, a crucial aspect given the prevalence of orthogonal initializations in LLMs. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of LLM architecture and behavior, offering tools with potential implications for developing more efficient and interpretable models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Handling multi-party dialogues represents a significant step for advancing spoken dialogue systems, necessitating the development of tasks specific to multi-party interactions. To address this challenge, we are constructing a multi-modal multi-party dialogue corpus of triadic (three-participant) discussions. This paper focuses on the task of addressee recognition, identifying who is being addressed to take the next turn, a critical component unique to multi-party dialogue systems. A subset of the corpus was annotated with addressee information, revealing that explicit addressees are indicated in approximately 20% of conversational turns. To evaluate the task's complexity, we benchmarked the performance of a large language model (GPT-4o) on addressee recognition. The results showed that GPT-4o achieved an accuracy only marginally above chance, underscoring the challenges of addressee recognition in multi-party dialogue. These findings highlight the need for further research to enhance the capabilities of large language models in understanding and navigating the intricacies of multi-party conversational dynamics.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Laughter serves as a multifaceted communicative signal in human interaction, yet its identification within dialogue presents a significant challenge for conversational AI systems. This study addresses this challenge by annotating laughable contexts in Japanese spontaneous text conversation data and developing a taxonomy to classify the underlying reasons for such contexts. Initially, multiple annotators manually labeled laughable contexts using a binary decision (laughable or non-laughable). Subsequently, an LLM was used to generate explanations for the binary annotations of laughable contexts, which were then categorized into a taxonomy comprising ten categories, including "Empathy and Affinity" and "Humor and Surprise," highlighting the diverse range of laughter-inducing scenarios. The study also evaluated GPT-4's performance in recognizing the majority labels of laughable contexts, achieving an F1 score of 43.14%. These findings contribute to the advancement of conversational AI by establishing a foundation for more nuanced recognition and generation of laughter, ultimately fostering more natural and engaging human-AI interactions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) still struggle with hallucinations despite their impressive capabilities. Recent studies have attempted to mitigate this by applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to multimodal scenarios using preference pairs from text-based responses. However, our analysis of representation distributions reveals that multimodal DPO struggles to align image and text representations and to distinguish between hallucinated and non-hallucinated descriptions. To address these challenges, in this work, we propose a Cross-modal Hierarchical Direct Preference Optimization (CHiP) to address these limitations. We introduce a visual preference optimization module within the DPO framework, enabling MLLMs to learn from both textual and visual preferences simultaneously. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical textual preference optimization module that allows the model to capture preferences at multiple granular levels, including response, segment, and token levels. We evaluate CHiP through both quantitative and qualitative analyses, with results across multiple benchmarks demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing hallucinations. On the Object HalBench dataset, CHiP outperforms DPO in hallucination reduction, achieving improvements of 52.7% and 55.5% relative points based on the base model Muffin and LLaVA models, respectively. We make all our datasets and code publicly available: https://github.com/LVUGAI/CHiP.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Human beings often experience stress, which can significantly influence their performance. This study explores whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit stress responses similar to those of humans and whether their performance fluctuates under different stress-inducing prompts. To investigate this, we developed a novel set of prompts, termed StressPrompt, designed to induce varying levels of stress. These prompts were derived from established psychological frameworks and carefully calibrated based on ratings from human participants. We then applied these prompts to several LLMs to assess their responses across a range of tasks, including instruction-following, complex reasoning, and emotional intelligence. The findings suggest that LLMs, like humans, perform optimally under moderate stress, consistent with the Yerkes-Dodson law. Notably, their performance declines under both low and high-stress conditions. Our analysis further revealed that these StressPrompts significantly alter the internal states of LLMs, leading to changes in their neural representations that mirror human responses to stress. This research provides critical insights into the operational robustness and flexibility of LLMs, demonstrating the importance of designing AI systems capable of maintaining high performance in real-world scenarios where stress is prevalent, such as in customer service, healthcare, and emergency response contexts. Moreover, this study contributes to the broader AI research community by offering a new perspective on how LLMs handle different scenarios and their similarities to human cognition.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a useful tool for uncovering human-interpretable features in the activations of large language models (LLMs). While some expect SAEs to find the true underlying features used by a model, our research shows that SAEs trained on the same model and data, differing only in the random seed used to initialize their weights, identify different sets of features. For example, in an SAE with 131K latents trained on a feedforward network in Llama 3 8B, only 30% of the features were shared across different seeds. We observed this phenomenon across multiple layers of three different LLMs, two datasets, and several SAE architectures. While ReLU SAEs trained with the L1 sparsity loss showed greater stability across seeds, SAEs using the state-of-the-art TopK activation function were more seed-dependent, even when controlling for the level of sparsity. Our results suggest that the set of features uncovered by an SAE should be viewed as a pragmatically useful decomposition of activation space, rather than an exhaustive and universal list of features "truly used" by the model.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication has led to immense enhancements in data rates and efficient spectrum management. The evolution of MIMO has been accompanied by increased hardware complexity and array sizes, causing system power consumption to rise as a result. Despite past advances in power-efficient hybrid architectures, new solutions are needed to enable extremely large-scale MIMO deployments for 6G and beyond. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture that integrates low-power reconfigurable antennas with both digital and analog precoding. This \emph{tri-hybrid} approach addresses key limitations in traditional and hybrid MIMO systems by improving power consumption and adding new layer for signal processing. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the proposed architecture and compare its performance with existing solutions, including fully-digital and hybrid MIMO systems. The results demonstrate significant improvements in energy efficiency, highlighting the potential of the tri-hybrid system to meet the growing demands of future wireless networks. We also discuss several design and implementation challenges, including the need for technological advancements in reconfigurable array hardware and tunable antenna parameters.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text-to-SQL is a fundamental and longstanding problem in the NLP area, aiming at converting natural language queries into SQL, enabling non-expert users to operate databases. Recent advances in LLM have greatly improved text-to-SQL performance. However, challenges persist, especially when dealing with complex user queries. Current approaches (e.g., COT prompting and multi-agent frameworks) rely on the ability of models to plan and generate SQL autonomously, but controlling performance remains difficult. In addition, LLMs are still prone to hallucinations. To alleviate these challenges, we designed a novel MCTS-SQL to guide SQL generation iteratively. The approach generates SQL queries through Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a heuristic self-refinement mechanism are used to enhance accuracy and reliability. Key components include a schema selector for extracting relevant information and an MCTS-based generator for iterative query refinement. Experimental results from the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks show that MCTS-SQL achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, on the BIRD development dataset, MCTS-SQL achieves an Execution (EX) accuracy of 69.40% using GPT-4o as the base model and a significant improvement when dealing with challenging tasks, with an EX of 51.48%, which is 3.41% higher than the existing method.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs), or foundation models (FMs), are pretrained transformers that coherently complete sentences auto-regressively. In this paper, we show that LLMs can control simplified space systems after some additional training, called fine-tuning. We look at relatively small language models, ranging between 7 and 13 billion parameters. We focus on four problems: a three-dimensional spring toy problem, low-thrust orbit transfer, low-thrust cislunar control, and powered descent guidance. The fine-tuned LLMs are capable of controlling systems by generating sufficiently accurate outputs that are multi-dimensional vectors with up to 10 significant digits. We show that for several problems the amount of data required to perform fine-tuning is smaller than what is generally required of traditional deep neural networks (DNNs), and that fine-tuned LLMs are good at generalizing outside of the training dataset. Further, the same LLM can be fine-tuned with data from different problems, with only minor performance degradation with respect to LLMs trained for a single application. This work is intended as a first step towards the development of a general space systems controller.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for their exceptional natural language processing capabilities. However, concerns about their trustworthiness remain unresolved, particularly in addressing ``jailbreaking'' attacks on aligned LLMs. Previous research predominantly relies on scenarios involving white-box LLMs or specific, fixed prompt templates, which are often impractical and lack broad applicability. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward and novel method called ObscurePrompt for jailbreaking LLMs, inspired by the observed fragile alignments in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. Specifically, we first formulate the decision boundary in the jailbreaking process and then explore how obscure text affects LLM's ethical decision boundary. ObscurePrompt starts with constructing a base prompt that integrates well-known jailbreaking techniques. Powerful LLMs are then utilized to obscure the original prompt through iterative transformations, aiming to bolster the attack's robustness. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach substantially improves upon previous methods in terms of attack effectiveness, maintaining efficacy against two prevalent defense mechanisms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces a novel problem, distributional information embedding, motivated by the practical demands of multi-bit watermarking for large language models (LLMs). Unlike traditional information embedding, which embeds information into a pre-existing host signal, LLM watermarking actively controls the text generation process--adjusting the token distribution--to embed a detectable signal. We develop an information-theoretic framework to analyze this distributional information embedding problem, characterizing the fundamental trade-offs among three critical performance metrics: text quality, detectability, and information rate. In the asymptotic regime, we demonstrate that the maximum achievable rate with vanishing error corresponds to the entropy of the LLM's output distribution and increases with higher allowable distortion. We also characterize the optimal watermarking scheme to achieve this rate. Extending the analysis to the finite-token case, we identify schemes that maximize detection probability while adhering to constraints on false alarm and distortion.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Alignment in large language models (LLMs) is used to enforce guidelines such as safety. Yet, alignment fails in the face of jailbreak attacks that modify inputs to induce unsafe outputs. In this paper, we present and evaluate a method to assess the robustness of LLM alignment. We observe that alignment embeds a safety classifier in the target model that is responsible for deciding between refusal and compliance. We seek to extract an approximation of this classifier, called a surrogate classifier, from the LLM. We develop an algorithm for identifying candidate classifiers from subsets of the LLM model. We evaluate the degree to which the candidate classifiers approximate the model's embedded classifier in benign (F1 score) and adversarial (using surrogates in a white-box attack) settings. Our evaluation shows that the best candidates achieve accurate agreement (an F1 score above 80%) using as little as 20% of the model architecture. Further, we find attacks mounted on the surrogate models can be transferred with high accuracy. For example, a surrogate using only 50% of the Llama 2 model achieved an attack success rate (ASR) of 70%, a substantial improvement over attacking the LLM directly, where we only observed a 22% ASR. These results show that extracting surrogate classifiers is a viable (and highly effective) means for modeling (and therein addressing) the vulnerability of aligned models to jailbreaking attacks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have become state-of-the-art in Machine Translation (MT), often trained on massive bilingual parallel corpora scraped from the web, that contain low-quality entries and redundant information, leading to significant computational challenges. Various data filtering methods exist to reduce dataset sizes, but their effectiveness largely varies based on specific language pairs and domains. This paper evaluates the impact of commonly used data filtering techniques, such as LASER, MUSE, and LaBSE, on English-Polish translation within the biomedical domain. By filtering the UFAL Medical Corpus, we created varying dataset sizes to fine-tune the mBART50 model, which was then evaluated using the SacreBLEU metric on the Khresmoi dataset, having the quality of translations assessed by bilingual speakers. Our results show that both LASER and MUSE can significantly reduce dataset sizes while maintaining or even enhancing performance. We recommend the use of LASER, as it consistently outperforms the other methods and provides the most fluent and natural-sounding translations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Hallucination has been a popular topic in natural language generation (NLG). In real-world applications, unfaithful content can result in bad data quality or loss of trust from end users. Thus, it is crucial to fact-check before adopting NLG for production usage, which can be expensive if done manually. In this paper, we investigate automated faithfulness evaluation in guided NLG. We developed a rubrics template and use large language models (LLMs) to score the generation into quantifiable scales. We compared popular LLMs as well as the widely adopted natural language inference (NLI) models in scoring quality and sensitivity. In addition, we developed methods to generation synthetic unfaithful data, as well as a heuristics to quantify the percentage of hallucination. Our results on 4 travel-domain industry dataset show that GPT-4 can provide accurate judgement and explanation on whether a source and a generation are factually consistent. Furthermore, we found that tuning NLI models on synthetic data can improve performance. Lastly, we present insights on latency and cost for deploying such system.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Historical linguists have long written "programs" that convert reconstructed words in an ancestor language into their attested descendants via ordered string rewrite functions (called sound laws) However, writing these programs is time-consuming, motivating the development of automated Sound Law Induction (SLI) which we formulate as Programming by Examples (PBE) with Large Language Models (LLMs) in this paper. While LLMs have been effective for code generation, recent work has shown that PBE is challenging but improvable by fine-tuning, especially with training data drawn from the same distribution as evaluation data. In this paper, we create a conceptual framework of what constitutes a "similar distribution" for SLI and propose four kinds of synthetic data generation methods with varying amounts of inductive bias to investigate what leads to the best performance. Based on the results we create a SOTA open-source model for SLI as PBE (+6% pass rate with a third of the parameters of the second-best LLM) and also highlight exciting future directions for PBE research.
