                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have become more prevalent in long-context applications such as interactive chatbots, document analysis, and agent workflows, but it is challenging to serve long-context requests with low latency and high throughput. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used technique to reduce latency without sacrificing performance but the conventional wisdom suggests that its efficacy is limited to small batch sizes. In MagicDec, we show that surprisingly SD can achieve speedup even for a high throughput inference regime for moderate to long sequences. More interestingly, an intelligent drafting strategy can achieve better speedup with increasing batch size based on our rigorous analysis. MagicDec first identifies the bottleneck shifts with increasing batch size and sequence length, and uses these insights to deploy speculative decoding more effectively for high throughput inference. Then, it leverages draft models with sparse KV cache to address the KV bottleneck that scales with both sequence length and batch size. This finding underscores the broad applicability of speculative decoding in long-context serving, as it can enhance throughput and reduce latency without compromising accuracy. For moderate to long sequences, we demonstrate up to 2x speedup for LLaMA-2-7B-32K and 1.84x speedup for LLaMA-3.1-8B when serving batch sizes ranging from 32 to 256 on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work provides a complete rheological characterization of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) inks in the presence of electric fields. Several concentrations of MoS2 are studied and dispersed in a viscoelastic fluid. The lubrication effects are present in the ink when the MoS2 concentration is higher than 0.10% w/w. The dielectric properties show the impossibility of a positive electrorheological effect for all MoS2-inks studied. The formation of vortices and electromigration of MoS2 particles occur under the influence of an external electric field. These two phenomena affect the rheological behavior of MoS2-inks under shear flow condition. Relatively to the extensional rheology experiments, the particle migration and the vortex formation promote anisotropy on the rheological properties of the inks which affects the relaxation time, the formation of beads-on-a-string and the uniaxial elongational flow condition is no longer valid. When the electric field strength is 1.5 kV/mm, the formation of Taylor's cone is observed and independent of MoS2 concentration.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The pseudorange error is one of the root causes of localization inaccuracy in GPS. Previous data-driven methods regress and eliminate pseudorange errors using handcrafted intermediate labels. Unlike them, we propose an end-to-end GPS localization framework, E2E-PrNet, to train a neural network for pseudorange correction (PrNet) directly using the final task loss calculated with the ground truth of GPS receiver states. The gradients of the loss with respect to learnable parameters are backpropagated through a Differentiable Nonlinear Least Squares (DNLS) optimizer to PrNet. The feasibility of fusing the data-driven neural network and the model-based DNLS module is verified with GPS data collected by Android phones, showing that E2E-PrNet outperforms the baseline weighted least squares method and the state-of-the-art end-to-end data-driven approach. Finally, we discuss the explainability of E2E-PrNet.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Datacenter applications often rely on remote procedure calls (RPCs) for fast, efficient, and secure communication. However, RPCs are slow, inefficient, and hard to use as they require expensive serialization and compression to communicate over a packetized serial network link. Compute Express Link 3.0 (CXL) offers an alternative solution, allowing applications to share data using a cache-coherent, shared-memory interface across clusters of machines.   RPCool is a new framework that exploits CXL's shared memory capabilities. RPCool avoids serialization by passing pointers to data structures in shared memory. While avoiding serialization is useful, directly sharing pointer-rich data eliminates the isolation that copying data over traditional networks provides, leaving the receiver vulnerable to invalid pointers and concurrent updates to shared data by the sender. RPCool restores this safety with careful and efficient management of memory permissions. Another significant challenge with CXL shared memory capabilities is that they are unlikely to scale to an entire datacenter. RPCool addresses this by falling back to RDMA-based communication.   Overall, RPCool reduces the round-trip latency by 1.93$\times$ and 7.2$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art RDMA and CXL-based RPC mechanisms, respectively. Moreover, RPCool performs either comparably or better than other RPC mechanisms across a range of workloads.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Matrix quantization compresses matrix elements into a more compact form to reduce storage requirements, with dequantization enabling reconstruction for use. We define the Quantization Error Minimization (QEM) problem as minimizing the difference between the original and quantized matrices while ensuring the quantized matrix remains within fixed memory constraints. This technique is crucial in applications like Large Language Model (LLM) weight compression and KV cache compression, where large matrix sizes demand efficient storage solutions.   As modern LLMs like GPT-4 and BERT continue to grow, effective matrix compression is increasingly important. These models contain billions of parameters in matrix form, making efficient weight quantization essential for both storage and computational efficiency. Similarly, KV caches, storing intermediate inference results, are matrix-based and benefit significantly from optimized compression techniques.   To address the QEM problem in the context of LLM weight and KV cache compression, we propose Quantum Entanglement Trees (QET). QET leverages the local structure of matrix elements by iteratively swapping elements to create a locally ordered matrix, which is then grouped and quantized column by column. To enhance QET, we introduce two optimizations: residual quantization to further reduce Mean Squared Error (MSE) and masking with batch processing to accelerate the algorithm.   Our experiments demonstrate that QET can reduce MSE to 12.3% of its original value at the same compression ratio, outperforming leading baseline methods. Our contributions include framing the QEM problem specifically for LLM and KV cache compression, developing the QET algorithm, and implementing optimizations that improve accuracy and processing speed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> An open problem in artificial intelligence is how systems can flexibly learn discrete abstractions that are useful for solving inherently continuous problems. Previous work has demonstrated that a class of hybrid state-space model known as recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS) discover meaningful behavioural units via the piecewise linear decomposition of complex continuous dynamics (Linderman et al., 2016). Furthermore, they model how the underlying continuous states drive these discrete mode switches. We propose that the rich representations formed by an rSLDS can provide useful abstractions for planning and control. We present a novel hierarchical model-based algorithm inspired by Active Inference in which a discrete MDP sits above a low-level linear-quadratic controller. The recurrent transition dynamics learned by the rSLDS allow us to (1) specify temporally-abstracted sub-goals in a method reminiscent of the options framework, (2) lift the exploration into discrete space allowing us to exploit information-theoretic exploration bonuses and (3) `cache' the approximate solutions to low-level problems in the discrete planner. We successfully apply our model to the sparse Continuous Mountain Car task, demonstrating fast system identification via enhanced exploration and non-trivial planning through the delineation of abstract sub-goals.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a plethora of powerful applications at the network edge, such as intelligent personal assistants. Data privacy and security concerns have prompted a shift towards edge-based fine-tuning of personal LLMs, away from cloud reliance. However, this raises issues of computational intensity and resource scarcity, hindering training efficiency and feasibility. While current studies investigate parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to mitigate resource constraints, our analysis indicates that these techniques are not sufficiently resource-efficient for edge devices. To tackle these challenges, we propose Pluto and Charon (PAC), a time and memory efficient collaborative edge AI framework for personal LLMs fine-tuning. PAC breaks the resource wall of personal LLMs fine-tuning with a sophisticated algorithm-system co-design. (1) Algorithmically, PAC implements a personal LLMs fine-tuning technique that is efficient in terms of parameters, time, and memory. It utilizes Parallel Adapters to circumvent the need for a full backward pass through the LLM backbone. Additionally, an activation cache mechanism further streamlining the process by negating the necessity for repeated forward passes across multiple epochs. (2) Systematically, PAC leverages edge devices in close proximity, pooling them as a collective resource for in-situ personal LLMs fine-tuning, utilizing a hybrid data and pipeline parallelism to orchestrate distributed training. The use of the activation cache eliminates the need for forward pass through the LLM backbone,enabling exclusive fine-tuning of the Parallel Adapters using data parallelism. Extensive evaluation based on prototype implementation demonstrates that PAC remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 8.64x end-to-end speedup and up to 88.16% reduction in memory footprint.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) leverage diverse semantic relationships in Heterogeneous Graphs (HetGs) and have demonstrated remarkable learning performance in various applications. However, current distributed GNN training systems often overlook unique characteristics of HetGs, such as varying feature dimensions and the prevalence of missing features among nodes, leading to suboptimal performance or even incompatibility with distributed HGNN training. We introduce Heta, a framework designed to address the communication bottleneck in distributed HGNN training. Heta leverages the inherent structure of HGNNs - independent relation-specific aggregations for each relation, followed by a cross-relation aggregation - and advocates for a novel Relation-Aggregation-First computation paradigm. It performs relation-specific aggregations within graph partitions and then exchanges partial aggregations. This design, coupled with a new graph partitioning method that divides a HetG based on its graph schema and HGNN computation dependency, substantially reduces communication overhead. Heta further incorporates an innovative GPU feature caching strategy that accounts for the different cache miss-penalties associated with diverse node types. Comprehensive evaluations of various HGNN models and large heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that Heta outperforms state-of-the-art systems like DGL and GraphLearn by up to 5.8x and 2.3x in end-to-end epoch time, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The strong electric field between the sample and the extractor is the core of cathode lenses and a pivotal determinant of high resolution. Nevertheless, fields in the range of 3-8 kV/mm can be a source of complications. Local field enhancement at sharp edges or microscopic protrusions of cleaved samples may result in field emission or flashovers. Moreover, slow background electrons are drawn into the microscope column, where they contribute to space charge effects. A novel front lens configuration, optimized through ray-tracing simulations, significantly reduces the field at the sample and allows even for zero field or retarding field, which serves to suppress space charge effects. One or several annular electrodes, situated in a concentric position relative to the extractor, serve to form an additional lens within the gap between the sample and the extractor. The refractory power of this lens, and consequently the field at the sample surface, can be modified by adjusting the potentials of the annular electrodes. The imaging properties and aberrations of this gap lens have been investigated with regard to momentum imaging and XPEEM. The study encompasses the energy range from the few-eV level for laser-ARPES to 6 keV, for hard X-ray ARPES. The additional converging lens situated in close proximity to the sample exhibits a reduced field curvature of the k-image in the backfocal plane. This allows for the acquisition of larger fields of view in both momentum and real-space imaging.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Variable sharing is a fundamental property in the static analysis of logic programs, since it is instrumental for ensuring correctness and increasing precision while inferring many useful program properties. Such properties include modes, determinacy, non-failure, cost, etc. This has motivated significant work on developing abstract domains to improve the precision and performance of sharing analyses. Much of this work has centered around the family of set-sharing domains, because of the high precision they offer. However, this comes at a price: their scalability to a wide set of realistic programs remains challenging and this hinders their wider adoption. In this work, rather than defining new sharing abstract domains, we focus instead on developing techniques which can be incorporated in the analyzers to address aspects that are known to affect the efficiency of these domains, such as the number of variables, without affecting precision. These techniques are inspired in others used in the context of compiler optimizations, such as expression reassociation and variable trimming. We present several such techniques and provide an extensive experimental evaluation of over 1100 program modules taken from both production code and classical benchmarks. This includes the Spectector cache analyzer, the s(CASP) system, the libraries of the Ciao system, the LPdoc documenter, the PLAI analyzer itself, etc. The experimental results are quite encouraging: we have obtained significant speed-ups, and, more importantly, the number of modules that require a timeout was cut in half. As a result, many more programs can be analyzed precisely in reasonable times.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models are designed to enhance the efficiency of large language models (LLMs) without proportionally increasing the computational demands. However, their deployment on edge devices still faces significant challenges due to high on-demand loading overheads from managing sparsely activated experts. This paper introduces AdapMoE, an algorithm-system co-design framework for efficient MoE inference. AdapMoE features adaptive expert gating and management to reduce the on-demand loading overheads. We observe the heterogeneity of experts loading across layers and tokens, based on which we propose a sensitivity-based strategy to adjust the number of activated experts dynamically. Meanwhile, we also integrate advanced prefetching and cache management techniques to further reduce the loading latency. Through comprehensive evaluations on various platforms, we demonstrate AdapMoE consistently outperforms existing techniques, reducing the average number of activated experts by 25% and achieving a 1.35x speedup without accuracy degradation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The inference process for large language models is slow and memory-intensive, with one of the most critical bottlenecks being excessive Key-Value (KV) cache accesses. This paper introduces "Double Sparsity," a novel post-training sparse attention technique designed to alleviate this bottleneck by reducing KV cache access. Double Sparsity combines token sparsity, which focuses on utilizing only the important tokens for computing self-attention, with channel sparsity, an approach that uses important feature channels for identifying important tokens. Our key insight is that the pattern of channel sparsity is relatively static, allowing us to use offline calibration to make it efficient at runtime, thereby enabling accurate and efficient identification of important tokens. Moreover, this method can be combined with offloading to achieve significant memory usage reduction. Experimental results demonstrate that Double Sparsity can achieve $\frac{1}{16}$ token and channel sparsity with minimal impact on accuracy across various tasks, including wiki-2 perplexity, key-value retrieval, and long context benchmarks with models including Llama-2-7B, Llama-2-70B, and Mixtral-8x7B. It brings up to a 14.1$\times$ acceleration in attention operations and a 1.9$\times$ improvement in end-to-end inference on GPUs. With offloading, it achieves a decoding speed acceleration of 16.3$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art solutions at a sequence length of 256K.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Massive off-chip accesses in GPUs are the main performance bottleneck, and we divided these accesses into three types: (1) Write, (2) Data-Read, and (3) Read-Only. Besides, We find that many writes are duplicate, and the duplication can be inter-dup and intra-dup. While inter-dup means different memory blocks are identical, and intra-dup means all the 4B elements in a line are the same. In this work, we propose a cache-assisted GPU memory deduplication architecture named CMD to reduce the off-chip accesses via utilizing the data duplication in GPU applications. CMD includes three key design contributions which aim to reduce the three kinds of accesses: (1) A novel GPU memory deduplication architecture that removes the inter-dup and inter-dup lines. As for the inter-dup detection, we reduce the extra read requests caused by the traditional read-verify hash process. Besides, we design several techniques to manage duplicate blocks. (2) We propose a cache-assisted read scheme to reduce the reads to duplicate data. When an L2 cache miss wants to read the duplicate block, if the reference block has been fetched to L2 and it is clean, we can copy it to the L2 missed block without accessing off-chip DRAM. As for the reads to intra-dup data, CMD uses the on-chip metadata cache to get the data. (3) When a cache line is evicted, the clean sectors in the line are invalidated while the dirty sectors are written back. However, most read-only victims are re-referenced from DRAM more than twice. Therefore, we add a full-associate FIFO to accommodate the read-only (it is also clean) victims to reduce the re-reference counts. Experiments show that CMD can decrease the off-chip accesses by 31.01%, reduce the energy by 32.78% and improve performance by 37.79%. Besides, CMD can improve the performance of memory-intensive workloads by 50.18%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Shared caches are vulnerable to side channel attacks through contention in cache sets. Besides being a simple source of information leak, these side channels form useful gadgets for more sophisticated attacks that compromise the security of shared systems.   The fundamental design aspect that contention attacks exploit is the deterministic nature of the set of addresses contending for a cache set. In this paper, we present RollingCache, a cache design that defends against contention attacks by dynamically changing the set of addresses contending for cache sets. Unlike prior defenses, RollingCache does not rely on address encryption/decryption, data relocation, or cache partitioning. We use one level of indirection to implement dynamic mapping controlled by the whole-cache runtime behavior. Our solution does not depend on having defined security domains, and can defend against an attacker running on the same or another core.   We evaluate RollingCache on ChampSim using the SPEC-2017 benchmark suite. Our security evaluation shows that our dynamic mapping removes the deterministic ability to identify the source of contention. The performance evaluation shows an impact of 1.67\% over a mix of workloads, with a corresponding

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models have excelled in various fields but encounter challenges in memory and time efficiency due to the expanding Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-sequence inference. Recent efforts try to reduce KV cache size to a given memory budget by evicting vast non-critical cache elements during runtime, while preserving generation quality. Our revisiting of current eviction methods reveals that they fundamentally minimize an upper bound of the $L_1$ eviction loss between the pre- and post-eviction outputs of multi-head self-attention mechanisms. Moreover, our analysis indicates that the common practices of uniformly assigning budgets across attention heads harm their post-eviction generation quality. In light of these findings, we propose a simple yet effective adaptive budget allocation algorithm. This algorithm not only optimizes the theoretical loss upper bound but also reduces the $L_1$ eviction loss in practice by aligning with the varied characteristics across different heads. By integrating this algorithm into two state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate the effectiveness of using adaptive budget allocation to optimize KV cache eviction. Extensive evaluations on 16 datasets and the Needle-in-a-Haystack test confirm significant performance improvements across various tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have gained increased popularity due to their remarkable success across various tasks, which has led to the active development of a large set of diverse LLMs. However, individual LLMs have limitations when applied to complex tasks because of such factors as training biases, model sizes, and the datasets used. A promising approach is to efficiently harness the diverse capabilities of LLMs to overcome these individual limitations. Towards this goal, we introduce a novel LLM selection algorithm called SelectLLM. This algorithm directs input queries to the most suitable subset of LLMs from a large pool, ensuring they collectively provide the correct response efficiently. SelectLLM uses a multi-label classifier, utilizing the classifier's predictions and confidence scores to design optimal policies for selecting an optimal, query-aware, and lightweight subset of LLMs. Our findings show that the proposed model outperforms individual LLMs and achieves competitive performance compared to similarly sized, computationally expensive top-performing LLM subsets. Specifically, with a similarly sized top-performing LLM subset, we achieve a significant reduction in latency on two standard reasoning benchmarks: 13% lower latency for GSM8K and 70% lower latency for MMLU. Additionally, we conduct comprehensive analyses and ablation studies, which validate the robustness of the proposed model.

In designing algorithms, compilers, and systems, data movement is a common bottleneck in high-performance computation, in which we improve cache and memory performance. We study a special type of data reuse in the form of repeated traversals, or re-traversals, which are based on the symmetric group. The cyclic and sawtooth traces are previously known results in symmetric locality, and in this work, we would like to generalize this result for any re-traversal. Then, we also provide an abstract framework for applications in compiler design and machine learning models to improve the memory performance of certain programs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a process where a large language model (LLM) retrieves useful information from a database and then generates the responses. It is becoming popular in enterprise settings for daily business operations. For example, Copilot for Microsoft 365 has accumulated millions of businesses. However, the security implications of adopting such RAG-based systems are unclear.   In this paper, we introduce ConfusedPilot, a class of security vulnerabilities of RAG systems that confuse Copilot and cause integrity and confidentiality violations in its responses. First, we investigate a vulnerability that embeds malicious text in the modified prompt in RAG, corrupting the responses generated by the LLM. Second, we demonstrate a vulnerability that leaks secret data, which leverages the caching mechanism during retrieval. Third, we investigate how both vulnerabilities can be exploited to propagate misinformation within the enterprise and ultimately impact its operations, such as sales and manufacturing. We also discuss the root cause of these attacks by investigating the architecture of a RAG-based system. This study highlights the security vulnerabilities in today's RAG-based systems and proposes design guidelines to secure future RAG-based systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Under conventional 5G system design, the authentication and continuous monitoring of user equipment (UE) demands a reliable backhaul connection between the radio access network (RAN) and the core network functions (AMF, AUSF, UDM, etc.). This is not a given, especially in disaster response and military operations. We propose that, in these scenarios, decisions made by core functions can be effectively delegated to the RAN by leveraging the RAN's computing resources and the micro-service programmability of the O-RAN system architecture. This paper presents several concrete designs of core-RAN decision delegation, including caching of core decisions and replicating some of the core decision logic. Each design has revealed interesting performance and security trade-offs that warrant further investigation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Bicameral Cache is a cache organization proposal for a vector architecture that segregates data according to their access type, distinguishing scalar from vector references. Its aim is to avoid both types of references from interfering in each other's data locality, with a special focus on prioritizing the performance on vector references. The proposed system incorporates an additional, non-polluting prefetching mechanism to help populate the long vector cache lines in advance to increase the hit rate by further exploiting the spatial locality on vector data. Its evaluation was conducted on the Cavatools simulator, comparing the performance to a standard conventional cache, over different typical vector benchmarks for several vector lengths. The results proved the proposed cache speeds up performance on stride-1 vector benchmarks, while hardly impacting non-stride-1's. In addition, the prefetching feature consistently provided an additional value.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Many modern applications that deal with sensitive data, such as healthcare and government services, outsource computation to cloud platforms. In such untrusted environments, privacy is of vital importance. One solution to this problem is homomorphic encryption (HE), a family of cryptographic schemes that support certain algebraic operations on encrypted data without the need for decryption. However, despite major advancements, encryption in modern HE schemes still comes with a non-trivial computational overhead that can hamper data-intensive workloads. To resolve this, recent research has shown that leveraging caching techniques, such as Rache, can significantly enhance the performance of HE schemes while maintaining security. Rache unfortunately displays a key limitation in the time complexity of its caching procedure, which scales with the size of the plaintext space. Smuche is another caching scheme that simultaneously improves the scalability of the caching procedure and turns the encryption process into a constant-time operation, utilizing only a single scalar multiplication. Even still, more can be done. In this paper, we present an encryption method we call ``Zinc" which entirely forgoes the multiple caching process, replacing it with a single scalar addition, and then injecting randomness that takes constant time with respect to the plaintext space. This injection of randomness is similar to Smuche, and a great improvement from Rache, allowing Zinc to achieve efficiency without compromising security. We implement the scheme using Microsoft SEAL and compare its performance to vanilla CKKS.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cache-aided MIMO communications aims to jointly exploit both coded caching~(CC) and spatial multiplexing gains to enhance communication efficiency. In this paper, we first analyze the achievable degrees of freedom~(DoF) in a MIMO-CC system with CC gain \(t\), where a server with \(L\) transmit antennas communicates with \(K\) users, each equipped with \(G\) receive antennas. We demonstrate that the enhanced achievable DoF is \(\max_{\beta, \Omega} \Omega \beta\), where the number of users \(\Omega\) served in each transmission is fine-tuned to maximize DoF, and \(\beta \le \min\big(G, \nicefrac{L \binom{\Omega-1}{t}}{1 + (\Omega - t - 1)\binom{\Omega-1}{t}}\big)\) represents the number of parallel streams decoded by each user. Second, we introduce an effective transmit covariance matrix design aimed at maximizing the symmetric rate, solved iteratively via successive convex approximation. Third, we propose a new class of MIMO-CC schemes using a novel scheduling mechanism leveraging maximal multicasting opportunities to maximize delivery rates at given SNR levels while adhering to linear processing constraints. Lastly, we devise linear multicast beamforming strategies tailored for the flexible scheduling schemes in MIMO-CC systems and present an iterative solution for the efficient design of beamformers. Extensive numerical simulations are used to verify the results of the paper.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The concept of ownership in high level languages can aid both the programmer and the compiler to reason about the validity of memory operations. Previously, ownership semantics has been used successfully in high level automatic program verification to model a reference to data by a first order logic (FOL) representation of data instead of maintaining an address map. However, ownership semantics is not used in low level program verification. We have identified two challenges. First, ownership information is lost when a program is compiled to a low level intermediate representation (e.g., in LLVM IR). Second, pointers in low level programs point to bytes using an address map (e.g., in unsafe Rust) and thus the verification condition (VC) cannot always replace a pointer by its FOL abstraction. To remedy the situation, we develop ownership semantics for an LLVM like low level intermediate representation. Using these semantics, the VC can opportunistically model some memory accesses by a direct access of a pointer cache that stores byte representation of data. This scheme reduces instances where an address map must be maintained, especially for mostly safe programs that follow ownership semantics. For unsafe functionality, memory accesses are modelled by operations on an address map and we provide mechanisms to keep the address map and pointer cache in sync. We implement these semantics in SEABMC, a bit precise bounded model checker for LLVM. For evaluation, the source programs are assumed to be written in C. Since C does not have ownership built in, suitable macros are added that introduce and preserve ownership during translation to LLVM like IR for verification. This approach is evaluated on mature open source C code. For both handcrafted benchmarks and practical programs, we observe a speedup of $1.3x-5x$ during SMT solving.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In many automated planning applications, action costs can be hard to specify. An example is the time needed to travel through a certain road segment, which depends on many factors, such as the current weather conditions. A natural way to address this issue is to learn to predict these parameters based on input features (e.g., weather forecasts) and use the predicted action costs in automated planning afterward. Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) has been successful in learning to predict the parameters of combinatorial optimization problems in a way that optimizes solution quality rather than prediction quality. This approach yields better results than treating prediction and optimization as separate tasks. In this paper, we investigate for the first time the challenges of implementing DFL for automated planning in order to learn to predict the action costs. There are two main challenges to overcome: (1) planning systems are called during gradient descent learning, to solve planning problems with negative action costs, which are not supported in planning. We propose novel methods for gradient computation to avoid this issue. (2) DFL requires repeated planner calls during training, which can limit the scalability of the method. We experiment with different methods approximating the optimal plan as well as an easy-to-implement caching mechanism to speed up the learning process. As the first work that addresses DFL for automated planning, we demonstrate that the proposed gradient computation consistently yields significantly better plans than predictions aimed at minimizing prediction error; and that caching can temper the computation requirements.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs), epitomized by ChatGPT' s release in late 2022, have revolutionized various industries with their advanced language comprehension. However, their efficiency is challenged by the Transformer architecture' s struggle with handling long texts. KV-Cache has emerged as a pivotal solution to this issue, converting the time complexity of token generation from quadratic to linear, albeit with increased GPU memory overhead proportional to conversation length. With the development of the LLM community and academia, various KV-Cache compression methods have been proposed. In this review, we dissect the various properties of KV-Cache and elaborate on various methods currently used to optimize the KV-Cache space usage of LLMs. These methods span the pre-training phase, deployment phase, and inference phase, and we summarize the commonalities and differences among these methods. Additionally, we list some metrics for evaluating the long-text capabilities of large language models, from both efficiency and capability perspectives. Our review thus sheds light on the evolving landscape of LLM optimization, offering insights into future advancements in this dynamic field.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent large language model applications, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation and chatbots, have led to an increased need to process longer input contexts. However, this requirement is hampered by inherent limitations. Architecturally, models are constrained by a context window defined during training. Additionally, processing extensive texts requires substantial GPU memory. We propose a novel approach, Finch, to compress the input context by leveraging the pre-trained model weights of the self-attention. Given a prompt and a long text, Finch iteratively identifies the most relevant Key (K) and Value (V) pairs over chunks of the text conditioned on the prompt. Only such pairs are stored in the KV cache, which, within the space constrained by the context window, ultimately contains a compressed version of the long text. Our proposal enables models to consume large inputs even with high compression (up to 93x) while preserving semantic integrity without the need for fine-tuning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sensing data (SD) plays an important role in safe-related applications for Internet of Vehicles. Proactively caching required sensing data (SD) is a pivotal strategy for alleviating network congestion and improving data accessibility. Despite merits, existing studies predominantly address SD caching within a single time slot, which may not be scalable to scenarios involving multi-slots. Furthermore, the oversight of service capacity at caching nodes could lead to significant queuing delays in SD reception. To tackle these limitations, we jointly consider the problem of anchoring caching placement and requests allocation for SD. A value model incorporating both temporal and spacial characteristics is first proposed to estimate the significance of different caching decisions. Subsequently, a stochastic integer nonlinear programming model is provided to optimize the long-term system performance, which is converted into a series of online optimization problem by leveraging the Lyapunov method and linearized via introducing auxiliary variables. To expedite the solution, we provide a binary quantum particle swarm optimization based algorithm with quadratic time complexity. Numerical investigations demonstrate the superiority of proposed algorithms compared with other schemes in terms of energy consumption, response latency, and cache-hit ratio.

RISC-V is gaining traction, and open-source hardware (OSH) platforms offer solutions to issues such as IP costs and vendor dependency. Existing multi-core cache-coherent RISC-V platforms are complex and not efficient for small embedded core clusters. We propose an open-source SystemVerilog implementation of a lightweight snoop-based cache-coherent cluster of Linux-capable CVA6 cores. Our design uses the MOESI protocol via the Arm's AMBA ACE protocol. Evaluated with Splash-3 benchmarks, our solution shows up to 32.87% faster performance in a dual-core setup and an average improvement of 15.8% over OpenPiton. Synthesized using GF 22nm FDSOI technology, the Cache Coherency Unit occupies only 1.6% of the system area.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern OOO CPUs have very deep pipelines with large branch misprediction recovery penalties. Speculatively executed instructions on the wrong path can significantly change cache state, depending on speculation levels. Architects often employ trace-driven simulation models in the design exploration stage, which sacrifice precision for speed. Trace-driven simulators are orders of magnitude faster than execution-driven models, reducing the often hundreds of thousands of simulation hours needed to explore new micro-architectural ideas. Despite this strong benefit of trace-driven simulation, these often fail to adequately model the consequences of wrong path because obtaining them is nontrivial. Prior works consider either a positive or negative impact of wrong path but not both. Here, we examine wrong path execution in simulation results and design a set of infrastructure for enabling wrong-path execution in a trace driven simulator. Our analysis shows the wrong path affects structures on both the instruction and data sides extensively, resulting in performance variations ranging from $-3.05$\% to $20.9$\% when ignoring wrong path. To benefit the research community and enhance the accuracy of simulators, we opened our traces and tracing utility in the hopes that industry can provide wrong-path traces generated by their internal simulators, enabling academic simulation without exposing industry IP.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Coded caching scheme originally proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MN) considered a broadcast network consisting of a single server connected to a set of users each having a cache memory. Motivated by practical scenarios, Karamchandani \textit{et al.} in [16] proposed a coded caching scheme for a two-layer hierarchical network consisting of a single server connected to multiple mirror sites and each mirror site connected to a distinct set of users, in which both mirror sites and users having cache memories. Low subpacketization level coded caching schemes are desirable for practical implementations. Placement delivery array (PDA) was proposed as a tool to design coded caching schemes with reduced subpacketization level by Yan \textit{et al.} in [4]. Schemes with reduced subpacketization levels are studied extensively in the literature for single-layer networks. Kong \textit{et al.} in [17] proposed a structure called hierarchical placement delivery arrays (HPDA), which characterizes a hierarchical coded caching system and also proposed a class of HPDAs that gives low subpacketization level schemes by using two PDAs. Low subpacketization level hierarchical schemes using combinatorial $t$-designs is proposed in [20]. Apart from that there is no other existing work that discusses the subpacketization problem in a hierarchical network. This paper proposes a class of HPDA construction that gives low subpacketization level hierarchical coded caching schemes, by first constructing a new class of PDAs. Compared with the existing schemes, in cases where the system parameters and subpacketization level are the same, the proposed hierarchical scheme has a better coding delay. Further, the new class of PDAs constructed either subsumes several known PDA constructions or achieves better transmission load for the same system parameters.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite the promising future of autonomous robots, several key issues currently remain that can lead to compromised performance and safety. One such issue is latency, where we find that even the latest embedded platforms from NVIDIA fail to execute intelligence tasks (e.g., object detection) of autonomous vehicles in a real-time fashion. One remedy to this problem is the promising paradigm of edge computing. Through collaboration with our industry partner, we identify key prohibitive limitations of the current edge mindset: (1) servers are not distributed enough and thus, are not close enough to vehicles, (2) current proposed edge solutions do not provide substantially better performance and extra information specific to autonomous vehicles to warrant their cost to the user, and (3) the state-of-the-art solutions are not compatible with popular frameworks used in autonomous systems, particularly the Robot Operating System (ROS).   To remedy these issues, we provide Genie, an encapsulation technique that can enable transparent caching in ROS in a non-intrusive way (i.e., without modifying the source code), can build the cache in a distributed manner (in contrast to traditional central caching methods), and can construct a collective three-dimensional object map to provide substantially better latency (even on low-power edge servers) and higher quality data to all vehicles in a certain locality. We fully implement our design on state-of-the-art industry-adopted embedded and edge platforms, using the prominent autonomous driving software Autoware, and find that Genie can enhance the latency of Autoware Vision Detector by 82% on average, enable object reusability 31% of the time on average and as much as 67% for the incoming requests, and boost the confidence in its object map considerably over time.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) represent a groundbreaking advancement in the domain of natural language processing due to their impressive reasoning abilities. Recently, there has been considerable interest in increasing the context lengths for these models to enhance their applicability to complex tasks. However, at long context lengths and large batch sizes, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores the attention keys and values, emerges as the new bottleneck in memory usage during inference. To address this, we propose Eigen Attention, which performs the attention operation in a low-rank space, thereby reducing the KV cache memory overhead. Our proposed approach is orthogonal to existing KV cache compression techniques and can be used synergistically with them. Through extensive experiments over OPT, MPT, and Llama model families, we demonstrate that Eigen Attention results in up to 40% reduction in KV cache sizes and up to 60% reduction in attention operation latency with minimal drop in performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Compute Express Link (CXL) emerges as a solution for wide gap between computational speed and data communication rates among host and multiple devices. It fosters a unified and coherent memory space between host and CXL storage devices such as such as Solid-state drive (SSD) for memory expansion, with a corresponding DRAM implemented as the device cache. However, this introduces challenges such as substantial cache miss penalties, sub-optimal caching due to data access granularity mismatch between the DRAM "cache" and SSD "memory", and inefficient hardware cache management. To address these issues, we propose a novel solution, named ICGMM, which optimizes caching and eviction directly on hardware, employing a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based approach. We prototype our solution on an FPGA board, which demonstrates a noteworthy improvement compared to the classic Least Recently Used (LRU) cache strategy. We observe a decrease in the cache miss rate ranging from 0.32% to 6.14%, leading to a substantial 16.23% to 39.14% reduction in the average SSD access latency. Furthermore, when compared to the state-of-the-art Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based cache policies, our GMM algorithm on FPGA showcases an impressive latency reduction of over 10,000 times. Remarkably, this is achieved while demanding much fewer hardware resources.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Previous measurements of neutron energy using fast plastic scintillators while operating the Fusion Z Pinch Experiment (FuZE) constrained the energy of any yield-producing deuteron beams to less than $4.65 keV$. FuZE has since been operated at increasingly higher input power, resulting in increased plasma current and larger fusion neutron yields. A detailed experimental study of the neutron energy isotropy in these regimes applies more stringent limits to possible contributions from beam-target fusion. The FuZE device operated at $-25~kV$ charge voltage has resulted in average plasma currents of $370~kA$ and D-D fusion neutron yields of $4\times10^7$ neutrons per discharge. Measurements of the neutron energy isotropy under these operating conditions demonstrates the energy of deuteron beams is less than $7.4 \pm 5.6^\mathrm{(stat)} \pm 3.7^\mathrm{(syst)}~keV$. Characterization of the detector response has reduced the number of free parameters in the fit of the neutron energy distribution, improving the confidence in the forward-fit method. Gamma backgrounds have been measured and the impact of these contributions on the isotropy results have been studied. Additionally, a time dependent measurement of the isotropy has been resolved for the first time, indicating increases to possible deuteron beam energies at late times. This suggests the possible growth of $m$=0 instabilities at the end of the main radiation event but confirms that the majority of the neutron production exhibits isotropy consistent with thermonuclear origin.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have ignited an innovative surge of AI applications, marking a new era of exciting possibilities equipped with extended context windows. However, hosting these models is cost-prohibitive mainly due to the extensive memory consumption of KV Cache involving long-context modeling. Despite several works proposing to evict unnecessary tokens from the KV Cache, most of them rely on the biased local statistics of accumulated attention scores and report performance using unconvincing metric like perplexity on inadequate short-text evaluation. In this paper, we propose NACL, a general framework for long-context KV cache eviction that achieves more optimal and efficient eviction in a single operation during the encoding phase. Due to NACL's efficiency, we combine more accurate attention score statistics in PROXY TOKENS EVICTION with the diversified random eviction strategy of RANDOM EVICTION, aiming to alleviate the issue of attention bias and enhance the robustness in maintaining pivotal tokens for long-context modeling tasks. Notably, our method significantly improves the performance on short- and long-text tasks by 80% and 76% respectively, reducing KV Cache by up to 50% with over 95% performance maintenance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in edge computing~(EC) have pushed cloud-based data caching services to edge, however, such emerging edge storage comes with numerous challenging and unique security issues. One of them is the problem of edge data integrity verification (EDIV) which coordinates multiple participants (e.g., data owners and edge nodes) to inspect whether data cached on edge is authentic. To date, various solutions have been proposed to address the EDIV problem, while there is no systematic review. Thus, we offer a comprehensive survey for the first time, aiming to show current research status, open problems, and potentially promising insights for readers to further investigate this under-explored field. Specifically, we begin by stating the significance of the EDIV problem, the integrity verification difference between data cached on cloud and edge, and three typical system models with corresponding inspection processes. To thoroughly assess prior research efforts, we synthesize a universal criteria framework that an effective verification approach should satisfy. On top of it, a schematic development timeline is developed to reveal the research advance on EDIV in a sequential manner, followed by a detailed review of the existing EDIV solutions. Finally, we highlight intriguing research challenges and possible directions for future work, along with a discussion on how forthcoming technology, e.g., machine learning and context-aware security, can augment security in EC. Given our findings, some major observations are: there is a noticeable trend to equip EDIV solutions with various functions and diversify study scenarios; completing EDIV within two types of participants (i.e., data owner and edge nodes) is garnering escalating interest among researchers; although the majority of existing methods rely on cryptography, emerging technology is being explored to handle the EDIV problem.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In large-language models, memory constraints in the key-value cache (KVC) pose a challenge during inference, especially with long prompts. In this work, we observed that compressing KV values is more effective than compressing the model regarding accuracy and job completion time (JCT). However, quantizing KV values and dropping less-important tokens incur significant runtime computational time overhead, delaying JCT. These methods also cannot reduce computation time or high network communication time overhead in sequence-parallelism (SP) frameworks for long prompts. To tackle these issues, based on our insightful observations from experimental analysis, we propose ZeroC, a Zero-delay QKV Compression system that eliminates time overhead and even reduces computation and communication time of the model operations. ZeroC innovatively embeds compression and decompression operations within model operations and adaptively determines compression ratios at a hybrid layer-token level. Further, it enables a communication-efficient SP inference framework. Trace-driven experiments demonstrate that ZeroC achieves up to 80% lower average JCT, 35% lower average perplexity, and 2.8x higher throughput with the same latency compared to state-of-the-art compression methods. ZeroC also reduces the average JCT of current LLM serving systems by up to 91% with the constraint of 0.1 perplexity increase. We open-sourced the code.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Diffusion models, widely used for image generation, face significant challenges related to their broad applicability due to prolonged inference times and high memory demands. Efficient Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is crucial to address these issues. However, unlike traditional models, diffusion models critically rely on the time-step for the multi-round denoising. Typically, each time-step is encoded into a hypersensitive temporal feature by several modules. Despite this, existing PTQ methods do not optimize these modules individually. Instead, they employ unsuitable reconstruction objectives and complex calibration methods, leading to significant disturbances in the temporal feature and denoising trajectory, as well as reduced compression efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel quantization framework that includes three strategies: 1) TIB-based Maintenance: Based on our innovative Temporal Information Block (TIB) definition, Temporal Information-aware Reconstruction (TIAR) and Finite Set Calibration (FSC) are developed to efficiently align original temporal features. 2) Cache-based Maintenance: Instead of indirect and complex optimization for the related modules, pre-computing and caching quantized counterparts of temporal features are developed to minimize errors. 3) Disturbance-aware Selection: Employ temporal feature errors to guide a fine-grained selection between the two maintenance strategies for further disturbance reduction. This framework preserves most of the temporal information and ensures high-quality end-to-end generation. Extensive testing on various datasets, diffusion models and hardware confirms our superior performance and acceleration..

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims to identify and classify entities in text into predefined categories. However, when applied to Arabic data, NER encounters unique challenges stemming from the language's rich morphological inflections, absence of capitalization cues, and spelling variants, where a single word can comprise multiple morphemes. In this paper, we introduce Arabic KNN-NER, our submission to the Wojood NER Shared Task 2024 (ArabicNLP 2024). We have participated in the shared sub-task 1 Flat NER. In this shared sub-task, we tackle fine-grained flat-entity recognition for Arabic text, where we identify a single main entity and possibly zero or multiple sub-entities for each word. Arabic KNN-NER augments the probability distribution of a fine-tuned model with another label probability distribution derived from performing a KNN search over the cached training data. Our submission achieved 91% on the test set on the WojoodFine dataset, placing Arabic KNN-NER on top of the leaderboard for the shared task.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper explores the potential of cryogenic computing and superconducting electronics as promising alternatives to traditional semiconductor devices. As semiconductor devices face challenges such as increased leakage currents and reduced performance at higher temperatures, these novel technologies offer high performance and low power computation. Cryogenic computing operates at ultra-low temperatures near 77 K, leading to lower leakage currents and improved electron mobility. On the other hand, superconducting electronics, operating near 0 K, allow electrons to flow without resistance, offering the potential for ultra-low-power, high-speed computation. This study presents a comprehensive performance modeling and analysis of these technologies and provides insights into their potential benefits and limitations. We implement models of in-order and out-of-order cores operating at high clock frequencies associated with superconducting electronics and cryogenic computing in gem5. We evaluate the performance of these components using workloads representative of real-world applications like NPB, SPEC CPU2006, and GAPBS. Our results show the potential speedups achievable by these components and the limitations posed by cache bandwidth. This work provides valuable insights into the performance implications and design trade-offs associated with cryogenic and superconducting technologies, laying the foundation for future research in this field using gem5.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The emergence of intelligence in large language models (LLMs) has inspired investigations into their integration into automata learning. This paper introduces the probabilistic Minimally Adequate Teacher (pMAT) formulation, which leverages a probabilistic oracle that could give persistent errors randomly during answering the membership queries for deterministic finite automata (DFA) learning. Given the tendency of LLMs to produce hallucinatory content, we have developed techniques to improve answer accuracy and ensure the correctness of the learned automata. We propose the $\mathtt{Discrimination}$ prompt as well as the $\mathtt{Verification}$ prompt and explore their advantages over common prompts. Additionally, we compare DFA learning performance between the TTT algorithm and common active learning algorithms. To address the exponential number of persistent errors, we implement a dynamic query cache refinement algorithm that identifies and corrects conflicting queries by combining the active and passive learning algorithms. The empirical results demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our approach, providing a theoretical foundation for automata learning with LLMs in the loop.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Towards a compatible utilization of NVM, NVM-specialized kernel file systems and NVM-based disk file system accelerators have been proposed. However, these studies only focus on one or several characteristics of NVM, while failing to exploit its best practice by putting NVM in the proper position of the whole storage stack. In this paper, we present NVPC, a transparent acceleration to existing kernel file systems with an NVM-enhanced page cache. The acceleration lies in two aspects, respectively matching the desperate needs of existing disk file systems: sync writes and cache-missed operations. Besides, the fast DRAM page cache is preserved for cache-hit operations. For sync writes, a high-performance log-based sync absorbing area is provided to redirect data destination from the slow disk to the fast NVM. Meanwhile, the byte-addressable feature of NVM is used to prevent write amplification. For cache-missed operations, NVPC makes use of the idle space on NVM to extend the DRAM page cache, so that more and larger workloads can fit into the cache. NVPC is entirely implemented as a page cache, thus can provide efficient speed-up to disk file systems with full transparency to users and full compatibility to lower file systems.   In Filebench macro-benchmarks, NVPC achieves at most 3.55x, 2.84x, and 2.64x faster than NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS. In RocksDB workloads with working set larger than DRAM, NVPC achieves 1.12x, 2.59x, and 2.11x faster than NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS. Meanwhile, NVPC gains positive revenue from NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS in 62.5% of the tested cases in our read/write/sync mixed evaluation, demonstrating that NVPC is more balanced and adaptive to complex real-world workloads. Experimental results also show that NVPC is the only method that accelerates Ext-4 in particular cases for up to 15.19x, with no slow-down to any other use cases.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Electron-beam-induced conversion of materials in a transmission electron microscope uses the high power density of a localized electron beam of acceleration voltages above 100 kV as an energy source to transform matter at the sub-micron scale. Here, the e-beam-induced transformation of precursor microparticles employing a low-energy e-beam with an acceleration voltage of 30 kV in a scanning electron microscope is developed to increase the versatility and efficiency of the technique. Under these conditions, the technique can be classified between e-beam lithography, where the e-beam is used to mill holes in or grow some different material onto a substrate, and e-beam welding, where matter can be welded together when overcoming the melting phase. Modifying gold microparticles on an amorphous SiOx substrate reveals the dominant role of inelastic electron-matter interaction and subsequent localized heating for the observed melting and vaporization of the precursor microparticles under the electron beam. Monte-Carlo scattering simulations and thermodynamic modeling further support the findings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain traction, their reliance on power-hungry GPUs places ever-increasing energy demands, raising environmental and monetary concerns. Inference dominates LLM workloads, presenting a critical challenge for providers: minimizing energy costs under Service-Level Objectives (SLOs) that ensure optimal user experience. In this paper, we present \textit{throttLL'eM}, a framework that reduces energy consumption while meeting SLOs through the use of instance and GPU frequency scaling. \textit{throttLL'eM} features mechanisms that project future KV cache usage and batch size. Leveraging a Machine-Learning (ML) model that receives these projections as inputs, \textit{throttLL'eM} manages performance at the iteration level to satisfy SLOs with reduced frequencies and instance sizes. We show that the proposed ML model achieves $R^2$ scores greater than 0.97 and miss-predicts performance by less than 1 iteration per second on average. Experimental results on LLM inference traces show that \textit{throttLL'eM} achieves up to 43.8\% lower energy consumption and an energy efficiency improvement of at least $1.71\times$ under SLOs, when compared to NVIDIA's Triton server.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With large language models (LLMs) widely deployed in long content generation recently, there has emerged an increasing demand for efficient long-sequence inference support. However, key-value (KV) cache, which is stored to avoid re-computation, has emerged as a critical bottleneck by growing linearly in size with the sequence length. Due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, the entire KV cache will be loaded for every generated token, resulting in low utilization of computational cores and high latency. While various compression methods for KV cache have been proposed to alleviate this issue, they suffer from degradation in generation quality. We introduce TriForce, a hierarchical speculative decoding system that is scalable for long sequence generation. This approach leverages the original model weights and dynamic sparse KV cache via retrieval as a draft model, which serves as an intermediate layer in the hierarchy and is further speculated by a smaller model to reduce its drafting latency. TriForce not only facilitates impressive speedups for Llama2-7B-128K, achieving up to 2.31$\times$ on an A100 GPU but also showcases scalability in handling even longer contexts. For the offloading setting on two RTX 4090 GPUs, TriForce achieves 0.108s/token$\unicode{x2014}$only half as slow as the auto-regressive baseline on an A100, which attains 7.78$\times$ on our optimized offloading system. Additionally, TriForce performs 4.86$\times$ than DeepSpeed-Zero-Inference on a single RTX 4090 GPU. TriForce's robustness is highlighted by its consistently outstanding performance across various temperatures. The code is available at https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/TriForce.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models (LLMs) evolve, the increase in model depth and parameter number leads to substantial redundancy. To enhance the efficiency of the attention mechanism, previous works primarily compress the KV cache or group attention heads, while largely overlooking redundancy between layers. Our comprehensive analyses across various LLMs show that highly similar attention patterns persist within most layers. It's intuitive to save the computation by sharing attention weights across layers. However, further analysis reveals two challenges: (1) Directly sharing the weight matrix without carefully rearranging the attention heads proves to be ineffective; (2) Shallow layers are vulnerable to small deviations in attention weights. Driven by these insights, we introduce LiSA, a lightweight substitute for self-attention in well-trained LLMs. LiSA employs tiny feed-forward networks to align attention heads between adjacent layers and low-rank matrices to approximate differences in layer-wise attention weights. Evaluations encompassing 13 typical benchmarks demonstrate that LiSA maintains high response quality in terms of accuracy and perplexity while reducing redundant attention calculations within 53-84% of the total layers. Our implementations of LiSA achieve a 6X compression of Q and K, with maximum throughput improvements of 19.5% for LLaMA3-8B and 32.3% for LLaMA2-7B.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Many spectral CT applications require accurate material decomposition. Existing material decomposition algorithms are often susceptible to significant noise magnification or, in the case of one-step model-based approaches, hampered by slow convergence rates and large computational requirements. In this work, we proposed a novel framework - spectral diffusion posterior sampling (spectral DPS) - for one-step reconstruction and multi-material decomposition, which combines sophisticated prior information captured by one-time unsupervised learning and an arbitrary analytic physical system model. Spectral DPS is built upon a general DPS framework for nonlinear inverse problems. Several strategies developed in previous work, including jumpstart sampling, Jacobian approximation, and multi-step likelihood updates are applied facilitate stable and accurate decompositions. The effectiveness of spectral DPS was evaluated on a simulated dual-layer and a kV-switching spectral system as well as on a physical cone-beam CT (CBCT) test bench. In simulation studies, spectral DPS improved PSNR by 27.49% to 71.93% over baseline DPS and by 26.53% to 57.30% over MBMD, depending on the the region of interest. In physical phantom study, spectral DPS achieved a <1% error in estimating the mean density in a homogeneous region. Compared with baseline DPS, spectral DPS effectively avoided generating false structures in the homogeneous phantom and reduced the variability around edges. Both simulation and physical phantom studies demonstrated the superior performance of spectral DPS for stable and accurate material decomposition.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To index the increasing volume of data, modern data indexes are typically stored on SSDs and cached in DRAM. However, searching such an index has resulted in significant I/O traffic due to limited access locality and inefficient cache utilization. At the heart of index searching is the operation of filtering through vast data spans to isolate a small, relevant subset, which involves basic equality tests rather than the complex arithmetic provided by modern CPUs. This paper introduces the Search-in-Memory (SiM) chip, which demonstrates the feasibility of performing data filtering directly within a NAND flash memory chip, transmitting only relevant search results rather than complete pages. Instead of adding complex circuits, we propose repurposing existing circuitry for efficient and accurate bitwise parallel matching. We demonstrate how different data structures can use our flexible SIMD command interface to offload index searches. This strategy not only frees up the CPU for more computationally demanding tasks, but it also optimizes DRAM usage for write buffering, significantly lowering energy consumption associated with I/O transmission between the CPU and DRAM. Extensive testing across a wide range of workloads reveals up to a 9X speedup in write-heavy workloads and up to 45% energy savings due to reduced read and write I/O. Furthermore, we achieve significant reductions in median and tail read latencies of up to 89% and 85% respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> One key to enabling high-performance serverless computing is to mitigate cold-starts. Current solutions utilize a warm pool to keep function alive: a warm-start can be analogous to a CPU cache-hit. However, modern cache has multiple hierarchies and the last-level cache is shared among cores, whereas the warm pool is limited to a single tenant for security concerns. Also, the warm pool keep-alive policy can be further optimized using cache replacement algorithms. In this paper, we borrow practical optimizations from caching, and design FaasCamp, a caching-aided multi-tenant serverless computing framework. FaasCamp extends the single-tier warm pool into multi-tiers, with a reclaim pool introduced enabling secure function instance sharing among tenants. Also, FaasCamp leverages machine learning to approximate the optimal cache replacement policy to improve the warm rate. We have implemented a prototype and conducted extensive experiments under multiple scenarios. The results show that FaasCamp can outperform existing platforms with minimal overhead.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Do transformers "think ahead" during inference at a given position? It is known transformers prepare information in the hidden states of the forward pass at time step $t$ that is then used in future forward passes $t+\tau$. We posit two explanations for this phenomenon: pre-caching, in which off-diagonal gradient terms present during training result in the model computing features at $t$ irrelevant to the present inference task but useful for the future, and breadcrumbs, in which features most relevant to time step $t$ are already the same as those that would most benefit inference at time $t+\tau$. We test these hypotheses by training language models without propagating gradients to past timesteps, a scheme we formalize as myopic training. In a constructed synthetic data setting, we find clear evidence for pre-caching. In the autoregressive language modeling setting, our experiments are more suggestive of the breadcrumbs hypothesis, though pre-caching increases with model scale.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multi-turn dialogues are a key interaction method between humans and Large Language Models (LLMs), as conversations extend over multiple rounds, keeping LLMs' high generation quality and low latency is a challenge. Mainstream LLMs can be grouped into two categories based on masking strategy: causal LLM and prefix LLM. Several works have demonstrated that prefix LLMs tend to outperform causal ones in scenarios that heavily depend on historical context such as multi-turn dialogues or in-context learning, thanks to their bidirectional attention on prefix sequences. However, prefix LLMs have an inherent inefficient training problem in multi-turn dialogue datasets. In addition, the attention mechanism of prefix LLM makes it unable to reuse Key-Value Cache (KV Cache) across dialogue rounds to reduce generation latency. In this paper, we propose a novel masking scheme called Intermittent Semi-working Mask (ISM) to address these problems. Specifically, we apply alternate bidirectional and unidirectional attention on queries and answers in the dialogue history. In this way, ISM is able to maintain the high quality of prefix LLM and low generation latency of causal LLM, simultaneously. Extensive experiments illustrate that our ISM achieves significant performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents MoE-Infinity, an offloading-efficient serving system for sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) models. To optimize offloading, MoE-Infinity achieves novel request-level tracing for expert activation, capturing MoE's sparse execution patterns such as selective activation, group activation, and skewed reuse. Leveraging the request-level trace, MoE-Infinity performs effective expert prefetching and expert caching, achieving high efficiency in transferring model parameters from host memory to GPU memory. Experimental results demonstrate that MoE-Infinity achieves low latency comparable to expensive full-GPU deployments, which require up to 4X more GPU resources than MoE-Infinity. Compared to offloading-supporting LLM serving systems such as DeepSpeed-Inference, Llama.cpp, Mixtral Offloading, and BrainStorm, MoE-Infinity exhibits superior latency performance, providing 2-20X improvements when serving various MoE models for a large collection of LLM tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Self-attention is an essential component of large language models (LLM) but a significant source of inference latency for long sequences. In multi-tenant LLM serving scenarios, the compute and memory operation cost of self-attention can be optimized by using the probability that multiple LLM requests have shared system prompts in prefixes. In this paper, we introduce ChunkAttention, a prefix-aware self-attention module that can detect matching prompt prefixes across multiple requests and share their key/value tensors in memory at runtime to improve the memory utilization of KV cache. This is achieved by breaking monolithic key/value tensors into smaller chunks and structuring them into the auxiliary prefix tree. Consequently, on top of the prefix-tree based KV cache, we design an efficient self-attention kernel, where a two-phase partition algorithm is implemented to improve the data locality during self-attention computation in the presence of shared system prompts. Experiments show that ChunkAttention can speed up the self-attention kernel by 3.2-4.8$\times$ compared to the state-of-the-art implementation, with the length of the system prompt ranging from 1024 to 4096.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph neural network training is mainly categorized into mini-batch and full-batch training methods. The mini-batch training method samples subgraphs from the original graph in each iteration. This sampling operation introduces extra computation overhead and reduces the training accuracy. Meanwhile, the full-batch training method calculates the features and corresponding gradients of all vertices in each iteration, and therefore has higher convergence accuracy. However, in the distributed cluster, frequent remote accesses of vertex features and gradients lead to huge communication overhead, thus restricting the overall training efficiency.   In this paper, we introduce the cached-based distributed full-batch graph neural network training framework (CDFGNN). We propose the adaptive cache mechanism to reduce the remote vertex access by caching the historical features and gradients of neighbor vertices. Besides, we further optimize the communication overhead by quantifying the messages and designing the graph partition algorithm for the hierarchical communication architecture. Experiments show that the adaptive cache mechanism reduces remote vertex accesses by 63.14% on average. Combined with communication quantization and hierarchical GP algorithm, CDFGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art distributed full-batch training frameworks by 30.39% in our experiments. Our results indicate that CDFGNN has great potential in accelerating distributed full-batch GNN training tasks.

Our approach keeps cached key-value pairs in the switch data plane while freeing them from item size limitations caused by hardware constraints.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, large language models (LLM) based on transformers are facing memory bottleneck issues due to KV cache, especially in long sequence handling. Previous researches proposed KV cache compression techniques that identify insignificant tokens based on Accumulative Attention Scores and removes their items from KV cache, noting that only few tokens play an important role in attention operations. However, we have observed that the existing Accumulative Attention Score is not suitable for the transformer decoder structure. In the decoder model, the number of times the Attention Score accumulates varies depending on the order of token appearance due to the effect of masking, causing an uneven comparison between tokens. To solve this, we propose Accumulative Attention Score with Forgetting Factor (A2SF) technique, which introduces a Forgetting Factor in the Attention Score accumulation process. A2SF applies a penalty to the past Attention Score generated from old tokens by repeatedly multiplying the Forgetting Factor to the Attention Score over time. Therefore, older tokens receive a larger penalty, providing fairness among different ages of tokens. Through the fair comparison among tokens, we can more effectively select important tokens. We have verified the accuracy improvement through A2SF in the OPT and LLaMA models and A2SF improves the accuracy of LLaMA 2 by up to 7.8% and 5.1% on 1-shot and 0-shot.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The possibility of electric field control of magnetocaloric effect through quasi-isostatic compression as a result of the converse piezoelectric effect was demonstrated on cylindrical type magnetoelectric composite MnAs/PZT. It was shown that an electric voltage of 100 V corresponding to an electric field of E ~0.3 kV/mm applied to the walls of the piezoelectric component PZT of the MnAs/PZT composite contributes to an increase in the maximum adiabatic temperature change by 0.2 K in the temperature range of the magnetostructural phase transition of MnAs ~317 K at magnetic field change of 1.8 T. Calculations using the finite element method have shown that an electric field voltage of 100 V is capable of creating a quasi-isostatic mechanical stress in the region inside a cylindrical PZT tube of ~3 MPa. Moreover, in the region of weak pressures up to 10 MPa, the contribution to the MCE from piezo compression linearly depends on the electrical voltage that can be used for control the MCE

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> KV-Cache compression methods generally sample a KV-Cache of effectual tokens or quantize it into lower bits. However, these methods cannot exploit the redundancy of the hidden dimension of KV tensors. This paper investigates a unique hidden dimension approach called Palu, a novel KV-Cache compression framework that utilizes low-rank projection. Palu decomposes the linear layers into low-rank matrices, caches the smaller intermediate states, and reconstructs the full keys and values on the fly. To improve accuracy, compression rate, and efficiency, Palu further encompasses (1) a medium-grained low-rank decomposition scheme, (2) an efficient rank search algorithm, (3) a low-rank-aware quantization algorithm, and (4) matrix fusion with optimized GPU kernels. Our extensive experiments with popular LLMs show that Palu can compress KV-Cache by more than 91.25% while maintaining a significantly better accuracy (up to 1.19 lower perplexity) than state-of-the-art KV-Cache quantization methods at a similar or even higher memory usage. When compressing KV-Cache for 50%, Palu delivers up to 1.61x end-to-end speedup for the attention module. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/shadowpa0327/Palu.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, achieving unprecedented performance across a variety of applications by leveraging increased model sizes and sequence lengths. However, the associated rise in computational and memory costs poses significant challenges, particularly in managing long sequences due to the quadratic complexity of the transformer attention mechanism. This paper focuses on the long-context scenario, addressing the inefficiencies in KV cache memory consumption during inference. Unlike existing approaches that optimize the memory based on the sequence lengths, we uncover that the channel dimension of the KV cache exhibits significant redundancy, characterized by unbalanced magnitude distribution and low-rank structure in attention weights. Based on these observations, we propose ThinK, a novel query-dependent KV cache pruning method designed to minimize attention weight loss while selectively pruning the least significant channels. Our approach not only maintains or enhances model accuracy but also achieves a reduction in memory costs by over 20% compared with vanilla KV cache eviction methods. Extensive evaluations on the LLaMA3 and Mistral models across various long-sequence datasets confirm the efficacy of ThinK, setting a new precedent for efficient LLM deployment without compromising performance. We also outline the potential of extending our method to value cache pruning, demonstrating ThinK's versatility and broad applicability in reducing both memory and computational overheads.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sparse matrix computation is crucial in various modern applications, including large-scale graph analytics, deep learning, and recommender systems. The performance of sparse kernels varies greatly depending on the structure of the input matrix, making it difficult to gain a comprehensive understanding of sparse computation and its relationship to inputs, algorithms, and target machine architecture. Despite extensive research on certain sparse kernels, such as Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV), the overall family of sparse algorithms has yet to be investigated as a whole. This paper introduces SpChar, a workload characterization methodology for general sparse computation. SpChar employs tree-based models to identify the most relevant hardware and input characteristics, starting from hardware and input-related metrics gathered from Performance Monitoring Counters (PMCs) and matrices. Our analysis enables the creation of a characterization loop that facilitates the optimization of sparse computation by mapping the impact of architectural features to inputs and algorithmic choices. We apply SpChar to more than 600 matrices from the SuiteSparse Matrix collection and three state-of-the-art Arm CPUs to determine the critical hardware and software characteristics that affect sparse computation. In our analysis, we determine that the biggest limiting factors for high-performance sparse computation are (1) the latency of the memory system, (2) the pipeline flush overhead resulting from branch misprediction, and (3) the poor reuse of cached elements. Additionally, we propose software and hardware optimizations that designers can implement to create a platform suitable for sparse computation. We then investigate these optimizations using the gem5 simulator to achieve a significant speedup of up to 2.63x compared to a CPU where the optimizations are not applied.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Applications with irregular data structures, data-dependent control flows and fine-grained data transfers (e.g., real-world graph computations) perform poorly on cache-based systems. We propose the UpDown accelerator that supports fine-grained execution with novel architecture mechanisms - lightweight threading, event-driven scheduling, efficient ultra-short threads, and split-transaction DRAM access with software-controlled synchronization. These hardware primitives support software programmable events, enabling high performance on diverse data structures and algorithms. UpDown also supports scalable performance; hardware replication enables programs to scale up performance. Evaluation results show UpDown's flexibility and scalability enable it to outperform CPUs on graph mining and analytics computations by up to 116-195x geomean speedup and more than 4x speedup over prior accelerators. We show that UpDown generates high memory parallelism (~4.6x over CPU) required for memory intensive graph computations. We present measurements that attribute the performance of UpDown (23x architectural advantage) to its individual architectural mechanisms. Finally, we also analyze the area and power cost of UpDown's mechanisms for software programmability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in large-scale vision-language models have achieved impressive performance in various zero-shot image classification tasks. While prior studies have demonstrated significant improvements by introducing few-shot labelled target samples, they still require labelling of target samples, which greatly degrades their scalability and generalizability while handling various visual recognition tasks. We design NtUA, a Noise-tolerant Unsupervised Adapter that allows the learning of effective target models with few unlabelled target samples. NtUA works as a key-value cache that formulates visual features and predicted pseudo-labels of the few unlabelled target samples as key-value pairs. It consists of two complementary designs. The first is adaptive cache formation that combats pseudo-label noises by weighting the key-value pairs according to their prediction confidence. The second is knowledge-guided cache refinement, which refines pair values (i.e., pseudo-labels) and cache weights by leveraging knowledge distillation from large-scale vision language models. Extensive experiments show that NtUA achieves superior performance consistently across multiple widely adopted benchmarks.

Despite extensive studies on FL-empowered channel estimation, the security concerns associated with FL require meticulous attention. In a scenario where small base stations (SBSs) serve as local models trained on cached data, and a macro base station (MBS) functions as the global model setting, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability of FL, launching attacks with various adversarial attacks or deployment tactics.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Software caches are an intrinsic component of almost every computer system. Consequently, caching algorithms, particularly eviction policies, are the topic of many papers. Almost all these prior papers evaluate the caching algorithm based on its hit ratio, namely the fraction of requests that are found in the cache, as opposed to disk. The hit ratio is viewed as a proxy for traditional performance metrics like system throughput or response time. Intuitively it makes sense that higher hit ratio should lead to higher throughput (and lower response time), since more requests are found in the cache (low access time) as opposed to the disk (high access time).   This paper challenges this intuition. We show that increasing the hit ratio can actually hurt the throughput (and response time) for many caching algorithms. Our investigation follows a three-pronged approach involving (i) queueing modeling and analysis, (ii) implementation and measurement, and (iii) simulation to validate the accuracy of the queueing model. We also show that the phenomenon of throughput decreasing at higher hit ratios is likely to be more pronounced in future systems, where the trend is towards faster disks and higher numbers of cores per CPU.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In-memory computing promises to overcome the von Neumann bottleneck in computer systems by performing computations directly within the memory. Previous research has suggested using Spin-Transfer Torque RAM (STT-RAM) for in-memory computing due to its non-volatility, low leakage power, high density, endurance, and commercial viability. This paper explores hierarchical in-memory computing, where different levels of the memory hierarchy are augmented with processing elements to optimize workload execution. The paper investigates processing in memory (PiM) using non-volatile STT-RAM and processing in cache (PiC) using volatile STT-RAM with relaxed retention, which helps mitigate STT-RAM's write latency and energy overheads. We analyze tradeoffs and overheads associated with data movement for PiC versus write overheads for PiM using STT-RAMs for various workloads. We examine workload characteristics, such as computational intensity and CPU-dependent workloads with limited instruction-level parallelism, and their impact on PiC/PiM tradeoffs. Using these workloads, we evaluate computing in STT-RAM versus SRAM at different cache hierarchy levels and explore the potential of heterogeneous STT-RAM cache architectures with various retention times for PiC and CPU-based computing. Our experiments reveal significant advantages of STT-RAM-based PiC over PiM for specific workloads. Finally, we describe open research problems in hierarchical in-memory computing architectures to further enhance this paradigm.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Processing-in-cache (PiC) and Processing-in-memory (PiM) architectures, especially those utilizing bit-line computing, offer promising solutions to mitigate data movement bottlenecks within the memory hierarchy. While previous studies have explored the integration of compute units within individual memory levels, the complexity and potential overheads associated with these designs have often limited their capabilities. This paper introduces a novel PiC/PiM architecture, Concurrent Hierarchical In-Memory Processing (CHIME), which strategically incorporates heterogeneous compute units across multiple levels of the memory hierarchy. This design targets the efficient execution of diverse, domain-specific workloads by placing computations closest to the data where it optimizes performance, energy consumption, data movement costs, and area. CHIME employs STT-RAM due to its various advantages in PiC/PiM computing, such as high density, low leakage, and better resiliency to data corruption from activating multiple word lines. We demonstrate that CHIME enhances concurrency and improves compute unit utilization at each level of the memory hierarchy. We present strategies for exploring the design space, grouping, and placing the compute units across the memory hierarchy. Experiments reveal that, compared to the state-of-the-art bit-line computing approaches, CHIME achieves significant speedup and energy savings of 57.95% and 78.23% for various domain-specific workloads, while reducing the overheads associated with single-level compute designs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Relaxed retention (or volatile) spin-transfer torque RAM (STT-RAM) has been widely studied as a way to reduce STT-RAM's write energy and latency overheads. Given a relaxed retention time STT-RAM level one (L1) cache, we analyze the impacts of dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) -- a common optimization in modern processors -- on STT-RAM L1 cache design. Our analysis reveals that, apart from the fact that different applications may require different retention times, the clock frequency, which is typically ignored in most STT-RAM studies, may also significantly impact applications' retention time needs. Based on our findings, we propose an asymmetric-retention core (ARC) design for multicore architectures. ARC features retention time heterogeneity to specialize STT-RAM retention times to applications' needs. We also propose a runtime prediction model to determine the best core on which to run an application, based on the applications' characteristics, their retention time requirements, and available DVFS settings. Results reveal that the proposed approach can reduce the average cache energy by 20.19% and overall processor energy by 7.66%, compared to a homogeneous STT-RAM cache design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Prior studies have shown that the retention time of the non-volatile spin-transfer torque RAM (STT-RAM) can be relaxed in order to reduce STT-RAM's write energy and latency. However, since different applications may require different retention times, STT-RAM retention times must be critically explored to satisfy various applications' needs. This process can be challenging due to exploration overhead, and exacerbated by the fact that STT-RAM caches are emerging and are not readily available for design time exploration. This paper explores using known and easily obtainable statistics (e.g., SRAM statistics) to predict the appropriate STT-RAM retention times, in order to minimize exploration overhead. We propose an STT-RAM Cache Retention Time (SCART) model, which utilizes machine learning to enable design time or runtime prediction of right-provisioned STT-RAM retention times for latency or energy optimization. Experimental results show that, on average, SCART can reduce the latency and energy by 20.34% and 29.12%, respectively, compared to a homogeneous retention time while reducing the exploration overheads by 52.58% compared to prior work.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Colocating high-priority, latency-sensitive (LS) and low-priority, best-effort (BE) DNN inference services reduces the total cost of ownership (TCO) of GPU clusters. Limited by bottlenecks such as VRAM channel conflicts and PCIe bus contentions, existing GPU sharing solutions are unable to avoid resource conflicts among concurrently executing tasks, failing to achieve both low latency for LS tasks and high throughput for BE tasks. To bridge this gap, this paper presents Missile, a general GPU sharing solution for multi-tenant DNN inference on NVIDIA GPUs. Missile approximates fine-grained GPU hardware resource isolation between multiple LS and BE DNN tasks at software level. Through comprehensive reverse engineering, Missile first reveals a general VRAM channel hash mapping architecture of NVIDIA GPUs and eliminates VRAM channel conflicts using software-level cache coloring. It also isolates the PCIe bus and fairly allocates PCIe bandwidth using completely fair scheduler. We evaluate 12 mainstream DNNs with synthetic and real-world workloads on four GPUs. The results show that compared to the state-of-the-art GPU sharing solutions, Missile reduces tail latency for LS services by up to ~50%, achieves up to 6.1x BE job throughput, and allocates PCIe bus bandwidth to tenants on-demand for optimal performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper investigates the role of CLIP image embeddings within the Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) framework, focusing on their impact on video generation quality and computational efficiency. Our findings indicate that CLIP embeddings, while crucial for aesthetic quality, do not significantly contribute towards the subject and background consistency of video outputs. Moreover, the computationally expensive cross-attention mechanism can be effectively replaced by a simpler linear layer. This layer is computed only once at the first diffusion inference step, and its output is then cached and reused throughout the inference process, thereby enhancing efficiency while maintaining high-quality outputs. Building on these insights, we introduce the VCUT, a training-free approach optimized for efficiency within the SVD architecture. VCUT eliminates temporal cross-attention and replaces spatial cross-attention with a one-time computed linear layer, significantly reducing computational load. The implementation of VCUT leads to a reduction of up to 322T Multiple-Accumulate Operations (MACs) per video and a decrease in model parameters by up to 50M, achieving a 20% reduction in latency compared to the baseline. Our approach demonstrates that conditioning during the Semantic Binding stage is sufficient, eliminating the need for continuous computation across all inference steps and setting a new standard for efficient video generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cloud key-value (KV) stores provide businesses with a cost-effective and adaptive alternative to traditional on-premise data management solutions. KV stores frequently consist of heterogeneous clusters, characterized by varying hardware specifications of the deployment nodes, with each node potentially running a distinct version of the KV store software. This heterogeneity is accompanied by the diverse metadata that they need to manage. In this study, we introduce MetaHive, a cache-optimized approach to managing metadata in heterogeneous KV store clusters. MetaHive disaggregates the original data from its associated metadata to promote independence between them, while maintaining their interconnection during usage. This makes the metadata opaque from the downstream processes and the other KV stores in the cluster. MetaHive also ensures that the KV and metadata entries are stored in the vicinity of each other in memory and storage. This allows MetaHive to optimally utilize the caching mechanism without extra storage read overhead for metadata retrieval. We deploy MetaHive to ensure data integrity in RocksDB and demonstrate its rapid data validation with minimal effect on performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the field of instruction-following large vision-language models (LVLMs), the efficient deployment of these models faces challenges, notably due to the high memory demands of their key-value (KV) caches. Conventional cache management strategies for LLMs focus on cache eviction, which often fails to address the specific needs of multimodal instruction-following models. Recognizing this gap, in this paper, we introduce Elastic Cache, a novel approach that benefits from applying distinct acceleration methods for instruction encoding and output generation stages. We investigate the metrics of importance in different stages and propose an importance-driven cache merging strategy to prune redundancy caches. Instead of discarding less important caches, our strategy identifies important key/value vectors as anchor points. Surrounding less important caches are then merged with these anchors, enhancing the preservation of contextual information in the KV caches while yielding an arbitrary acceleration ratio. For instruction encoding, we utilize the frequency to evaluate the importance of caches. Regarding output generation, we prioritize tokens based on their distance with an offset, by which both the initial and most recent tokens are retained. Results on a range of LVLMs demonstrate that Elastic Cache not only boosts efficiency but also notably outperforms existing pruning methods in language generation across various tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficiently serving large language models (LLMs) requires batching of many requests to reduce the cost per request. Yet, with larger batch sizes and longer context lengths, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores attention keys and values to avoid re-computations, significantly increases memory demands and becomes the new bottleneck in speed and memory usage. Additionally, the loading of the KV cache causes the computational core to be idle, which limits the inference speed. A straightforward and effective solution to reduce KV cache size is quantization, which decreases the total bytes taken by KV cache. However, there is a lack of in-depth studies that explore the element distribution of KV cache to understand the hardness and limitation of KV cache quantization. To fill the gap, we conducted a comprehensive study on the element distribution in KV cache of popular LLMs. Our findings indicate that the key cache should be quantized per-channel, i.e., group elements along the channel dimension and quantize them together. In contrast, the value cache should be quantized per-token. From this analysis, we developed a tuning-free 2bit KV cache quantization algorithm named KIVI. With hardware-friendly implementation, KIVI can enable Llama, Falcon, and Mistral models to maintain almost the same quality while using $\mathbf{2.6\times}$ less peak memory (including model weight). This reduction in memory usage enables up to $\mathbf{4\times}$ larger batch size, bringing $\mathbf{2.35\times \sim 3.47\times}$ throughput on real LLM inference workload.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Building efficient inference framework has gained increasing interests for research community. Early-exit models, a variant of LLMs, improves the inference efficiency of LLMs by skipping rest layers and directly generate output tokens when they are confident enough. However, there is no work of LLM inference framework that takes early-exit models into consideration. This is non-trivial as prior art on LLM inference cannot be directly applied to early-exit models. In this work, we solves two key challenges in building efficient inference framework for early-exit models: (1) batch inference at iteration-level granularity; and (2) KV cache management. For the former, we propose to process the batch until all sequences surpass the early-exit confidence threshold. For the latter, we propose to fill the KV cache of rest layers before the iteration terminates. Our evaluation shows that, compared with the original vLLM operating at full layers, our solution achieves up to 1.25x speed up.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Existing LLM training and inference frameworks struggle in boosting efficiency with sparsity while maintaining the integrity of context and model architecture. Inspired by the sharding concept in database and the fact that attention parallelizes over heads on accelerators, we propose Sparsely-Sharded (S2) Attention, an attention algorithm that allocates heterogeneous context partitions for different attention heads to divide and conquer. S2-Attention enforces each attention head to only attend to a partition of contexts following a strided sparsity pattern, while the full context is preserved as the union of all the shards. As attention heads are processed in separate thread blocks, the context reduction for each head can thus produce end-to-end speed-up and memory reduction. At inference, LLMs trained with S2-Attention can then take the KV cache reduction as free meals with guaranteed model quality preserve. In experiments, we show S2-Attentioncan provide as much as (1) 25.3X wall-clock attention speed-up over FlashAttention-2, resulting in 6X reduction in end-to-end training time and 10X inference latency, (2) on-par model training quality compared to default attention, (3)perfect needle retrieval accuracy over 32K context window. On top of the algorithm, we build DKernel, an LLM training and inference kernel library that allows users to customize sparsity patterns for their own models. We open-sourced DKerneland make it compatible with Megatron, Pytorch, and vLLM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this work, a distributed server system composed of multiple servers that holds some coded files and multiple users that are interested in retrieving the linear functions of the files is investigated, where the servers are robust, blind and adversarial in the sense that any $J$ servers can together recover all files, while any $I$ colluding servers cannot obtain any information about the files, and at most $A$ servers maliciously provides erroneous information. In addition, the file library must be secure from a wiretapper who obtains all the signals, and the demands of any subset of users must kept private from the other users and servers, even if they collude. A coding scheme is proposed by incorporating the ideas of Shamir's secret sharing and key superposition into the framework of Placement Delivery Array (PDA), originally proposed to characterize the single-server coded caching system without any security or privacy constraints. It is shown that PDAs associated to Maddah-Ali and Niesen's coded caching scheme results in an achievable memory-storage-communication region, such that the storage size and communication load were optimal to within a multiplicative gap, except for the small memory regime when the number of files was smaller than the number of users.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are often tested in simulation to estimate the probability they will violate safety specifications. Two common issues arise when using existing techniques to produce this estimation: If violations occur rarely, simple Monte-Carlo sampling techniques can fail to produce efficient estimates; if simulation horizons are too long, importance sampling techniques (which learn proposal distributions from past simulations) can fail to converge. This paper addresses both issues by interleaving rare-event sampling techniques with online specification monitoring algorithms. We use adaptive multi-level splitting to decompose simulations into partial trajectories, then calculate the distance of those partial trajectories to failure by leveraging robustness metrics from Signal Temporal Logic (STL). By caching those partial robustness metric values, we can efficiently re-use computations across multiple sampling stages. Our experiments on an interstate lane-change scenario show our method is viable for testing simulated AV-pipelines, efficiently estimating failure probabilities for STL specifications based on real traffic rules. We produce better estimates than Monte-Carlo and importance sampling in fewer simulations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Rich textual and topological information of textual graphs need to be modeled in real-world applications such as webpages, e-commerce, and academic articles. Practitioners have been long following the path of adopting a shallow text encoder and a subsequent graph neural network (GNN) to solve this problem. In light of recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), it is apparent that integrating LLMs for enhanced textual encoding can substantially improve the performance of textual graphs. Nevertheless, the efficiency of these methods poses a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose ENGINE, a parameter- and memory-efficient fine-tuning method for textual graphs with an LLM encoder. The key insight is to combine the LLMs and GNNs through a tunable side structure, which significantly reduces the training complexity without impairing the joint model's capacity. Extensive experiments on textual graphs demonstrate our method's effectiveness by achieving the best model performance, meanwhile having the lowest training cost compared to previous methods. Moreover, we introduce two variants with caching and dynamic early exit to further enhance training and inference speed. Specifically, caching accelerates ENGINE's training by 12x, and dynamic early exit achieves up to 5x faster inference with a negligible performance drop (at maximum 1.17% relevant drop across 7 datasets).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformers have emerged as the backbone of large language models (LLMs). However, generation remains inefficient due to the need to store in memory a cache of key-value representations for past tokens, whose size scales linearly with the input sequence length and batch size. As a solution, we propose Dynamic Memory Compression (DMC), a method for online key-value cache compression at inference time. Most importantly, the model learns to apply different compression ratios in different heads and layers. We retrofit pre-trained LLMs such as Llama 2 (7B, 13B and 70B) into DMC Transformers, achieving up to 7x throughput increase during auto-regressive inference on an NVIDIA H100 GPU. DMC is applied via continued pre-training on a negligible percentage of the original data without adding any extra parameters. DMC preserves the original downstream performance with up to 4x cache compression, outperforming up-trained grouped-query attention (GQA) and key-value eviction policies (H$_2$O, TOVA). GQA and DMC can be even combined to obtain compounded gains. Hence, DMC can serve as a drop-in replacement for KV caching in existing LLMs to fit longer contexts and larger batches within any given memory budget.

In this article, we examine how some of the concepts of 6G technologies developed for terrestrial networks can be relevant in the context of cislunar networks. We discuss how 6G concepts, such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, quantum-resistant physical layer security, private information read/write/cache networks, semantic and goal-oriented communications, information freshness based quality of communication metrics, multi-relay and cooperative networks, hold the potential to shape the future of cislunar communications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Web caches play a crucial role in web performance and scalability. However, detecting cached responses is challenging when web servers do not reliably communicate the cache status through standardized headers. This paper presents a novel methodology for cache detection using timing analysis. Our approach eliminates the dependency on cache status headers, making it applicable to any web server. The methodology relies on sending paired requests using HTTP multiplexing functionality and makes heavy use of cache-busting to control the origin of the responses. By measuring the time it takes to receive responses from paired requests, we can determine if a response is cached or not. In each pair, one request is cache-busted to force retrieval from the origin server, while the other request is not and might be served from the cache, if present. A faster response time for the non-cache-busted request compared to the cache-busted one suggests the first one is coming from the cache. We implemented this approach in a tool and achieved an estimated accuracy of 89.6% compared to state-of-the-art methods based on cache status headers. Leveraging our cache detection approach, we conducted a large-scale experiment on the Tranco Top 50k websites. We identified a significant presence of hidden caches (5.8%) that do not advertise themselves through headers. Additionally, we employed our methodology to detect Web Cache Deception (WCD) vulnerabilities in these hidden caches. We discovered that 1.020 of them are susceptible to WCD vulnerabilities, potentially leaking sensitive data. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our timing analysis methodology for cache discovery and highlight the importance of a tool that does not rely on cache-communicated cache status headers.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> CXL (Compute Express Link) is an emerging open industry-standard interconnect between processing and memory devices that is expected to revolutionize the way systems are designed in the near future. It enables cache-coherent shared memory pools in a disaggregated fashion at unprecedented scales, allowing algorithms to interact with a variety of storage devices using simple loads and stores in a cacheline granularity. Alongside with unleashing unique opportunities for a wide range of applications, CXL introduces new challenges of data management and crash consistency. Alas, CXL lacks an adequate programming model, which makes reasoning about the correctness and expected behaviors of algorithms and systems on top of it nearly impossible.   In this work, we present CXL0, the first programming model for concurrent programs running on top of CXL. We propose a high-level abstraction for CXL memory accesses and formally define operational semantics on top of that abstraction. We provide a set of general transformations that adapt concurrent algorithms to the new disruptive technology. Using these transformations, every linearizable algorithm can be easily transformed into its provably correct version in the face of a full-system or sub-system crash. We believe that this work will serve as the stepping stone for systems design and modelling on top of CXL, and support the development of future models as software and hardware evolve.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are not only resource-intensive to train but even more costly to deploy in production. Therefore, recent work has attempted to prune blocks of LLMs based on cheap proxies for estimating block importance, effectively removing 10% of blocks in well-trained LLaMa-2 and Mistral 7b models without any significant degradation of downstream metrics. In this paper, we explore different block importance metrics by considering adaptive metrics such as Shapley value in addition to static ones explored in prior work. We show that adaptive metrics exhibit a trade-off in performance between tasks i.e., improvement on one task may degrade performance on the other due to differences in the computed block influences. Furthermore, we extend this analysis from a complete block to individual self-attention and feed-forward layers, highlighting the propensity of the self-attention layers to be more amendable to pruning, even allowing removal of upto 33% of the self-attention layers without incurring any performance degradation on MMLU for Mistral 7b (significant reduction in costly maintenance of KV-cache). Finally, we look at simple performance recovery techniques to emulate the pruned layers by training lightweight additive bias or low-rank linear adapters. Performance recovery using emulated updates avoids performance degradation for the initial blocks (up to 5% absolute improvement on MMLU), which is either competitive or superior to the learning-based technique.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across various domains, processing millions of daily requests. This surge in demand poses significant challenges in optimizing throughput and latency while keeping costs manageable. The Key-Value (KV) cache, a standard method for retaining previous computations, makes LLM inference highly bounded by memory. While batching strategies can enhance performance, they frequently lead to significant memory fragmentation. Even though cutting-edge systems like vLLM mitigate KV cache fragmentation using paged Attention mechanisms, they still suffer from inefficient memory and computational operations due to the tightly coupled page management and computation kernels.   This study introduces the vTensor, an innovative tensor structure for LLM inference based on GPU virtual memory management (VMM). vTensor addresses existing limitations by decoupling computation from memory defragmentation and offering dynamic extensibility. Our framework employs a CPU-GPU heterogeneous approach, ensuring efficient, fragmentation-free memory management while accommodating various computation kernels across different LLM architectures. Experimental results indicate that vTensor achieves an average speedup of 1.86x across different models, with up to 2.42x in multi-turn chat scenarios. Additionally, vTensor provides average speedups of 2.12x and 3.15x in kernel evaluation, reaching up to 3.92x and 3.27x compared to SGLang Triton prefix-prefilling kernels and vLLM paged Attention kernel, respectively. Furthermore, it frees approximately 71.25% (57GB) of memory on the NVIDIA A100 GPU compared to vLLM, enabling more memory-intensive workloads.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LSM-based key-value (KV) stores are an important component in modern data infrastructures. However, they suffer from high tail latency, in the order of several seconds, making them less attractive for user-facing applications. In this paper, we introduce the notion of compaction chains and we analyse how they affect tail latency. Then, we show that modern designs reduce tail latency, by trading I/O amplification or require large amounts of memory. Based on our analysis, we present vLSM, a new KV store design that improves tail latency significantly without compromising on memory or I/O amplification. vLSM reduces (a) compaction chain width by using small SSTs and eliminating the tiering compaction required in L0 by modern systems and (b) compaction chain length by using a larger than typical growth factor between L1 and L2 and introducing overlap-aware SSTs in L1. We implement vLSM in RocksDB and evaluate it using db_bench and YCSB. Our evaluation highlights the underlying trade-off among memory requirements, I/O amplification, and tail latency, as well as the advantage of vLSM over current approaches. vLSM improves P99 tail latency by up to 4.8x for writes and by up to 12.5x for reads, reduces cumulative write stalls by up to 60% while also slightly improves I/O amplification at the same memory budget.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The coalgebraic $\mu$-calculus provides a generic semantic framework for fixpoint logics over systems whose branching type goes beyond the standard relational setup, e.g. probabilistic, weighted, or game-based. Previous work on the coalgebraic $\mu$-calculus includes an exponential-time upper bound on satisfiability checking, which however relies on the availability of tableau rules for the next-step modalities that are sufficiently well-behaved in a formally defined sense; in particular, rule matches need to be representable by polynomial-sized codes, and the sequent duals of the rules need to absorb cut. While such rule sets have been identified for some important cases, they are not known to exist in all cases of interest, in particular ones involving either integer weights as in the graded $\mu$-calculus, or real-valued weights in combination with non-linear arithmetic. In the present work, we prove the same upper complexity bound under more general assumptions, specifically regarding the complexity of the (much simpler) satisfiability problem for the underlying one-step logic, roughly described as the nesting-free next-step fragment of the logic. The bound is realized by a generic global caching algorithm that supports on-the-fly satisfiability checking. Notably, our approach directly accommodates unguarded formulae, and thus avoids use of the guardedness transformation. Example applications include new exponential-time upper bounds for satisfiability checking in an extension of the graded $\mu$-calculus with polynomial inequalities (including positive Presburger arithmetic), as well as an extension of the (two-valued) probabilistic $\mu$-calculus with polynomial inequalities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based large language models have achieved remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks. However, they often struggle with seemingly easy tasks like arithmetic despite their vast capabilities. This stark disparity raise human's concerns about their safe and ethical use, hinder their widespread adoption.In this paper, we focus on a typical arithmetic task, integer multiplication, to explore and explain the imperfection of transformers in this domain. We provide comprehensive analysis of a vanilla transformer trained to perform n-digit integer multiplication. Our observations indicate that the model decomposes multiplication task into multiple parallel subtasks, sequentially optimizing each subtask for each digit to complete the final multiplication. Based on observation and analysis, we infer the reasons of transformers deficiencies in multiplication tasks lies in their difficulty in calculating successive carryovers and caching intermediate results, and confirmed this inference through experiments. Guided by these findings, we propose improvements to enhance transformers performance on multiplication tasks. These enhancements are validated through rigorous testing and mathematical modeling, not only enhance transformer's interpretability, but also improve its performance, e.g., we achieve over 99.9% accuracy on 5-digit integer multiplication with a tiny transformer, outperform LLMs GPT-4. Our method contributes to the broader fields of model understanding and interpretability, paving the way for analyzing more complex tasks and Transformer models. This work underscores the importance of explainable AI, helping to build trust in large language models and promoting their adoption in critical applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The memory and computational demands of Key-Value (KV) cache present significant challenges for deploying long-context language models. Previous approaches attempt to mitigate this issue by selectively dropping tokens, which irreversibly erases critical information that might be needed for future queries. In this paper, we propose a novel compression technique for KV cache that preserves all token information. Our investigation reveals that: i) Most attention heads primarily focus on the local context; ii) Only a few heads, denoted as retrieval heads, can essentially pay attention to all input tokens. These key observations motivate us to use separate caching strategy for attention heads. Therefore, we propose RazorAttention, a training-free KV cache compression algorithm, which maintains a full cache for these crucial retrieval heads and discards the remote tokens in non-retrieval heads. Furthermore, we introduce a novel mechanism involving a "compensation token" to further recover the information in the dropped tokens. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of large language models (LLMs) demonstrate that RazorAttention achieves a reduction in KV cache size by over 70% without noticeable impacts on performance. Additionally, RazorAttention is compatible with FlashAttention, rendering it an efficient and plug-and-play solution that enhances LLM inference efficiency without overhead or retraining of the original model.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used today in recommendation systems, fraud detection, and node/link classification tasks. Real world GNNs continue to scale in size and require a large memory footprint for storing graphs and embeddings that often exceed the memory capacities of the target GPUs used for training. To address limited memory capacities, traditional GNN training approaches use graph partitioning and sharding techniques to scale up across multiple GPUs within a node and/or scale out across multiple nodes. However, this approach suffers from the high computational costs of graph partitioning algorithms and inefficient communication across GPUs.   To address these overheads, we propose Large-scale Storage-based Multi-GPU GNN framework (LSM-GNN), a storagebased approach to train GNN models that utilizes a novel communication layer enabling GPU software caches to function as a system-wide shared cache with low overheads.LSM-GNN incorporates a hybrid eviction policy that intelligently manages cache space by using both static and dynamic node information to significantly enhance cache performance. Furthermore, we introduce the Preemptive Victim-buffer Prefetcher (PVP), a mechanism for prefetching node feature data from a Victim Buffer located in CPU pinned-memory to further reduce the pressure on the storage devices. Experimental results show that despite the lower compute capabilities and memory capacities, LSM-GNN in a single node with two GPUs offers superior performance over two-node-four-GPU Dist-DGL baseline and provides up to 3.75x speed up on end-to-end epoch time while running large-scale GNN training

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The maximum supported context length is a critical bottleneck limiting the practical application of the Large Language Model (LLM). Although existing length extrapolation methods can extend the context of LLMs to millions of tokens, these methods all have an explicit upper bound. In this work, we propose LongCache, a training-free approach that enables LLM to support an infinite context with finite context scope, through full-context cache selection and training-free integration. This effectively frees LLMs from the length extrapolation issue. We validate LongCache on the LongBench and L-Eval and demonstrate its performance is on par with traditional full-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, we have applied LongCache on mainstream LLMs, including LLaMA3 and Mistral-v0.3, enabling them to support context lengths of at least 400K in Needle-In-A-Haystack tests. We will improve the efficiency of LongCache by GPU-aware optimization soon.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Split learning (SL) aims to protect user data privacy by distributing deep models between client-server and keeping private data locally. In SL training with multiple clients, the local model weights are shared among the clients for local model update. This paper first reveals data privacy leakage exacerbated from local weight sharing among the clients in SL through model inversion attacks. Then, to reduce the data privacy leakage issue, we propose and analyze privacy-enhanced SL (P-SL) (or SL without local weight sharing). We further propose parallelized P-SL to expedite the training process by duplicating multiple server-side model instances without compromising accuracy. Finally, we explore P-SL with late participating clients and devise a server-side cache-based training method to address the forgetting phenomenon in SL when late clients join. Experimental results demonstrate that P-SL helps reduce up to 50% of client-side data leakage, which essentially achieves a better privacy-accuracy trade-off than the current trend by using differential privacy mechanisms. Moreover, P-SL and its cache-based version achieve comparable accuracy to baseline SL under various data distributions, while cost less computation and communication. Additionally, caching-based training in P-SL mitigates the negative effect of forgetting, stabilizes the learning, and enables practical and low-complexity training in a dynamic environment with late-arriving clients.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> How to efficiently serve Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a pressing issue because of their huge computational cost in their autoregressive generation process. To mitigate computational costs, LLMs often employ the KV Cache technique to improve the generation speed. While improving the computational efficiency, the storage requirements of the KV cache are substantial, particularly in long-context scenarios, leading to significant memory consumption. Existing KV cache eviction methods often degrade the performance of LLMs in long-context scenarios due to the information loss introduced by eviction. In this paper, we propose a novel KV cache merging approach, called KVMerger, to achieve adaptive KV cache compression for long-context tasks without significant performance degradation under constrained memory budgets. Our approach is inspired by the intriguing observation that key states exhibit high similarity at the token level within a single sequence. To facilitate merging, we develop an effective yet straightforward merging set identification algorithm to identify suitable KV states for merging. Our merging set identification algorithm stimulates the second observation that KV cache sparsity, from similarity perspective, is independent of the dataset and remains persistent at the model level. Subsequently, we propose a Gaussian kernel weighted merging algorithm to selectively merge all states within each merging set. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of KVMerger for long-context tasks under constrained memory budgets, applying it to models including Llama2-7B-chat and Llama2-13B-chat. Using the LongBench and ZeroScroll benchmarks, we compare our method with other KV cache compression techniques, including H2O and CaM, showing that our method achieves superior performance across tasks with both 50% and 35% KV cache budgets.

In this work, we develop a distributed volumetric neural representation and optimize it for in situ visualization. Our technique eliminates data exchanges between processes, achieving state-of-the-art compression speed, quality and ratios. Our technique also enables the implementation of an efficient strategy for caching large-scale simulation data in high temporal frequencies, further facilitating the use of reactive in situ visualization in a wider range of scientific problems. We integrate this system with the Ascent infrastructure and evaluate its performance and usability using real-world simulations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models (LLMs) take on complex tasks, their inputs are supplemented with longer contexts that incorporate domain knowledge. Yet using long contexts is challenging, as nothing can be generated until the whole context is processed by the LLM. While the context-processing delay can be reduced by reusing the KV cache of a context across different inputs, fetching the KV cache, which contains large tensors, over the network can cause high extra network delays.   CacheGen is a fast context-loading module for LLM systems. First, CacheGen uses a custom tensor encoder, leveraging KV cache's distributional properties to encode a KV cache into more compact bitstream representations with negligible decoding overhead, to save bandwidth usage. Second, CacheGen adapts the compression level of different parts of a KV cache to cope with changes in available bandwidth, in order to maintain low context-loading delay and high generation quality. % When available bandwidth drops, CacheGen may raise the compression level for a part of the context or recompute its KV cache on the fly. We test CacheGen on popular LLMs and datasets. Compared to the recent systems that reuse the KV cache, CacheGen reduces the KV cache size by 3.5-4.3x and the total delay in fetching and processing contexts by 3.2-3.7x with negligible impact on the LLM response quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurately retrieving relevant bid keywords for user queries is critical in Sponsored Search but remains challenging, particularly for short, ambiguous queries. Existing dense and generative retrieval models often fail to capture nuanced user intent in these cases. To address this, we propose an approach to enhance query understanding by augmenting queries with rich contextual signals derived from web search results and large language models, stored in an online cache. Specifically, we use web search titles and snippets to ground queries in real-world information and utilize GPT-4 to generate query rewrites and explanations that clarify user intent. These signals are efficiently integrated through a Fusion-in-Decoder based Unity architecture, enabling both dense and generative retrieval with serving costs on par with traditional context-free models. To address scenarios where context is unavailable in the cache, we introduce context glancing, a curriculum learning strategy that improves model robustness and performance even without contextual signals during inference. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that our context-aware approach substantially outperforms context-free models. Furthermore, online A/B testing on a prominent search engine across 160+ countries shows significant improvements in user engagement and revenue.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The computational difficulties of large language model (LLM) inference remain a significant obstacle to their widespread deployment. The need for many applications to support long input sequences and process them in large batches typically causes token-generation to be bottlenecked by data transfer. For this reason, we introduce SparQ Attention, a technique for increasing the inference throughput of LLMs by utilising memory bandwidth more efficiently within the attention layers, through selective fetching of the cached history. Our proposed technique can be applied directly to off-the-shelf LLMs during inference, without requiring any modification to the pre-training setup or additional fine-tuning. We show that SparQ Attention brings up to 8x savings in attention data transfers without substantial drops in accuracy, by evaluating Llama 2 and 3, Mistral, Gemma and Pythia models on a wide range of downstream tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The inference of transformer-based large language models consists of two sequential stages: 1) a prefilling stage to compute the KV cache of prompts and generate the first token, and 2) a decoding stage to generate subsequent tokens. For long prompts, the KV cache must be computed for all tokens during the prefilling stage, which can significantly increase the time needed to generate the first token. Consequently, the prefilling stage may become a bottleneck in the generation process. An open question remains whether all prompt tokens are essential for generating the first token. To answer this, we introduce a novel method, LazyLLM, that selectively computes the KV for tokens important for the next token prediction in both the prefilling and decoding stages. Contrary to static pruning approaches that prune the prompt at once, LazyLLM allows language models to dynamically select different subsets of tokens from the context in different generation steps, even though they might be pruned in previous steps. Extensive experiments on standard datasets across various tasks demonstrate that LazyLLM is a generic method that can be seamlessly integrated with existing language models to significantly accelerate the generation without fine-tuning. For instance, in the multi-document question-answering task, LazyLLM accelerates the prefilling stage of the LLama 2 7B model by 2.34x while maintaining accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep learning kernels exhibit predictable memory accesses and compute patterns, making GPUs' parallel architecture well-suited for their execution. Software and runtime systems for GPUs are optimized to better utilize the stream multiprocessors, on-chip cache, and off-chip high-bandwidth memory. As deep learning models and GPUs evolve, access to newer GPUs is often limited, raising questions about the performance of new model architectures on existing GPUs, existing models on new GPUs, and new model architectures on new GPUs. To address these questions, we introduce NeuSight, a framework to predict the performance of various deep learning models, for both training and inference, on unseen GPUs without requiring actual execution. The framework leverages both GPU hardware behavior and software library optimizations to estimate end-to-end performance. Previous work uses regression models that capture linear trends or multilayer perceptrons to predict the overall latency of deep learning kernels on GPUs. These approaches suffer from higher error percentages when forecasting performance on unseen models and new GPUs. Instead, NeuSight decomposes the prediction problem into smaller problems, bounding the prediction through fundamental performance laws. NeuSight decomposes a single deep learning kernel prediction into smaller working sets called tiles, which are executed independently on the GPU. Tile-granularity predictions are determined using a machine learning approach and aggregated to estimate end-to-end latency. NeuSight outperforms prior work across various deep learning workloads and the latest GPUs. It reduces the percentage error from 198% and 19.7% to 3.8% in predicting the latency of GPT3 model for training and inference on H100, compared to state-of-the-art prior works, where both GPT3 and H100 were not used to train the framework.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable perceptual and reasoning abilities, typically comprising a Vision Encoder, an Adapter, and a Large Language Model (LLM). The adapter serves as the critical bridge between the visual and language components. However, training adapters with image-level supervision often results in significant misalignment, undermining the LLMs' capabilities and limiting the potential of Multimodal LLMs. To address this, we introduce Supervised Embedding Alignment (SEA), a token-level alignment method that leverages vision-language pre-trained models, such as CLIP, to align visual tokens with the LLM's embedding space through contrastive learning. This approach ensures a more coherent integration of visual and language representations, enhancing the performance and interpretability of multimodal LLMs while preserving their inherent capabilities. Extensive experiments show that SEA effectively improves MLLMs, particularly for smaller models, without adding extra data or inference computation. SEA also lays the groundwork for developing more general and adaptable solutions to enhance multimodal systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Embodied tasks require the agent to fully understand 3D scenes simultaneously with its exploration, so an online, real-time, fine-grained and highly-generalized 3D perception model is desperately needed. Since high-quality 3D data is limited, directly training such a model in 3D is almost infeasible. Meanwhile, vision foundation models (VFM) has revolutionized the field of 2D computer vision with superior performance, which makes the use of VFM to assist embodied 3D perception a promising direction. However, most existing VFM-assisted 3D perception methods are either offline or too slow that cannot be applied in practical embodied tasks. In this paper, we aim to leverage Segment Anything Model (SAM) for real-time 3D instance segmentation in an online setting. This is a challenging problem since future frames are not available in the input streaming RGB-D video, and an instance may be observed in several frames so object matching between frames is required. To address these challenges, we first propose a geometric-aware query lifting module to represent the 2D masks generated by SAM by 3D-aware queries, which is then iteratively refined by a dual-level query decoder. In this way, the 2D masks are transferred to fine-grained shapes on 3D point clouds. Benefit from the query representation for 3D masks, we can compute the similarity matrix between the 3D masks from different views by efficient matrix operation, which enables real-time inference. Experiments on ScanNet, ScanNet200, SceneNN and 3RScan show our method achieves leading performance even compared with offline methods. Our method also demonstrates great generalization ability in several zero-shot dataset transferring experiments and show great potential in open-vocabulary and data-efficient setting. Code and demo are available at https://xuxw98.github.io/ESAM/, with only one RTX 3090 GPU required for training and evaluation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have become more prevalent in long-context applications such as interactive chatbots, document analysis, and agent workflows, but it is challenging to serve long-context requests with low latency and high throughput. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used technique to reduce latency without sacrificing performance but the conventional wisdom suggests that its efficacy is limited to small batch sizes. In MagicDec, we show that surprisingly SD can achieve speedup even for a high throughput inference regime for moderate to long sequences. More interestingly, an intelligent drafting strategy can achieve better speedup with increasing batch size based on our rigorous analysis. MagicDec first identifies the bottleneck shifts with increasing batch size and sequence length, and uses these insights to deploy speculative decoding more effectively for high throughput inference. Then, it leverages draft models with sparse KV cache to address the KV bottleneck that scales with both sequence length and batch size. This finding underscores the broad applicability of speculative decoding in long-context serving, as it can enhance throughput and reduce latency without compromising accuracy. For moderate to long sequences, we demonstrate up to 2x speedup for LLaMA-2-7B-32K and 1.84x speedup for LLaMA-3.1-8B when serving batch sizes ranging from 32 to 256 on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As artificial intelligence (AI) applications continue to expand in next-generation networks, there is a growing need for deep neural network (DNN) models. Although DNN models deployed at the edge are promising for providing AI as a service with low latency, their cooperation is yet to be explored. In this paper, we consider that DNN service providers share their computing resources as well as their models' parameters and allow other DNNs to offload their computations without mirroring. We propose a novel algorithm called coordinated DNNs on edge (\textbf{CoDE}) that facilitates coordination among DNN services by establishing new inference paths. CoDE aims to find the optimal path, which is the path with the highest possible reward, by creating multi-task DNNs from individual models. The reward reflects the inference throughput and model accuracy. With CoDE, DNN models can make new paths for inference by using their own or other models' parameters. We then evaluate the performance of CoDE through numerical experiments. The results demonstrate a $40\%$ increase in the inference throughput while degrading the average accuracy by only $2.3\%$. Experiments show that CoDE enhances the inference throughput and, achieves higher precision compared to a state-of-the-art existing method.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Long-context capability is critical for multi-modal foundation models, especially for long video understanding. We introduce LongVILA, a full-stack solution for long-context visual-language models by co-designing the algorithm and system. For model training, we upgrade existing VLMs to support long video understanding by incorporating two additional stages, i.e., long context extension and long supervised fine-tuning. However, training on long video is computationally and memory intensive. We introduce the long-context Multi-Modal Sequence Parallelism (MM-SP) system that efficiently parallelizes long video training and inference, enabling 2M context length training on 256 GPUs without any gradient checkpointing. LongVILA efficiently extends the number of video frames of VILA from 8 to 1024, improving the long video captioning score from 2.00 to 3.26 (out of 5), achieving 99.5% accuracy in 1400-frame (274k context length) video needle-in-a-haystack. LongVILA-8B demonstrates consistent accuracy improvements on long videos in the VideoMME benchmark as the number of frames increases. Besides, MM-SP is 2.1x - 5.7x faster than ring sequence parallelism and 1.1x - 1.4x faster than Megatron with context parallelism + tensor parallelism. Moreover, it seamlessly integrates with Hugging Face Transformers.

To this end, we present Story3D-Agent, a pioneering approach that leverages the capabilities of LLMs to transform provided narratives into 3D-rendered visualizations. By integrating procedural modeling, our approach enables precise control over multi-character actions and motions, as well as diverse decorative elements, ensuring the long-range and dynamic 3D representation. Furthermore, our method supports narrative extension through logical reasoning, ensuring that generated content remains consistent with existing conditions. We have thoroughly evaluated our Story3D-Agent to validate its effectiveness, offering a basic framework to advance 3D story representation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the rapidly evolving landscape of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text generation, the emergence of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) presents a promising avenue for improving the quality and reliability of generated text by leveraging information retrieved from user specified database. Benchmarking is essential to evaluate and compare the performance of the different RAG configurations in terms of retriever and generator, providing insights into their effectiveness, scalability, and suitability for the specific domain and applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework to generate a domain relevant RAG benchmark. Our framework is based on automatic question-answer generation with Human (domain experts)-AI Large Language Model (LLM) teaming. As a case study, we demonstrate the framework by introducing PermitQA, a first-of-its-kind benchmark on the wind siting and permitting domain which comprises of multiple scientific documents/reports related to environmental impact of wind energy projects. Our framework systematically evaluates RAG performance using diverse metrics and multiple question types with varying complexity level. We also demonstrate the performance of different models on our benchmark.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In an enterprise Virtual Assistant (VA) system, intent classification is the crucial component that determines how a user input is handled based on what the user wants. The VA system is expected to be a cost-efficient SaaS service with low training and inference time while achieving high accuracy even with a small number of training samples. We pretrain a transformer-based sentence embedding model with a contrastive learning objective and leverage the embedding of the model as features when training intent classification models. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art results for few-shot scenarios and performs better than other commercial solutions on popular intent classification benchmarks. However, generating features via a transformer-based model increases the inference time, especially for longer user inputs, due to the quadratic runtime of the transformer's attention mechanism. On top of model distillation, we introduce a practical multi-task adaptation approach that configures dynamic token pruning without the need for task-specific training for intent classification. We demonstrate that this approach improves the inference speed of popular sentence transformer models without affecting model performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present a comprehensive report on compressing the Llama 3.1 8B and Mistral NeMo 12B models to 4B and 8B parameters, respectively, using pruning and distillation. We explore two distinct pruning strategies: (1) depth pruning and (2) joint hidden/attention/MLP (width) pruning, and evaluate the results on common benchmarks from the LM Evaluation Harness. The models are then aligned with NeMo Aligner and tested in instruct-tuned versions. This approach produces a compelling 4B model from Llama 3.1 8B and a state-of-the-art Mistral-NeMo-Minitron-8B (MN-Minitron-8B for brevity) model from Mistral NeMo 12B. We found that with no access to the original data, it is beneficial to slightly fine-tune teacher models on the distillation dataset. We open-source our base model weights on Hugging Face with a permissive license.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the realm of multimodal research, numerous studies leverage substantial image-text pairs to conduct modal alignment learning, transforming Large Language Models (LLMs) into Multimodal LLMs and excelling in a variety of visual-language tasks. The prevailing methodologies primarily fall into two categories: self-attention-based and cross-attention-based methods. While self-attention-based methods offer superior data efficiency due to their simple MLP architecture, they often suffer from lower computational efficiency due to concatenating visual and textual tokens as input for LLM. Conversely, cross-attention-based methods, although less data-efficient due to additional learnable parameters, exhibit higher computational efficiency by avoiding long sequence input for LLM. To address these trade-offs, we introduce the Data-Efficient and Compute-Efficient Multimodal Large Language Model (EE-MLLM). Without introducing additional modules or learnable parameters, EE-MLLM achieves both data and compute efficiency. Specifically, we modify the original self-attention mechanism in MLLM to a composite attention mechanism. This mechanism has two key characteristics: 1) Eliminating the computational overhead of self-attention within visual tokens to achieve compute efficiency, and 2) Reusing the weights on each layer of LLM to facilitate effective modality alignment between vision and language for data efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of EE-MLLM across a range of benchmarks, including general-purpose datasets like MMBench and SeedBench, as well as fine-grained tasks such as TextVQA and DocVQA.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are being deployed across various domains today. However, their capacity to solve Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges in cybersecurity has not been thoroughly evaluated. To address this, we develop a novel method to assess LLMs in solving CTF challenges by creating a scalable, open-source benchmark database specifically designed for these applications. This database includes metadata for LLM testing and adaptive learning, compiling a diverse range of CTF challenges from popular competitions. Utilizing the advanced function calling capabilities of LLMs, we build a fully automated system with an enhanced workflow and support for external tool calls. Our benchmark dataset and automated framework allow us to evaluate the performance of five LLMs, encompassing both black-box and open-source models. This work lays the foundation for future research into improving the efficiency of LLMs in interactive cybersecurity tasks and automated task planning. By providing a specialized dataset, our project offers an ideal platform for developing, testing, and refining LLM-based approaches to vulnerability detection and resolution. Evaluating LLMs on these challenges and comparing with human performance yields insights into their potential for AI-driven cybersecurity solutions to perform real-world threat management. We make our dataset open source to public https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/LLM_CTF_Database along with our playground automated framework https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/llm_ctf_automation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite the recent successes of large, pretrained neural language models (LLMs), comparatively little is known about the representations of linguistic structure they learn during pretraining, which can lead to unexpected behaviors in response to prompt variation or distribution shift. To better understand these models and behaviors, we introduce a general model analysis framework to study LLMs with respect to their representation and use of human-interpretable linguistic properties. Our framework, CALM (Competence-based Analysis of Language Models), is designed to investigate LLM competence in the context of specific tasks by intervening on models' internal representations of different linguistic properties using causal probing, and measuring models' alignment under these interventions with a given ground-truth causal model of the task. We also develop a new approach for performing causal probing interventions using gradient-based adversarial attacks, which can target a broader range of properties and representations than prior techniques. Finally, we carry out a case study of CALM using these interventions to analyze and compare LLM competence across a variety of lexical inference tasks, showing that CALM can be used to explain and predict behaviors across these tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Molecular property prediction and generative design via deep learning models has been the subject of intense research given its potential to accelerate development of new, high-performance materials. More recently, these workflows have been significantly augmented with the advent of large language models (LLMs) and systems of LLM-driven agents capable of utilizing pre-trained models to make predictions in the context of more complex research tasks. While effective, there is still room for substantial improvement within the agentic systems on the retrieval of salient information for material design tasks. Moreover, alternative uses of predictive deep learning models, such as leveraging their latent representations to facilitate cross-modal retrieval augmented generation within agentic systems to enable task-specific materials design, has remained unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that large, pre-trained chemistry foundation models can serve as a basis for enabling semantic chemistry information retrieval for both small-molecules, complex polymeric materials, and reactions. Additionally, we show the use of chemistry foundation models in conjunction with image models such as OpenCLIP facilitate unprecedented queries and information retrieval across multiple characterization data domains. Finally, we demonstrate the integration of these systems within multi-agent systems to facilitate structure and topological-based natural language queries and information retrieval for complex research tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Traditionally, reward models used for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) are trained to directly predict preference scores without leveraging the generation capabilities of the underlying large language model (LLM). This limits the capabilities of reward models as they must reason implicitly about the quality of a response, i.e., preference modeling must be performed in a single forward pass through the model. To enable reward models to reason explicitly about the quality of a response, we introduce Critique-out-Loud (CLoud) reward models. CLoud reward models operate by first generating a natural language critique of the assistant's response that is then used to predict a scalar reward for the quality of the response. We demonstrate the success of CLoud reward models for both Llama-3-8B and 70B base models: compared to classic reward models CLoud reward models improve pairwise preference classification accuracy on RewardBench by 4.65 and 5.84 percentage points for the 8B and 70B base models respectively. Furthermore, CLoud reward models lead to a Pareto improvement for win rate on ArenaHard when used as the scoring model for Best-of-N. Finally, we explore how to exploit the dynamic inference compute capabilities of CLoud reward models by performing self-consistency decoding for reward prediction.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs), information retrieval (IR) systems, such as search engines and recommender systems, have undergone a significant paradigm shift. This evolution, while heralding new opportunities, introduces emerging challenges, particularly in terms of biases and unfairness, which may threaten the information ecosystem. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of existing works on emerging and pressing bias and unfairness issues in IR systems when the integration of LLMs. We first unify bias and unfairness issues as distribution mismatch problems, providing a groundwork for categorizing various mitigation strategies through distribution alignment. Subsequently, we systematically delve into the specific bias and unfairness issues arising from three critical stages of LLMs integration into IR systems: data collection, model development, and result evaluation. In doing so, we meticulously review and analyze recent literature, focusing on the definitions, characteristics, and corresponding mitigation strategies associated with these issues. Finally, we identify and highlight some open problems and challenges for future work, aiming to inspire researchers and stakeholders in the IR field and beyond to better understand and mitigate bias and unfairness issues of IR in this LLM era. We also consistently maintain a GitHub repository for the relevant papers and resources in this rising direction at https://github.com/KID-22/LLM-IR-Bias-Fairness-Survey.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current methods for aligning large language models (LLMs) typically aim to reflect general human values and behaviors, but they often fail to capture the unique characteristics and preferences of individual users. To address this gap, we introduce the concept of Personality Alignment. This approach tailors LLMs' responses and decisions to match the specific preferences of individual users or closely related groups. Inspired by psychometrics, we created the Personality Alignment with Personality Inventories (PAPI) dataset, which includes data from 300,000 real subjects, each providing behavioral preferences based on the Big Five Personality Factors. This dataset allows us to quantitatively evaluate the extent to which LLMs can align with each subject's behavioral patterns. Recognizing the challenges of personality alignments: such as limited personal data, diverse preferences, and scalability requirements: we developed an activation intervention optimization method. This method enhances LLMs' ability to efficiently align with individual behavioral preferences using minimal data and computational resources. Remarkably, our method, PAS, achieves superior performance while requiring only 1/5 of the optimization time compared to DPO, offering practical value for personality alignment. Our work paves the way for future AI systems to make decisions and reason in truly personality ways, enhancing the relevance and meaning of AI interactions for each user and advancing human-centered artificial intelligence.The code has released in \url{https://github.com/zhu-minjun/PAlign}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Designing expressive generative models that support exact and efficient inference is a core question in probabilistic ML. Probabilistic circuits (PCs) offer a framework where this tractability-vs-expressiveness trade-off can be analyzed theoretically. Recently, squared PCs encoding subtractive mixtures via negative parameters have emerged as tractable models that can be exponentially more expressive than monotonic PCs, i.e., PCs with positive parameters only. In this paper, we provide a more precise theoretical characterization of the expressiveness relationships among these models. First, we prove that squared PCs can be less expressive than monotonic ones. Second, we formalize a novel class of PCs -- sum of squares PCs -- that can be exponentially more expressive than both squared and monotonic PCs. Around sum of squares PCs, we build an expressiveness hierarchy that allows us to precisely unify and separate different tractable model classes such as Born Machines and PSD models, and other recently introduced tractable probabilistic models by using complex parameters. Finally, we empirically show the effectiveness of sum of squares circuits in performing distribution estimation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> What role can the otherwise successful Large Language Models (LLMs) play in the understanding of human cognition, and in particular in terms of informing language acquisition debates? To contribute to this question, we first argue that neither humans nor LLMs are general learners, in a variety of senses. We make a novel case for how in particular LLMs follow a dual-optimization process: they are optimized during their training (which is typically compared to language acquisition), and modern LLMs have also been selected, through a process akin to natural selection in a species. From this perspective, we argue that the performance of LLMs, whether similar or dissimilar to that of humans, does not weigh easily on important debates about the importance of human cognitive biases for language.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs) struggle with technical standards in telecommunications. We propose a fine-tuned retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system based on the Phi-2 small language model (SLM) to serve as an oracle for communication networks. Our developed system leverages forward-looking semantic chunking to adaptively determine parsing breakpoints based on embedding similarity, enabling effective processing of diverse document formats. To handle the challenge of multiple similar contexts in technical standards, we employ a re-ranking algorithm to prioritize the most relevant retrieved chunks. Recognizing the limitations of Phi-2's small context window, we implement a recent technique, namely SelfExtend, to expand the context window during inference, which not only boosts the performance but also can accommodate a wider range of user queries and design requirements from customers to specialized technicians. For fine-tuning, we utilize the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) technique to enhance computational efficiency during training and enable effective fine-tuning on small datasets. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements over existing question-answering approaches in the telecom domain, achieving performance that exceeds larger language models such as GPT-4 (which is about 880 times larger in size). This work presents a novel approach to leveraging SLMs for communication networks, offering a balance of efficiency and performance. This work can serve as a foundation towards agentic language models for networks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Hopfield network serves as a fundamental energy-based model in machine learning, capturing memory retrieval dynamics through an ordinary differential equation (ODE). The model's output, the equilibrium point of the ODE, is traditionally computed via synchronous updates using the forward Euler method. This paper aims to overcome some of the disadvantages of this approach. We propose a conceptual shift, viewing Hopfield networks as instances of Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs). The DEQ framework not only allows for the use of specialized solvers, but also leads to new insights on an empirical inference technique that we will refer to as 'even-odd splitting'. Our theoretical analysis of the method uncovers a parallelizable asynchronous update scheme, which should converge roughly twice as fast as the conventional synchronous updates. Empirical evaluations validate these findings, showcasing the advantages of both the DEQ framework and even-odd splitting in digitally simulating energy minimization in Hopfield networks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to malicious influence by cyber attackers through intrusions such as adversarial, backdoor, and embedding inversion attacks. In response, the burgeoning field of LLM Security aims to study and defend against such threats. Thus far, the majority of works in this area have focused on monolingual English models, however, emerging research suggests that multilingual LLMs may be more vulnerable to various attacks than their monolingual counterparts. While previous work has investigated embedding inversion over a small subset of European languages, it is challenging to extrapolate these findings to languages from different linguistic families and with differing scripts. To this end, we explore the security of multilingual LLMs in the context of embedding inversion attacks and investigate cross-lingual and cross-script inversion across 20 languages, spanning over 8 language families and 12 scripts. Our findings indicate that languages written in Arabic script and Cyrillic script are particularly vulnerable to embedding inversion, as are languages within the Indo-Aryan language family. We further observe that inversion models tend to suffer from language confusion, sometimes greatly reducing the efficacy of an attack. Accordingly, we systematically explore this bottleneck for inversion models, uncovering predictable patterns which could be leveraged by attackers. Ultimately, this study aims to further the field's understanding of the outstanding security vulnerabilities facing multilingual LLMs and raise awareness for the languages most at risk of negative impact from these attacks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in complex tasks, yet their widespread adoption is impeded by substantial computational demands. With hundreds of billion parameters, transformer-based LLMs necessitate months of pretraining across a high-end GPU cluster. However, this paper reveals a compelling finding: transformers exhibit considerable redundancy in pretraining computations, which motivates our proposed solution, Mixed Sparsity Training (MST), an efficient pretraining method that can reduce about $75\%$ of Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) while maintaining performance. MST integrates dynamic sparse training (DST) with Sparsity Variation (SV) and Hybrid Sparse Attention (HSA) during pretraining, involving three distinct phases: warm-up, ultra-sparsification, and restoration. The warm-up phase transforms the dense model into a sparse one, and the restoration phase reinstates connections. Throughout these phases, the model is trained with a dynamically evolving sparse topology and an HSA mechanism to maintain performance and minimize training FLOPs concurrently. Our experiment on GPT-2 showcases a FLOP reduction of $4\times$ without compromising performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Empowering LLMs with the ability to utilize useful information from a long context is crucial for many downstream applications. However, achieving long context lengths with the conventional transformer architecture requires substantial training and inference resources. In this paper, we present FocusLLM, a framework designed to extend the context length of any decoder-only LLM, enabling the model to focus on relevant information from very long sequences. FocusLLM processes long text inputs by dividing them into chunks based on the model's original context length to alleviate the issue of attention distraction. Then, it appends the local context to each chunk as a prompt to extract essential information from each chunk based on a novel parallel decoding mechanism, and ultimately integrates the extracted information into the local context. FocusLLM stands out for great training efficiency and versatility: trained with an 8K input length with much less training cost than previous methods, FocusLLM exhibits superior performance across downstream long-context tasks and maintains strong language modeling ability when handling extensive long texts, even up to 400K tokens.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As inference on Large Language Models (LLMs) emerges as an important workload in machine learning applications, weight quantization has become a standard technique for efficient GPU deployment. Quantization not only reduces model size, but has also been shown to yield substantial speedups for single-user inference, due to reduced memory movement, with low accuracy impact. Yet, it remains open whether speedups are achievable also in \emph{batched} settings with multiple parallel clients, which are highly relevant for practical serving. It is unclear whether GPU kernels can be designed to remain practically memory-bound, while supporting the substantially increased compute requirements of batched workloads.   This paper resolves this question positively by describing the design of Mixed-precision Auto-Regressive LINear kernels, called MARLIN. Concretely, given a model whose weights are compressed via quantization to, e.g., 4 bits per element, MARLIN shows that batchsizes up to 16-32 can be supported with close to maximum ($4\times$) quantization speedup, and larger batchsizes up to 64-128 with gradually decreasing, but still significant, acceleration. MARLIN accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as asynchronous memory access, complex task scheduling and pipelining, and bespoke quantization support. Our experiments show that MARLIN's near-optimal performance on individual LLM layers across different scenarios can also lead to end-to-end LLM inference speedups (of up to $2.8\times$) when integrated with the popular vLLM serving engine. Finally, MARLIN is extensible to further compression techniques, like NVIDIA 2:4 sparsity, leading to additional speedups.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Network complexity and computational efficiency have become increasingly significant aspects of deep learning. Sparse deep learning addresses these challenges by recovering a sparse representation of the underlying target function by reducing heavily over-parameterized deep neural networks. Specifically, deep neural architectures compressed via structured sparsity (e.g. node sparsity) provide low latency inference, higher data throughput, and reduced energy consumption. In this paper, we explore two well-established shrinkage techniques, Lasso and Horseshoe, for model compression in Bayesian neural networks. To this end, we propose structurally sparse Bayesian neural networks which systematically prune excessive nodes with (i) Spike-and-Slab Group Lasso (SS-GL), and (ii) Spike-and-Slab Group Horseshoe (SS-GHS) priors, and develop computationally tractable variational inference including continuous relaxation of Bernoulli variables. We establish the contraction rates of the variational posterior of our proposed models as a function of the network topology, layer-wise node cardinalities, and bounds on the network weights. We empirically demonstrate the competitive performance of our models compared to the baseline models in prediction accuracy, model compression, and inference latency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLM) are evolving and have significantly revolutionized the landscape of software development. If used well, they can significantly accelerate the software development cycle. At the same time, the community is very cautious of the models being trained on biased or sensitive data, which can lead to biased outputs along with the inadvertent release of confidential information. Additionally, the carbon footprints and the un-explainability of these black box models continue to raise questions about the usability of LLMs.   With the abundance of opportunities LLMs have to offer, this paper explores the idea of judging tests used to evaluate compiler implementations of directive-based programming models as well as probe into the black box of LLMs. Based on our results, utilizing an agent-based prompting approach and setting up a validation pipeline structure drastically increased the quality of DeepSeek Coder, the LLM chosen for the evaluation purposes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini have significantly advanced natural language processing, enabling various applications such as chatbots and automated content generation. However, these models can be exploited by malicious individuals who craft toxic prompts to elicit harmful or unethical responses. These individuals often employ jailbreaking techniques to bypass safety mechanisms, highlighting the need for robust toxic prompt detection methods. Existing detection techniques, both blackbox and whitebox, face challenges related to the diversity of toxic prompts, scalability, and computational efficiency. In response, we propose ToxicDetector, a lightweight greybox method designed to efficiently detect toxic prompts in LLMs. ToxicDetector leverages LLMs to create toxic concept prompts, uses embedding vectors to form feature vectors, and employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier for prompt classification. Our evaluation on various versions of the LLama models, Gemma-2, and multiple datasets demonstrates that ToxicDetector achieves a high accuracy of 96.39\% and a low false positive rate of 2.00\%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, ToxicDetector's processing time of 0.0780 seconds per prompt makes it highly suitable for real-time applications. ToxicDetector achieves high accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, making it a practical method for toxic prompt detection in LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Neural shape representation generally refers to representing 3D geometry using neural networks, e.g., computing a signed distance or occupancy value at a specific spatial position. In this paper we present a neural-network architecture suitable for accurate encoding of 3D shapes in a single forward pass. Our architecture is based on a multi-scale hybrid system incorporating graph-based and voxel-based components, as well as a continuously differentiable decoder. The hybrid system includes a novel way of voxelizing point-based features in neural networks, which we show can be used in combination with oriented point-clouds to obtain smoother and more detailed reconstructions. Furthermore, our network is trained to solve the eikonal equation and only requires knowledge of the zero-level set for training and inference. This means that in contrast to most previous shape encoder architectures, our network is able to output valid signed distance fields without explicit prior knowledge of non-zero distance values or shape occupancy. It also requires only a single forward-pass, instead of the latent-code optimization used in auto-decoder methods. We further propose a modification to the loss function in case that surface normals are not well defined, e.g., in the context of non-watertight surfaces and non-manifold geometry, resulting in an unsigned distance field. Overall, our system can help to reduce the computational overhead of training and evaluating neural distance fields, as well as enabling the application to difficult geometry.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Latent Space (LS) network models project the nodes of a network on a $d$-dimensional latent space to achieve dimensionality reduction of the network while preserving its relevant features. Inference is often carried out within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework. Nonetheless, it is well-known that the computational time for this set of models increases quadratically with the number of nodes. In this work, we build on the Random-Scan (RS) approach to propose an MCMC strategy that alleviates the computational burden for LS models while maintaining the benefits of a general-purpose technique. We call this novel strategy Multiple RS (MRS). This strategy is effective in reducing the computational cost by a factor without severe consequences on the MCMC draws. Moreover, we introduce a novel adaptation strategy that consists of a probabilistic update of the set of latent coordinates of each node. Our Adaptive MRS adapts the acceptance rate of the Metropolis step to adjust the probability of updating the latent coordinates. We show via simulation that the Adaptive MRS approach performs better than MRS in terms of mixing. Finally, we apply our algorithm to a multi-layer temporal LS model and show how our adaptive strategy may be beneficial to empirical applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We address a persistent challenge in text-to-image models: accurately generating a specified number of objects. Current models, which learn from image-text pairs, inherently struggle with counting, as training data cannot depict every possible number of objects for any given object. To solve this, we propose optimizing the generated image based on a counting loss derived from a counting model that aggregates an object\'s potential. Employing an out-of-the-box counting model is challenging for two reasons: first, the model requires a scaling hyperparameter for the potential aggregation that varies depending on the viewpoint of the objects, and second, classifier guidance techniques require modified models that operate on noisy intermediate diffusion steps. To address these challenges, we propose an iterated online training mode that improves the accuracy of inferred images while altering the text conditioning embedding and dynamically adjusting hyperparameters. Our method offers three key advantages: (i) it can consider non-derivable counting techniques based on detection models, (ii) it is a zero-shot plug-and-play solution facilitating rapid changes to the counting techniques and image generation methods, and (iii) the optimized counting token can be reused to generate accurate images without additional optimization. We evaluate the generation of various objects and show significant improvements in accuracy. The project page is available at https://ozzafar.github.io/count_token.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have great success in natural language processing tasks such as response generation. However, their use in tabular data has been limited due to their inferior performance compared to traditional machine learning models (TMLs) such as XGBoost. We find that the pre-trained knowledge of LLMs enables them to interpret new variables that appear in a test without additional training, a capability central to the concept of Out-of-Variable (OOV). From the findings, we propose a Language-Based-Classifier (LBC), a classifier that maximizes the benefits of LLMs to outperform TMLs on OOV tasks. LBC employs three key methodological strategies: 1) Categorical changes to adjust data to better fit the model's understanding, 2) Advanced order and indicator to enhance data representation to the model, and 3) Using verbalizer to map logit scores to classes during inference to generate model predictions. These strategies, combined with the pre-trained knowledge of LBC, emphasize the model's ability to effectively handle OOV tasks. We empirically and theoretically validate the superiority of LBC. LBC is the first study to apply an LLM-based model to OOV tasks. The source code is at https://github.com/sksmssh/LBCforOOVGen

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The outcome of the formation of massive stars is an important anchor point in their evolution. It provides insight into the physics of the assembly process, and sets the conditions for stellar evolution. We characterize a population of 18 highly reddened O4.5 to B9 stars in the very young massive star-forming region M17. Their properties allow us to identify the empirical location of the ZAMS, and rotation and mass-loss rate of stars there. We performed quantitative spectroscopic modeling of VLT/X-shooter spectra using NLTE atmosphere code Fastwind and fitting approach Kiwi-GA. The observed SEDs were used to determine the line-of-sight extinction. From a comparison of their positions in the HRD with MIST evolutionary tracks, we inferred the stellar masses and ages. We find an age of $0.4_{-0.2}^{+0.6}$ Myr for our sample, however we also identify a strong relation between the age and the mass of the stars. The extinction towards the sources ranges from $A_V = 3.6$ to 10.6. Stars more massive than 10 M$_{\odot}$ have reached the ZAMS. Their projected ZAMS spin rate distribution extends to 0.3 of the critical velocity; their mass-loss rates agree with those of other main-sequence OB stars. Stars with a mass in the range $3 < M/$M$_{\odot} < 7$ are still on the pre-main sequence (PMS). Evolving their $v \sin i$ to the ZAMS yields values up to $\sim 0.6 v_{\rm crit}$. For PMS stars without disks, we find tentative mass-loss rates up to $10^{-8.5}\,$M$_{\odot}$\,yr$^{-1}$. We constrain the empirical location of the ZAMS for massive ($10 < M/$M$_{\odot} < 50$) stars. The ZAMS rotation rates for intermediate-mass stars are twice as high as for massive stars, suggesting that the angular momentum gain processes differ between the two groups. The relation between the age and mass of the stars suggests a lag in the formation of more massive stars relative to lower mass stars.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The establishment of bioRxiv facilitated the rapid adoption of preprints in the life sciences, accelerating the dissemination of new research findings. However, the sheer volume of preprints published daily can be overwhelming, making it challenging for researchers to stay updated on the latest developments. Here, I introduce biorecap, an R package that retrieves and summarizes bioRxiv preprints using a large language model (LLM) running locally on nearly any commodity laptop. biorecap leverages the ollamar package to interface with the Ollama server and API endpoints, allowing users to prompt any local LLM available through Ollama. The package follows tidyverse conventions, enabling users to pipe the output of one function as input to another. Additionally, biorecap provides a single wrapper function that generates a timestamped CSV file and HTML report containing short summaries of recent preprints published in user-configurable subject areas. By combining the strengths of LLMs with the flexibility and security of local execution, biorecap represents an advancement in the tools available for managing the information overload in modern scientific research. The biorecap R package is available on GitHub at https://github.com/stephenturner/biorecap under an open-source (MIT) license.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-quality images given a text prompt. However, ensuring the prompt-image alignment remains a considerable challenge, i.e., generating images that faithfully align with the prompt's semantics. Recent works attempt to improve the faithfulness by optimizing the latent code, which potentially could cause the latent code to go out-of-distribution and thus produce unrealistic images. In this paper, we propose FRAP, a simple, yet effective approach based on adaptively adjusting the per-token prompt weights to improve prompt-image alignment and authenticity of the generated images. We design an online algorithm to adaptively update each token's weight coefficient, which is achieved by minimizing a unified objective function that encourages object presence and the binding of object-modifier pairs. Through extensive evaluations, we show FRAP generates images with significantly higher prompt-image alignment to prompts from complex datasets, while having a lower average latency compared to recent latent code optimization methods, e.g., 4 seconds faster than D&B on the COCO-Subject dataset. Furthermore, through visual comparisons and evaluation on the CLIP-IQA-Real metric, we show that FRAP not only improves prompt-image alignment but also generates more authentic images with realistic appearances. We also explore combining FRAP with prompt rewriting LLM to recover their degraded prompt-image alignment, where we observe improvements in both prompt-image alignment and image quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To trust the fluent generations of large language models (LLMs), humans must be able to verify their correctness against trusted, external sources. Recent efforts, such as providing citations via retrieved documents or post-hoc provenance, enhance verifiability but still provide no guarantees on their correctness. To address these limitations, we tackle the verifiability goal with a different philosophy: trivializing the verification process by developing models that quote verbatim statements from trusted sources in pre-training data. We propose Quote-Tuning, and demonstrate it is feasible to align LLMs to provide quoted statements from data memorized during pre-training. The core of Quote-Tuning is a fast membership inference function (Marone and Van Durme, 2023) that efficiently verifies text against a trusted corpus. We leverage this tool to design a reward function to quantify quotes in model responses, which is then used to create a dataset for preference learning. Experimental results show that Quote-Tuning significantly increases verbatim quotes from high-quality pre-training documents by 55% to 130% relative to un-tuned models while maintaining response quality. Quote-Tuning also generalizes quoting to out-of-domain data, is applicable in different tasks, and provides additional benefits to truthfulness. Our method not only serves as a hassle-free method to increase quoting but also opens up avenues for improving LLM trustworthiness through better verifiability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Safety fine-tuning helps align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences for their safe deployment. To better understand the underlying factors that make models safe via safety fine-tuning, we design a synthetic data generation framework that captures salient aspects of an unsafe input by modeling the interaction between the task the model is asked to perform (e.g., "design") versus the specific concepts the task is asked to be performed upon (e.g., a "cycle" vs. a "bomb"). Using this, we investigate three well-known safety fine-tuning methods -- supervised safety fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and unlearning -- and provide significant evidence demonstrating that these methods minimally transform MLP weights to specifically align unsafe inputs into its weights' null space. This yields a clustering of inputs based on whether the model deems them safe or not. Correspondingly, when an adversarial input (e.g., a jailbreak) is provided, its activations are closer to safer samples, leading to the model processing such an input as if it were safe. We validate our findings, wherever possible, on real-world models -- specifically, Llama-2 7B and Llama-3 8B.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deeply virtual exclusive scattering processes (DVES) serve as precise probes of nucleon quark and gluon distributions in coordinate space. These distributions are derived from generalized parton distributions (GPDs) via Fourier transform relative to proton momentum transfer. QCD factorization theorems enable DVES to be parameterized by Compton form factors (CFFs), which are convolutions of GPDs with perturbatively calculable kernels. Accurate extraction of CFFs from DVCS, benefiting from interference with the Bethe-Heitler (BH) process and a simpler final state structure, is essential for inferring GPDs. This paper focuses on extracting CFFs from DVCS data using a variational autoencoder inverse mapper (VAIM) and its constrained variant (C-VAIM). VAIM is shown to be consistent with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in extracting multiple CFF solutions for given kinematics, while C-VAIM effectively captures correlations among CFFs across different kinematic values, providing more constrained solutions. This study represents a crucial first step towards a comprehensive analysis pipeline towards the extraction of GPDs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this work, we present MotionBooth, an innovative framework designed for animating customized subjects with precise control over both object and camera movements. By leveraging a few images of a specific object, we efficiently fine-tune a text-to-video model to capture the object's shape and attributes accurately. Our approach presents subject region loss and video preservation loss to enhance the subject's learning performance, along with a subject token cross-attention loss to integrate the customized subject with motion control signals. Additionally, we propose training-free techniques for managing subject and camera motions during inference. In particular, we utilize cross-attention map manipulation to govern subject motion and introduce a novel latent shift module for camera movement control as well. MotionBooth excels in preserving the appearance of subjects while simultaneously controlling the motions in generated videos. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method. Our project page is at https://jianzongwu.github.io/projects/motionbooth

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have training corpora containing large amounts of program code, greatly improving the model's code comprehension and generation capabilities. However, sound comprehensive research on detecting program vulnerabilities, a more specific task related to code, and evaluating the performance of LLMs in this more specialized scenario is still lacking. To address common challenges in vulnerability analysis, our study introduces a new benchmark, VulDetectBench, specifically designed to assess the vulnerability detection capabilities of LLMs. The benchmark comprehensively evaluates LLM's ability to identify, classify, and locate vulnerabilities through five tasks of increasing difficulty. We evaluate the performance of 17 models (both open- and closed-source) and find that while existing models can achieve over 80% accuracy on tasks related to vulnerability identification and classification, they still fall short on specific, more detailed vulnerability analysis tasks, with less than 30% accuracy, making it difficult to provide valuable auxiliary information for professional vulnerability mining. Our benchmark effectively evaluates the capabilities of various LLMs at different levels in the specific task of vulnerability detection, providing a foundation for future research and improvements in this critical area of code security. VulDetectBench is publicly available at https://github.com/Sweetaroo/VulDetectBench.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Collective intelligence among gig workers yields considerable advantages, including improved information exchange, deeper social bonds, and stronger advocacy for better labor conditions. Especially as it enables workers to collaboratively pinpoint shared challenges and devise optimal strategies for addressing these issues. However, enabling collective intelligence remains challenging, as existing tools often overestimate gig workers' available time and uniformity in analytical reasoning. To overcome this, we introduce GigSense, a tool that leverages large language models alongside theories of collective intelligence and sensemaking. GigSense enables gig workers to rapidly understand and address shared challenges effectively, irrespective of their diverse backgrounds. Our user study showed that GigSense users outperformed those using a control interface in problem identification and generated solutions more quickly and of higher quality, with better usability experiences reported. GigSense not only empowers gig workers but also opens up new possibilities for supporting workers more broadly, demonstrating the potential of large language model interfaces to enhance collective intelligence efforts in the evolving workplace.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) can include sensitive information from individuals and organizations, leading to potential privacy leakage. This work implements Influence Functions (IFs) to trace privacy leakage back to the training data, thereby mitigating privacy concerns of Language Models (LMs). However, we notice that current IFs struggle to accurately estimate the influence of tokens with large gradient norms, potentially overestimating their influence. When tracing the most influential samples, this leads to frequently tracing back to samples with large gradient norm tokens, overshadowing the actual most influential samples even if their influences are well estimated. To address this issue, we propose Heuristically Adjusted IF (HAIF), which reduces the weight of tokens with large gradient norms, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of tracing the most influential samples. To establish easily obtained groundtruth for tracing privacy leakage, we construct two datasets, PII-E and PII-CR, representing two distinct scenarios: one with identical text in the model outputs and pre-training data, and the other where models leverage their reasoning abilities to generate text divergent from pre-training data. HAIF significantly improves tracing accuracy, enhancing it by 20.96\% to 73.71\% on the PII-E dataset and 3.21\% to 45.93\% on the PII-CR dataset, compared to the best SOTA IFs against various GPT-2 and QWen-1.5 models. HAIF also outperforms SOTA IFs on real-world pretraining data CLUECorpus2020, demonstrating strong robustness regardless prompt and response lengths.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Penetration testing, a critical component of cybersecurity, typically requires extensive time and effort to find vulnerabilities. Beginners in this field often benefit from collaborative approaches with the community or experts. To address this, we develop CIPHER (Cybersecurity Intelligent Penetration-testing Helper for Ethical Researchers), a large language model specifically trained to assist in penetration testing tasks. We trained CIPHER using over 300 high-quality write-ups of vulnerable machines, hacking techniques, and documentation of open-source penetration testing tools. Additionally, we introduced the Findings, Action, Reasoning, and Results (FARR) Flow augmentation, a novel method to augment penetration testing write-ups to establish a fully automated pentesting simulation benchmark tailored for large language models. This approach fills a significant gap in traditional cybersecurity Q\&A benchmarks and provides a realistic and rigorous standard for evaluating AI's technical knowledge, reasoning capabilities, and practical utility in dynamic penetration testing scenarios. In our assessments, CIPHER achieved the best overall performance in providing accurate suggestion responses compared to other open-source penetration testing models of similar size and even larger state-of-the-art models like Llama 3 70B and Qwen1.5 72B Chat, particularly on insane difficulty machine setups. This demonstrates that the current capabilities of general LLMs are insufficient for effectively guiding users through the penetration testing process. We also discuss the potential for improvement through scaling and the development of better benchmarks using FARR Flow augmentation results. Our benchmark will be released publicly at https://github.com/ibndias/CIPHER.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The integration of large language models (LLMs) in mental health care is an emerging field. There is a need to systematically review the application outcomes and delineate the advantages and limitations in clinical settings. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the use of LLMs in mental health care, assessing their efficacy, challenges, and potential for future applications. A systematic search was conducted across multiple databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, arXiv, medRxiv, and PsyArXiv in November 2023. All forms of original research, peer-reviewed or not, published or disseminated between October 1, 2019, and December 2, 2023, are included without language restrictions if they used LLMs developed after T5 and directly addressed research questions in mental health care settings. From an initial pool of 313 articles, 34 met the inclusion criteria based on their relevance to LLM application in mental health care and the robustness of reported outcomes. Diverse applications of LLMs in mental health care are identified, including diagnosis, therapy, patient engagement enhancement, etc. Key challenges include data availability and reliability, nuanced handling of mental states, and effective evaluation methods. Despite successes in accuracy and accessibility improvement, gaps in clinical applicability and ethical considerations were evident, pointing to the need for robust data, standardized evaluations, and interdisciplinary collaboration. LLMs hold substantial promise for enhancing mental health care. For their full potential to be realized, emphasis must be placed on developing robust datasets, development and evaluation frameworks, ethical guidelines, and interdisciplinary collaborations to address current limitations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In modern online platforms, incentives are essential factors that enhance user engagement and increase platform revenue. Over recent years, uplift modeling has been introduced as a strategic approach to assign incentives to individual customers. Especially in many real-world applications, online platforms can only incentivize customers with specific budget constraints. This problem can be reformulated as the multi-choice knapsack problem. This optimization aims to select the optimal incentive for each customer to maximize the return on investment. Recent works in this field frequently tackle the budget allocation problem using a two-stage approach. However, this solution is confronted with the following challenges: (1) The causal inference methods often ignore the domain knowledge in online marketing, where the expected response curve of a customer should be monotonic and smooth as the incentive increases. (2) An optimality gap between the two stages results in inferior sub-optimal allocation performance due to the loss of the incentive recommendation information for the uplift prediction under the limited budget constraint. To address these challenges, we propose a novel End-to-End Cost-Effective Incentive Recommendation (E3IR) model under budget constraints. Specifically, our methods consist of two modules, i.e., the uplift prediction module and the differentiable allocation module. In the uplift prediction module, we construct prediction heads to capture the incremental improvement between adjacent treatments with the marketing domain constraints (i.e., monotonic and smooth). We incorporate integer linear programming (ILP) as a differentiable layer input in the allocation module. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on public and real product datasets, demonstrating that our E3IR improves allocation performance compared to existing two-stage approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We investigate the behavior of the dense and cold (normalized) QCD trace anomaly, $\Delta$, in the interior of twin neutron stars (obtained from several sets of equations of state in agreement with modern compact-star and multimessenger data) satisfying static and dynamic stability conditions. We scan this parameter space in order to look for effects caused by the presence of a strong first-order phase transition connecting hadron and quark phases by means of a Maxwell construction. We found robustly that $\Delta$ suffers an abrupt decrease around the transition point, even reaching large negative values ($\Delta\simeq-0.35$), in marked contrast to current studies pointing out a smooth behavior with $\Delta\gtrsim 0$ at all densities. Besides, we characterize the behavior of conformal factor, $d_{c}$, in twin stars for which we perform comparisons with theoretical constraints, e.g. from Bayesian studies adjusted to agree with pQCD. All this allows us to infer and hypothesize modifications in the strong QCD coupling in dense nuclear matter with a strong thermodynamic discontinuity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 achieving impressive results in function-level code generation, they struggle with repository-scale code understanding (e.g., coming up with the right arguments for calling routines), requiring a deeper comprehension of complex file interactions. Also, recently, people have developed LLM agents that attempt to interact with repository code (e.g., compiling and evaluating its execution), prompting the need to evaluate their performance. These gaps have motivated our development of ML-Bench, a benchmark rooted in real-world programming applications that leverage existing code repositories to perform tasks. Addressing the need for LLMs to interpret long code contexts and translate instructions into precise, executable scripts, ML-Bench encompasses annotated 9,641 examples across 18 GitHub repositories, challenging LLMs to accommodate user-specified arguments and documentation intricacies effectively. To evaluate both LLMs and AI agents, two setups are employed: ML-LLM-Bench for assessing LLMs' text-to-code conversion within a predefined deployment environment, and ML-Agent-Bench for testing autonomous agents in an end-to-end task execution within a Linux sandbox environment. Our findings indicate that while GPT-4o leads with a Pass@5 rate surpassing 50%, there remains significant scope for improvement, highlighted by issues such as hallucinated outputs and difficulties with bash script generation. Notably, in the more demanding ML-Agent-Bench, GPT-4o achieves a 76.47% success rate, reflecting the efficacy of iterative action and feedback in complex task resolution. Our code, dataset, and models are available at https://github.com/gersteinlab/ML-bench.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Commentary provides readers with a deep understanding of events by presenting diverse arguments and evidence. However, creating commentary is a time-consuming task, even for skilled commentators. Large language models (LLMs) have simplified the process of natural language generation, but their direct application in commentary creation still faces challenges due to unique task requirements. These requirements can be categorized into two levels: 1) fundamental requirements, which include creating well-structured and logically consistent narratives, and 2) advanced requirements, which involve generating quality arguments and providing convincing evidence. In this paper, we introduce Xinyu, an efficient LLM-based system designed to assist commentators in generating Chinese commentaries. To meet the fundamental requirements, we deconstruct the generation process into sequential steps, proposing targeted strategies and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for each step. To address the advanced requirements, we present an argument ranking model for arguments and establish a comprehensive evidence database that includes up-to-date events and classic books, thereby strengthening the substantiation of the evidence with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technology. To evaluate the generated commentaries more fairly, corresponding to the two-level requirements, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation metric that considers five distinct perspectives in commentary generation. Our experiments confirm the effectiveness of our proposed system. We also observe a significant increase in the efficiency of commentators in real-world scenarios, with the average time spent on creating a commentary dropping from 4 hours to 20 minutes. Importantly, such an increase in efficiency does not compromise the quality of the commentaries.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mainstream backdoor attacks on large language models (LLMs) typically set a fixed trigger in the input instance and specific responses for triggered queries. However, the fixed trigger setting (e.g., unusual words) may be easily detected by human detection, limiting the effectiveness and practicality in real-world scenarios. To enhance the stealthiness of backdoor activation, we present a new poisoning paradigm against LLMs triggered by specifying generation conditions, which are commonly adopted strategies by users during model inference. The poisoned model performs normally for output under normal/other generation conditions, while becomes harmful for output under target generation conditions. To achieve this objective, we introduce BrieFool, an efficient attack framework. It leverages the characteristics of generation conditions by efficient instruction sampling and poisoning data generation, thereby influencing the behavior of LLMs under target conditions. Our attack can be generally divided into two types with different targets: Safety unalignment attack and Ability degradation attack. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that BrieFool is effective across safety domains and ability domains, achieving higher success rates than baseline methods, with 94.3 % on GPT-3.5-turbo

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The data collected by autonomous vehicle (AV) sensors such as LiDAR and cameras is crucial for creating high-definition (HD) maps to provide higher accuracy and enable a higher level of automation. Nevertheless, offloading this large volume of raw data to edge servers leads to increased latency due to network congestion in highly dense environments such as Vehicular Adhoc networks (VANET). To address this challenge, researchers have focused on the dynamic allocation of minimum contention window (CWmin) value. While this approach could be sufficient for fairness, it might not be adequate for prioritizing different services, as it also involves other parameters such as maximum contention window (CWmax) and infer-frame space number (IFSn). In response to this, we extend the scope of previous solutions to include the control of not only CWmin but also the adjustment of two other parameters in the standard IEEE802.11: CWmax and IFSn, alongside waiting transmission time. To achieve this, we introduced a methodology involving a cross-layer solution between the application and MAC layers. Additionally, we utilised multi-agent techniques, emphasising a hierarchical structure and independent learning (IL) to improve latency to efficiently handle map updates while interacting with multiple services. This approach demonstrated an improvement in latency against the standard IEEE802.11p EDCA by $31\%$, $49\%$, $87.3\%$, and $64\%$ for Voice, Video, HD Map, and Best-effort, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Empathetic response generation endows agents with the capability to comprehend dialogue contexts and react to expressed emotions. Previous works predominantly focus on leveraging the speaker's emotional labels, but ignore the importance of emotion cause reasoning in empathetic response generation, which hinders the model's capacity for further affective understanding and cognitive inference. In this paper, we propose a cause-aware empathetic generation approach by integrating emotions and causes through a well-designed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt on Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach can greatly promote LLMs' performance of empathy by instruction tuning and enhancing the role awareness of an empathetic listener in the prompt. Additionally, we propose to incorporate cause-oriented external knowledge from COMET into the prompt, which improves the diversity of generation and alleviates conflicts between internal and external knowledge at the same time. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate that our approach on LLaMA-7b achieves state-of-the-art performance in both automatic and human evaluations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the burgeoning advancements in the field of natural language processing (NLP), the demand for training data has increased significantly. To save costs, it has become common for users and businesses to outsource the labor-intensive task of data collection to third-party entities. Unfortunately, recent research has unveiled the inherent risk associated with this practice, particularly in exposing NLP systems to potential backdoor attacks. Specifically, these attacks enable malicious control over the behavior of a trained model by poisoning a small portion of the training data. Unlike backdoor attacks in computer vision, textual backdoor attacks impose stringent requirements for attack stealthiness. However, existing attack methods meet significant trade-off between effectiveness and stealthiness, largely due to the high information entropy inherent in textual data. In this paper, we introduce the Efficient and Stealthy Textual backdoor attack method, EST-Bad, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Our EST-Bad encompasses three core strategies: optimizing the inherent flaw of models as the trigger, stealthily injecting triggers with LLMs, and meticulously selecting the most impactful samples for backdoor injection. Through the integration of these techniques, EST-Bad demonstrates an efficient achievement of competitive attack performance while maintaining superior stealthiness compared to prior methods across various text classifier datasets.

As model merging becomes increasingly prevalent across various fields, it is crucial to understand the available model merging techniques comprehensively. However, there is a significant gap in the literature regarding a systematic and thorough review of these techniques. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of model merging methods and theories, their applications in various domains and settings, and future research directions. Specifically, we first propose a new taxonomic approach that exhaustively discusses existing model merging methods. Secondly, we discuss the application of model merging techniques in large language models, multimodal large language models, and 10+ machine learning subfields, including continual learning, multi-task learning, few-shot learning, etc. Finally, we highlight the remaining challenges of model merging and discuss future research directions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Atmospheric escape is thought to significantly influence the evolution of exoplanets, especially for sub-Jupiter planets on short orbital periods. Theoretical models predict that hydrodynamic escape could erode the atmospheres of such gaseous planets, leaving only a rocky core. Deriving atmospheric mass-loss rates from observations is necessary to check these predictions. One of the ways to obtain mass-loss rate estimates is to fit transit spectra of the 10830 {\AA} helium or UV metal lines with Parker wind models. We aim to provide the community with a tool that enables performing this type of analysis, and present sunbather, an open-source Python code to model escaping exoplanet atmospheres and their transit spectra. sunbather incorporates the Parker wind code p-winds and the photoionization code Cloudy, with the ability to calculate any currently known spectral tracer at an arbitrary atmospheric composition. With sunbather, we investigate how the atmospheric structure of a generic hot Neptune planet depends on the metallicity. We find that the mass-loss rate drops by roughly one order of magnitude as we increase the metallicity from solar to 50 times solar. Line cooling by metal species is important already for a solar composition, and more so at higher metallicity. We then demonstrate how sunbather can be used to interpret observations of spectral lines that form in the upper atmosphere. We fit the observed helium spectrum of the mini-Neptune TOI-2134 b and show how even for helium data, the inferred mass-loss rate depends on the metallicity by up to a factor of three.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efforts directed towards promoting Open Government Data (OGD) have gained significant traction across various governmental tiers since the mid-2000s. As more datasets are published on OGD portals, finding specific data becomes harder, leading to information overload. Complete and accurate documentation of datasets, including association of proper tags with datasets is key to improving dataset findability and accessibility. Analysis conducted on the Estonian Open Data Portal, revealed that 11% datasets have no associated tags, while 26% had only one tag assigned to them, which underscores challenges in data findability and accessibility within the portal, which, according to the recent Open Data Maturity Report, is considered trend-setter. The aim of this study is to propose an automated solution to tagging datasets to improve data findability on OGD portals. This paper presents Tagify - a prototype of tagging interface that employs large language models (LLM) such as GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 to automate dataset tagging, generating tags for datasets in English and Estonian, thereby augmenting metadata preparation by data publishers and improving data findability on OGD portals by data users. The developed solution was evaluated by users and their feedback was collected to define an agenda for future prototype improvements.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose selective debiasing -- an inference-time safety mechanism that aims to increase the overall quality of models in terms of prediction performance and fairness in the situation when re-training a model is prohibitive. The method is inspired by selective prediction, where some predictions that are considered low quality are discarded at inference time. In our approach, we identify the potentially biased model predictions and, instead of discarding them, we debias them using LEACE -- a post-processing debiasing method. To select problematic predictions, we propose a bias quantification approach based on KL divergence, which achieves better results than standard UQ methods. Experiments with text classification datasets demonstrate that selective debiasing helps to close the performance gap between post-processing methods and at-training and pre-processing debiasing techniques.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Model (LLM) has demonstrated significant success in a range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks within general domain. The emergence of LLM has introduced innovative methodologies across diverse fields, including the natural sciences. Researchers aim to implement automated, concurrent process driven by LLM to supplant conventional manual, repetitive and labor-intensive work. In the domain of spectral analysis and detection, it is imperative for researchers to autonomously acquire pertinent knowledge across various research objects, which encompasses the spectroscopic techniques and the chemometric methods that are employed in experiments and analysis. Paradoxically, despite the recognition of spectroscopic detection as an effective analytical method, the fundamental process of knowledge retrieval remains both time-intensive and repetitive. In response to this challenge, we first introduced the Spectral Detection and Analysis Based Paper(SDAAP) dataset, which is the first open-source textual knowledge dataset for spectral analysis and detection and contains annotated literature data as well as corresponding knowledge instruction data. Subsequently, we also designed an automated Q\&A framework based on the SDAAP dataset, which can retrieve relevant knowledge and generate high-quality responses by extracting entities in the input as retrieval parameters. It is worth noting that: within this framework, LLM is only used as a tool to provide generalizability, while RAG technique is used to accurately capture the source of the knowledge.This approach not only improves the quality of the generated responses, but also ensures the traceability of the knowledge. Experimental results show that our framework generates responses with more reliable expertise compared to the baseline.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> High-performance sparse matrix-matrix (SpMM) multiplication is paramount for science and industry, as the ever-increasing sizes of data prohibit using dense data structures. Yet, existing hardware, such as Tensor Cores (TC), is ill-suited for SpMM, as it imposes strict constraints on data structures that cannot be met by unstructured sparsity found in many applications. To address this, we introduce (S)parse (Ma)trix Matrix (T)ensor Core-accelerated (SMaT): a novel SpMM library that utilizes TCs for unstructured sparse matrices. Our block-sparse library leverages the low-level CUDA MMA (matrix-matrix-accumulate) API, maximizing the performance offered by modern GPUs. Algorithmic optimizations such as sparse matrix permutation further improve performance by minimizing the number of non-zero blocks. The evaluation on NVIDIA A100 shows that SMaT outperforms SotA libraries (DASP, cuSPARSE, and Magicube) by up to 125x (on average 2.6x). SMaT can be used to accelerate many workloads in scientific computing, large-model training, inference, and others.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed machine learning but raised significant legal concerns due to their potential to produce text that infringes on copyrights, resulting in several high-profile lawsuits. The legal landscape is struggling to keep pace with these rapid advancements, with ongoing debates about whether generated text might plagiarize copyrighted materials. Current LLMs may infringe on copyrights or overly restrict non-copyrighted texts, leading to these challenges: (i) the need for a comprehensive evaluation benchmark to assess copyright compliance from multiple aspects; (ii) evaluating robustness against safeguard bypassing attacks; and (iii) developing effective defense targeted against the generation of copyrighted text. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a curated dataset to evaluate methods, test attack strategies, and propose lightweight, real-time defense to prevent the generation of copyrighted text, ensuring the safe and lawful use of LLMs. Our experiments demonstrate that current LLMs frequently output copyrighted text, and that jailbreaking attacks can significantly increase the volume of copyrighted output. Our proposed defense mechanism significantly reduces the volume of copyrighted text generated by LLMs by effectively refusing malicious requests.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Neural networks (NN) perform well in diverse tasks, but sometimes produce nonsensical results to humans. Most NN models "solely" learn from (input, output) pairs, occasionally conflicting with human knowledge. Many studies indicate injecting human knowledge by reducing output constraints during training can improve model performance and reduce constraint violations. While there have been several attempts to compare different existing algorithms under the same programming framework, nonetheless, there has been no previous work that categorizes learning algorithms with output constraints in a unified manner. Our contributions are as follows: (1) We categorize the previous studies based on three axes: type of constraint loss used (e.g. probabilistic soft logic, REINFORCE), exploration strategy of constraint-violating examples, and integration mechanism of learning signals from main task and constraint. (2) We propose new algorithms to integrate the information of main task and constraint injection, inspired by continual-learning algorithms. (3) Furthermore, we propose the $H\beta$-score as a metric for considering the main task metric and constraint violation simultaneously. To provide a thorough analysis, we examine all the algorithms on three NLP tasks: natural language inference (NLI), synthetic transduction examples (STE), and semantic role labeling (SRL). We explore and reveal the key factors of various algorithms associated with achieving high $H\beta$-scores.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In-context learning (ICL) has proven to be an effective strategy for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) with no additional training. However, the exact mechanism behind these performance improvements remains unclear. This study is the first to show how ICL surfaces memorized training data and to explore the correlation between this memorization and performance across various ICL regimes: zero-shot, few-shot, and many-shot. Our most notable findings include: (1) ICL significantly surfaces memorization compared to zero-shot learning in most cases; (2) demonstrations, without their labels, are the most effective element in surfacing memorization; (3) ICL improves performance when the surfaced memorization in few-shot regimes reaches a high level (about 40%); and (4) there is a very strong correlation between performance and memorization in ICL when it outperforms zero-shot learning. Overall, our study uncovers a hidden phenomenon -- memorization -- at the core of ICL, raising an important question: to what extent do LLMs truly generalize from demonstrations in ICL, and how much of their success is due to memorization?

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This study investigates the application effectiveness of the Large Language Model (LLMs) ChatGLM in the automated generation of high school information technology exam questions. Through meticulously designed prompt engineering strategies, the model is guided to generate diverse questions, which are then comprehensively evaluated by domain experts. The evaluation dimensions include the Hitting(the degree of alignment with teaching content), Fitting (the degree of embodiment of core competencies), Clarity (the explicitness of question descriptions), and Willing to use (the teacher's willingness to use the question in teaching). The results indicate that ChatGLM outperforms human-generated questions in terms of clarity and teachers' willingness to use, although there is no significant difference in hit rate and fit. This finding suggests that ChatGLM has the potential to enhance the efficiency of question generation and alleviate the burden on teachers, providing a new perspective for the future development of educational assessment systems. Future research could explore further optimizations to the ChatGLM model to maintain high fit and hit rates while improving the clarity of questions and teachers' willingness to use them.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With an evergrowing number of LLMs reporting superlative performance for English, their ability to perform equitably for different dialects of English ($\textit{i.e.}$, dialect robustness) needs to be ascertained. Specifically, we use English language (US English or Indian English) conversations between humans who play the word-guessing game of 'taboo'. We formulate two evaluative tasks: target word prediction (TWP) ($\textit{i.e.}$, predict the masked target word in a conversation) and target word selection (TWS) ($\textit{i.e.}$, select the most likely masked target word in a conversation, from among a set of candidate words). Extending MD3, an existing dialectic dataset of taboo-playing conversations, we introduce M-MD3, a target-word-masked version of MD3 with the en-US and en-IN subsets. We create two subsets: en-MV (where en-US is transformed to include dialectal information) and en-TR (where dialectal information is removed from en-IN). We evaluate one open-source (Llama3) and two closed-source (GPT-4/3.5) LLMs. LLMs perform significantly better for US English than Indian English for both TWP and TWS tasks, for all settings, exhibiting marginalisation against the Indian dialect of English. While GPT-based models perform the best, the comparatively smaller models work more equitably after fine-tuning. Our error analysis shows that the LLMs can understand the dialect better after fine-tuning using dialectal data. Our evaluation methodology exhibits a novel way to examine attributes of language models using pre-existing dialogue datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is crucial for Recommendation System(RS), aiming to provide personalized recommendation services for users in many aspects such as food delivery, e-commerce and so on. However, traditional RS relies on collaborative signals, which lacks semantic understanding to real-time scenes. We also noticed that a major challenge in utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for practical recommendation purposes is their efficiency in dealing with long text input. To break through the problems above, we propose Large Language Model Aided Real-time Scene Recommendation(LARR), adopt LLMs for semantic understanding, utilizing real-time scene information in RS without requiring LLM to process the entire real-time scene text directly, thereby enhancing the efficiency of LLM-based CTR modeling. Specifically, recommendation domain-specific knowledge is injected into LLM and then RS employs an aggregation encoder to build real-time scene information from separate LLM's outputs. Firstly, a LLM is continual pretrained on corpus built from recommendation data with the aid of special tokens. Subsequently, the LLM is fine-tuned via contrastive learning on three kinds of sample construction strategies. Through this step, LLM is transformed into a text embedding model. Finally, LLM's separate outputs for different scene features are aggregated by an encoder, aligning to collaborative signals in RS, enhancing the performance of recommendation model.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces two multilingual systems, IKUN and IKUN-C, developed for the general machine translation task in WMT24. IKUN and IKUN-C represent an open system and a constrained system, respectively, built on Llama-3-8b and Mistral-7B-v0.3. Both systems are designed to handle all 11 language directions using a single model. According to automatic evaluation metrics, IKUN-C achieved 6 first-place and 3 second-place finishes among all constrained systems, while IKUN secured 1 first-place and 2 second-place finishes across both open and constrained systems. These encouraging results suggest that large language models (LLMs) are nearing the level of proficiency required for effective multilingual machine translation. The systems are based on a two-stage approach: first, continuous pre-training on monolingual data in 10 languages, followed by fine-tuning on high-quality parallel data for 11 language directions. The primary difference between IKUN and IKUN-C lies in their monolingual pre-training strategy. IKUN-C is pre-trained using constrained monolingual data, whereas IKUN leverages monolingual data from the OSCAR dataset. In the second phase, both systems are fine-tuned on parallel data sourced from NTREX, Flores, and WMT16-23 for all 11 language pairs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent strides in Large Language Models (LLMs) have saturated many Natural Language Processing (NLP) benchmarks, emphasizing the need for more challenging ones to properly assess LLM capabilities. However, domain-specific and multilingual benchmarks are rare because they require in-depth expertise to develop. Still, most public models are trained predominantly on English corpora, while other languages remain understudied, particularly for practical domain-specific NLP tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel NLP benchmark for the legal domain that challenges LLMs in five key dimensions: processing \emph{long documents} (up to 50K tokens), using \emph{domain-specific knowledge} (embodied in legal texts), \emph{multilingual} understanding (covering five languages), \emph{multitasking} (comprising legal document-to-document Information Retrieval, Court View Generation, Leading Decision Summarization, Citation Extraction, and eight challenging Text Classification tasks) and \emph{reasoning} (comprising especially Court View Generation, but also the Text Classification tasks). Our benchmark contains diverse datasets from the Swiss legal system, allowing for a comprehensive study of the underlying non-English, inherently multilingual legal system. Despite the large size of our datasets (some with hundreds of thousands of examples), existing publicly available multilingual models struggle with most tasks, even after extensive in-domain pre-training and fine-tuning. We publish all resources (benchmark suite, pre-trained models, code) under permissive open CC BY-SA licenses.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Time-series data exists in every corner of real-world systems and services, ranging from satellites in the sky to wearable devices on human bodies. Learning representations by extracting and inferring valuable information from these time series is crucial for understanding the complex dynamics of particular phenomena and enabling informed decisions. With the learned representations, we can perform numerous downstream analyses more effectively. Among several approaches, deep learning has demonstrated remarkable performance in extracting hidden patterns and features from time-series data without manual feature engineering. This survey first presents a novel taxonomy based on three fundamental elements in designing state-of-the-art universal representation learning methods for time series. According to the proposed taxonomy, we comprehensively review existing studies and discuss their intuitions and insights into how these methods enhance the quality of learned representations. Finally, as a guideline for future studies, we summarize commonly used experimental setups and datasets and discuss several promising research directions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose a spatio-temporal generalised additive model (GAM) to study if precipitation patterns have changed between two 10-year time periods in the last 50 years in Austria. In particular, we model three scenarios: monthly mean and monthly maximum precipitation as well as the maximum length of a dry spell per month with a gamma, blended generalised extreme value and negative binomial distribution, respectively, over the periods 1973-1982 and 2013-2022. In order to model the spatial dependencies in the data more realistically, we intend to take the mountainous landscape of Austria into account. Therefore, we have chosen a non-stationary version of the Mat\'ern covariance function, which accounts for elevation differences, as a spatial argument of the latent field in the GAM. The temporal part of the latent field is captured by an AR(1) process. We use the stochastic partial differential equation approach in combination with integrated nested Laplace approximation to perform inference computationally efficient. The model outputs are visualised and support existing climate change studies in the Alpine region obtained with, for example, projections from regional climate models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced artificial intelligence, excelling in numerous tasks. Although the functionality of a model is inherently tied to its parameters, a systematic method for exploring the connections between the parameters and the functionality are lacking. Models sharing similar structure and parameter counts exhibit significant performance disparities across various tasks, prompting investigations into the varying patterns that govern their performance. We adopted a mutagenesis screen approach inspired by the methods used in biological studies, to investigate Llama2-7b and Zephyr. This technique involved mutating elements within the models' matrices to their maximum or minimum values to examine the relationship between model parameters and their functionalities. Our research uncovered multiple levels of fine structures within both models. Many matrices showed a mixture of maximum and minimum mutations following mutagenesis, but others were predominantly sensitive to one type. Notably, mutations that produced phenotypes, especially those with severe outcomes, tended to cluster along axes. Additionally, the location of maximum and minimum mutations often displayed a complementary pattern on matrix in both models, with the Gate matrix showing a unique two-dimensional asymmetry after rearrangement. In Zephyr, certain mutations consistently resulted in poetic or conversational rather than descriptive outputs. These "writer" mutations grouped according to the high-frequency initial word of the output, with a marked tendency to share the row coordinate even when they are in different matrices. Our findings affirm that the mutagenesis screen is an effective tool for deciphering the complexities of large language models and identifying unexpected ways to expand their potential, providing deeper insights into the foundational aspects of AI systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Safety alignment is indispensable for Large language models (LLMs) to defend threats from malicious instructions. However, recent researches reveal safety-aligned LLMs prone to reject benign queries due to the exaggerated safety issue, limiting their helpfulness. In this paper, we propose a Safety-Conscious Activation Steering (SCANS) method to mitigate the exaggerated safety concerns in aligned LLMs. First, SCANS extracts the refusal steering vectors within the activation space and utilizes vocabulary projection to anchor some specific safety-critical layers which influence model refusal behavior. Second, by tracking the hidden state transition, SCANS identifies the steering direction and steers the model behavior accordingly, achieving a balance between exaggerated safety and adequate safety. Experiments show that SCANS achieves new state-of-the-art performance on XSTest and OKTest benchmarks, without impairing their defense capability against harmful queries and maintaining almost unchanged model capability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We study a new problem setting of question answering (QA), referred to as DocTabQA. Within this setting, given a long document, the goal is to respond to questions by organizing the answers into structured tables derived directly from the document's content. Unlike traditional QA approaches which predominantly rely on unstructured text to formulate responses, DocTabQA aims to leverage structured tables as answers to convey information clearly and systematically, thereby enhancing user comprehension and highlighting relationships between data points. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been previously explored. In this paper, we introduce the QTabA dataset, encompassing 300 financial documents, accompanied by manually annotated 1.5k question-table pairs. Initially, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 to establish a baseline. However, it is widely acknowledged that LLMs encounter difficulties when tasked with generating intricate, structured outputs from long input sequences. To overcome these challenges, we present a two-stage framework, called DocTabTalk, which initially retrieves relevant sentences from extensive documents and subsequently generates hierarchical tables based on these identified sentences. DocTabTalk incorporates two key technological innovations: AlignLLaMA and TabTalk, which are specifically tailored to assist GPT-4 in tackling DocTabQA, enabling it to generate well-structured, hierarchical tables with improved organization and clarity. Comprehensive experimental evaluations conducted on both QTabA and RotoWire datasets demonstrate that our DocTabTalk significantly enhances the performances of the GPT-4 in our proposed DocTabQA task and the table generation task. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/SmileWHC/DocTabQA for further research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have attracted much attention for their multifunctionality. However, traditional Transformer architectures incur significant overhead due to their secondary computational complexity. To address this issue, we introduce ML-Mamba, a multimodal language model, which utilizes the latest and efficient Mamba-2 model for inference. Mamba-2 is known for its linear scalability and fast processing of long sequences. We replace the Transformer-based backbone with a pre-trained Mamba-2 model and explore methods for integrating 2D visual selective scanning mechanisms into multimodal learning while also trying various visual encoders and Mamba-2 model variants. Our extensive experiments in various multimodal benchmark tests demonstrate the competitive performance of ML-Mamba and highlight the potential of state space models in multimodal tasks. The experimental results show that: (1) we empirically explore how to effectively apply the 2D vision selective scan mechanism for multimodal learning. We propose a novel multimodal connector called the Mamba-2 Scan Connector (MSC), which enhances representational capabilities. (2) ML-Mamba achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods such as TinyLaVA and MobileVLM v2 through its linear sequential modeling while faster inference speed; (3) Compared to multimodal models utilizing Mamba-1, the Mamba-2-based ML-Mamba exhibits superior inference performance and effectiveness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> ost recent popular Role-Playing Games (RPGs) allow players to create in-game characters with hundreds of adjustable parameters, including bone positions and various makeup options. Although text-driven auto-customization systems have been developed to simplify the complex process of adjusting these intricate character parameters, they are limited by their single-round generation and lack the capability for further editing and fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose an Interactive Character Editing framework (ICE) to achieve a multi-round dialogue-based refinement process. In a nutshell, our ICE offers a more user-friendly way to enable players to convey creative ideas iteratively while ensuring that created characters align with the expectations of players. Specifically, we propose an Instruction Parsing Module (IPM) that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to parse multi-round dialogues into clear editing instruction prompts in each round. To reliably and swiftly modify character control parameters at a fine-grained level, we propose a Semantic-guided Low-dimension Parameter Solver (SLPS) that edits character control parameters according to prompts in a zero-shot manner. Our SLPS first localizes the character control parameters related to the fine-grained modification, and then optimizes the corresponding parameters in a low-dimension space to avoid unrealistic results. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed ICE for in-game character creation and the superior editing performance of ICE.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Conventional Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) approaches rely on manually crafted interfaces connecting symbolic task planning with continuous motion generation. These domain-specific and labor-intensive modules are limited in addressing emerging tasks in real-world settings. Here, we present LLM^3, a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based TAMP framework featuring a domain-independent interface. Specifically, we leverage the powerful reasoning and planning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs to propose symbolic action sequences and select continuous action parameters for motion planning. Crucially, LLM^3 incorporates motion planning feedback through prompting, allowing the LLM to iteratively refine its proposals by reasoning about motion failure. Consequently, LLM^3 interfaces between task planning and motion planning, alleviating the intricate design process of handling domain-specific messages between them. Through a series of simulations in a box-packing domain, we quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM^3 in solving TAMP problems and the efficiency in selecting action parameters. Ablation studies underscore the significant contribution of motion failure reasoning to the success of LLM^3. Furthermore, we conduct qualitative experiments on a physical manipulator, demonstrating the practical applicability of our approach in real-world settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to evolve, more are being designed to handle long-context inputs. Despite this advancement, most of them still face challenges in accurately handling long-context tasks, often showing the "lost in the middle" issue. We identify that insufficient retrieval capability is one of the important reasons for this issue. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel approach to design training data for long-context tasks, aiming at augmenting LLMs' proficiency in extracting key information from long context. Specially, we incorporate an additional part named "paraphrasing the original text" when constructing the answer of training samples and then fine-tuning the model. Experimenting on LongBench and NaturalQuestions Multi-document-QA dataset with models of Llama and Qwen series, our method achieves an improvement of up to 8.48% and 4.48% in average scores, respectively, showing effectiveness in improving the model' s performance on long-context tasks. The model and training data have been made available on HuggingFace(https://huggingface.co/yuyijiong/Qwen-14b-chat-yarn-32k).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The non-relativistic model of nuclear matter with Brussels extended Skyrme interactions is employed in order to build, within a Bayesian approach, models for the dense matter equation of state (EOS). In addition to a minimal set of constraints on nuclear empirical parameters; the density behavior of the energy per particle in pure neutron matter (PNM); a lower limit on the maximum neutron star (NS) mass, we require that the Fermi velocity of neutrons ($v_{\mathrm{F;\,n}}$) in PNM and symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) with densities up to $0.8~\mathrm{fm}^{-3}$ (arbitrary) does not exceed the speed of light. The latter condition is imposed in order to cure a deficiency present in many Skyrme interactions [Duan and Urban, Phys. Rev. C 108, 025813 (2023)]. We illustrate the importance of this constraint for the posterior distributions. Some of our models are subjected to constraints on the density dependence of neutron (nucleon) Landau effective mass in PNM (SNM), too. The impact of various sets of constraints on the behaviors of nuclear matter and NSs is discussed in detail. Systematic comparison with results previously obtained by employing Skyrme interactions is done for posteriors of both nuclear matter (NM) and NS parameters. Special attention is given to the model and constraints dependence of correlations among various quantities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As Internet of Things (IoT) technology advances, end devices like sensors and smartphones are progressively equipped with AI models tailored to their local memory and computational constraints. Local inference reduces communication costs and latency; however, these smaller models typically underperform compared to more sophisticated models deployed on edge servers or in the cloud. Cooperative Inference Systems (CISs) address this performance trade-off by enabling smaller devices to offload part of their inference tasks to more capable devices. These systems often deploy hierarchical models that share numerous parameters, exemplified by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that utilize strategies like early exits or ordered dropout. In such instances, Federated Learning (FL) may be employed to jointly train the models within a CIS. Yet, traditional training methods have overlooked the operational dynamics of CISs during inference, particularly the potential high heterogeneity in serving rates across clients. To address this gap, we propose a novel FL approach designed explicitly for use in CISs that accounts for these variations in serving rates. Our framework not only offers rigorous theoretical guarantees, but also surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) training algorithms for CISs, especially in scenarios where inference request rates or data availability are uneven among clients.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are versatile and demonstrate impressive generalization ability by mining and learning information from extensive unlabeled text. However, they still exhibit reasoning mistakes, often stemming from knowledge deficiencies, which can affect their trustworthiness and reliability. Although users can provide diverse and comprehensive queries, obtaining sufficient and effective feedback is demanding. Furthermore, evaluating LLMs comprehensively with limited labeled samples is difficult. This makes it a challenge to diagnose and remedy the deficiencies of LLMs through rich label-free user queries. To tackle this challenge, we propose a label-free curricular meaningful learning framework (LaMer). LaMer first employs relative entropy to automatically diagnose and quantify the knowledge deficiencies of LLMs in a label-free setting. Next, to remedy the diagnosed knowledge deficiencies, we apply curricular meaningful learning: first, we adopt meaningful learning to adaptively synthesize augmentation data according to the severity of the deficiencies, and then design a curricular deficiency remedy strategy to remedy the knowledge deficiencies of LLMs progressively. Experiments show that LaMer efficiently and effectively diagnoses and remedies knowledge deficiencies in LLMs, improving various LLMs across seven out-of-distribution (OOD) reasoning and language understanding benchmarks, achieving comparable results to baselines with just 40\% training data. LaMer even surpasses methods that rely on labeled datasets for deficiency diagnosis. In application, our label-free method can offer an effective knowledge deficiency diagnostic tool for efficient LLM development.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Although Kubernetes has become a widespread open-source system that automates the management of containerized applications, its complexity can be a significant barrier, particularly for application developers unfamiliar with it. One approach employs large language models (LLMs) to assist developers in generating Kubernetes manifests; however it is currently impossible to determine whether the output satisfies given specifications and is comprehensible. In this study, we proposed a benchmarking method for evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs in synthesizing manifests, using the Compose specification -- a standard widely adopted by application developers -- as input. The proposed benchmarking method revealed that LLMs generally produce accurate results that compensate for simple specification gaps. However, we also observed that inline comments for readability were often omitted, and completion accuracy was low for atypical inputs with unclear intentions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce the emPDF (Empirical Distribution Function), a novel dynamical modeling method that infers the gravitational potential from kinematic tracers with optimal statistical efficiency under the minimal assumption of steady state. emPDF determines the best-fit potential by maximizing the similarity between instantaneous kinematics and the time-averaged phase-space distribution function (DF), which is empirically constructed from observation upon the theoretical foundation of oPDF (Han et al. 2016). This approach eliminates the need for presumed functional forms of DFs or orbit libraries required by conventional DF- or orbit-based methods. emPDF stands out for its flexibility, efficiency, and capability in handling observational effects, making it preferable to the popular Jeans equation or other minimal assumption methods, especially for the Milky Way (MW) outer halo where tracers often have limited sample size and poor data quality. We apply emPDF to infer the MW mass profile using Gaia DR3 data of satellite galaxies and globular clusters, obtaining consistent measurements with the constraints from simulation-informed DF fitting (Li et al. 2020). While the simulation-informed DF offers superior precision owing to the additional information extracted from simulations, emPDF is independent of such supplementary knowledge and applicable to general tracer populations. We provide tabulated measurements of the mass profile from emPDF, along with updated measurements from simulation-informed DF.

In this paper, we provide a transparent physics analysis of diffusion models, formulating the fluctuation theorem, entropy production, equilibrium measure, and Franz-Parisi potential to understand the dynamic process and intrinsic phase transitions. Our analysis is rooted in a path integral representation of both forward and backward dynamics, and in treating the reverse diffusion generative process as a statistical inference, where the time-dependent state variables serve as quenched disorder akin to that in spin glass theory. Our study thus links stochastic thermodynamics, statistical inference and geometry based analysis together to yield a coherent picture about how the generative diffusion models work.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Odd radio circles (ORCs) are newly discovered extragalactic radio objects with unknown origin. In this work, we carry out three-dimensional cosmic-ray (CR) magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the FLASH code and predict the radio morphology of end-on active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet-inflated bubbles considering hadronic emission. We consider CR proton (CRp)-dominated jets as they tend to inflate oblate bubbles, promising to reproduce the large inferred sizes of the ORCs when viewed end-on. We find that powerful and long-duration CRp-dominated jets can create bubbles with similar sizes ($\sim 300-600$ kpc) and radio morphology (circular and edge-brightened) to the observed ORCs in low-mass ($M_{\rm vir}\sim 8\times 10^{12} - 8\times 10^{13}~M_\odot$) halos. Given the same amount of input jet energy, longer-duration (thus lower-power) jets tend to create larger bubbles since high-power jets generate strong shocks that carry away a significant portion of the jet energy. The edge-brightened feature of the observed ORCs is naturally reproduced due to efficient hadronic collisions at the interface between the bubbles and the ambient medium. We further discuss the radio luminosity, X-ray detectability, and the possible origin of such strong AGN jets in the context of galaxy evolution. We conclude that end-on CR-dominated AGN bubbles could be a plausible scenario for the formation of ORCs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are implicit troublemakers. While they provide valuable insights and assist in problem-solving, they can also potentially serve as a resource for malicious activities. Implementing safety alignment could mitigate the risk of LLMs generating harmful responses. We argue that: even when an LLM appears to successfully block harmful queries, there may still be hidden vulnerabilities that could act as ticking time bombs. To identify these underlying weaknesses, we propose to use a cost value model as both a detector and an attacker. Trained on external or self-generated harmful datasets, the cost value model could successfully influence the original safe LLM to output toxic content in decoding process. For instance, LLaMA-2-chat 7B outputs 39.18% concrete toxic content, along with only 22.16% refusals without any harmful suffixes. These potential weaknesses can then be exploited via prompt optimization such as soft prompts on images. We name this decoding strategy: Jailbreak Value Decoding (JVD), emphasizing that seemingly secure LLMs may not be as safe as we initially believe. They could be used to gather harmful data or launch covert attacks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multi-modal Large Language Models have recently experienced rapid developments and excel in various multi-modal tasks. However, they still struggle with mathematical geometric problem solving, which requires exceptional visual perception proficiency. Existing MLLMs mostly optimize the LLM backbone to acquire geometric reasoning capabilities, while rarely emphasizing improvements in visual comprehension. In this paper, we first investigate the visual perception performance of MLLMs when facing geometric diagrams. Our findings reveal that current MLLMs severely suffer from inaccurate geometric perception and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose EAGLE, a novel two-stage end-to-end visual enhancement MLLM framework designed to ElevAte Geometric reasoning through LLM-Empowered visual instruction tuning. Specifically, in the preliminary stage, we feed geometric image-caption pairs into our MLLM that contains a fully fine-tuning CLIP ViT and a frozen LLM, aiming to endow our model with basic geometric knowledge. In the subsequent advanced stage, we incorporate LoRA modules into the vision encoder and unfreeze the LLM backbone. This enables the model to leverage the inherent CoT rationales within question-answer pairs, guiding the MLLM to focus on nuanced visual cues and enhancing its overall perceptual capacity. Moreover, we optimize the cross-modal projector in both stages to foster adaptive visual-linguistic alignments. After the two-stage visual enhancement, we develop the geometry expert model EAGLE-7B. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. For example, on the GeoQA benchmark, EAGLE-7B not only surpasses the exemplary G-LLaVA 7B model by 2.9%, but also marginally outperforms the larger G-LLaVA 13B model. On the MathVista benchmark, EAGLE-7B achieves remarkable 3.8% improvements compared with the proprietary model GPT-4V.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are often English-centric due to the disproportionate distribution of languages in their pre-training data. Enhancing non-English language capabilities through post-pretraining often results in catastrophic forgetting of the ability of original languages. Previous methods either achieve good expansion with severe forgetting or slight forgetting with poor expansion, indicating the challenge of balancing language expansion while preventing forgetting. In this paper, we propose a method called MoE-LPR (Mixture-of-Experts with Language Priors Routing) to alleviate this problem. MoE-LPR employs a two-stage training approach to enhance the multilingual capability. First, the model is post-pretrained into a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture by upcycling, where all the original parameters are frozen and new experts are added. In this stage, we focus improving the ability on expanded languages, without using any original language data. Then, the model reviews the knowledge of the original languages with replay data amounting to less than 1% of post-pretraining, where we incorporate language priors routing to better recover the abilities of the original languages. Evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that MoE-LPR outperforms other post-pretraining methods. Freezing original parameters preserves original language knowledge while adding new experts preserves the learning ability. Reviewing with LPR enables effective utilization of multilingual knowledge within the parameters. Additionally, the MoE architecture maintains the same inference overhead while increasing total model parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate MoE-LPR's effectiveness in improving expanded languages and preserving original language proficiency with superior scalability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Dynamic activation (DA) techniques, such as DejaVu and MoEfication, have demonstrated their potential to significantly enhance the inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs). However, these techniques often rely on ReLU activation functions or require additional parameters and training to maintain performance. This paper introduces a training-free Threshold-based Dynamic Activation(TDA) method that leverage sequence information to exploit the inherent sparsity of models across various architectures. This method is designed to accelerate generation speed by 18-25\% without significantly compromising task performance, thereby addressing the limitations of existing DA techniques. Moreover, we delve into the root causes of LLM sparsity and theoretically analyze two of its critical features: history-related activation uncertainty and semantic-irrelevant activation inertia. Our comprehensive analyses not only provide a robust theoretical foundation for DA methods but also offer valuable insights to guide future research in optimizing LLMs for greater efficiency and effectiveness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To promote sustainable business practices, and to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, the EU has developed the taxonomy of sustainable activities, which describes when exactly business practices can be considered sustainable. While the taxonomy has only been recently established, progressively more companies will have to report how much of their revenue was created via sustainably executed business processes. To help companies prepare to assess whether their business processes comply with the constraints outlined in the taxonomy, we investigate in how far these criteria can be used for conformance checking, that is, assessing in a data-driven manner, whether business process executions adhere to regulatory constraints. For this, we develop a few-shot learning pipeline to characterize the constraints of the taxonomy with the help of an LLM as to the process dimensions they relate to. We find that many constraints of the taxonomy are useable for conformance checking, particularly in the sectors of energy, manufacturing, and transport. This will aid companies in preparing to monitor regulatory compliance with the taxonomy automatically, by characterizing what kind of information they need to extract, and by providing a better understanding of sectors where such an assessment is feasible and where it is not.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Homomorphic encryption (HE)-based deep neural network (DNN) inference protects data and model privacy but suffers from significant computation overhead. We observe transforming the DNN weights into circulant matrices converts general matrix-vector multiplications into HE-friendly 1-dimensional convolutions, drastically reducing the HE computation cost. Hence, in this paper, we propose \method, a protocol/network co-optimization framework based on block circulant transformation. At the protocol level, PrivCirNet customizes the HE encoding algorithm that is fully compatible with the block circulant transformation and reduces the computation latency in proportion to the block size. At the network level, we propose a latency-aware formulation to search for the layer-wise block size assignment based on second-order information. PrivCirNet also leverages layer fusion to further reduce the inference cost. We compare PrivCirNet with the state-of-the-art HE-based framework Bolt (IEEE S\&P 2024) and the HE-friendly pruning method SpENCNN (ICML 2023). For ResNet-18 and Vision Transformer (ViT) on Tiny ImageNet, PrivCirNet reduces latency by $5.0\times$ and $1.3\times$ with iso-accuracy over Bolt, respectively, and improves accuracy by $4.1\%$ and $12\%$ over SpENCNN, respectively. For MobileNetV2 on ImageNet, PrivCirNet achieves $1.7\times$ lower latency and $4.2\%$ better accuracy over Bolt and SpENCNN, respectively. Our code and checkpoints are available on Git Hub.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Standard Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models have traditionally been trained with Sinusoidal Positional Embeddings (PEs), which are inadequate for capturing long-range dependencies and are inefficient for long-context or document-level translation. In contrast, state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) employ relative PEs, demonstrating superior length generalization. This work explores the potential for efficiently switching the Positional Embeddings of pre-trained NMT models from absolute sinusoidal PEs to relative approaches such as RoPE and ALiBi. Our findings reveal that sinusoidal PEs can be effectively replaced with RoPE and ALiBi with negligible or no performance loss, achieved by fine-tuning on a small fraction of high-quality data. Additionally, models trained without Positional Embeddings (NoPE) are not a viable solution for Encoder-Decoder architectures, as they consistently under-perform compared to models utilizing any form of Positional Embedding. Furthermore, even a model trained from scratch with these relative PEs slightly under-performs a fine-tuned model, underscoring the efficiency and validity of our hypothesis.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate human-level capabilities in dialogue, reasoning, and knowledge retention. However, even the most advanced LLMs face challenges such as hallucinations and real-time updating of their knowledge. Current research addresses this bottleneck by equipping LLMs with external knowledge, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). However, two key issues constrained the development of RAG. First, there is a growing lack of comprehensive and fair comparisons between novel RAG algorithms. Second, open-source tools such as LlamaIndex and LangChain employ high-level abstractions, which results in a lack of transparency and limits the ability to develop novel algorithms and evaluation metrics. To close this gap, we introduce RAGLAB, a modular and research-oriented open-source library. RAGLAB reproduces 6 existing algorithms and provides a comprehensive ecosystem for investigating RAG algorithms. Leveraging RAGLAB, we conduct a fair comparison of 6 RAG algorithms across 10 benchmarks. With RAGLAB, researchers can efficiently compare the performance of various algorithms and develop novel algorithms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Context: Previous studies demonstrate that Machine or Deep Learning (ML/DL) models can detect Technical Debt from source code comments called Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD). Despite the importance of ML/DL in software development, limited studies focus on automated detection for new SATD types: Algorithm Debt (AD). AD detection is important because it helps to identify TD early, facilitating research, learning, and preventing the accumulation of issues related to model degradation and lack of scalability. Aim: Our goal is to improve AD detection performance of various ML/DL models. Method: We will perform empirical studies using approaches: TF-IDF, Count Vectorizer, Hash Vectorizer, and TD-indicative words to identify features that improve AD detection, using ML/DL classifiers with different data featurisations. We will use an existing dataset curated from seven DL frameworks where comments were manually classified as AD, Compatibility, Defect, Design, Documentation, Requirement, and Test Debt. We will explore various word embedding methods to further enrich features for ML models. These embeddings will be from models founded in DL such as ROBERTA, ALBERTv2, and large language models (LLMs): INSTRUCTOR and VOYAGE AI. We will enrich the dataset by incorporating AD-related terms, then train various ML/DL classifiers, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, ROBERTA, and ALBERTv2.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are driving advancements in artificial intelligence by increasing the scale of model parameters, which has significantly enhanced generalization ability and unlocked new capabilities in practice. However, their performance in specific downstream tasks is usually hindered by their knowledge boundaries on these tasks. Thus, fine-tuning techniques, especially the widely used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method, have been introduced to expand the boundaries on these tasks, whereas LoRA would underperform on certain tasks owing to its potential overfitting on these tasks. To overcome this overfitting and improve the performance of LoRA, we propose the flexible low rank adaptation (Flexora) method to automatically and flexibly select the most important layers needing to be fine-tuned to achieve the best performance on different downstream tasks. Specifically, Flexora firstly frames this layer selection problem as a well-defined hyperparameter optimization (HPO) problem, then addresses it using the unrolled differentiation (UD) method, and finally selects the most useful layers based on the optimized hyperparameters. Our extensive experiments on many pretrained models and natural language tasks show that Flexora is able to consistently improve over the existing baselines, indicating the effectiveness of our Flexora in practice. We additionally provide insightful theoretical results and many ablation studies to deliver a comprehensive understanding of our Flexora.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph classification is a challenging problem owing to the difficulty in quantifying the similarity between graphs or representing graphs as vectors, though there have been a few methods using graph kernels or graph neural networks (GNNs). Graph kernels often suffer from computational costs and manual feature engineering, while GNNs commonly utilize global pooling operations, risking the loss of structural or semantic information. This work introduces Graph Reference Distribution Learning (GRDL), an efficient and accurate graph classification method. GRDL treats each graph's latent node embeddings given by GNN layers as a discrete distribution, enabling direct classification without global pooling, based on maximum mean discrepancy to adaptively learned reference distributions. To fully understand this new model (the existing theories do not apply) and guide its configuration (e.g., network architecture, references' sizes, number, and regularization) for practical use, we derive generalization error bounds for GRDL and verify them numerically. More importantly, our theoretical and numerical results both show that GRDL has a stronger generalization ability than GNNs with global pooling operations. Experiments on moderate-scale and large-scale graph datasets show the superiority of GRDL over the state-of-the-art, emphasizing its remarkable efficiency, being at least 10 times faster than leading competitors in both training and inference stages.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Many inductive logic programming (ILP) methods are incapable of learning programs from probabilistic background knowledge, e.g. coming from sensory data or neural networks with probabilities. We propose Propper, which handles flawed and probabilistic background knowledge by extending ILP with a combination of neurosymbolic inference, a continuous criterion for hypothesis selection (BCE) and a relaxation of the hypothesis constrainer (NoisyCombo). For relational patterns in noisy images, Propper can learn programs from as few as 8 examples. It outperforms binary ILP and statistical models such as a Graph Neural Network.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In Business Process Management (BPM), effectively comprehending process models is crucial yet poses significant challenges, particularly as organizations scale and processes become more complex. This paper introduces a novel framework utilizing the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the interpretability of complex process models. We present different methods for abstracting business process models into a format accessible to LLMs, and we implement advanced prompting strategies specifically designed to optimize LLM performance within our framework. Additionally, we present a tool, AIPA, that implements our proposed framework and allows for conversational process querying. We evaluate our framework and tool by i) an automatic evaluation comparing different LLMs, model abstractions, and prompting strategies and ii) a user study designed to assess AIPA's effectiveness comprehensively. Results demonstrate our framework's ability to improve the accessibility and interpretability of process models, pioneering new pathways for integrating AI technologies into the BPM field.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In human reading and communication, individuals tend to engage in geospatial reasoning, which involves recognizing geographic entities and making informed inferences about their interrelationships. To mimic such cognitive process, current methods either utilize conventional natural language understanding toolkits, or directly apply models pretrained on geo-related natural language corpora. However, these methods face two significant challenges: i) they do not generalize well to unseen geospatial scenarios, and ii) they overlook the importance of integrating geospatial context from geographical databases with linguistic information from the Internet. To handle these challenges, we propose GeoReasoner, a language model capable of reasoning on geospatially grounded natural language. Specifically, it first leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate a comprehensive location description based on linguistic and geospatial information. It also encodes direction and distance information into spatial embedding via treating them as pseudo-sentences. Consequently, the model is trained on both anchor-level and neighbor-level inputs to learn geo-entity representation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate GeoReasoner's superiority in three tasks: toponym recognition, toponym linking, and geo-entity typing, compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding biological processes, drug development, and biotechnological advancements requires detailed analysis of protein structures and sequences, a task in protein research that is inherently complex and time-consuming when performed manually. To streamline this process, we introduce ProteinGPT, a state-of-the-art multi-modal protein chat system, that allows users to upload protein sequences and/or structures for comprehensive protein analysis and responsive inquiries. ProteinGPT seamlessly integrates protein sequence and structure encoders with linear projection layers for precise representation adaptation, coupled with a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses. To train ProteinGPT, we construct a large-scale dataset of 132,092 proteins with annotations, and optimize the instruction-tuning process using GPT-4o. This innovative system ensures accurate alignment between the user-uploaded data and prompts, simplifying protein analysis. Experiments show that ProteinGPT can produce promising responses to proteins and their corresponding questions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) such as Copilot and ChatGPT have transformed software development by automating coding tasks. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in reducing error rates and fully meeting user expectations. Our empirical study reveals LLMs tend to dilute their self-attention on the initial prompt as more code tokens are generated. We hypothesize this self-attention dilution issue is one of the root causes of inaccuracies in LLM-generated code. To mitigate this issue, we propose Selective Prompt Anchoring (SPA). SPA amplifies the influence of the selected parts in the initial prompt, which we refer to as ``anchored text'', during code generation. Specifically, SPA calculates the logit distribution difference with and without the anchored text. We prove this difference approximates the anchored text's contextual contribution to the output logits. SPA creates an augmented logit distribution by linearly combining the original logit distribution and the logit difference. We evaluate SPA with five LLMs on four benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that using SPA can consistently improve Pass@1 rates by up to 9.7% in all settings. Notably, with selective text anchoring, a small version of DeepSeek-Coder (6.7B) can achieve better performance than an original much larger version (33B). Our code is available at https://github.com/magic-YuanTian/Selective-Prompt-Anchoring.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable perceptual and reasoning abilities, typically comprising a Vision Encoder, an Adapter, and a Large Language Model (LLM). The adapter serves as the critical bridge between the visual and language components. However, training adapters with image-level supervision often results in significant misalignment, undermining the LLMs' capabilities and limiting the potential of Multimodal LLMs. To address this, we introduce Supervised Embedding Alignment (SEA), a token-level alignment method that leverages vision-language pre-trained models, such as CLIP, to align visual tokens with the LLM's embedding space through contrastive learning. This approach ensures a more coherent integration of visual and language representations, enhancing the performance and interpretability of multimodal LLMs while preserving their inherent capabilities. Extensive experiments show that SEA effectively improves MLLMs, particularly for smaller models, without adding extra data or inference computation. SEA also lays the groundwork for developing more general and adaptable solutions to enhance multimodal systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have become more prevalent in long-context applications such as interactive chatbots, document analysis, and agent workflows, but it is challenging to serve long-context requests with low latency and high throughput. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used technique to reduce latency without sacrificing performance but the conventional wisdom suggests that its efficacy is limited to small batch sizes. In MagicDec, we show that surprisingly SD can achieve speedup even for a high throughput inference regime for moderate to long sequences. More interestingly, an intelligent drafting strategy can achieve better speedup with increasing batch size based on our rigorous analysis. MagicDec first identifies the bottleneck shifts with increasing batch size and sequence length, and uses these insights to deploy speculative decoding more effectively for high throughput inference. Then, it leverages draft models with sparse KV cache to address the KV bottleneck that scales with both sequence length and batch size. This finding underscores the broad applicability of speculative decoding in long-context serving, as it can enhance throughput and reduce latency without compromising accuracy. For moderate to long sequences, we demonstrate up to 2x speedup for LLaMA-2-7B-32K and 1.84x speedup for LLaMA-3.1-8B when serving batch sizes ranging from 32 to 256 on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Traditional visual storytelling is complex, requiring specialized knowledge and substantial resources, yet often constrained by human creativity and creation precision. While Large Language Models (LLMs) enhance visual storytelling, current approaches often limit themselves to 2D visuals or oversimplify stories through motion synthesis and behavioral simulation, failing to create comprehensive, multi-dimensional narratives. To this end, we present Story3D-Agent, a pioneering approach that leverages the capabilities of LLMs to transform provided narratives into 3D-rendered visualizations. By integrating procedural modeling, our approach enables precise control over multi-character actions and motions, as well as diverse decorative elements, ensuring the long-range and dynamic 3D representation. Furthermore, our method supports narrative extension through logical reasoning, ensuring that generated content remains consistent with existing conditions. We have thoroughly evaluated our Story3D-Agent to validate its effectiveness, offering a basic framework to advance 3D story representation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the rapidly evolving landscape of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text generation, the emergence of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) presents a promising avenue for improving the quality and reliability of generated text by leveraging information retrieved from user specified database. Benchmarking is essential to evaluate and compare the performance of the different RAG configurations in terms of retriever and generator, providing insights into their effectiveness, scalability, and suitability for the specific domain and applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework to generate a domain relevant RAG benchmark. Our framework is based on automatic question-answer generation with Human (domain experts)-AI Large Language Model (LLM) teaming. As a case study, we demonstrate the framework by introducing PermitQA, a first-of-its-kind benchmark on the wind siting and permitting domain which comprises of multiple scientific documents/reports related to environmental impact of wind energy projects. Our framework systematically evaluates RAG performance using diverse metrics and multiple question types with varying complexity level. We also demonstrate the performance of different models on our benchmark.

We explore two distinct pruning strategies: (1) depth pruning and (2) joint hidden/attention/MLP (width) pruning, and evaluate the results on common benchmarks from the LM Evaluation Harness. The models are then aligned with NeMo Aligner and tested in instruct-tuned versions. This approach produces a compelling 4B model from Llama 3.1 8B and a state-of-the-art Mistral-NeMo-Minitron-8B (MN-Minitron-8B for brevity) model from Mistral NeMo 12B. We found that with no access to the original data, it is beneficial to slightly fine-tune teacher models on the distillation dataset.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the realm of multimodal research, numerous studies leverage substantial image-text pairs to conduct modal alignment learning, transforming Large Language Models (LLMs) into Multimodal LLMs and excelling in a variety of visual-language tasks. The prevailing methodologies primarily fall into two categories: self-attention-based and cross-attention-based methods. While self-attention-based methods offer superior data efficiency due to their simple MLP architecture, they often suffer from lower computational efficiency due to concatenating visual and textual tokens as input for LLM. Conversely, cross-attention-based methods, although less data-efficient due to additional learnable parameters, exhibit higher computational efficiency by avoiding long sequence input for LLM. To address these trade-offs, we introduce the Data-Efficient and Compute-Efficient Multimodal Large Language Model (EE-MLLM). Without introducing additional modules or learnable parameters, EE-MLLM achieves both data and compute efficiency. Specifically, we modify the original self-attention mechanism in MLLM to a composite attention mechanism. This mechanism has two key characteristics: 1) Eliminating the computational overhead of self-attention within visual tokens to achieve compute efficiency, and 2) Reusing the weights on each layer of LLM to facilitate effective modality alignment between vision and language for data efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of EE-MLLM across a range of benchmarks, including general-purpose datasets like MMBench and SeedBench, as well as fine-grained tasks such as TextVQA and DocVQA.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are being deployed across various domains today. However, their capacity to solve Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges in cybersecurity has not been thoroughly evaluated. To address this, we develop a novel method to assess LLMs in solving CTF challenges by creating a scalable, open-source benchmark database specifically designed for these applications. This database includes metadata for LLM testing and adaptive learning, compiling a diverse range of CTF challenges from popular competitions. Utilizing the advanced function calling capabilities of LLMs, we build a fully automated system with an enhanced workflow and support for external tool calls. Our benchmark dataset and automated framework allow us to evaluate the performance of five LLMs, encompassing both black-box and open-source models. This work lays the foundation for future research into improving the efficiency of LLMs in interactive cybersecurity tasks and automated task planning. By providing a specialized dataset, our project offers an ideal platform for developing, testing, and refining LLM-based approaches to vulnerability detection and resolution. Evaluating LLMs on these challenges and comparing with human performance yields insights into their potential for AI-driven cybersecurity solutions to perform real-world threat management. We make our dataset open source to public https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/LLM_CTF_Database along with our playground automated framework https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/llm_ctf_automation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite the recent successes of large, pretrained neural language models (LLMs), comparatively little is known about the representations of linguistic structure they learn during pretraining, which can lead to unexpected behaviors in response to prompt variation or distribution shift. To better understand these models and behaviors, we introduce a general model analysis framework to study LLMs with respect to their representation and use of human-interpretable linguistic properties. Our framework, CALM (Competence-based Analysis of Language Models), is designed to investigate LLM competence in the context of specific tasks by intervening on models' internal representations of different linguistic properties using causal probing, and measuring models' alignment under these interventions with a given ground-truth causal model of the task. We also develop a new approach for performing causal probing interventions using gradient-based adversarial attacks, which can target a broader range of properties and representations than prior techniques. Finally, we carry out a case study of CALM using these interventions to analyze and compare LLM competence across a variety of lexical inference tasks, showing that CALM can be used to explain and predict behaviors across these tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Molecular property prediction and generative design via deep learning models has been the subject of intense research given its potential to accelerate development of new, high-performance materials. More recently, these workflows have been significantly augmented with the advent of large language models (LLMs) and systems of LLM-driven agents capable of utilizing pre-trained models to make predictions in the context of more complex research tasks. While effective, there is still room for substantial improvement within the agentic systems on the retrieval of salient information for material design tasks. Moreover, alternative uses of predictive deep learning models, such as leveraging their latent representations to facilitate cross-modal retrieval augmented generation within agentic systems to enable task-specific materials design, has remained unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that large, pre-trained chemistry foundation models can serve as a basis for enabling semantic chemistry information retrieval for both small-molecules, complex polymeric materials, and reactions. Additionally, we show the use of chemistry foundation models in conjunction with image models such as OpenCLIP facilitate unprecedented queries and information retrieval across multiple characterization data domains. Finally, we demonstrate the integration of these systems within multi-agent systems to facilitate structure and topological-based natural language queries and information retrieval for complex research tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Traditionally, reward models used for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) are trained to directly predict preference scores without leveraging the generation capabilities of the underlying large language model (LLM). This limits the capabilities of reward models as they must reason implicitly about the quality of a response, i.e., preference modeling must be performed in a single forward pass through the model. To enable reward models to reason explicitly about the quality of a response, we introduce Critique-out-Loud (CLoud) reward models. CLoud reward models operate by first generating a natural language critique of the assistant's response that is then used to predict a scalar reward for the quality of the response. We demonstrate the success of CLoud reward models for both Llama-3-8B and 70B base models: compared to classic reward models CLoud reward models improve pairwise preference classification accuracy on RewardBench by 4.65 and 5.84 percentage points for the 8B and 70B base models respectively. Furthermore, CLoud reward models lead to a Pareto improvement for win rate on ArenaHard when used as the scoring model for Best-of-N. Finally, we explore how to exploit the dynamic inference compute capabilities of CLoud reward models by performing self-consistency decoding for reward prediction.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs), information retrieval (IR) systems, such as search engines and recommender systems, have undergone a significant paradigm shift. This evolution, while heralding new opportunities, introduces emerging challenges, particularly in terms of biases and unfairness, which may threaten the information ecosystem. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of existing works on emerging and pressing bias and unfairness issues in IR systems when the integration of LLMs. We first unify bias and unfairness issues as distribution mismatch problems, providing a groundwork for categorizing various mitigation strategies through distribution alignment. Subsequently, we systematically delve into the specific bias and unfairness issues arising from three critical stages of LLMs integration into IR systems: data collection, model development, and result evaluation. In doing so, we meticulously review and analyze recent literature, focusing on the definitions, characteristics, and corresponding mitigation strategies associated with these issues. Finally, we identify and highlight some open problems and challenges for future work, aiming to inspire researchers and stakeholders in the IR field and beyond to better understand and mitigate bias and unfairness issues of IR in this LLM era. We also consistently maintain a GitHub repository for the relevant papers and resources in this rising direction at https://github.com/KID-22/LLM-IR-Bias-Fairness-Survey.

It utilizes Chain of Thought (COT) to address uncertainties inherent in large language models. \texttt{DreamFactory} generates long, stylistically coherent, and complex videos. Evaluating these long-form videos presents a challenge. We propose novel metrics such as Cross-Scene Face Distance Score and Cross-Scene Style Consistency Score.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current methods for aligning large language models (LLMs) typically aim to reflect general human values and behaviors, but they often fail to capture the unique characteristics and preferences of individual users. To address this gap, we introduce the concept of Personality Alignment. This approach tailors LLMs' responses and decisions to match the specific preferences of individual users or closely related groups. Inspired by psychometrics, we created the Personality Alignment with Personality Inventories (PAPI) dataset, which includes data from 300,000 real subjects, each providing behavioral preferences based on the Big Five Personality Factors. This dataset allows us to quantitatively evaluate the extent to which LLMs can align with each subject's behavioral patterns. Recognizing the challenges of personality alignments: such as limited personal data, diverse preferences, and scalability requirements: we developed an activation intervention optimization method. This method enhances LLMs' ability to efficiently align with individual behavioral preferences using minimal data and computational resources. Remarkably, our method, PAS, achieves superior performance while requiring only 1/5 of the optimization time compared to DPO, offering practical value for personality alignment. Our work paves the way for future AI systems to make decisions and reason in truly personality ways, enhancing the relevance and meaning of AI interactions for each user and advancing human-centered artificial intelligence.The code has released in \url{https://github.com/zhu-minjun/PAlign}.

To contribute to this question, we first argue that neither humans nor LLMs are general learners, in a variety of senses. We make a novel case for how in particular LLMs follow a dual-optimization process: they are optimized during their training (which is typically compared to language acquisition), and modern LLMs have also been selected, through a process akin to natural selection in a species. From this perspective, we argue that the performance of LLMs, whether similar or dissimilar to that of humans, does not weigh easily on important debates about the importance of human cognitive biases for language.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs) struggle with technical standards in telecommunications. We propose a fine-tuned retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system based on the Phi-2 small language model (SLM) to serve as an oracle for communication networks. Our developed system leverages forward-looking semantic chunking to adaptively determine parsing breakpoints based on embedding similarity, enabling effective processing of diverse document formats. To handle the challenge of multiple similar contexts in technical standards, we employ a re-ranking algorithm to prioritize the most relevant retrieved chunks. Recognizing the limitations of Phi-2's small context window, we implement a recent technique, namely SelfExtend, to expand the context window during inference, which not only boosts the performance but also can accommodate a wider range of user queries and design requirements from customers to specialized technicians. For fine-tuning, we utilize the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) technique to enhance computational efficiency during training and enable effective fine-tuning on small datasets. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements over existing question-answering approaches in the telecom domain, achieving performance that exceeds larger language models such as GPT-4 (which is about 880 times larger in size). This work presents a novel approach to leveraging SLMs for communication networks, offering a balance of efficiency and performance. This work can serve as a foundation towards agentic language models for networks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to malicious influence by cyber attackers through intrusions such as adversarial, backdoor, and embedding inversion attacks. In response, the burgeoning field of LLM Security aims to study and defend against such threats. Thus far, the majority of works in this area have focused on monolingual English models, however, emerging research suggests that multilingual LLMs may be more vulnerable to various attacks than their monolingual counterparts. While previous work has investigated embedding inversion over a small subset of European languages, it is challenging to extrapolate these findings to languages from different linguistic families and with differing scripts. To this end, we explore the security of multilingual LLMs in the context of embedding inversion attacks and investigate cross-lingual and cross-script inversion across 20 languages, spanning over 8 language families and 12 scripts. Our findings indicate that languages written in Arabic script and Cyrillic script are particularly vulnerable to embedding inversion, as are languages within the Indo-Aryan language family. We further observe that inversion models tend to suffer from language confusion, sometimes greatly reducing the efficacy of an attack. Accordingly, we systematically explore this bottleneck for inversion models, uncovering predictable patterns which could be leveraged by attackers. Ultimately, this study aims to further the field's understanding of the outstanding security vulnerabilities facing multilingual LLMs and raise awareness for the languages most at risk of negative impact from these attacks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in complex tasks, yet their widespread adoption is impeded by substantial computational demands. With hundreds of billion parameters, transformer-based LLMs necessitate months of pretraining across a high-end GPU cluster. However, this paper reveals a compelling finding: transformers exhibit considerable redundancy in pretraining computations, which motivates our proposed solution, Mixed Sparsity Training (MST), an efficient pretraining method that can reduce about $75\%$ of Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) while maintaining performance. MST integrates dynamic sparse training (DST) with Sparsity Variation (SV) and Hybrid Sparse Attention (HSA) during pretraining, involving three distinct phases: warm-up, ultra-sparsification, and restoration. The warm-up phase transforms the dense model into a sparse one, and the restoration phase reinstates connections. Throughout these phases, the model is trained with a dynamically evolving sparse topology and an HSA mechanism to maintain performance and minimize training FLOPs concurrently. Our experiment on GPT-2 showcases a FLOP reduction of $4\times$ without compromising performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Empowering LLMs with the ability to utilize useful information from a long context is crucial for many downstream applications. However, achieving long context lengths with the conventional transformer architecture requires substantial training and inference resources. In this paper, we present FocusLLM, a framework designed to extend the context length of any decoder-only LLM, enabling the model to focus on relevant information from very long sequences. FocusLLM processes long text inputs by dividing them into chunks based on the model's original context length to alleviate the issue of attention distraction. Then, it appends the local context to each chunk as a prompt to extract essential information from each chunk based on a novel parallel decoding mechanism, and ultimately integrates the extracted information into the local context. FocusLLM stands out for great training efficiency and versatility: trained with an 8K input length with much less training cost than previous methods, FocusLLM exhibits superior performance across downstream long-context tasks and maintains strong language modeling ability when handling extensive long texts, even up to 400K tokens.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As inference on Large Language Models (LLMs) emerges as an important workload in machine learning applications, weight quantization has become a standard technique for efficient GPU deployment. Quantization not only reduces model size, but has also been shown to yield substantial speedups for single-user inference, due to reduced memory movement, with low accuracy impact. Yet, it remains open whether speedups are achievable also in \emph{batched} settings with multiple parallel clients, which are highly relevant for practical serving. It is unclear whether GPU kernels can be designed to remain practically memory-bound, while supporting the substantially increased compute requirements of batched workloads.   This paper resolves this question positively by describing the design of Mixed-precision Auto-Regressive LINear kernels, called MARLIN. Concretely, given a model whose weights are compressed via quantization to, e.g., 4 bits per element, MARLIN shows that batchsizes up to 16-32 can be supported with close to maximum ($4\times$) quantization speedup, and larger batchsizes up to 64-128 with gradually decreasing, but still significant, acceleration. MARLIN accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as asynchronous memory access, complex task scheduling and pipelining, and bespoke quantization support. Our experiments show that MARLIN's near-optimal performance on individual LLM layers across different scenarios can also lead to end-to-end LLM inference speedups (of up to $2.8\times$) when integrated with the popular vLLM serving engine. Finally, MARLIN is extensible to further compression techniques, like NVIDIA 2:4 sparsity, leading to additional speedups.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLM) are evolving and have significantly revolutionized the landscape of software development. If used well, they can significantly accelerate the software development cycle. At the same time, the community is very cautious of the models being trained on biased or sensitive data, which can lead to biased outputs along with the inadvertent release of confidential information. Additionally, the carbon footprints and the un-explainability of these black box models continue to raise questions about the usability of LLMs.   With the abundance of opportunities LLMs have to offer, this paper explores the idea of judging tests used to evaluate compiler implementations of directive-based programming models as well as probe into the black box of LLMs. Based on our results, utilizing an agent-based prompting approach and setting up a validation pipeline structure drastically increased the quality of DeepSeek Coder, the LLM chosen for the evaluation purposes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini have significantly advanced natural language processing, enabling various applications such as chatbots and automated content generation. However, these models can be exploited by malicious individuals who craft toxic prompts to elicit harmful or unethical responses. These individuals often employ jailbreaking techniques to bypass safety mechanisms, highlighting the need for robust toxic prompt detection methods. Existing detection techniques, both blackbox and whitebox, face challenges related to the diversity of toxic prompts, scalability, and computational efficiency. In response, we propose ToxicDetector, a lightweight greybox method designed to efficiently detect toxic prompts in LLMs. ToxicDetector leverages LLMs to create toxic concept prompts, uses embedding vectors to form feature vectors, and employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier for prompt classification. Our evaluation on various versions of the LLama models, Gemma-2, and multiple datasets demonstrates that ToxicDetector achieves a high accuracy of 96.39\% and a low false positive rate of 2.00\%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, ToxicDetector's processing time of 0.0780 seconds per prompt makes it highly suitable for real-time applications. ToxicDetector achieves high accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, making it a practical method for toxic prompt detection in LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have great success in natural language processing tasks such as response generation. However, their use in tabular data has been limited due to their inferior performance compared to traditional machine learning models (TMLs) such as XGBoost. We find that the pre-trained knowledge of LLMs enables them to interpret new variables that appear in a test without additional training, a capability central to the concept of Out-of-Variable (OOV). From the findings, we propose a Language-Based-Classifier (LBC), a classifier that maximizes the benefits of LLMs to outperform TMLs on OOV tasks. LBC employs three key methodological strategies: 1) Categorical changes to adjust data to better fit the model's understanding, 2) Advanced order and indicator to enhance data representation to the model, and 3) Using verbalizer to map logit scores to classes during inference to generate model predictions. These strategies, combined with the pre-trained knowledge of LBC, emphasize the model's ability to effectively handle OOV tasks. We empirically and theoretically validate the superiority of LBC. LBC is the first study to apply an LLM-based model to OOV tasks. The source code is at https://github.com/sksmssh/LBCforOOVGen

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The establishment of bioRxiv facilitated the rapid adoption of preprints in the life sciences, accelerating the dissemination of new research findings. However, the sheer volume of preprints published daily can be overwhelming, making it challenging for researchers to stay updated on the latest developments. Here, I introduce biorecap, an R package that retrieves and summarizes bioRxiv preprints using a large language model (LLM) running locally on nearly any commodity laptop. biorecap leverages the ollamar package to interface with the Ollama server and API endpoints, allowing users to prompt any local LLM available through Ollama. The package follows tidyverse conventions, enabling users to pipe the output of one function as input to another. Additionally, biorecap provides a single wrapper function that generates a timestamped CSV file and HTML report containing short summaries of recent preprints published in user-configurable subject areas. By combining the strengths of LLMs with the flexibility and security of local execution, biorecap represents an advancement in the tools available for managing the information overload in modern scientific research. The biorecap R package is available on GitHub at https://github.com/stephenturner/biorecap under an open-source (MIT) license.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-quality images given a text prompt. However, ensuring the prompt-image alignment remains a considerable challenge, i.e., generating images that faithfully align with the prompt's semantics. Recent works attempt to improve the faithfulness by optimizing the latent code, which potentially could cause the latent code to go out-of-distribution and thus produce unrealistic images. In this paper, we propose FRAP, a simple, yet effective approach based on adaptively adjusting the per-token prompt weights to improve prompt-image alignment and authenticity of the generated images. We design an online algorithm to adaptively update each token's weight coefficient, which is achieved by minimizing a unified objective function that encourages object presence and the binding of object-modifier pairs. Through extensive evaluations, we show FRAP generates images with significantly higher prompt-image alignment to prompts from complex datasets, while having a lower average latency compared to recent latent code optimization methods, e.g., 4 seconds faster than D&B on the COCO-Subject dataset. Furthermore, through visual comparisons and evaluation on the CLIP-IQA-Real metric, we show that FRAP not only improves prompt-image alignment but also generates more authentic images with realistic appearances. We also explore combining FRAP with prompt rewriting LLM to recover their degraded prompt-image alignment, where we observe improvements in both prompt-image alignment and image quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To trust the fluent generations of large language models (LLMs), humans must be able to verify their correctness against trusted, external sources. Recent efforts, such as providing citations via retrieved documents or post-hoc provenance, enhance verifiability but still provide no guarantees on their correctness. To address these limitations, we tackle the verifiability goal with a different philosophy: trivializing the verification process by developing models that quote verbatim statements from trusted sources in pre-training data. We propose Quote-Tuning, and demonstrate it is feasible to align LLMs to provide quoted statements from data memorized during pre-training. The core of Quote-Tuning is a fast membership inference function (Marone and Van Durme, 2023) that efficiently verifies text against a trusted corpus. We leverage this tool to design a reward function to quantify quotes in model responses, which is then used to create a dataset for preference learning. Experimental results show that Quote-Tuning significantly increases verbatim quotes from high-quality pre-training documents by 55% to 130% relative to un-tuned models while maintaining response quality. Quote-Tuning also generalizes quoting to out-of-domain data, is applicable in different tasks, and provides additional benefits to truthfulness. Our method not only serves as a hassle-free method to increase quoting but also opens up avenues for improving LLM trustworthiness through better verifiability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Computing is at a moment of profound opportunity. Emerging applications -- such as capable artificial intelligence, immersive virtual realities, and pervasive sensor systems -- drive unprecedented demand for computer. Despite recent advances toward net zero carbon emissions, the computing industry's gross energy usage continues to rise at an alarming rate, outpacing the growth of new energy installations and renewable energy deployments. A shift towards sustainability is needed to spark a transformation in how computer systems are manufactured, allocated, and consumed. Carbon Connect envisions coordinated research thrusts that produce design and management strategies for sustainable, next-generation computer systems. These strategies must flatten and then reverse growth trajectories for computing power and carbon for society's most rapidly growing applications such as artificial intelligence and virtual spaces. We will require accurate models for carbon accounting in computing technology. For embodied carbon, we must re-think conventional design strategies -- over-provisioned monolithic servers, frequent hardware refresh cycles, custom silicon -- and adopt life-cycle design strategies that more effectively reduce, reuse and recycle hardware at scale. For operational carbon, we must not only embrace renewable energy but also design systems to use that energy more efficiently. Finally, new hardware design and management strategies must be cognizant of economic policy and regulatory landscape, aligning private initiatives with societal goals. Many of these broader goals will require computer scientists to develop deep, enduring collaborations with researchers in economics, law, and industrial ecology to spark change in broader practice.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Safety fine-tuning helps align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences for their safe deployment. To better understand the underlying factors that make models safe via safety fine-tuning, we design a synthetic data generation framework that captures salient aspects of an unsafe input by modeling the interaction between the task the model is asked to perform (e.g., "design") versus the specific concepts the task is asked to be performed upon (e.g., a "cycle" vs. a "bomb"). Using this, we investigate three well-known safety fine-tuning methods -- supervised safety fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and unlearning -- and provide significant evidence demonstrating that these methods minimally transform MLP weights to specifically align unsafe inputs into its weights' null space. This yields a clustering of inputs based on whether the model deems them safe or not. Correspondingly, when an adversarial input (e.g., a jailbreak) is provided, its activations are closer to safer samples, leading to the model processing such an input as if it were safe. We validate our findings, wherever possible, on real-world models -- specifically, Llama-2 7B and Llama-3 8B.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have training corpora containing large amounts of program code, greatly improving the model's code comprehension and generation capabilities. However, sound comprehensive research on detecting program vulnerabilities, a more specific task related to code, and evaluating the performance of LLMs in this more specialized scenario is still lacking. To address common challenges in vulnerability analysis, our study introduces a new benchmark, VulDetectBench, specifically designed to assess the vulnerability detection capabilities of LLMs. The benchmark comprehensively evaluates LLM's ability to identify, classify, and locate vulnerabilities through five tasks of increasing difficulty. We evaluate the performance of 17 models (both open- and closed-source) and find that while existing models can achieve over 80% accuracy on tasks related to vulnerability identification and classification, they still fall short on specific, more detailed vulnerability analysis tasks, with less than 30% accuracy, making it difficult to provide valuable auxiliary information for professional vulnerability mining. Our benchmark effectively evaluates the capabilities of various LLMs at different levels in the specific task of vulnerability detection, providing a foundation for future research and improvements in this critical area of code security. VulDetectBench is publicly available at https://github.com/Sweetaroo/VulDetectBench.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Dexterous robotic manipulation remains a challenging domain due to its strict demands for precision and robustness on both hardware and software. While dexterous robotic hands have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex tasks, efficiently learning adaptive control policies for hands still presents a significant hurdle given the high dimensionalities of hands and tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose Tilde, an imitation learning-based in-hand manipulation system on a dexterous DeltaHand. It leverages 1) a low-cost, configurable, simple-to-control, soft dexterous robotic hand, DeltaHand, 2) a user-friendly, precise, real-time teleoperation interface, TeleHand, and 3) an efficient and generalizable imitation learning approach with diffusion policies. Our proposed TeleHand has a kinematic twin design to the DeltaHand that enables precise one-to-one joint control of the DeltaHand during teleoperation. This facilitates efficient high-quality data collection of human demonstrations in the real world. To evaluate the effectiveness of our system, we demonstrate the fully autonomous closed-loop deployment of diffusion policies learned from demonstrations across seven dexterous manipulation tasks with an average 90% success rate.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Collective intelligence among gig workers yields considerable advantages, including improved information exchange, deeper social bonds, and stronger advocacy for better labor conditions. Especially as it enables workers to collaboratively pinpoint shared challenges and devise optimal strategies for addressing these issues. However, enabling collective intelligence remains challenging, as existing tools often overestimate gig workers' available time and uniformity in analytical reasoning. To overcome this, we introduce GigSense, a tool that leverages large language models alongside theories of collective intelligence and sensemaking. GigSense enables gig workers to rapidly understand and address shared challenges effectively, irrespective of their diverse backgrounds. Our user study showed that GigSense users outperformed those using a control interface in problem identification and generated solutions more quickly and of higher quality, with better usability experiences reported. GigSense not only empowers gig workers but also opens up new possibilities for supporting workers more broadly, demonstrating the potential of large language model interfaces to enhance collective intelligence efforts in the evolving workplace.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) can include sensitive information from individuals and organizations, leading to potential privacy leakage. This work implements Influence Functions (IFs) to trace privacy leakage back to the training data, thereby mitigating privacy concerns of Language Models (LMs). However, we notice that current IFs struggle to accurately estimate the influence of tokens with large gradient norms, potentially overestimating their influence. When tracing the most influential samples, this leads to frequently tracing back to samples with large gradient norm tokens, overshadowing the actual most influential samples even if their influences are well estimated. To address this issue, we propose Heuristically Adjusted IF (HAIF), which reduces the weight of tokens with large gradient norms, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of tracing the most influential samples. To establish easily obtained groundtruth for tracing privacy leakage, we construct two datasets, PII-E and PII-CR, representing two distinct scenarios: one with identical text in the model outputs and pre-training data, and the other where models leverage their reasoning abilities to generate text divergent from pre-training data. HAIF significantly improves tracing accuracy, enhancing it by 20.96\% to 73.71\% on the PII-E dataset and 3.21\% to 45.93\% on the PII-CR dataset, compared to the best SOTA IFs against various GPT-2 and QWen-1.5 models. HAIF also outperforms SOTA IFs on real-world pretraining data CLUECorpus2020, demonstrating strong robustness regardless prompt and response lengths.

Interference in 5G networks challenges high-quality service due to dense user equipment deployment and increased wireless environment complexity. Our CNN-based model is designed to detect Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) sequences amidst various interference scenarios, leveraging the spatial and temporal characteristics of PRACH signals to enhance detection accuracy and robustness. Comprehensive datasets of simulated PRACH signals under controlled interference conditions were generated to train and validate the model. Experimental results show that our CNN-based approach outperforms traditional PRACH detection methods in accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. This study demonstrates the potential of AI/ML techniques in advancing interference management in 5G networks, providing a foundation for future research and practical applications in optimizing network performance and reliability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Penetration testing, a critical component of cybersecurity, typically requires extensive time and effort to find vulnerabilities. Beginners in this field often benefit from collaborative approaches with the community or experts. To address this, we develop CIPHER (Cybersecurity Intelligent Penetration-testing Helper for Ethical Researchers), a large language model specifically trained to assist in penetration testing tasks. We trained CIPHER using over 300 high-quality write-ups of vulnerable machines, hacking techniques, and documentation of open-source penetration testing tools. Additionally, we introduced the Findings, Action, Reasoning, and Results (FARR) Flow augmentation, a novel method to augment penetration testing write-ups to establish a fully automated pentesting simulation benchmark tailored for large language models. This approach fills a significant gap in traditional cybersecurity Q\&A benchmarks and provides a realistic and rigorous standard for evaluating AI's technical knowledge, reasoning capabilities, and practical utility in dynamic penetration testing scenarios. In our assessments, CIPHER achieved the best overall performance in providing accurate suggestion responses compared to other open-source penetration testing models of similar size and even larger state-of-the-art models like Llama 3 70B and Qwen1.5 72B Chat, particularly on insane difficulty machine setups. This demonstrates that the current capabilities of general LLMs are insufficient for effectively guiding users through the penetration testing process. We also discuss the potential for improvement through scaling and the development of better benchmarks using FARR Flow augmentation results. Our benchmark will be released publicly at https://github.com/ibndias/CIPHER.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The integration of large language models (LLMs) in mental health care is an emerging field. There is a need to systematically review the application outcomes and delineate the advantages and limitations in clinical settings. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the use of LLMs in mental health care, assessing their efficacy, challenges, and potential for future applications. A systematic search was conducted across multiple databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, arXiv, medRxiv, and PsyArXiv in November 2023. All forms of original research, peer-reviewed or not, published or disseminated between October 1, 2019, and December 2, 2023, are included without language restrictions if they used LLMs developed after T5 and directly addressed research questions in mental health care settings. From an initial pool of 313 articles, 34 met the inclusion criteria based on their relevance to LLM application in mental health care and the robustness of reported outcomes. Diverse applications of LLMs in mental health care are identified, including diagnosis, therapy, patient engagement enhancement, etc. Key challenges include data availability and reliability, nuanced handling of mental states, and effective evaluation methods. Despite successes in accuracy and accessibility improvement, gaps in clinical applicability and ethical considerations were evident, pointing to the need for robust data, standardized evaluations, and interdisciplinary collaboration. LLMs hold substantial promise for enhancing mental health care. For their full potential to be realized, emphasis must be placed on developing robust datasets, development and evaluation frameworks, ethical guidelines, and interdisciplinary collaborations to address current limitations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 achieving impressive results in function-level code generation, they struggle with repository-scale code understanding (e.g., coming up with the right arguments for calling routines), requiring a deeper comprehension of complex file interactions. Also, recently, people have developed LLM agents that attempt to interact with repository code (e.g., compiling and evaluating its execution), prompting the need to evaluate their performance. These gaps have motivated our development of ML-Bench, a benchmark rooted in real-world programming applications that leverage existing code repositories to perform tasks. Addressing the need for LLMs to interpret long code contexts and translate instructions into precise, executable scripts, ML-Bench encompasses annotated 9,641 examples across 18 GitHub repositories, challenging LLMs to accommodate user-specified arguments and documentation intricacies effectively. To evaluate both LLMs and AI agents, two setups are employed: ML-LLM-Bench for assessing LLMs' text-to-code conversion within a predefined deployment environment, and ML-Agent-Bench for testing autonomous agents in an end-to-end task execution within a Linux sandbox environment. Our findings indicate that while GPT-4o leads with a Pass@5 rate surpassing 50%, there remains significant scope for improvement, highlighted by issues such as hallucinated outputs and difficulties with bash script generation. Notably, in the more demanding ML-Agent-Bench, GPT-4o achieves a 76.47% success rate, reflecting the efficacy of iterative action and feedback in complex task resolution. Our code, dataset, and models are available at https://github.com/gersteinlab/ML-bench.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Commentary provides readers with a deep understanding of events by presenting diverse arguments and evidence. However, creating commentary is a time-consuming task, even for skilled commentators. Large language models (LLMs) have simplified the process of natural language generation, but their direct application in commentary creation still faces challenges due to unique task requirements. These requirements can be categorized into two levels: 1) fundamental requirements, which include creating well-structured and logically consistent narratives, and 2) advanced requirements, which involve generating quality arguments and providing convincing evidence. In this paper, we introduce Xinyu, an efficient LLM-based system designed to assist commentators in generating Chinese commentaries. To meet the fundamental requirements, we deconstruct the generation process into sequential steps, proposing targeted strategies and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for each step. To address the advanced requirements, we present an argument ranking model for arguments and establish a comprehensive evidence database that includes up-to-date events and classic books, thereby strengthening the substantiation of the evidence with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technology. To evaluate the generated commentaries more fairly, corresponding to the two-level requirements, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation metric that considers five distinct perspectives in commentary generation. Our experiments confirm the effectiveness of our proposed system. We also observe a significant increase in the efficiency of commentators in real-world scenarios, with the average time spent on creating a commentary dropping from 4 hours to 20 minutes. Importantly, such an increase in efficiency does not compromise the quality of the commentaries.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mainstream backdoor attacks on large language models (LLMs) typically set a fixed trigger in the input instance and specific responses for triggered queries. However, the fixed trigger setting (e.g., unusual words) may be easily detected by human detection, limiting the effectiveness and practicality in real-world scenarios. To enhance the stealthiness of backdoor activation, we present a new poisoning paradigm against LLMs triggered by specifying generation conditions, which are commonly adopted strategies by users during model inference. The poisoned model performs normally for output under normal/other generation conditions, while becomes harmful for output under target generation conditions. To achieve this objective, we introduce BrieFool, an efficient attack framework. It leverages the characteristics of generation conditions by efficient instruction sampling and poisoning data generation, thereby influencing the behavior of LLMs under target conditions. Our attack can be generally divided into two types with different targets: Safety unalignment attack and Ability degradation attack. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that BrieFool is effective across safety domains and ability domains, achieving higher success rates than baseline methods, with 94.3 % on GPT-3.5-turbo

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Empathetic response generation endows agents with the capability to comprehend dialogue contexts and react to expressed emotions. Previous works predominantly focus on leveraging the speaker's emotional labels, but ignore the importance of emotion cause reasoning in empathetic response generation, which hinders the model's capacity for further affective understanding and cognitive inference. In this paper, we propose a cause-aware empathetic generation approach by integrating emotions and causes through a well-designed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt on Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach can greatly promote LLMs' performance of empathy by instruction tuning and enhancing the role awareness of an empathetic listener in the prompt. Additionally, we propose to incorporate cause-oriented external knowledge from COMET into the prompt, which improves the diversity of generation and alleviates conflicts between internal and external knowledge at the same time. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate that our approach on LLaMA-7b achieves state-of-the-art performance in both automatic and human evaluations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the burgeoning advancements in the field of natural language processing (NLP), the demand for training data has increased significantly. To save costs, it has become common for users and businesses to outsource the labor-intensive task of data collection to third-party entities. Unfortunately, recent research has unveiled the inherent risk associated with this practice, particularly in exposing NLP systems to potential backdoor attacks. Specifically, these attacks enable malicious control over the behavior of a trained model by poisoning a small portion of the training data. Unlike backdoor attacks in computer vision, textual backdoor attacks impose stringent requirements for attack stealthiness. However, existing attack methods meet significant trade-off between effectiveness and stealthiness, largely due to the high information entropy inherent in textual data. In this paper, we introduce the Efficient and Stealthy Textual backdoor attack method, EST-Bad, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Our EST-Bad encompasses three core strategies: optimizing the inherent flaw of models as the trigger, stealthily injecting triggers with LLMs, and meticulously selecting the most impactful samples for backdoor injection. Through the integration of these techniques, EST-Bad demonstrates an efficient achievement of competitive attack performance while maintaining superior stealthiness compared to prior methods across various text classifier datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Model merging is an efficient empowerment technique in the machine learning community that does not require the collection of raw training data and does not require expensive computation. As model merging becomes increasingly prevalent across various fields, it is crucial to understand the available model merging techniques comprehensively. However, there is a significant gap in the literature regarding a systematic and thorough review of these techniques. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of model merging methods and theories, their applications in various domains and settings, and future research directions. Specifically, we first propose a new taxonomic approach that exhaustively discusses existing model merging methods. Secondly, we discuss the application of model merging techniques in large language models, multimodal large language models, and 10+ machine learning subfields, including continual learning, multi-task learning, few-shot learning, etc. Finally, we highlight the remaining challenges of model merging and discuss future research directions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efforts directed towards promoting Open Government Data (OGD) have gained significant traction across various governmental tiers since the mid-2000s. As more datasets are published on OGD portals, finding specific data becomes harder, leading to information overload. Complete and accurate documentation of datasets, including association of proper tags with datasets is key to improving dataset findability and accessibility. Analysis conducted on the Estonian Open Data Portal, revealed that 11% datasets have no associated tags, while 26% had only one tag assigned to them, which underscores challenges in data findability and accessibility within the portal, which, according to the recent Open Data Maturity Report, is considered trend-setter. The aim of this study is to propose an automated solution to tagging datasets to improve data findability on OGD portals. This paper presents Tagify - a prototype of tagging interface that employs large language models (LLM) such as GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 to automate dataset tagging, generating tags for datasets in English and Estonian, thereby augmenting metadata preparation by data publishers and improving data findability on OGD portals by data users. The developed solution was evaluated by users and their feedback was collected to define an agenda for future prototype improvements.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Model (LLM) has demonstrated significant success in a range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks within general domain. The emergence of LLM has introduced innovative methodologies across diverse fields, including the natural sciences. Researchers aim to implement automated, concurrent process driven by LLM to supplant conventional manual, repetitive and labor-intensive work. In the domain of spectral analysis and detection, it is imperative for researchers to autonomously acquire pertinent knowledge across various research objects, which encompasses the spectroscopic techniques and the chemometric methods that are employed in experiments and analysis. Paradoxically, despite the recognition of spectroscopic detection as an effective analytical method, the fundamental process of knowledge retrieval remains both time-intensive and repetitive. In response to this challenge, we first introduced the Spectral Detection and Analysis Based Paper(SDAAP) dataset, which is the first open-source textual knowledge dataset for spectral analysis and detection and contains annotated literature data as well as corresponding knowledge instruction data. Subsequently, we also designed an automated Q\&A framework based on the SDAAP dataset, which can retrieve relevant knowledge and generate high-quality responses by extracting entities in the input as retrieval parameters. It is worth noting that: within this framework, LLM is only used as a tool to provide generalizability, while RAG technique is used to accurately capture the source of the knowledge.This approach not only improves the quality of the generated responses, but also ensures the traceability of the knowledge. Experimental results show that our framework generates responses with more reliable expertise compared to the baseline.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed machine learning but raised significant legal concerns due to their potential to produce text that infringes on copyrights, resulting in several high-profile lawsuits. The legal landscape is struggling to keep pace with these rapid advancements, with ongoing debates about whether generated text might plagiarize copyrighted materials. Current LLMs may infringe on copyrights or overly restrict non-copyrighted texts, leading to these challenges: (i) the need for a comprehensive evaluation benchmark to assess copyright compliance from multiple aspects; (ii) evaluating robustness against safeguard bypassing attacks; and (iii) developing effective defense targeted against the generation of copyrighted text. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a curated dataset to evaluate methods, test attack strategies, and propose lightweight, real-time defense to prevent the generation of copyrighted text, ensuring the safe and lawful use of LLMs. Our experiments demonstrate that current LLMs frequently output copyrighted text, and that jailbreaking attacks can significantly increase the volume of copyrighted output. Our proposed defense mechanism significantly reduces the volume of copyrighted text generated by LLMs by effectively refusing malicious requests.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In-context learning (ICL) has proven to be an effective strategy for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) with no additional training. However, the exact mechanism behind these performance improvements remains unclear. This study is the first to show how ICL surfaces memorized training data and to explore the correlation between this memorization and performance across various ICL regimes: zero-shot, few-shot, and many-shot. Our most notable findings include: (1) ICL significantly surfaces memorization compared to zero-shot learning in most cases; (2) demonstrations, without their labels, are the most effective element in surfacing memorization; (3) ICL improves performance when the surfaced memorization in few-shot regimes reaches a high level (about 40%); and (4) there is a very strong correlation between performance and memorization in ICL when it outperforms zero-shot learning. Overall, our study uncovers a hidden phenomenon -- memorization -- at the core of ICL, raising an important question: to what extent do LLMs truly generalize from demonstrations in ICL, and how much of their success is due to memorization?

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This study investigates the application effectiveness of the Large Language Model (LLMs) ChatGLM in the automated generation of high school information technology exam questions. Through meticulously designed prompt engineering strategies, the model is guided to generate diverse questions, which are then comprehensively evaluated by domain experts. The evaluation dimensions include the Hitting(the degree of alignment with teaching content), Fitting (the degree of embodiment of core competencies), Clarity (the explicitness of question descriptions), and Willing to use (the teacher's willingness to use the question in teaching). The results indicate that ChatGLM outperforms human-generated questions in terms of clarity and teachers' willingness to use, although there is no significant difference in hit rate and fit. This finding suggests that ChatGLM has the potential to enhance the efficiency of question generation and alleviate the burden on teachers, providing a new perspective for the future development of educational assessment systems. Future research could explore further optimizations to the ChatGLM model to maintain high fit and hit rates while improving the clarity of questions and teachers' willingness to use them.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With an evergrowing number of LLMs reporting superlative performance for English, their ability to perform equitably for different dialects of English ($\textit{i.e.}$, dialect robustness) needs to be ascertained. Specifically, we use English language (US English or Indian English) conversations between humans who play the word-guessing game of 'taboo'. We formulate two evaluative tasks: target word prediction (TWP) ($\textit{i.e.}$, predict the masked target word in a conversation) and target word selection (TWS) ($\textit{i.e.}$, select the most likely masked target word in a conversation, from among a set of candidate words). Extending MD3, an existing dialectic dataset of taboo-playing conversations, we introduce M-MD3, a target-word-masked version of MD3 with the en-US and en-IN subsets. We create two subsets: en-MV (where en-US is transformed to include dialectal information) and en-TR (where dialectal information is removed from en-IN). We evaluate one open-source (Llama3) and two closed-source (GPT-4/3.5) LLMs. LLMs perform significantly better for US English than Indian English for both TWP and TWS tasks, for all settings, exhibiting marginalisation against the Indian dialect of English. While GPT-based models perform the best, the comparatively smaller models work more equitably after fine-tuning. Our error analysis shows that the LLMs can understand the dialect better after fine-tuning using dialectal data. Our evaluation methodology exhibits a novel way to examine attributes of language models using pre-existing dialogue datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is crucial for Recommendation System(RS), aiming to provide personalized recommendation services for users in many aspects such as food delivery, e-commerce and so on. However, traditional RS relies on collaborative signals, which lacks semantic understanding to real-time scenes. We also noticed that a major challenge in utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for practical recommendation purposes is their efficiency in dealing with long text input. To break through the problems above, we propose Large Language Model Aided Real-time Scene Recommendation(LARR), adopt LLMs for semantic understanding, utilizing real-time scene information in RS without requiring LLM to process the entire real-time scene text directly, thereby enhancing the efficiency of LLM-based CTR modeling. Specifically, recommendation domain-specific knowledge is injected into LLM and then RS employs an aggregation encoder to build real-time scene information from separate LLM's outputs. Firstly, a LLM is continual pretrained on corpus built from recommendation data with the aid of special tokens. Subsequently, the LLM is fine-tuned via contrastive learning on three kinds of sample construction strategies. Through this step, LLM is transformed into a text embedding model. Finally, LLM's separate outputs for different scene features are aggregated by an encoder, aligning to collaborative signals in RS, enhancing the performance of recommendation model.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Benchmarks that closely reflect downstream application scenarios are essential for the streamlined adoption of new research in tabular machine learning (ML). In this work, we examine existing tabular benchmarks and find two common characteristics of industry-grade tabular data that are underrepresented in the datasets available to the academic community. First, tabular data often changes over time in real-world deployment scenarios. This impacts model performance and requires time-based train and test splits for correct model evaluation. Yet, existing academic tabular datasets often lack timestamp metadata to enable such evaluation. Second, a considerable portion of datasets in production settings stem from extensive data acquisition and feature engineering pipelines. For each specific dataset, this can have a different impact on the absolute and relative number of predictive, uninformative, and correlated features, which in turn can affect model selection. To fill the aforementioned gaps in academic benchmarks, we introduce TabReD -- a collection of eight industry-grade tabular datasets covering a wide range of domains from finance to food delivery services. We assess a large number of tabular ML models in the feature-rich, temporally-evolving data setting facilitated by TabReD. We demonstrate that evaluation on time-based data splits leads to different methods ranking, compared to evaluation on random splits more common in academic benchmarks. Furthermore, on the TabReD datasets, MLP-like architectures and GBDT show the best results, while more sophisticated DL models are yet to prove their effectiveness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces two multilingual systems, IKUN and IKUN-C, developed for the general machine translation task in WMT24. IKUN and IKUN-C represent an open system and a constrained system, respectively, built on Llama-3-8b and Mistral-7B-v0.3. Both systems are designed to handle all 11 language directions using a single model. According to automatic evaluation metrics, IKUN-C achieved 6 first-place and 3 second-place finishes among all constrained systems, while IKUN secured 1 first-place and 2 second-place finishes across both open and constrained systems. These encouraging results suggest that large language models (LLMs) are nearing the level of proficiency required for effective multilingual machine translation. The systems are based on a two-stage approach: first, continuous pre-training on monolingual data in 10 languages, followed by fine-tuning on high-quality parallel data for 11 language directions. The primary difference between IKUN and IKUN-C lies in their monolingual pre-training strategy. IKUN-C is pre-trained using constrained monolingual data, whereas IKUN leverages monolingual data from the OSCAR dataset. In the second phase, both systems are fine-tuned on parallel data sourced from NTREX, Flores, and WMT16-23 for all 11 language pairs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent strides in Large Language Models (LLMs) have saturated many Natural Language Processing (NLP) benchmarks, emphasizing the need for more challenging ones to properly assess LLM capabilities. However, domain-specific and multilingual benchmarks are rare because they require in-depth expertise to develop. Still, most public models are trained predominantly on English corpora, while other languages remain understudied, particularly for practical domain-specific NLP tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel NLP benchmark for the legal domain that challenges LLMs in five key dimensions: processing \emph{long documents} (up to 50K tokens), using \emph{domain-specific knowledge} (embodied in legal texts), \emph{multilingual} understanding (covering five languages), \emph{multitasking} (comprising legal document-to-document Information Retrieval, Court View Generation, Leading Decision Summarization, Citation Extraction, and eight challenging Text Classification tasks) and \emph{reasoning} (comprising especially Court View Generation, but also the Text Classification tasks). Our benchmark contains diverse datasets from the Swiss legal system, allowing for a comprehensive study of the underlying non-English, inherently multilingual legal system. Despite the large size of our datasets (some with hundreds of thousands of examples), existing publicly available multilingual models struggle with most tasks, even after extensive in-domain pre-training and fine-tuning. We publish all resources (benchmark suite, pre-trained models, code) under permissive open CC BY-SA licenses.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced artificial intelligence, excelling in numerous tasks. Although the functionality of a model is inherently tied to its parameters, a systematic method for exploring the connections between the parameters and the functionality are lacking. Models sharing similar structure and parameter counts exhibit significant performance disparities across various tasks, prompting investigations into the varying patterns that govern their performance. We adopted a mutagenesis screen approach inspired by the methods used in biological studies, to investigate Llama2-7b and Zephyr. This technique involved mutating elements within the models' matrices to their maximum or minimum values to examine the relationship between model parameters and their functionalities. Our research uncovered multiple levels of fine structures within both models. Many matrices showed a mixture of maximum and minimum mutations following mutagenesis, but others were predominantly sensitive to one type. Notably, mutations that produced phenotypes, especially those with severe outcomes, tended to cluster along axes. Additionally, the location of maximum and minimum mutations often displayed a complementary pattern on matrix in both models, with the Gate matrix showing a unique two-dimensional asymmetry after rearrangement. In Zephyr, certain mutations consistently resulted in poetic or conversational rather than descriptive outputs. These "writer" mutations grouped according to the high-frequency initial word of the output, with a marked tendency to share the row coordinate even when they are in different matrices. Our findings affirm that the mutagenesis screen is an effective tool for deciphering the complexities of large language models and identifying unexpected ways to expand their potential, providing deeper insights into the foundational aspects of AI systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Safety alignment is indispensable for Large language models (LLMs) to defend threats from malicious instructions. However, recent researches reveal safety-aligned LLMs prone to reject benign queries due to the exaggerated safety issue, limiting their helpfulness. In this paper, we propose a Safety-Conscious Activation Steering (SCANS) method to mitigate the exaggerated safety concerns in aligned LLMs. First, SCANS extracts the refusal steering vectors within the activation space and utilizes vocabulary projection to anchor some specific safety-critical layers which influence model refusal behavior. Second, by tracking the hidden state transition, SCANS identifies the steering direction and steers the model behavior accordingly, achieving a balance between exaggerated safety and adequate safety. Experiments show that SCANS achieves new state-of-the-art performance on XSTest and OKTest benchmarks, without impairing their defense capability against harmful queries and maintaining almost unchanged model capability.

Unlike traditional QA approaches which predominantly rely on unstructured text to formulate responses, DocTabQA aims to leverage structured tables as answers to convey information clearly and systematically, thereby enhancing user comprehension and highlighting relationships between data points. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been previously explored. In this paper, we introduce the QTabA dataset, encompassing 300 financial documents, accompanied by manually annotated 1.5k question-table pairs. Initially, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 to establish a baseline. However, it is widely acknowledged that LLMs encounter difficulties when tasked with generating intricate, structured outputs from long input sequences. To overcome these challenges, we present a two-stage framework, called DocTabTalk, which initially retrieves relevant sentences from extensive documents and subsequently generates hierarchical tables based on these identified sentences. DocTabTalk incorporates two key technological innovations: AlignLLaMA and TabTalk, which are specifically tailored to assist GPT-4 in tackling DocTabQA, enabling it to generate well-structured, hierarchical tables with improved organization and clarity. Comprehensive experimental evaluations conducted on both QTabA and RotoWire datasets demonstrate that our DocTabTalk significantly enhances the performances of the GPT-4 in our proposed DocTabQA task and the table generation task. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/SmileWHC/DocTabQA for further research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> ost recent popular Role-Playing Games (RPGs) allow players to create in-game characters with hundreds of adjustable parameters, including bone positions and various makeup options. Although text-driven auto-customization systems have been developed to simplify the complex process of adjusting these intricate character parameters, they are limited by their single-round generation and lack the capability for further editing and fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose an Interactive Character Editing framework (ICE) to achieve a multi-round dialogue-based refinement process. In a nutshell, our ICE offers a more user-friendly way to enable players to convey creative ideas iteratively while ensuring that created characters align with the expectations of players. Specifically, we propose an Instruction Parsing Module (IPM) that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to parse multi-round dialogues into clear editing instruction prompts in each round. To reliably and swiftly modify character control parameters at a fine-grained level, we propose a Semantic-guided Low-dimension Parameter Solver (SLPS) that edits character control parameters according to prompts in a zero-shot manner. Our SLPS first localizes the character control parameters related to the fine-grained modification, and then optimizes the corresponding parameters in a low-dimension space to avoid unrealistic results. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed ICE for in-game character creation and the superior editing performance of ICE.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Conventional Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) approaches rely on manually crafted interfaces connecting symbolic task planning with continuous motion generation. These domain-specific and labor-intensive modules are limited in addressing emerging tasks in real-world settings. Here, we present LLM^3, a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based TAMP framework featuring a domain-independent interface. Specifically, we leverage the powerful reasoning and planning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs to propose symbolic action sequences and select continuous action parameters for motion planning. Crucially, LLM^3 incorporates motion planning feedback through prompting, allowing the LLM to iteratively refine its proposals by reasoning about motion failure. Consequently, LLM^3 interfaces between task planning and motion planning, alleviating the intricate design process of handling domain-specific messages between them. Through a series of simulations in a box-packing domain, we quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM^3 in solving TAMP problems and the efficiency in selecting action parameters. Ablation studies underscore the significant contribution of motion failure reasoning to the success of LLM^3. Furthermore, we conduct qualitative experiments on a physical manipulator, demonstrating the practical applicability of our approach in real-world settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to evolve, more are being designed to handle long-context inputs. Despite this advancement, most of them still face challenges in accurately handling long-context tasks, often showing the "lost in the middle" issue. We identify that insufficient retrieval capability is one of the important reasons for this issue. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel approach to design training data for long-context tasks, aiming at augmenting LLMs' proficiency in extracting key information from long context. Specially, we incorporate an additional part named "paraphrasing the original text" when constructing the answer of training samples and then fine-tuning the model. Experimenting on LongBench and NaturalQuestions Multi-document-QA dataset with models of Llama and Qwen series, our method achieves an improvement of up to 8.48% and 4.48% in average scores, respectively, showing effectiveness in improving the model' s performance on long-context tasks. The model and training data have been made available on HuggingFace(https://huggingface.co/yuyijiong/Qwen-14b-chat-yarn-32k).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Wind power generation plays a crucial role in transitioning away from fossil fuel-dependent energy sources, contributing significantly to the mitigation of climate change. Monitoring and evaluating the aerodynamics of large wind turbine rotors is crucial to enable more wind energy deployment. This is necessary to achieve the European climate goal of a reduction in net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. This paper presents a comparison between two measurement systems for evaluating the aerodynamic performance of wind turbine rotor blades on a full-scale wind tunnel test. One system uses an array of ten commercial compact ultra-low power micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) pressure sensors placed on the blade surface, while the other employs high-accuracy lab-based pressure scanners embedded in the airfoil. The tests are conducted at a Reynolds number of 3.5 x 10^6, which represents typical operating conditions for wind turbines. MEMS sensors are of particular interest, as they can enable real-time monitoring which would be impossible with the ground truth system. This work provides an accurate quantification of the impact of the MEMS system on the blade aerodynamics and its measurement accuracy. Our results indicate that MEMS sensors, with a total sensing power below 1.6 mW, can measure key aerodynamic parameters like Angle of Attack (AoA) and flow separation with a precision of 1{\deg}. Although there are minor differences in measurements due to sensor encapsulation, the MEMS system does not significantly compromise blade aerodynamics, with a maximum shift in the angle of attack for flow separation of only 1{\deg}. These findings indicate that surface and low-power MEMS sensor systems are a promising approach for efficient and sustainable wind turbine monitoring using self-sustaining Internet of Things devices and wireless sensor networks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, there have been significant advancements in computer vision which have led to the widespread deployment of image recognition and generation systems in socially relevant applications, from hiring to security screening. However, the prevalence of biases within these systems has raised significant ethical and social concerns. The most extensively studied biases in this context are related to gender, race and age. Yet, other biases are equally pervasive and harmful, such as lookism, i.e., the preferential treatment of individuals based on their physical appearance. Lookism remains under-explored in computer vision but can have profound implications not only by perpetuating harmful societal stereotypes but also by undermining the fairness and inclusivity of AI technologies. Thus, this paper advocates for the systematic study of lookism as a critical bias in computer vision models. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify three areas of intersection between lookism and computer vision. We illustrate them by means of examples and a user study. We call for an interdisciplinary approach to address lookism, urging researchers, developers, and policymakers to prioritize the development of equitable computer vision systems that respect and reflect the diversity of human appearances.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As an emerging cloud computing deployment paradigm, serverless computing is gaining traction due to its efficiency and ability to harness on-demand cloud resources. However, a significant hurdle remains in the form of the cold start problem, causing latency when launching new function instances from scratch. Existing solutions tend to use over-simplistic strategies for function pre-loading/unloading without full invocation pattern exploitation, rendering unsatisfactory optimization of the trade-off between cold start latency and resource waste. To bridge this gap, we propose SPES, the first differentiated scheduler for runtime cold start mitigation by optimizing serverless function provision. Our insight is that the common architecture of serverless systems prompts the concentration of certain invocation patterns, leading to predictable invocation behaviors. This allows us to categorize functions and pre-load/unload proper function instances with finer-grained strategies based on accurate invocation prediction. Experiments demonstrate the success of SPES in optimizing serverless function provision on both sides: reducing the 75th-percentile cold start rates by 49.77% and the wasted memory time by 56.43%, compared to the state-of-the-art. By mitigating the cold start issue, SPES is a promising advancement in facilitating cloud services deployed on serverless architectures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are versatile and demonstrate impressive generalization ability by mining and learning information from extensive unlabeled text. However, they still exhibit reasoning mistakes, often stemming from knowledge deficiencies, which can affect their trustworthiness and reliability. Although users can provide diverse and comprehensive queries, obtaining sufficient and effective feedback is demanding. Furthermore, evaluating LLMs comprehensively with limited labeled samples is difficult. This makes it a challenge to diagnose and remedy the deficiencies of LLMs through rich label-free user queries. To tackle this challenge, we propose a label-free curricular meaningful learning framework (LaMer). LaMer first employs relative entropy to automatically diagnose and quantify the knowledge deficiencies of LLMs in a label-free setting. Next, to remedy the diagnosed knowledge deficiencies, we apply curricular meaningful learning: first, we adopt meaningful learning to adaptively synthesize augmentation data according to the severity of the deficiencies, and then design a curricular deficiency remedy strategy to remedy the knowledge deficiencies of LLMs progressively. Experiments show that LaMer efficiently and effectively diagnoses and remedies knowledge deficiencies in LLMs, improving various LLMs across seven out-of-distribution (OOD) reasoning and language understanding benchmarks, achieving comparable results to baselines with just 40\% training data. LaMer even surpasses methods that rely on labeled datasets for deficiency diagnosis. In application, our label-free method can offer an effective knowledge deficiency diagnostic tool for efficient LLM development.

One approach employs large language models (LLMs) to assist developers in generating Kubernetes manifests; however it is currently impossible to determine whether the output satisfies given specifications and is comprehensible. In this study, we proposed a benchmarking method for evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs in synthesizing manifests, using the Compose specification -- a standard widely adopted by application developers -- as input. The proposed benchmarking method revealed that LLMs generally produce accurate results that compensate for simple specification gaps. However, we also observed that inline comments for readability were often omitted, and completion accuracy was low for atypical inputs with unclear intentions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Access to resources strongly constrains the decisions we make. While we might wish to offer every student a scholarship, or schedule every patient for follow-up meetings with a specialist, limited resources mean that this is not possible. When deploying machine learning systems, these resource constraints are simply enforced by varying the threshold of a classifier. However, these finite resource limitations are disregarded by most existing tools for fair machine learning, which do not allow the specification of resource limitations and do not remain fair when varying thresholds. This makes them ill-suited for real-world deployment. Our research introduces the concept of "resource-constrained fairness" and quantifies the cost of fairness within this framework. We demonstrate that the level of available resources significantly influences this cost, a factor overlooked in previous evaluations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are implicit troublemakers. While they provide valuable insights and assist in problem-solving, they can also potentially serve as a resource for malicious activities. Implementing safety alignment could mitigate the risk of LLMs generating harmful responses. We argue that: even when an LLM appears to successfully block harmful queries, there may still be hidden vulnerabilities that could act as ticking time bombs. To identify these underlying weaknesses, we propose to use a cost value model as both a detector and an attacker. Trained on external or self-generated harmful datasets, the cost value model could successfully influence the original safe LLM to output toxic content in decoding process. For instance, LLaMA-2-chat 7B outputs 39.18% concrete toxic content, along with only 22.16% refusals without any harmful suffixes. These potential weaknesses can then be exploited via prompt optimization such as soft prompts on images. We name this decoding strategy: Jailbreak Value Decoding (JVD), emphasizing that seemingly secure LLMs may not be as safe as we initially believe. They could be used to gather harmful data or launch covert attacks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multi-modal Large Language Models have recently experienced rapid developments and excel in various multi-modal tasks. However, they still struggle with mathematical geometric problem solving, which requires exceptional visual perception proficiency. Existing MLLMs mostly optimize the LLM backbone to acquire geometric reasoning capabilities, while rarely emphasizing improvements in visual comprehension. In this paper, we first investigate the visual perception performance of MLLMs when facing geometric diagrams. Our findings reveal that current MLLMs severely suffer from inaccurate geometric perception and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose EAGLE, a novel two-stage end-to-end visual enhancement MLLM framework designed to ElevAte Geometric reasoning through LLM-Empowered visual instruction tuning. Specifically, in the preliminary stage, we feed geometric image-caption pairs into our MLLM that contains a fully fine-tuning CLIP ViT and a frozen LLM, aiming to endow our model with basic geometric knowledge. In the subsequent advanced stage, we incorporate LoRA modules into the vision encoder and unfreeze the LLM backbone. This enables the model to leverage the inherent CoT rationales within question-answer pairs, guiding the MLLM to focus on nuanced visual cues and enhancing its overall perceptual capacity. Moreover, we optimize the cross-modal projector in both stages to foster adaptive visual-linguistic alignments. After the two-stage visual enhancement, we develop the geometry expert model EAGLE-7B. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. For example, on the GeoQA benchmark, EAGLE-7B not only surpasses the exemplary G-LLaVA 7B model by 2.9%, but also marginally outperforms the larger G-LLaVA 13B model. On the MathVista benchmark, EAGLE-7B achieves remarkable 3.8% improvements compared with the proprietary model GPT-4V.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are often English-centric due to the disproportionate distribution of languages in their pre-training data. Enhancing non-English language capabilities through post-pretraining often results in catastrophic forgetting of the ability of original languages. Previous methods either achieve good expansion with severe forgetting or slight forgetting with poor expansion, indicating the challenge of balancing language expansion while preventing forgetting. In this paper, we propose a method called MoE-LPR (Mixture-of-Experts with Language Priors Routing) to alleviate this problem. MoE-LPR employs a two-stage training approach to enhance the multilingual capability. First, the model is post-pretrained into a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture by upcycling, where all the original parameters are frozen and new experts are added. In this stage, we focus improving the ability on expanded languages, without using any original language data. Then, the model reviews the knowledge of the original languages with replay data amounting to less than 1% of post-pretraining, where we incorporate language priors routing to better recover the abilities of the original languages. Evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that MoE-LPR outperforms other post-pretraining methods. Freezing original parameters preserves original language knowledge while adding new experts preserves the learning ability. Reviewing with LPR enables effective utilization of multilingual knowledge within the parameters. Additionally, the MoE architecture maintains the same inference overhead while increasing total model parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate MoE-LPR's effectiveness in improving expanded languages and preserving original language proficiency with superior scalability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Dynamic activation (DA) techniques, such as DejaVu and MoEfication, have demonstrated their potential to significantly enhance the inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs). However, these techniques often rely on ReLU activation functions or require additional parameters and training to maintain performance. This paper introduces a training-free Threshold-based Dynamic Activation(TDA) method that leverage sequence information to exploit the inherent sparsity of models across various architectures. This method is designed to accelerate generation speed by 18-25\% without significantly compromising task performance, thereby addressing the limitations of existing DA techniques. Moreover, we delve into the root causes of LLM sparsity and theoretically analyze two of its critical features: history-related activation uncertainty and semantic-irrelevant activation inertia. Our comprehensive analyses not only provide a robust theoretical foundation for DA methods but also offer valuable insights to guide future research in optimizing LLMs for greater efficiency and effectiveness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To promote sustainable business practices, and to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, the EU has developed the taxonomy of sustainable activities, which describes when exactly business practices can be considered sustainable. While the taxonomy has only been recently established, progressively more companies will have to report how much of their revenue was created via sustainably executed business processes. To help companies prepare to assess whether their business processes comply with the constraints outlined in the taxonomy, we investigate in how far these criteria can be used for conformance checking, that is, assessing in a data-driven manner, whether business process executions adhere to regulatory constraints. For this, we develop a few-shot learning pipeline to characterize the constraints of the taxonomy with the help of an LLM as to the process dimensions they relate to. We find that many constraints of the taxonomy are useable for conformance checking, particularly in the sectors of energy, manufacturing, and transport. This will aid companies in preparing to monitor regulatory compliance with the taxonomy automatically, by characterizing what kind of information they need to extract, and by providing a better understanding of sectors where such an assessment is feasible and where it is not.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Standard Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models have traditionally been trained with Sinusoidal Positional Embeddings (PEs), which are inadequate for capturing long-range dependencies and are inefficient for long-context or document-level translation. In contrast, state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) employ relative PEs, demonstrating superior length generalization. This work explores the potential for efficiently switching the Positional Embeddings of pre-trained NMT models from absolute sinusoidal PEs to relative approaches such as RoPE and ALiBi. Our findings reveal that sinusoidal PEs can be effectively replaced with RoPE and ALiBi with negligible or no performance loss, achieved by fine-tuning on a small fraction of high-quality data. Additionally, models trained without Positional Embeddings (NoPE) are not a viable solution for Encoder-Decoder architectures, as they consistently under-perform compared to models utilizing any form of Positional Embedding. Furthermore, even a model trained from scratch with these relative PEs slightly under-performs a fine-tuned model, underscoring the efficiency and validity of our hypothesis.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate human-level capabilities in dialogue, reasoning, and knowledge retention. However, even the most advanced LLMs face challenges such as hallucinations and real-time updating of their knowledge. Current research addresses this bottleneck by equipping LLMs with external knowledge, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). However, two key issues constrained the development of RAG. First, there is a growing lack of comprehensive and fair comparisons between novel RAG algorithms. Second, open-source tools such as LlamaIndex and LangChain employ high-level abstractions, which results in a lack of transparency and limits the ability to develop novel algorithms and evaluation metrics. To close this gap, we introduce RAGLAB, a modular and research-oriented open-source library. RAGLAB reproduces 6 existing algorithms and provides a comprehensive ecosystem for investigating RAG algorithms. Leveraging RAGLAB, we conduct a fair comparison of 6 RAG algorithms across 10 benchmarks. With RAGLAB, researchers can efficiently compare the performance of various algorithms and develop novel algorithms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Context: Previous studies demonstrate that Machine or Deep Learning (ML/DL) models can detect Technical Debt from source code comments called Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD). Despite the importance of ML/DL in software development, limited studies focus on automated detection for new SATD types: Algorithm Debt (AD). AD detection is important because it helps to identify TD early, facilitating research, learning, and preventing the accumulation of issues related to model degradation and lack of scalability. Aim: Our goal is to improve AD detection performance of various ML/DL models. Method: We will perform empirical studies using approaches: TF-IDF, Count Vectorizer, Hash Vectorizer, and TD-indicative words to identify features that improve AD detection, using ML/DL classifiers with different data featurisations. We will use an existing dataset curated from seven DL frameworks where comments were manually classified as AD, Compatibility, Defect, Design, Documentation, Requirement, and Test Debt. We will explore various word embedding methods to further enrich features for ML models. These embeddings will be from models founded in DL such as ROBERTA, ALBERTv2, and large language models (LLMs): INSTRUCTOR and VOYAGE AI. We will enrich the dataset by incorporating AD-related terms, then train various ML/DL classifiers, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, ROBERTA, and ALBERTv2.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are driving advancements in artificial intelligence by increasing the scale of model parameters, which has significantly enhanced generalization ability and unlocked new capabilities in practice. However, their performance in specific downstream tasks is usually hindered by their knowledge boundaries on these tasks. Thus, fine-tuning techniques, especially the widely used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method, have been introduced to expand the boundaries on these tasks, whereas LoRA would underperform on certain tasks owing to its potential overfitting on these tasks. To overcome this overfitting and improve the performance of LoRA, we propose the flexible low rank adaptation (Flexora) method to automatically and flexibly select the most important layers needing to be fine-tuned to achieve the best performance on different downstream tasks. Specifically, Flexora firstly frames this layer selection problem as a well-defined hyperparameter optimization (HPO) problem, then addresses it using the unrolled differentiation (UD) method, and finally selects the most useful layers based on the optimized hyperparameters. Our extensive experiments on many pretrained models and natural language tasks show that Flexora is able to consistently improve over the existing baselines, indicating the effectiveness of our Flexora in practice. We additionally provide insightful theoretical results and many ablation studies to deliver a comprehensive understanding of our Flexora.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In Business Process Management (BPM), effectively comprehending process models is crucial yet poses significant challenges, particularly as organizations scale and processes become more complex. This paper introduces a novel framework utilizing the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the interpretability of complex process models. We present different methods for abstracting business process models into a format accessible to LLMs, and we implement advanced prompting strategies specifically designed to optimize LLM performance within our framework. Additionally, we present a tool, AIPA, that implements our proposed framework and allows for conversational process querying. We evaluate our framework and tool by i) an automatic evaluation comparing different LLMs, model abstractions, and prompting strategies and ii) a user study designed to assess AIPA's effectiveness comprehensively. Results demonstrate our framework's ability to improve the accessibility and interpretability of process models, pioneering new pathways for integrating AI technologies into the BPM field.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In human reading and communication, individuals tend to engage in geospatial reasoning, which involves recognizing geographic entities and making informed inferences about their interrelationships. To mimic such cognitive process, current methods either utilize conventional natural language understanding toolkits, or directly apply models pretrained on geo-related natural language corpora. However, these methods face two significant challenges: i) they do not generalize well to unseen geospatial scenarios, and ii) they overlook the importance of integrating geospatial context from geographical databases with linguistic information from the Internet. To handle these challenges, we propose GeoReasoner, a language model capable of reasoning on geospatially grounded natural language. Specifically, it first leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate a comprehensive location description based on linguistic and geospatial information. It also encodes direction and distance information into spatial embedding via treating them as pseudo-sentences. Consequently, the model is trained on both anchor-level and neighbor-level inputs to learn geo-entity representation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate GeoReasoner's superiority in three tasks: toponym recognition, toponym linking, and geo-entity typing, compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In large e-commerce platforms, search systems are typically composed of a series of modules, including recall, pre-ranking, and ranking phases. The pre-ranking phase, serving as a lightweight module, is crucial for filtering out the bulk of products in advance for the downstream ranking module. Industrial efforts on optimizing the pre-ranking model have predominantly focused on enhancing ranking consistency, model structure, and generalization towards long-tail items. Beyond these optimizations, meeting the system performance requirements presents a significant challenge. Contrasting with existing industry works, we propose a novel method: a Generalizable and RAnk-ConsistEnt Pre-Ranking Model (GRACE), which achieves: 1) Ranking consistency by introducing multiple binary classification tasks that predict whether a product is within the top-k results as estimated by the ranking model, which facilitates the addition of learning objectives on common point-wise ranking models; 2) Generalizability through contrastive learning of representation for all products by pre-training on a subset of ranking product embeddings; 3) Ease of implementation in feature construction and online deployment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements in both offline metrics and online A/B test: a 0.75% increase in AUC and a 1.28% increase in CVR.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding biological processes, drug development, and biotechnological advancements requires detailed analysis of protein structures and sequences, a task in protein research that is inherently complex and time-consuming when performed manually. To streamline this process, we introduce ProteinGPT, a state-of-the-art multi-modal protein chat system, that allows users to upload protein sequences and/or structures for comprehensive protein analysis and responsive inquiries. ProteinGPT seamlessly integrates protein sequence and structure encoders with linear projection layers for precise representation adaptation, coupled with a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses. To train ProteinGPT, we construct a large-scale dataset of 132,092 proteins with annotations, and optimize the instruction-tuning process using GPT-4o. This innovative system ensures accurate alignment between the user-uploaded data and prompts, simplifying protein analysis. Experiments show that ProteinGPT can produce promising responses to proteins and their corresponding questions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) such as Copilot and ChatGPT have transformed software development by automating coding tasks. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in reducing error rates and fully meeting user expectations. Our empirical study reveals LLMs tend to dilute their self-attention on the initial prompt as more code tokens are generated. We hypothesize this self-attention dilution issue is one of the root causes of inaccuracies in LLM-generated code. To mitigate this issue, we propose Selective Prompt Anchoring (SPA). SPA amplifies the influence of the selected parts in the initial prompt, which we refer to as ``anchored text'', during code generation. Specifically, SPA calculates the logit distribution difference with and without the anchored text. We prove this difference approximates the anchored text's contextual contribution to the output logits. SPA creates an augmented logit distribution by linearly combining the original logit distribution and the logit difference. We evaluate SPA with five LLMs on four benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that using SPA can consistently improve Pass@1 rates by up to 9.7% in all settings. Notably, with selective text anchoring, a small version of DeepSeek-Coder (6.7B) can achieve better performance than an original much larger version (33B). Our code is available at https://github.com/magic-YuanTian/Selective-Prompt-Anchoring.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mercari is the largest C2C e-commerce marketplace in Japan, having more than 20 million active monthly users. Search being the fundamental way to discover desired items, we have always had a substantial amount of data with implicit feedback. Although we actively take advantage of that to provide the best service for our users, the correlation of implicit feedback for such tasks as image quality assessment is not trivial. Many traditional lines of research in Machine Learning (ML) are similarly motivated by the insatiable appetite of Deep Learning (DL) models for well-labelled training data. Weak supervision is about leveraging higher-level and/or noisier supervision over unlabeled data. Large Language Models (LLMs) are being actively studied and used for data labelling tasks. We present how we leverage a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to enable LLM to produce image aesthetics labels that correlate well with human behavior in e-commerce settings. Leveraging LLMs is more cost-effective compared to explicit human judgment, while significantly improving the explainability of deep image quality evaluation which is highly important for customer journey optimization at Mercari. We propose a cost-efficient LLM-driven approach for assessing and predicting image quality in e-commerce settings, which is very convenient for proof-of-concept testing. We show that our LLM-produced labels correlate with user behavior on Mercari. Finally, we show our results from an online experimentation, where we achieved a significant growth in sales on the web platform.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving at an unprecedented pace and have exhibited considerable capability in the realm of natural language processing (NLP) with world knowledge. Benefiting from ultra-large-scale training corpora, a single LLM can manage typical NLP tasks competently. However, its performance in executing reasoning tasks is still confined by the limitations of its internal representations. To push this boundary further, we introduce Corex in this paper, a suite of novel general-purpose strategies that transform LLMs into autonomous agents pioneering multi-model collaborations for complex task-solving. Inspired by human behaviors, Corex is constituted by diverse collaboration paradigms including Debate, Review, and Retrieve modes, which collectively work towards enhancing the factuality, faithfulness, and reliability of the reasoning process. These paradigms foster task-agnostic approaches that enable LLMs to ''think outside the box,'' thereby overcoming hallucinations and providing better solutions. Through extensive experiments across four different types of reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that orchestrating multiple LLMs to work in concert yields substantially better performance compared to existing methods. Further results and in-depth analysis demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our method, facilitating collaboration among different LLMs and promoting annotation efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large-scale data collection is essential for developing personalized training data, mitigating the shortage of training data, and fine-tuning specialized models. However, creating high-quality datasets quickly and accurately remains a challenge due to annotation errors, the substantial time and costs associated with human labor. To address these issues, we propose Automatic Dataset Construction (ADC), an innovative methodology that automates dataset creation with negligible cost and high efficiency. Taking the image classification task as a starting point, ADC leverages LLMs for the detailed class design and code generation to collect relevant samples via search engines, significantly reducing the need for manual annotation and speeding up the data generation process. Despite these advantages, ADC also encounters real-world challenges such as label errors (label noise) and imbalanced data distributions (label bias). We provide open-source software that incorporates existing methods for label error detection, robust learning under noisy and biased data, ensuring a higher-quality training data and more robust model training procedure. Furthermore, we design three benchmark datasets focused on label noise detection, label noise learning, and class-imbalanced learning. These datasets are vital because there are few existing datasets specifically for label noise detection, despite its importance. Finally, we evaluate the performance of existing popular methods on these datasets, thereby facilitating further research in the field.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Breast ultrasound is essential for detecting and diagnosing abnormalities, with radiology reports summarizing key findings like lesion characteristics and malignancy assessments. Extracting this critical information is challenging due to the unstructured nature of these reports, with varied linguistic styles and inconsistent formatting. While proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 are effective, they are costly and raise privacy concerns when handling protected health information. This study presents a pipeline for developing an in-house LLM to extract clinical information from radiology reports. We first use GPT-4 to create a small labeled dataset, then fine-tune a Llama3-8B model on it. Evaluated on clinician-annotated reports, our model achieves an average F1 score of 84.6%, which is on par with GPT-4. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of developing an in-house LLM that not only matches GPT-4's performance but also offers cost reductions and enhanced data privacy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transferable neural architecture search (TNAS) has been introduced to design efficient neural architectures for multiple tasks, to enhance the practical applicability of NAS in real-world scenarios. In TNAS, architectural knowledge accumulated in previous search processes is reused to warm up the architecture search for new tasks. However, existing TNAS methods still search in an extensive search space, necessitating the evaluation of numerous architectures. To overcome this challenge, this work proposes a novel transfer paradigm, i.e., design principle transfer. In this work, the linguistic description of various structural components' effects on architectural performance is termed design principles. They are learned from established architectures and then can be reused to reduce the search space by discarding unpromising architectures. Searching in the refined search space can boost both the search performance and efficiency for new NAS tasks. To this end, a large language model (LLM)-assisted design principle transfer (LAPT) framework is devised. In LAPT, LLM is applied to automatically reason the design principles from a set of given architectures, and then a principle adaptation method is applied to refine these principles progressively based on the new search results. Experimental results show that LAPT can beat the state-of-the-art TNAS methods on most tasks and achieve comparable performance on others.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Planning remains one of the last standing bastions for large language models (LLMs), which now turn their attention to search. Most of the literature uses the language models as world models to define the search space, forgoing soundness for the sake of flexibility. A recent work, Thought of Search (ToS), proposed defining the search space with code, having the language models produce that code. ToS requires a human in the loop, collaboratively producing a sound successor function and goal test. The result, however, is worth the effort: all the tested datasets were solved with 100% accuracy. At the same time LLMs have demonstrated significant progress in code generation and refinement for complex reasoning tasks. In this work, we automate ToS (AutoToS), completely taking the human out of the loop of solving planning problems. AutoToS guides the language model step by step towards the generation of sound and complete search components, through feedback from both generic and domain specific unit tests. We achieve 100% accuracy, with minimal feedback iterations, using LLMs of various sizes on all evaluated domains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have behaved well in generating unit tests for Java projects. However, the performance for covering the complex focal methods within the projects is poor. Complex methods comprise many conditions and loops, requiring the test cases to be various enough to cover all lines and branches. However, existing test generation methods with LLMs provide the whole method-to-test to the LLM without assistance on input analysis. The LLM has difficulty inferring the test inputs to cover all conditions, resulting in missing lines and branches. To tackle the problem, we propose decomposing the focal methods into slices and asking the LLM to generate test cases slice by slice. Our method simplifies the analysis scope, making it easier for the LLM to cover more lines and branches in each slice. We build a dataset comprising complex focal methods collected from the projects used by existing state-of-the-art approaches. Our experiment results show that our method significantly outperforms current test case generation methods with LLMs and the typical SBST method Evosuite regarding both line and branch coverage scores.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent research in neural machine translation (NMT) has shown that training on high-quality machine-generated data can outperform training on human-generated data. This work accompanies the first-ever release of a LLM-generated, MBR-decoded and QE-reranked dataset with both sentence-level and multi-sentence examples. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the quality of our dataset in terms of its downstream impact on NMT model performance. We find that training from scratch on our (machine-generated) dataset outperforms training on the (web-crawled) WMT'23 training dataset (which is 300 times larger), and also outperforms training on the top-quality subset of the WMT'23 training dataset. We also find that performing self-distillation by finetuning the LLM which generated this dataset outperforms the LLM's strong few-shot baseline. These findings corroborate the quality of our dataset, and demonstrate the value of high-quality machine-generated data in improving performance of NMT models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the era of large language models (LLMs), the task of ``System I''~-~the fast, unconscious, and intuitive tasks, e.g., sentiment analysis, text classification, etc., have been argued to be successfully solved. However, sarcasm, as a subtle linguistic phenomenon, often employs rhetorical devices like hyperbole and figuration to convey true sentiments and intentions, involving a higher level of abstraction than sentiment analysis. There is growing concern that the argument about LLMs' success may not be fully tenable when considering sarcasm understanding. To address this question, we select eleven SOTA LLMs and eight SOTA pre-trained language models (PLMs) and present comprehensive evaluations on six widely used benchmark datasets through different prompting approaches, i.e., zero-shot input/output (IO) prompting, few-shot IO prompting, chain of thought (CoT) prompting. Our results highlight three key findings: (1) current LLMs underperform supervised PLMs based sarcasm detection baselines across six sarcasm benchmarks. This suggests that significant efforts are still required to improve LLMs' understanding of human sarcasm. (2) GPT-4 consistently and significantly outperforms other LLMs across various prompting methods, with an average improvement of 14.0\%$\uparrow$. Claude 3 and ChatGPT demonstrate the next best performance after GPT-4. (3) Few-shot IO prompting method outperforms the other two methods: zero-shot IO and few-shot CoT. The reason is that sarcasm detection, being a holistic, intuitive, and non-rational cognitive process, is argued not to adhere to step-by-step logical reasoning, making CoT less effective in understanding sarcasm compared to its effectiveness in mathematical reasoning tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in clinical applications through prompt engineering, which enables the generation of flexible and diverse clinical predictions. However, they pose challenges in producing prediction probabilities, which are essential for transparency and allowing clinicians to apply flexible probability thresholds in decision-making. While explicit prompt instructions can lead LLMs to provide prediction probability numbers through text generation, LLMs' limitations in numerical reasoning raise concerns about the reliability of these text-generated probabilities. To assess this reliability, we compared explicit probabilities derived from text generation to implicit probabilities calculated based on the likelihood of predicting the correct label token. Experimenting with six advanced open-source LLMs across five medical datasets, we found that the performance of explicit probabilities was consistently lower than implicit probabilities with respect to discrimination, precision, and recall. Moreover, these differences were enlarged on small LLMs and imbalanced datasets, emphasizing the need for cautious interpretation and applications, as well as further research into robust probability estimation methods for LLMs in clinical contexts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite prior safety alignment efforts, mainstream LLMs can still generate harmful and unethical content when subjected to jailbreaking attacks. Existing jailbreaking methods fall into two main categories: template-based and optimization-based methods. The former requires significant manual effort and domain knowledge, while the latter, exemplified by Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), which seeks to maximize the likelihood of harmful LLM outputs through token-level optimization, also encounters several limitations: requiring white-box access, necessitating pre-constructed affirmative phrase, and suffering from low efficiency. In this paper, we present ECLIPSE, a novel and efficient black-box jailbreaking method utilizing optimizable suffixes. Drawing inspiration from LLMs' powerful generation and optimization capabilities, we employ task prompts to translate jailbreaking goals into natural language instructions. This guides the LLM to generate adversarial suffixes for malicious queries. In particular, a harmfulness scorer provides continuous feedback, enabling LLM self-reflection and iterative optimization to autonomously and efficiently produce effective suffixes. Experimental results demonstrate that ECLIPSE achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 0.92 across three open-source LLMs and GPT-3.5-Turbo, significantly surpassing GCG in 2.4 times. Moreover, ECLIPSE is on par with template-based methods in ASR while offering superior attack efficiency, reducing the average attack overhead by 83%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized role-playing, enabling the development of general role-playing models. However, current role-playing training has two significant issues: (I) Using a predefined role profile to prompt dialogue training for specific scenarios usually leads to inconsistencies and even conflicts between the dialogue and the profile, resulting in training biases. (II) The model learns to imitate the role based solely on the profile, neglecting profile-dialogue alignment at the sentence level. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective framework called BEYOND DIALOGUE, designed to overcome these hurdles. This framework innovatively introduces "beyond dialogue" tasks to align dialogue with profile traits based on each specific scenario, thereby eliminating biases during training. Furthermore, by adopting an innovative prompting mechanism that generates reasoning outcomes for training, the framework allows the model to achieve fine-grained alignment between profile and dialogue at the sentence level. The aforementioned methods are fully automated and low-cost. Additionally, the integration of automated dialogue and objective evaluation methods forms a comprehensive framework, paving the way for general role-playing. Experimental results demonstrate that our model excels in adhering to and reflecting various dimensions of role profiles, outperforming most proprietary general and specialized role-playing baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The field of emotion recognition of conversation (ERC) has been focusing on separating sentence feature encoding and context modeling, lacking exploration in generative paradigms based on unified designs. In this study, we propose a novel approach, InstructERC, to reformulate the ERC task from a discriminative framework to a generative framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). InstructERC makes three significant contributions: (1) it introduces a simple yet effective retrieval template module, which helps the model explicitly integrate multi-granularity dialogue supervision information. (2) We introduce two additional emotion alignment tasks, namely speaker identification and emotion prediction tasks, to implicitly model the dialogue role relationships and future emotional tendencies in conversations. (3) Pioneeringly, we unify emotion labels across benchmarks through the feeling wheel to fit real application scenarios. InstructERC still perform impressively on this unified dataset. Our LLM-based plugin framework significantly outperforms all previous models and achieves comprehensive SOTA on three commonly used ERC datasets. Extensive analysis of parameter-efficient and data-scaling experiments provides empirical guidance for applying it in practical scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This study explores the potential of Modern Hopfield Networks (MHN) in improving the ability of computer vision models to handle out-of-distribution data. While current computer vision models can generalize to unseen samples from the same distribution, they are susceptible to minor perturbations such as blurring, which limits their effectiveness in real-world applications. We suggest integrating MHN into the baseline models to enhance their robustness. This integration can be implemented during the test time for any model and combined with any adversarial defense method. Our research shows that the proposed integration consistently improves model performance on the MNIST-C dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art increase of 13.84% in average corruption accuracy, a 57.49% decrease in mean Corruption Error (mCE), and a 60.61% decrease in relative mCE compared to the baseline model. Additionally, we investigate the capability of MHN to converge to the original non-corrupted data. Notably, our method does not require test-time adaptation or augmentation with corruptions, underscoring its practical viability for real-world deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly attracting attention in various applications. Nonetheless, there is a growing concern as some users attempt to exploit these models for malicious purposes, including the synthesis of controlled substances and the propagation of disinformation. In an effort to mitigate such risks, the concept of "Alignment" technology has been developed. However, recent studies indicate that this alignment can be undermined using sophisticated prompt engineering or adversarial suffixes, a technique known as "Jailbreak." Our research takes cues from the human-like generate process of LLMs. We identify that while jailbreaking prompts may yield output logits similar to benign prompts, their initial embeddings within the model's latent space tend to be more analogous to those of malicious prompts. Leveraging this finding, we propose utilizing the early transformer outputs of LLMs as a means to detect malicious inputs, and terminate the generation immediately. Built upon this idea, we introduce a simple yet significant defense approach called EEG-Defender for LLMs. We conduct comprehensive experiments on ten jailbreak methods across three models. Our results demonstrate that EEG-Defender is capable of reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by a significant margin, roughly 85\% in comparison with 50\% for the present SOTAs, with minimal impact on the utility and effectiveness of LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The fashion domain encompasses a variety of real-world multimodal tasks, including multimodal retrieval and multimodal generation. The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence generated content, particularly in technologies like large language models for text generation and diffusion models for visual generation, have sparked widespread research interest in applying these multimodal models in the fashion domain. However, tasks involving embeddings, such as image-to-text or text-to-image retrieval, have been largely overlooked from this perspective due to the diverse nature of the multimodal fashion domain. And current research on multi-task single models lack focus on image generation. In this work, we present UniFashion, a unified framework that simultaneously tackles the challenges of multimodal generation and retrieval tasks within the fashion domain, integrating image generation with retrieval tasks and text generation tasks. UniFashion unifies embedding and generative tasks by integrating a diffusion model and LLM, enabling controllable and high-fidelity generation. Our model significantly outperforms previous single-task state-of-the-art models across diverse fashion tasks, and can be readily adapted to manage complex vision-language tasks. This work demonstrates the potential learning synergy between multimodal generation and retrieval, offering a promising direction for future research in the fashion domain.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As Large Language Models (LLMs) push the boundaries of AI capabilities, their demand for data is growing. Much of this data is private and distributed across edge devices, making Federated Learning (FL) a de-facto alternative for fine-tuning (i.e., FedLLM). However, it faces significant challenges due to the inherent heterogeneity among clients, including varying data distributions and diverse task types. Towards a versatile FedLLM, we replace traditional dense model with a sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, whose parallel feed-forward networks enable greater flexibility. To make it more practical in resource-constrained environments, we present FedMoE, the efficient personalized FL framework to address data heterogeneity, constructing an optimal sub-MoE for each client and bringing the knowledge back to global MoE. FedMoE is composed of two fine-tuning stages. In the first stage, FedMoE simplifies the problem by conducting a heuristic search based on observed activation patterns, which identifies a suboptimal submodel for each client. In the second stage, these submodels are distributed to clients for further training and returned for server aggregating through a novel modular aggregation strategy. Meanwhile, FedMoE progressively adjusts the submodels to optimal through global expert recommendation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous personalized FL methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has yielded impressive success in various downstream tasks. However, the vast potential and remarkable capabilities of LLMs also raise new security and privacy concerns if they are exploited for nefarious purposes due to their open-endedness. For example, LLMs may be used to plagiarize or imitate writing, thereby infringing the copyright of the original content, or to create indiscriminate fake information based on a certain source text. In some cases, LLMs can even analyze text from the Internet to infer personal privacy. Unfortunately, previous text protection research could not foresee the emergence of powerful LLMs, rendering it no longer effective in this new context. To bridge this gap, we introduce Silent Guardian (SG), a text protection mechanism against LLMs, which allows LLMs to refuse to generate response when receiving protected text, preventing the malicious use of text from the source. Specifically, we first propose the concept of Truncation Protection Examples (TPE). By carefully modifying the text to be protected, TPE can induce LLMs to first sample the end token, thus directly terminating the interaction. In addition, to efficiently construct TPE in the discrete space of text data, we propose a novel optimization algorithm called Super Tailored Protection (STP), which is not only highly efficient but also maintains the semantic consistency of the text during the optimization process. The comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that SG can effectively protect the target text under various configurations and achieve almost 100% protection success rate in some cases. Notably, SG also exhibits relatively good transferability and robustness, making its application in practical scenarios possible.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Security concerns related to Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively explored, yet the safety implications for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly in medical contexts (MedMLLMs), remain insufficiently studied. This paper delves into the underexplored security vulnerabilities of MedMLLMs, especially when deployed in clinical environments where the accuracy and relevance of question-and-answer interactions are critically tested against complex medical challenges. By combining existing clinical medical data with atypical natural phenomena, we define the mismatched malicious attack (2M-attack) and introduce its optimized version, known as the optimized mismatched malicious attack (O2M-attack or 2M-optimization). Using the voluminous 3MAD dataset that we construct, which covers a wide range of medical image modalities and harmful medical scenarios, we conduct a comprehensive analysis and propose the MCM optimization method, which significantly enhances the attack success rate on MedMLLMs. Evaluations with this dataset and attack methods, including white-box attacks on LLaVA-Med and transfer attacks (black-box) on four other SOTA models, indicate that even MedMLLMs designed with enhanced security features remain vulnerable to security breaches. Our work underscores the urgent need for a concerted effort to implement robust security measures and enhance the safety and efficacy of open-source MedMLLMs, particularly given the potential severity of jailbreak attacks and other malicious or clinically significant exploits in medical settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has seen significant advancements with the development of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, much of this research remains focused on English, often overlooking low-resource languages like Korean. This oversight presents challenges due to the unique non-alphabetic token structure of Korean and the substantial memory and computational demands required for LLM training, which frequently lead to memory constraints and out-of-memory errors. To address these issues, we present RedWhale, a model specifically tailored for Korean language processing. RedWhale is developed using an efficient continual pretraining approach that includes a comprehensive Korean corpus preprocessing pipeline, a specialized tokenizer, an optimized model initialization technique, and a multistage pretraining strategy. These innovations collectively reduce training time and computational costs while maintaining high levels of accuracy and comprehension. By leveraging cross-lingual transfer learning, which exploits shared linguistic similarities across languages, RedWhale builds on English models to enhance Korean language processing. Experimental results demonstrate that RedWhale outperforms other leading models on Korean NLP benchmarks, including the Korean Balanced Evaluation of Significant Tasks (KoBEST), showing superior understanding and generation of Korean text. Furthermore, RedWhale showed no signs of convergence even after pretraining on 9.7 billion tokens, indicating the potential for further improvements with additional training. This work represents a significant advancement in bridging the linguistic divide, particularly in enhancing NLP capabilities for the Korean language.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern data compression methods are slowly reaching their limits after 80 years of research, millions of papers, and wide range of applications. Yet, the extravagant 6G communication speed requirement raises a major open question for revolutionary new ideas of data compression.   We have previously shown all understanding or learning are compression, under reasonable assumptions. Large language models (LLMs) understand data better than ever before. Can they help us to compress data?   The LLMs may be seen to approximate the uncomputable Solomonoff induction. Therefore, under this new uncomputable paradigm, we present LMCompress. LMCompress shatters all previous lossless compression algorithms, doubling the lossless compression ratios of JPEG-XL for images, FLAC for audios, and H.264 for videos, and quadrupling the compression ratio of bz2 for texts. The better a large model understands the data, the better LMCompress compresses.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Matrix quantization compresses matrix elements into a more compact form to reduce storage requirements, with dequantization enabling reconstruction for use. We define the Quantization Error Minimization (QEM) problem as minimizing the difference between the original and quantized matrices while ensuring the quantized matrix remains within fixed memory constraints. This technique is crucial in applications like Large Language Model (LLM) weight compression and KV cache compression, where large matrix sizes demand efficient storage solutions.   As modern LLMs like GPT-4 and BERT continue to grow, effective matrix compression is increasingly important. These models contain billions of parameters in matrix form, making efficient weight quantization essential for both storage and computational efficiency. Similarly, KV caches, storing intermediate inference results, are matrix-based and benefit significantly from optimized compression techniques.   To address the QEM problem in the context of LLM weight and KV cache compression, we propose Quantum Entanglement Trees (QET). QET leverages the local structure of matrix elements by iteratively swapping elements to create a locally ordered matrix, which is then grouped and quantized column by column. To enhance QET, we introduce two optimizations: residual quantization to further reduce Mean Squared Error (MSE) and masking with batch processing to accelerate the algorithm.   Our experiments demonstrate that QET can reduce MSE to 12.3% of its original value at the same compression ratio, outperforming leading baseline methods. Our contributions include framing the QEM problem specifically for LLM and KV cache compression, developing the QET algorithm, and implementing optimizations that improve accuracy and processing speed.
