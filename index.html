                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven the need for increasingly sophisticated inference pipelines and hardware platforms. Modern LLM serving extends beyond traditional prefill-decode workflows, incorporating multi-stage processes such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), key-value (KV) cache retrieval, dynamic model routing, and multi step reasoning. These stages exhibit diverse computational demands, requiring distributed systems that integrate GPUs, ASICs, CPUs, and memory-centric architectures. However, existing simulators lack the fidelity to model these heterogeneous, multi-engine workflows, limiting their ability to inform architectural decisions.   To address this gap, we introduce HERMES, a Heterogeneous Multi-stage LLM inference Execution Simulator. HERMES models diverse request stages; including RAG, KV retrieval, reasoning, prefill, and decode across complex hardware hierarchies. HERMES supports heterogeneous clients executing multiple models concurrently unlike prior frameworks while incorporating advanced batching strategies and multi-level memory hierarchies. By integrating real hardware traces with analytical modeling, HERMES captures critical trade-offs such as memory bandwidth contention, inter-cluster communication latency, and batching efficiency in hybrid CPU-accelerator deployments. Through case studies, we explore the impact of reasoning stages on end-to-end latency, optimal batching strategies for hybrid pipelines, and the architectural implications of remote KV cache retrieval. HERMES empowers system designers to navigate the evolving landscape of LLM inference, providing actionable insights into optimizing hardware-software co-design for next-generation AI workloads.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The comic production industry requires reference-based line art colorization with high accuracy, efficiency, contextual consistency, and flexible control. A comic page often involves diverse characters, objects, and backgrounds, which complicates the coloring process. Despite advancements in diffusion models for image generation, their application in line art colorization remains limited, facing challenges related to handling extensive reference images, time-consuming inference, and flexible control. We investigate the necessity of extensive contextual image guidance on the quality of line art colorization. To address these challenges, we introduce Cobra, an efficient and versatile method that supports color hints and utilizes over 200 reference images while maintaining low latency. Central to Cobra is a Causal Sparse DiT architecture, which leverages specially designed positional encodings, causal sparse attention, and Key-Value Cache to effectively manage long-context references and ensure color identity consistency. Results demonstrate that Cobra achieves accurate line art colorization through extensive contextual reference, significantly enhancing inference speed and interactivity, thereby meeting critical industrial demands. We release our codes and models on our project page: https://zhuang2002.github.io/Cobra/.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LLM inference is essential for applications like text summarization, translation, and data analysis, but the high cost of GPU instances from Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) like AWS is a major burden. This paper proposes InferSave, a cost-efficient VM selection framework for cloud based LLM inference. InferSave optimizes KV cache offloading based on Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and workload charac teristics, estimating GPU memory needs, and recommending cost-effective VM instances. Additionally, the Compute Time Calibration Function (CTCF) improves instance selection accuracy by adjusting for discrepancies between theoretical and actual GPU performance. Experiments on AWS GPU instances show that selecting lower-cost instances without KV cache offloading improves cost efficiency by up to 73.7% for online workloads, while KV cache offloading saves up to 20.19% for offline workloads.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vector processors frequently suffer from inefficient memory accesses, particularly for strided and segment patterns. While coalescing strided accesses is a natural solution, effectively gathering or scattering elements at fixed strides remains challenging. Naive approaches rely on high-overhead crossbars that remap any byte between memory and registers, leading to physical design issues. Segment operations require row-column transpositions, typically handled using either element-level in-place transposition (degrading performance) or large buffer-based bulk transposition (incurring high area overhead). In this paper, we present EARTH, a novel vector memory access architecture designed to overcome these challenges through shifting-based optimizations. For strided accesses, EARTH integrates specialized shift networks for gathering and scattering elements. After coalescing multiple accesses within the same cache line, data is routed between memory and registers through the shifting network with minimal overhead. For segment operations, EARTH employs a shifted register bank enabling direct column-wise access, eliminating dedicated segment buffers while providing high-performance, in-place bulk transposition. Implemented on FPGA with Chisel HDL based on an open-source RISC-V vector unit, EARTH enhances performance for strided memory accesses, achieving 4x-8x speedups in benchmarks dominated by strided operations. Compared to conventional designs, EARTH reduces hardware area by 9% and power consumption by 41%, significantly advancing both performance and efficiency of vector processors.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent large language models (LLMs) face increasing inference latency as input context length and model size continue to grow. In particular, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique, which enhances LLM responses by incorporating external knowledge, exacerbates this issue by significantly increasing the number of input tokens. This expansion in token length leads to a substantial rise in computational overhead, particularly during the prefill stage, resulting in prolonged time-to-first-token (TTFT). To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to reduce TTFT by leveraging a disk-based key-value (KV) cache to lessen the computational burden during the prefill stage. We also introduce a disk-based shared KV cache management system, called Shared RAG-DCache, for multi-instance LLM RAG service environments. This system, together with an optimal system configuration, improves both throughput and latency under given resource constraints. Shared RAG-DCache exploits the locality of documents related to user queries in RAG, as well as the queueing delay in LLM inference services. It proactively generates and stores disk KV caches for query-related documents and shares them across multiple LLM instances to enhance inference performance. In experiments on a single host equipped with 2 GPUs and 1 CPU, Shared RAG-DCache achieved a 15~71% increase in throughput and up to a 12~65% reduction in latency, depending on the resource configuration.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As sixth-generation (6G) networks advance, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into 6G infrastructure to enhance network management and intelligence. However, traditional LLMs architecture struggle to meet the stringent latency and security requirements of 6G, especially as the increasing in sequence length leads to greater task complexity. This paper proposes Edge-Prompt, a cloud-edge collaborative framework based on a hierarchical attention splicing mechanism. EdgePrompt employs distributed key-value (KV) pair optimization techniques to accelerate inference and adapt to network conditions. Additionally, to reduce the risk of data leakage, EdgePrompt incorporates a privacy preserving strategy by isolating sensitive information during processing. Experiments on public dataset show that EdgePrompt effectively improves the inference throughput and reduces the latency, which provides a reliable solution for LLMs deployment in 6G environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Priority queues are used in a wide range of applications, including prioritized online scheduling, discrete event simulation, and greedy algorithms. In parallel settings, classical priority queues often become a severe bottleneck, resulting in low throughput. Consequently, there has been significant interest in concurrent priority queues with relaxed semantics. In this article, we present the MultiQueue, a flexible approach to relaxed priority queues that uses multiple internal sequential priority queues. The scalability of the MultiQueue is enhanced by buffering elements, batching operations on the internal queues, and optimizing access patterns for high cache locality. We investigate the complementary quality criteria of rank error, which measures how close deleted elements are to the global minimum, and delay, which quantifies how many smaller elements were deleted before a given element. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that the MultiQueue outperforms competing approaches across several benchmarks. This includes shortest-path and branch-and-bound benchmarks that resemble real applications. Moreover, the MultiQueue can be configured easily to balance throughput and quality according to the application's requirements. We employ a seemingly paradoxical technique of wait-free locking that might be of broader interest for converting sequential data structures into relaxed concurrent data structures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are indispensable in today's applications, but their inference procedure -- generating responses by processing text in segments and using a memory-heavy Key-Value (KV) cache -- demands significant computational resources, particularly under memory constraints. This paper formulates LLM inference optimization as a multi-stage online scheduling problem where sequential prompt arrivals and KV cache growth render conventional scheduling ineffective. We develop a fluid dynamics approximation to provide a tractable benchmark that guides algorithm design. Building on this, we propose the Waiting for Accumulated Inference Threshold (WAIT) algorithm, which uses multiple thresholds to schedule incoming prompts optimally when output lengths are known, and extend it to Nested WAIT for cases with unknown output lengths. Theoretical analysis shows that both algorithms achieve near-optimal performance against the fluid benchmark in heavy traffic conditions, balancing throughput, latency, and Time to First Token (TTFT). Experiments with the Llama-7B model on an A100 GPU using both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate improved throughput and reduced latency relative to established baselines like vLLM and Sarathi. This work bridges operations research and machine learning, offering a rigorous framework for the efficient deployment of LLMs under memory constraints.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> BLAS is a fundamental building block of advanced linear algebra libraries and many modern scientific computing applications. GPUs are known for their strong arithmetic computing capabilities and are highly suited for BLAS operations. However, porting code to GPUs often requires significant effort, especially for large, complex codes or legacy codes, even for BLAS-heavy applications. While various tools exist to automatically offload BLAS to GPUs, they are often impractical due to the high costs associated with mandatory data transfers. The advent of unified memory architectures in recent GPU designs, such as the NVIDIA Grace-Hopper, allows cache-coherent memory access across all types of memory for both CPU and GPU, potentially eliminating the bottlenecks faced in conventional architectures. This breakthrough paves the way for innovative application developments and porting strategies. Building on our preliminary work demonstrating the potential of automatic *gemm offload, this paper extends the framework to all level-3 BLAS operations and introduces SCILIB-Accel, a novel tool for automatic BLAS offload. SCILIB-Accel leverages the memory coherency in Grace-Hopper and introduces a Device First-Use data movement policy inspired by the OpenMP First-Touch approach in multi-socket CPU programming, minimizing CPU-GPU data transfers for typical scientific computing codes. Additionally, utilizing dynamic binary instrumentation, the tool intercepts BLAS symbols directly from a CPU binary, requiring no code modifications or recompilation. SCILIB-Accel has been evaluated using multiple quantum physics codes on up to a few hundred GPU nodes, yielding promising speedups. Notably, for the LSMS method in the MuST suite, a 3x speedup was achieved on Grace-Hopper compared to Grace-Grace.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Porting codes to GPU often requires major efforts. While several tools exist for automatically offload numerical libraries such as BLAS and LAPACK, they often prove impractical due to the high cost of mandatory data transfer. The new unified memory architecture in NVIDIA Grace-Hopper allows high bandwidth cache-coherent memory access of all memory from both CPU and GPU, potentially eliminating bottleneck faced in conventional architecture. This breakthrough opens up new avenues for application development and porting strategies. In this study, we introduce a new tool for automatic BLAS offload, the tool leverages the high speed cache coherent NVLink C2C interconnect in Grace-Hopper, and enables performant GPU offload for BLAS heavy applications with no code changes or recompilation. The tool was tested on two quantum chemistry or physics codes, great performance benefits were observed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> An essential step for mounting cache attacks is finding eviction sets, collections of memory locations that contend on cache space. On Intel processors, one of the main challenges for identifying contending addresses is the sliced cache design, where the processor hashes the physical address to determine where in the cache a memory location is stored. While past works have demonstrated that the hash function can be reversed, they also showed that it depends on physical address bits that the adversary does not know.   In this work, we make three main contributions to the art of finding eviction sets. We first exploit microarchitectural races to compare memory access times and identify the cache slice to which an address maps. We then use the known hash function to both reduce the error rate in our slice identification method and to reduce the work by extrapolating slice mappings to untested memory addresses. Finally, we show how to propagate information on eviction sets across different page offsets for the hitherto unexplored case of non-linear hash functions.   Our contributions allow for entire LLC eviction set generation in 0.7 seconds on the Intel i7-9850H and 1.6 seconds on the i9-10900K, both using non-linear functions. This represents a significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art techniques taking 9x and 10x longer, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Data-centric ML pipelines extend traditional machine learning (ML) pipelines -- of feature transformations and ML model training -- by outer loops for data cleaning, augmentation, and feature engineering to create high-quality input data. Existing lossless matrix compression applies lightweight compression schemes to numeric matrices and performs linear algebra operations such as matrix-vector multiplications directly on the compressed representation but struggles to efficiently rediscover structural data redundancy. Compressed operations are effective at fitting data in available memory, reducing I/O across the storage-memory-cache hierarchy, and improving instruction parallelism. The applied data cleaning, augmentation, and feature transformations provide a rich source of information about data characteristics such as distinct items, column sparsity, and column correlations. In this paper, we introduce BWARE -- an extension of AWARE for workload-aware lossless matrix compression -- that pushes compression through feature transformations and engineering to leverage information about structural transformations. Besides compressed feature transformations, we introduce a novel technique for lightweight morphing of a compressed representation into workload-optimized compressed representations without decompression. BWARE shows substantial end-to-end runtime improvements, reducing the execution time for training data-centric ML pipelines from days to hours.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> AlayaDB is a cutting-edge vector database system natively architected for efficient and effective long-context inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) at AlayaDB AI. Specifically, it decouples the KV cache and attention computation from the LLM inference systems, and encapsulates them into a novel vector database system. For the Model as a Service providers (MaaS), AlayaDB consumes fewer hardware resources and offers higher generation quality for various workloads with different kinds of Service Level Objectives (SLOs), when comparing with the existing alternative solutions (e.g., KV cache disaggregation, retrieval-based sparse attention). The crux of AlayaDB is that it abstracts the attention computation and cache management for LLM inference into a query processing procedure, and optimizes the performance via a native query optimizer. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AlayaDB via (i) three use cases from our industry partners, and (ii) extensive experimental results on LLM inference benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Microarchitectural attacks are a significant concern, leading to many hardware-based defense proposals. However, different defenses target different classes of attacks, and their impact on each other has not been fully considered. To raise awareness of this problem, we study an interaction between two state-of-the art defenses in this paper, timing obfuscations of remote cache lines (TORC) and delaying speculative changes to remote cache lines (DSRC). TORC mitigates cache-hit based attacks and DSRC mitigates speculative coherence state change attacks.   We observe that DSRC enables coherence information to be retrieved into the processor core, where it is out of the reach of timing obfuscations to protect. This creates an unforeseen consequence that redo operations can be triggered within the core to detect the presence or absence of remote cache lines, which constitutes a security vulnerability. We demonstrate that a new covert channel attack is possible using this vulnerability. We propose two ways to mitigate the attack, whose performance varies depending on an application's cache usage. One way is to never send remote exclusive coherence state (E) information to the core even if it is created. The other way is to never create a remote E state, which is responsible for triggering redos.   We demonstrate the timing difference caused by this microarchitectural defense assumption violation using GEM5 simulations. Performance evaluation on SPECrate 2017 and PARSEC benchmarks of the two fixes show less than 32\% average overhead across both sets of benchmarks. The repair which prevented the creation of remote E state had less than 2.8% average overhead.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The fault characteristics of inverter-based resources (IBRs) are different from conventional synchronous generators. The fault response of IBRs is non-linear due to saturation states and mainly determined by fault ride through (FRT) strategies of the associated voltage source converter (VSC). This results in prohibitively large solution times for power flows considering these short circuit characteristics, especially when the power system states change fast due to uncertainty in IBR generations. To overcome this, a phasor-domain steady state (SS) short circuit (SC) solver for IBR dominated power systems is proposed in this paper, and subsequently the developed IBR models are incorporated with a novel Jacobian-based Power Flow (PF) solver. In this multiphase PF solver, any power system components can be modeled by considering their original non-linear or linear mathematical representations. Moreover, two novel FRT strategies are proposed to fully utilize the converter capacity and to comply with IEEE-2800 2022 std and German grid code. The results are compared with the Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) simulation on the IEEE 34 test network and the 120 kV EPRI benchmark system. The developed IBR sequence domain PF model demonstrates more accurate behavior compared to the classical IBR generator model. The error in calculating the short circuit current with the proposed SC solver is less than 3%, while achieving significant speed improvements of three order of magnitudes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, the Internet has been dominated by content-rich platforms, employing recommendation systems to provide users with more appealing content (e.g., videos in YouTube, movies in Netflix). While traditional content recommendations are oblivious to network conditions, the paradigm of Network-Friendly Recommendations (NFR) has recently emerged, favoring content that improves network performance (e.g. cached near the user), while still being appealing to the user. However, NFR algorithms sometimes achieve their goal by shrinking the pool of content recommended to users. The undesirable side-effect is reduced content diversity, a phenomenon known as ``content/filter bubble''. This reduced diversity is problematic for both users, who are prevented from exploring a broader range of content, and content creators (e.g. YouTubers) whose content may be recommended less frequently, leading to perceived unfairness. In this paper, we first investigate - using real data and state-of-the-art NFR schemes - the extent of this phenomenon. We then formulate a ``Diverse-NFR'' optimization problem (i.e., network-friendly recommendations with - sufficient - content diversity), and through a series of transformation steps, we manage to reduce it to a linear program that can be solved fast and optimally. Our findings show that Diverse-NFR can achieve high network gains (comparable to non-diverse NFR) while maintaining diversity constraints. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that incorporates diversity issues into network-friendly recommendation algorithms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern information retrieval systems often rely on multiple components executed in a pipeline. In a research setting, this can lead to substantial redundant computations (e.g., retrieving the same query multiple times for evaluating different downstream rerankers). To overcome this, researchers take cached "result" files as inputs, which represent the output of another pipeline. However, these result files can be brittle and can cause a disconnect between the conceptual design of the pipeline and its logical implementation. To overcome both the redundancy problem (when executing complete pipelines) and the disconnect problem (when relying on intermediate result files), we describe our recent efforts to improve the caching capabilities in the open-source PyTerrier IR platform. We focus on two main directions: (1) automatic implicit caching of common pipeline prefixes when comparing systems and (2) explicit caching of operations through a new extension package, pyterrier-caching. These approaches allow for the best of both worlds: pipelines can be fully expressed end-to-end, while also avoiding redundant computations between pipelines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this work, we consider the multi-access combinatorial topology with $C$ caches where each user accesses a unique set of $r$ caches. For this setup, we consider secrecy, where each user should not know anything about the files it did not request, and demand privacy, where each user's demand must be kept private from other non-colluding users. We propose a scheme satisfying both conditions and derive a lower bound based on cut-set arguments. Also, we prove that our scheme is optimal when $r\geq C-1$, and it is order-optimal when the cache memory size $M$ is greater than or equal to a certain threshold for $r<C-1$. When $r=1$, in most of the memory region, our scheme achieves the same rate as the one given by the secretive scheme for the dedicated cache setup by Ravindrakumar et al. ( 'Private Coded Caching,' in \textit{IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security}, 2018), while satisfying both secrecy and demand privacy conditions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficient inference of large language models (LLMs) is hindered by an ever-growing key-value (KV) cache, making KV cache compression a critical research direction. Traditional methods selectively evict less important KV cache entries based on attention scores or position heuristics, which leads to information loss and hallucinations. Recently, merging-based strategies have been explored to retain more information by merging KV pairs that would be discarded; however, these existing approaches inevitably introduce inconsistencies in attention distributions before and after merging, causing output perturbation and degraded generation quality. To overcome this challenge, we propose KeepKV, a novel adaptive KV cache merging method designed to eliminate output perturbation while preserving performance under strict memory constraints. KeepKV introduces the Electoral Votes mechanism that records merging history and adaptively adjusts attention scores. Moreover, it further leverages a novel Zero Inference-Perturbation Merging methods, keeping attention consistency and compensating for attention loss resulting from cache merging. KeepKV successfully retains essential context information within a significantly compressed cache. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and LLM architectures demonstrate that KeepKV substantially reduces memory usage, enhances inference throughput by more than 2x and keeps superior generation quality even with 10% KV cache budgets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language tasks, but their inference incurs substantial computational and memory overhead. To improve efficiency, parallel decoding methods like Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT) decompose prompts into sub-problems for concurrent processing. However, these methods significantly compromise answer quality by treating semantically linked sub-problems as independent. We propose Plato, a novel approach that co-designs algorithms and systems for semantic-aware parallel decoding. Plato leverages LLMs to organize sub-problems into a dependency graph based on logical and causal relationships, enabling concurrent decoding of non-dependent nodes while preserving answer coherence and quality. To further enhance efficiency, Plato pipelines planning and node decoding stages, implements a global context cache, and carefully structures node inference prompts to maximize key-value cache reuse and minimize overhead. Our evaluations show that Plato improves throughput by 68% over autoregressive decoding while achieving a 40% net win rate in answer quality. Compared to SoT, Plato demonstrates a remarkable 90% quality net-win rate. Ablation studies reveal that our pipeline design improves speedup by 29%, while our KV cache reuse optimization reduces overhead by 75%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent breakthroughs in large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled various generative tasks on a single model. Real-world services (e.g., OpenAI's ChatGPT [27]) powered by an LLM often concurrently support latency-critical requests for interactive applications (e.g., question-answering systems, referred to as real-time or RT requests) and throughput-oriented requests for back-of-house processing (e.g., documents batch processing [28], referred to best-effort or BE requests), with complex hybrid inference workloads to the underlying model. State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM serving systems dedicate machines to each type of request, towards either low inference latency or high serving throughput, respectively. This practice simplifies request scheduling and management but suffers from poor resource utilization. We propose BROS, a hybrid LLM serving system that aims to collocate RT/BE requests, meeting RT requests' latency requirements while maintaining BE requests' throughput. BROS formulates the problem of hybrid RT/BE request scheduling and solves it with a dynamic priority-based algorithm. BROS designs a bidirectional KV cache management mechanism, allowing RT requests to share KV memory with BE requests to remove the scheduling restrictions caused by insufficient KV memory and improve utilization. Extensive experiments validate that BROS achieves a good trade-off when serving hybrid RT and BE requests. It significantly reduces the latency of RT requests (up to 74.20%), improving their fine-grained service level objectives (SLOs) attainments (up to 36.38x), with negligible throughput reduction for BE requests, showing significant advantages over SOTA systems like vLLM and TGI.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce Block-attention, an attention mechanism designed to address the increased inference latency and cost in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios. Traditional approaches often encode the entire context in an auto-regressive manner. Instead, Block-attention divides retrieved documents into discrete blocks, with each block independently calculating key-value (KV) states except for the final block. In RAG scenarios, by defining each passage as a block, Block-attention enables us to reuse the KV states of passages that have been seen before, thereby significantly reducing the latency and the computation overhead during inference. The implementation of Block-attention involves block segmentation, position re-encoding, and fine-tuning the LLM to adapt to the Block-attention mechanism. Experiments on 11 diverse benchmarks, including RAG, ICL, and general domains, demonstrate that after block fine-tuning, the Block-attention model not only achieves performance comparable to that of full-attention models, but can also seamlessly switch between the block and full attention modes without any performance loss. Notably, Block-attention significantly reduces the time to first token (TTFT) and floating point operations (FLOPs) to a very low level. It only takes 45 ms to output the first token for an input sequence with a total length of 32K. Compared to the full-attention models, the TTFT and corresponding FLOPs are reduced by 98.7% and 99.8%, respectively. Additionally, in Appendix A, we elaborate on how Block-attention is applied in Game AI scenario and the substantial potential benefits it entails. We strongly suggest researchers in the gaming field not to overlook this section.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in generative tasks, yet their iterative denoising process results in slow inference, limiting their practicality. While existing acceleration methods exploit the well-known U-shaped similarity pattern between adjacent steps through caching mechanisms, they lack theoretical foundation and rely on simplistic computation reuse, often leading to performance degradation. In this work, we provide a theoretical understanding by analyzing the denoising process through the second-order Adams-Bashforth method, revealing a linear relationship between the outputs of consecutive steps. This analysis explains why the outputs of adjacent steps exhibit a U-shaped pattern. Furthermore, extending Adams-Bashforth method to higher order, we propose a novel caching-based acceleration approach for diffusion models, instead of directly reusing cached results, with a truncation error bound of only \(O(h^k)\) where $h$ is the step size. Extensive validation across diverse image and video diffusion models (including HunyuanVideo and FLUX.1-dev) with various schedulers demonstrates our method's effectiveness in achieving nearly $3\times$ speedup while maintaining original performance levels, offering a practical real-time solution without compromising generation quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Spin-orbit torques (SOTs) generated in SOT-material/ferromagnet structures are classified as damping-like (DL) and field-like (FL) torques for current-driven magnetization switching. It is well known that both DL- and FL-SOTs originate from the SOT-material and DL-SOT dominates the current-driven switching process while FL-SOT contributes limitedly, resulting in an incubation time (several nanoseconds) during collinear magnetization switching with the spin polarization because of the DL attributes. Here we report a FL-SOT originated from the ferromagnet, different from the origin of DL-SOT, and demonstrate that it dominates the collinear magnetization switching. We show that the FL-SOT and resultant collinear switching can be modulated, one order of magnitude and sign reversal, by controlling the ferromagnet. Because of no incubation time and higher charge-to-spin efficiencies in the FL switching, we further show that the switching time can be down to 200 ps with one order lower critical switching current density compared to DL switching. These results indicate that the FL switching may provide a practical solution for magnetic memory in speed-priority cache applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models have emerged as a powerful approach for multi-modal content creation, offering high efficiency and quality across diverse multimedia applications. However, they face significant memory bottlenecks due to extensive KV cache accumulation during inference. Existing KV cache compression techniques for large language models are suboptimal for VAR models due to, as we identify in this paper, two distinct categories of attention heads in VAR models: Structural Heads, which preserve spatial coherence through diagonal attention patterns, and Contextual Heads, which maintain semantic consistency through vertical attention patterns. These differences render single-strategy KV compression techniques ineffective for VAR models. To address this, we propose HACK, a training-free Head-Aware Compression method for KV cache. HACK allocates asymmetric cache budgets and employs pattern-specific compression strategies tailored to the essential characteristics of each head category. Experiments on Infinity-2B, Infinity-8B, and VAR-d30 demonstrate its effectiveness in text-to-image and class-conditional generation tasks. HACK can hack down up to 50\% and 70\% of cache with minimal performance degradation for VAR-d30 and Infinity-8B, respectively. Even with 70\% and 90\% KV cache compression in VAR-d30 and Infinity-8B, HACK still maintains high-quality generation while reducing memory usage by 44.2\% and 58.9\%, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video Variational Autoencoder (VAE) encodes videos into a low-dimensional latent space, becoming a key component of most Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) to reduce model training costs. However, as the resolution and duration of generated videos increase, the encoding cost of Video VAEs becomes a limiting bottleneck in training LVDMs. Moreover, the block-wise inference method adopted by most LVDMs can lead to discontinuities of latent space when processing long-duration videos. The key to addressing the computational bottleneck lies in decomposing videos into distinct components and efficiently encoding the critical information. Wavelet transform can decompose videos into multiple frequency-domain components and improve the efficiency significantly, we thus propose Wavelet Flow VAE (WF-VAE), an autoencoder that leverages multi-level wavelet transform to facilitate low-frequency energy flow into latent representation. Furthermore, we introduce a method called Causal Cache, which maintains the integrity of latent space during block-wise inference. Compared to state-of-the-art video VAEs, WF-VAE demonstrates superior performance in both PSNR and LPIPS metrics, achieving 2x higher throughput and 4x lower memory consumption while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed on mobile devices, but the limited DRAM capacity constrains the deployable model size. This paper introduces ActiveFlow, the first LLM inference framework that can achieve adaptive DRAM usage for modern LLMs (not ReLU-based), enabling the scaling up of deployable model sizes. The framework is based on the novel concept of active weight DRAM-flash swapping and incorporates three novel techniques: (1) Cross-layer active weights preloading. It uses the activations from the current layer to predict the active weights of several subsequent layers, enabling computation and data loading to overlap, as well as facilitating large I/O transfers. (2) Sparsity-aware self-distillation. It adjusts the active weights to align with the dense-model output distribution, compensating for approximations introduced by contextual sparsity. (3) Active weight DRAM-flash swapping pipeline. It orchestrates the DRAM space allocation among the hot weight cache, preloaded active weights, and computation-involved weights based on available memory. Results show ActiveFlow achieves the performance-cost Pareto frontier compared to existing efficiency optimization methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> SLAM technology plays a crucial role in indoor mapping and localization. A common challenge in indoor environments is the "double-sided mapping issue", where closely positioned walls, doors, and other surfaces are mistakenly identified as a single plane, significantly hindering map accuracy and consistency. To address this issue this paper introduces a SLAM approach that ensures accurate mapping using normal vector consistency. We enhance the voxel map structure to store both point cloud data and normal vector information, enabling the system to evaluate consistency during nearest neighbor searches and map updates. This process distinguishes between the front and back sides of surfaces, preventing incorrect point-to-plane constraints. Moreover, we implement an adaptive radius KD-tree search method that dynamically adjusts the search radius based on the local density of the point cloud, thereby enhancing the accuracy of normal vector calculations. To further improve realtime performance and storage efficiency, we incorporate a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache strategy, which facilitates efficient incremental updates of the voxel map. The code is released as open-source and validated in both simulated environments and real indoor scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach effectively resolves the "double-sided mapping issue" and significantly improves mapping precision. Additionally, we have developed and open-sourced the first simulation and real world dataset specifically tailored for the "double-sided mapping issue".

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as promising tools for automated reinforcement learning (RL) reward design, owing to their robust capabilities in commonsense reasoning and code generation. By engaging in dialogues with RL agents, LLMs construct a Reward Observation Space (ROS) by selecting relevant environment states and defining their internal operations. However, existing frameworks have not effectively leveraged historical exploration data or manual task descriptions to iteratively evolve this space. In this paper, we propose a novel heuristic framework that enhances LLM-driven reward design by evolving the ROS through a table-based exploration caching mechanism and a text-code reconciliation strategy. Our framework introduces a state execution table, which tracks the historical usage and success rates of environment states, overcoming the Markovian constraint typically found in LLM dialogues and facilitating more effective exploration. Furthermore, we reconcile user-provided task descriptions with expert-defined success criteria using structured prompts, ensuring alignment in reward design objectives. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark RL tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed framework. Code and video demos are available at jingjjjjjie.github.io/LLM2Reward.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Investigative workflows require interactive exploratory analysis on large heterogeneous knowledge graphs. Current databases show limitations in enabling such task. This paper discusses the architecture of Siren Federate, a system that efficiently supports exploratory graph analysis by bridging document-oriented, relational and graph models. Technical contributions include distributed join algorithms, adaptive query planning, query plan folding, semantic caching, and semi-join decomposition for path query. Semi-join decomposition addresses the exponential growth of intermediate results in path-based queries. Experiments show that Siren Federate exhibits low latency and scales well with the amount of data, the number of users, and the number of computing nodes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers are integral to program analysis techniques like concolic and symbolic execution, where they help assess the satisfiability of logical formulae to explore execution paths of the program under test. However, frequent solver invocations are still the main performance bottleneck of these techniques. One way to mitigate this challenge is through optimizations such as caching and reusing solver results. While current methods typically focus on reusing results from fully equivalent or closely related formulas, they often miss broader opportunities for reuse. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Cache-a-lot, that extends the reuse of unsatisfiable (unsat) results by systematically considering all possible variable substitutions. This enables more extensive reuse of results, thereby reducing the number of SMT solver invocations and improving the overall efficiency of concolic and symbolic execution. Our evaluation, conducted against the state-of-the-art Utopia solution using two benchmark sets, shows significant improvements, particularly with more complex formulas. Our method achieves up to 74% unsat core reuse, compared to Utopia's 41%, and significant increase in the time savings. These results demonstrate that, despite the additional computational complexity, the broader reuse of unsat results significantly enhances performance, offering valuable advancements for formal verification and program analysis.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language model (LLM) inference serving systems are essential to various LLM-based applications. As demand for LLM services continues to grow, scaling these systems to handle high request rates while meeting latency Service-Level Objectives (SLOs), referred to as effective throughput, becomes critical. However, existing systems often struggle to improve effective throughput, primarily due to a significant decline in Time To First Token (TTFT) SLO attainment. We identify two major causes of this bottleneck: (1) memory-intensive KV cache that limits batch size expansion under GPU memory constraints, and (2) rigid batch composition enforced by the default First-Come-First-Serve scheduling policy. In this paper, we introduce Apt-Serve, a scalable framework designed to enhance effective throughput in LLM inference serving. Apt-Serve features a new hybrid cache scheme that combines KV cache with a memory-efficient hidden cache for reusable input hidden state vectors, allowing large batch sizes and improving request concurrency. Based on the hybrid cache, Apt-Serve employs an adaptive runtime scheduling mechanism that dynamically optimizes batch composition. We formally define the adaptive scheduling optimization problem and propose an efficient algorithm with theoretical guarantees. Extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets and LLMs ranging from 13B to 66B parameters demonstrate that Apt-Serve achieves up to 8.8x improvement in effective throughput compared to the state-of-the-art inference serving systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in various natural language processing (NLP) applications. However, the high memory and computation cost induced by the KV cache limits the inference efficiency, especially for long input sequences. Compute-in-memory (CIM)-based accelerators have been proposed for LLM acceleration with KV cache pruning. However, as existing accelerators only support static pruning with a fixed pattern or dynamic pruning with primitive implementations, they suffer from either high accuracy degradation or low efficiency. In this paper, we propose a ferroelectric FET (FeFET)-based unified content addressable memory (CAM) and CIM architecture, dubbed as UniCAIM. UniCAIM features simultaneous support for static and dynamic pruning with 3 computation modes: 1) in the CAM mode, UniCAIM enables approximate similarity measurement in O(1) time for dynamic KV cache pruning with high energy efficiency; 2) in the charge-domain CIM mode, static pruning can be supported based on accumulative similarity score, which is much more flexible compared to fixed patterns; 3) in the current-domain mode, exact attention computation can be conducted with a subset of selected KV cache. We further propose a novel CAM/CIM cell design that leverages the multi-level characteristics of FeFETs for signed multibit storage of the KV cache and in-place attention computation. With extensive experimental results, we demonstrate UniCAIM can reduce the area-energy-delay product (AEDP) by 8.2-831x over the state-ofthe-art CIM-based LLM accelerators at the circuit level, along with high accuracy comparable with dense attention at the application level, showing its great potential for efficient long-context LLM inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Hybrid models that combine the language modeling capabilities of Attention layers with the efficiency of Recurrent layers (e.g., State Space Models) have gained traction in practically supporting long contexts in Large Language Model serving. Yet, the unique properties of these models complicate the usage of complementary efficiency optimizations such as prefix caching that skip redundant computations across requests. Most notably, their use of in-place state updates for recurrent layers precludes rolling back cache entries for partial sequence overlaps, and instead mandates only exact-match cache hits; the effect is a deluge of (large) cache entries per sequence, most of which yield minimal reuse opportunities. We present Marconi, the first system that supports efficient prefix caching with Hybrid LLMs. Key to Marconi are its novel admission and eviction policies that more judiciously assess potential cache entries based not only on recency, but also on (1) forecasts of their reuse likelihood across a taxonomy of different hit scenarios, and (2) the compute savings that hits deliver relative to memory footprints. Across diverse workloads and Hybrid models, Marconi achieves up to 34.4$\times$ higher token hit rates (71.1% or 617 ms lower TTFT) compared to state-of-the-art prefix caching systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) is a critical operation in many applications. Current multithreaded implementations are based on Gustavson's algorithm and often perform poorly on large matrices due to limited cache reuse by the accumulators. We present MAGNUS (Matrix Algebra for Gigantic NUmerical Systems), a novel algorithm to maximize data locality in SpGEMM. To generate locality, MAGNUS reorders the intermediate product into discrete cache-friendly chunks using a two-level hierarchical approach. The accumulator is applied to each chunk, where the chunk size is chosen such that the accumulator is cache-efficient. MAGNUS is input- and system-aware: based on the matrix characteristics and target system specifications, the optimal number of chunks is computed by minimizing the storage cost of the necessary data structures. MAGNUS allows for a hybrid accumulation strategy in which each chunk uses a different accumulator based on an input threshold. We consider two accumulators: an AVX-512 vectorized bitonic sorting algorithm and classical dense accumulation. An OpenMP implementation of MAGNUS is compared with several baselines, including Intel MKL, for a variety of different matrices on three Intel architectures. For matrices from the SuiteSparse collection, MAGNUS is faster than all the baselines in most cases and is often an order of magnitude faster than at least one baseline. For massive random matrices, MAGNUS scales to the largest matrix sizes, while the baselines do not. Furthermore, MAGNUS is close to the optimal bound for these matrices, regardless of the matrix size, structure, and density.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scaling language models to handle longer input sequences typically necessitates large key-value (KV) caches, resulting in substantial memory overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Tensor Product Attention (TPA), a novel attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions to represent queries, keys, and values compactly, significantly shrinking KV cache size at inference time. By factorizing these representations into contextual low-rank components (contextual factorization) and seamlessly integrating with RoPE, TPA achieves improved model quality alongside memory efficiency. Based on TPA, we introduce the Tensor ProducT ATTenTion Transformer (T6), a new model architecture for sequence modeling. Through extensive empirical evaluation of language modeling tasks, we demonstrate that T6 exceeds the performance of standard Transformer baselines including MHA, MQA, GQA, and MLA across various metrics, including perplexity and a range of renowned evaluation benchmarks. Notably, TPA's memory efficiency enables the processing of significantly longer sequences under fixed resource constraints, addressing a critical scalability challenge in modern language models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to tackle increasingly complex tasks through advanced reasoning, long-form content generation, and tool use. Solving these tasks often involves long inference-time computations. In human problem solving, a common strategy to expedite work is collaboration: by dividing the problem into sub-tasks, exploring different strategies concurrently, etc. Recent research has shown that LLMs can also operate in parallel by implementing explicit cooperation frameworks, such as voting mechanisms or the explicit creation of independent sub-tasks that can be executed in parallel. However, each of these frameworks may not be suitable for all types of tasks, which can hinder their applicability. In this work, we propose a different design approach: we run LLM "workers" in parallel , allowing them to synchronize via a concurrently-updated attention cache and prompt these workers to decide how best to collaborate. Our approach allows the instances to come up with their own collaboration strategy for the problem at hand, all the while "seeing" each other's partial progress in the concurrent cache. We implement this approach via Hogwild! Inference: a parallel LLM inference engine where multiple instances of the same LLM run in parallel with the same attention cache, with "instant" access to each other's generated tokens. Hogwild! inference takes advantage of Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to avoid recomputation while improving parallel hardware utilization. We find that modern reasoning-capable LLMs can perform inference with shared Key-Value cache out of the box, without additional fine-tuning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite the recent success of large language models (LLMs), LLMs are particularly challenging in long-sequence inference scenarios due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention mechanism. Inspired by the interpretability theory of feature attribution in neural network models, we observe that not all tokens have the same contribution. Based on this observation, we propose a novel token pruning framework, namely Saliency-driven Dynamic Token Pruning (SDTP), to gradually and dynamically prune redundant tokens based on the input context. Specifically, a lightweight saliency-driven prediction module is designed to estimate the importance score of each token with its hidden state, which is added to different layers of the LLM to hierarchically prune redundant tokens. Furthermore, a ranking-based optimization strategy is proposed to minimize the ranking divergence of the saliency score and the predicted importance score. Extensive experiments have shown that our framework is generalizable to various models and datasets. By hierarchically pruning 65\% of the input tokens, our method greatly reduces 33\% $\sim$ 47\% FLOPs and achieves speedup up to 1.75$\times$ during inference, while maintaining comparable performance. We further demonstrate that SDTP can be combined with KV cache compression method for further compression.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Application performance of modern day processors is often limited by the memory subsystem rather than actual compute capabilities. Therefore, data throughput specifications play a key role in modeling application performance and determining possible bottlenecks. However, while peak instruction throughputs and bandwidths for local caches are often documented, the achievable throughput can also depend on the relation between memory access and compute instructions. In this paper, we present an Arm version of the well established x86-membench throughput benchmark, which we have adapted to support all current SIMD extensions of the Armv8 instruction set architecture. We describe aspects of the Armv8 ISA that need to be considered in the portable design of this benchmark. We use the benchmark to analyze the memory subsystem at a fine spatial granularity and to unveil microarchitectural details of three processors: Fujitsu A64FX, Ampere Altra and Cavium ThunderX2. Based on the resulting performance information, we show that instruction fetch and decoder widths become a potential bottleneck for cache-bandwidth-sensitive workloads due to the load-store concept of the Arm ISA.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Batch data analytics is a growing application for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs enable users to perform a wide range of natural language tasks, such as classification, entity extraction, and translation, over large datasets. However, LLM inference is highly costly and slow: for example, an NVIDIA L4 GPU running Llama3-8B can only process 6 KB of text per second, taking about a day to handle 15 GB of data; processing a similar amount of data costs around $10K on OpenAI's GPT-4o. In this paper, we propose novel techniques that can significantly reduce the cost of LLM calls for relational data analytics workloads. Our key contribution is developing efficient algorithms for reordering the rows and the fields within each row of an input table to maximize key-value (KV) cache reuse when performing LLM serving. As such, our approach can be easily applied to existing analytics systems and serving platforms. Our evaluation shows that our solution can yield up to 3.4x improvement in job completion time on a benchmark of diverse LLM-based queries using Llama 3 models. Our solution also achieves a 32% cost savings under OpenAI and Anthropic pricing models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Processing long contexts presents a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs). While recent advancements allow LLMs to handle much longer contexts than before (e.g., 32K or 128K tokens), it is computationally expensive and can still be insufficient for many applications. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is considered a promising strategy to address this problem. However, conventional RAG methods face inherent limitations because of two underlying requirements: 1) explicitly stated queries, and 2) well-structured knowledge. These conditions, however, do not hold in general long-context processing tasks.   In this work, we propose MemoRAG, a novel RAG framework empowered by global memory-augmented retrieval. MemoRAG features a dual-system architecture. First, it employs a light but long-range system to create a global memory of the long context. Once a task is presented, it generates draft answers, providing useful clues for the retrieval tools to locate relevant information within the long context. Second, it leverages an expensive but expressive system, which generates the final answer based on the retrieved information. Building upon this fundamental framework, we realize the memory module in the form of KV compression, and reinforce its memorization and cluing capacity from the Generation quality's Feedback (a.k.a. RLGF). In our experiments, MemoRAG achieves superior performances across a variety of long-context evaluation tasks, not only complex scenarios where traditional RAG methods struggle, but also simpler ones where RAG is typically applied.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We consider a system with a local cache connected to a backend server and an end user population. A set of contents are stored at the the server where they continuously get updated. The local cache keeps copies, potentially stale, of a subset of the contents. The users make content requests to the local cache which either can serve the local version if available or can fetch a fresh version or can wait for additional requests before fetching and serving a fresh version. Serving a stale version of a content incurs an age-of-version(AoV) dependent ageing cost, fetching it from the server incurs a fetching cost, and making a request wait incurs a per unit time waiting cost. We focus on the optimal actions subject to the cache capacity constraint at each decision epoch, aiming at minimizing the long term average cost. We pose the problem as a Restless Multi-armed Bandit(RMAB) Problem and propose a Whittle index based policy which is known to be asymptotically optimal. We explicitly characterize the Whittle indices. We numerically evaluate the proposed policy and also compare it to a greedy policy. We show that it is close to the optimal policy and substantially outperforms the exising policies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> An efficient data structure is fundamental to meeting the growing demands in dynamic graph processing. However, the dual requirements for graph computation efficiency (with contiguous structures) and graph update efficiency (with linked list-like structures) present a conflict in the design principles of graph structures. After experimental studies of existing state-of-the-art dynamic graph structures, we observe that the overhead of cache misses accounts for a major portion of the graph computation time. This paper presents GastCoCo, a system with graph storage and coroutine-based prefetch co-design. By employing software prefetching via stackless coroutines and introducing a prefetch-friendly data structure CBList, GastCoCo significantly alleviates the performance degradation caused by cache misses. Our results show that GastCoCo outperforms state-of-the-art graph storage systems by 1.3x - 180x in graph updates and 1.4x - 41.1x in graph computation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Speculative decoding (SD) has been shown to reduce the latency of autoregressive decoding (AD) by 2-3x for small batch sizes. However, increasing throughput and therefore reducing the cost per token requires decoding with large batch sizes. Recent work shows that SD can accelerate decoding with large batch sizes too if the context is sufficiently long and the draft model's KV cache is sparse. We introduce SPIRe, a draft model that combines static sparse attention, pruned initialization, and feedback memory to increase the modeled throughput of speculative decoding by over 100% compared to speculation with a much smaller draft model and by over 35% compared to the strong baseline of sparse self-speculation. Our approach is particularly effective when context lengths vary significantly across requests.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present significant extensions to diffusion-based sequence generation models, blurring the line with autoregressive language models. We introduce hyperschedules, which assign distinct noise schedules to individual token positions, generalizing both autoregressive models (e.g., GPT) and conventional diffusion models (e.g., SEDD, MDLM) as special cases. Second, we propose two hybrid token-wise noising processes that interpolate between absorbing and uniform processes, enabling the model to fix past mistakes, and we introduce a novel inference algorithm that leverages this new feature in a simplified context inspired from MDLM. To support efficient training and inference, we design attention masks compatible with KV-caching. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art perplexity and generate diverse, high-quality sequences across standard benchmarks, suggesting a promising path for autoregressive diffusion-based sequence generation.

We propose a new caching strategy which leverages the continuity of paths of Brownian Motion. In the case of Laplace's equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions, our algorithm has improved asymptotic runtime compared to previous approaches. Until recently, estimates were constructed pointwise and did not use the relationship between solutions at nearby points within a domain. Instead, our results are achieved by passing information from a cache of fixed size. We also provide bounds on the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate its performance on example problems of increasing complexity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> NSGA-III is one of the most widely adopted algorithms for tackling many-objective optimization problems. However, its CPU-based design severely limits scalability and computational efficiency. To address the limitations, we propose {TensorNSGA-III}, a fully tensorized implementation of NSGA-III that leverages GPU parallelism for large-scale many-objective optimization. Unlike conventional GPU-accelerated evolutionary algorithms that rely on heuristic approximations to improve efficiency, TensorNSGA-III maintains the exact selection and variation mechanisms of NSGA-III while achieving significant acceleration. By reformulating the selection process with tensorized data structures and an optimized caching strategy, our approach effectively eliminates computational bottlenecks inherent in traditional CPU-based and na\"ive GPU implementations. Experimental results on widely used numerical benchmarks show that TensorNSGA-III achieves speedups of up to $3629\times$ over the CPU version of NSGA-III. Additionally, we validate its effectiveness in multiobjective robotic control tasks, where it discovers diverse and high-quality behavioral solutions. Furthermore, we investigate the critical role of large population sizes in many-objective optimization and demonstrate the scalability of TensorNSGA-III in such scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional performance but incur significant serving costs due to their substantial memory requirements, with the key-value (KV) cache being a primary bottleneck. Existing KV cache compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning, apply uniform treatment to both keys and values, and discard unimportant tokens entirely, overlooking the fine-grained differences in significance of various components within the KV cache. To address these limitations, we introduce LeanKV, a framework that advances KV cache compression by exploiting three levels of differentiation in the KV cache: (1) the differing impact of keys and values on attention computation, (2) the varying importance of tokens, and (3) the diverse dynamic sparsity patterns across attention heads. At the core of LeanKV is an on-GPU memory manager that compacts fragmented free memory list into contiguous regions in parallel, effectively translating sparsity in the KV cache into performance gains. We evaluate LeanKV on several mainstream models, including the recent "thinking model". LeanKV is able to compress the KV cache by $2.7\times$ to $5.7\times$ with near-lossless accuracy on complex workloads requiring sophisticated reasoning and long-generation capabilities, and enhances throughput by $1.9\times$ to $5.4\times$.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rapid growth of mobile data traffic and the increasing prevalence of video streaming, proactive content caching in edge computing has become crucial for reducing latency and alleviating network congestion. However, traditional caching strategies such as FIFO, LRU, and LFU fail to effectively predict future content popularity, while existing proactive caching approaches often require users to upload data to a central server, raising concerns regarding privacy and scalability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Graph Federated Learning-based Proactive Content Caching (GFPCC) scheme that enhances caching efficiency while preserving user privacy. The proposed approach integrates federated learning and graph neural networks, enabling users to locally train Light Graph Convolutional Networks (LightGCN) to capture user-item relationships and predict content popularity. Instead of sharing raw data, only the trained model parameters are transmitted to the central server, where a federated averaging algorithm aggregates updates, refines the global model, and selects the most popular files for proactive caching. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets, such as MovieLens, demonstrate that GFPCC outperforms baseline caching algorithms by achieving higher cache efficiency through more accurate content popularity predictions. Moreover, the federated learning framework strengthens privacy protection while maintaining efficient model training; however, scalability remains a challenge in large-scale networks with dynamic user preferences.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has demonstrated significant advantages as it enables to increase the model capacity without a proportional increase in computation. However, the large MoE model size still introduces substantial memory demands, which usually requires expert offloading on resource-constrained platforms and incurs significant overhead. Hybrid CPU-GPU inference has been proposed to leverage CPU computation to reduce expert loading overhead but faces major challenges: on one hand, the expert activation patterns of MoE models are highly unstable, rendering the fixed mapping strategies in existing works inefficient; on the other hand, the hybrid CPU-GPU schedule for MoE is inherently complex due to the diverse expert sizes, structures, uneven workload distribution, etc. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose HybriMoE, a hybrid CPU-GPU inference framework that improves resource utilization through a novel CPU-GPU scheduling and cache management system. HybriMoE introduces (i) a dynamic intra-layer scheduling strategy to balance workloads across CPU and GPU, (ii) an impact-driven inter-layer prefetching algorithm, and (iii) a score-based caching algorithm to mitigate expert activation instability. We implement HybriMoE on top of the kTransformers framework and evaluate it on three widely used MoE-based LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that HybriMoE achieves an average speedup of 1.33$\times$ in the prefill stage and 1.70$\times$ in the decode stage compared to state-of-the-art hybrid MoE inference framework.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit pronounced memory-bound characteristics during inference due to High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) bandwidth constraints. In this paper, we propose an L2 Cache-oriented asynchronous KV Cache prefetching method to break through the memory bandwidth bottleneck in LLM inference through computation-load overlap. By strategically scheduling idle memory bandwidth during active computation windows, our method proactively prefetches required KV Cache into GPU L2 cache, enabling high-speed L2 cache hits for subsequent accesses and effectively hiding HBM access latency within computational cycles. Extensive experiments on NVIDIA H20 GPUs demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 2.15x improvement in attention kernel efficiency and up to 1.97x end-to-end throughput enhancement, surpassing state-of-the-art baseline FlashAttention-3. Notably, our solution maintains orthogonality to existing optimization techniques and can be integrated with current inference frameworks, providing a scalable latency-hiding solution for next-generation LLM inference engines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> For a two-hop IoT system consisting of multiple energy harvesting sensors, a cache-enabled edge node, and multiple monitors, the status update control at the edge node, which has partial battery state information (pBSI) of the sensors, is formulated as a pBSI problem. The concept of inferred pBSI is introduced to reduce the noiseless single-sensor pBSI problem to a Markov decision process with a moderate state-space size, enabling the optimal policy to be obtained through a value iteration algorithm. A lower bound on the expected time-average on-demand age of information performance is established for the general single-sensor status update problem. For the single-sensor pBSI problem, a semi-closed-form policy called the current-next (CN) policy is proposed, along with an efficient post-update value iteration algorithm with a per-iteration time complexity proportional to the square of the battery capacity. A weighted-update-gain-competition (WUGC) approach is further leveraged to extend the CN policy to the multi-sensor case. Numerical results in the single-sensor case demonstrate the near-optimal performance of the CN policy across various energy arrival processes. Simulations for an IoT system with $100$ sensors reveal that the WUGC-CN policy outperforms the maximum-age-first policy and the random-scheduling-based CN policy under Bernoulli energy arrival processes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing complexity of autonomous systems has driven a shift to integrated heterogeneous SoCs with real-time and safety demands. Ensuring deterministic WCETs and low-latency for critical tasks requires minimizing interference on shared resources like virtual memory. Existing techniques, such as software coloring and memory replication, introduce significant area and performance overhead, especially with virtualized memory where address translation adds latency uncertainty. To address these limitations, we propose CVA6-VMRT, an extension of the open-source RISC-V CVA6 core, adding hardware support for predictability in virtual memory access with minimal area overhead. CVA6-VMRT features dynamically partitioned Translation Look-aside Buffers (TLBs) and hybrid L1 cache/scratchpad memory (SPM) functionality. It allows fine-grained per-thread control of resources, enabling the operating system to manage TLB replacements, including static overwrites, to ensure single-cycle address translation for critical memory regions. Additionally, CVA6-VMRT enables runtime partitioning of data and instruction caches into cache and SPM sections, providing low and predictable access times for critical data without impacting other accesses. In a virtualized setting, CVA6-VMRT enhances execution time determinism for critical guests by 94% during interference from non-critical guests, with minimal impact on their average absolute execution time compared to isolated execution of the critical guests only. This interference-aware behaviour is achieved with just a 4% area overhead and no timing penalty compared to the baseline CVA6 core.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Addressing the inherent low acquisition frequency limitation of 3D LiDAR to achieve high-frequency output has become a critical research focus in the LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) domain. To ensure real-time performance, frequency-enhanced LIO systems must process each sweep within significantly reduced timeframe, which presents substantial challenges for deployment on low-computational-power platforms. To address these limitations, we introduce SR-LIO++, an innovative LIO system capable of achieving doubled output frequency relative to input frequency on resource-constrained hardware platforms, including the Raspberry Pi 4B. Our system employs a sweep reconstruction methodology to enhance LiDAR sweep frequency, generating high-frequency reconstructed sweeps. Building upon this foundation, we propose a caching mechanism for intermediate results (i.e., surface parameters) of the most recent segments, effectively minimizing redundant processing of common segments in adjacent reconstructed sweeps. This method decouples processing time from the traditionally linear dependence on reconstructed sweep frequency. Furthermore, we present a quantized map point management based on index table mapping, significantly reducing memory usage by converting global 3D point storage from 64-bit double precision to 8-bit char representation. This method also converts the computationally intensive Euclidean distance calculations in nearest neighbor searches from 64-bit double precision to 16-bit short and 32-bit integer formats, significantly reducing both memory and computational cost. Extensive experimental evaluations across three distinct computing platforms and four public datasets demonstrate that SR-LIO++ maintains state-of-the-art accuracy while substantially enhancing efficiency. Notably, our system successfully achieves 20Hz state output on Raspberry Pi 4B hardware.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized for complex tasks requiring longer context lengths, with some models supporting up to 128K or 1M tokens. This trend, however, presents significant challenges in inference speed and memory management. Quantization emerges as a promising approach to address the widening gap between LLM size and memory capacity. However, traditional quantization schemes often yield suboptimal compression results for KV caches due to two key factors: i) On-the-fly quantization and de-quantization, causing significant performance overhead; ii) Prevalence of outliers in KV values, challenging low-bitwidth uniform quantization. To this end, we propose MILLION, a novel quantization framework achieving low-bitwidth KV cache through product quantization. First, we conduct a thorough analysis of KV cache distribution, revealing the limitations of existing quantization schemes. Second, we introduce a non-uniform quantization algorithm based on product quantization, which efficiently compresses data while preserving accuracy. Third, we develop a high-performance GPU inference framework with efficient attention kernel and pipeline design for MILLION that leverages sparse computation and asynchronous quantization, significantly enhancing inference speed. Comprehensive evaluation results demonstrate that MILLION can achieve 4 bits quantization with trivial perplexity and accuracy loss, and achieve 2.09x end-to-end performance gains at 32K context length.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Attention mechanisms have revolutionized sequence learning but suffer from quadratic computational complexity. This paper introduces Lattice, a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) mechanism that leverages the inherent low-rank structure of K-V matrices to efficiently compress the cache into a fixed number of memory slots, achieving sub-quadratic complexity. We formulate this compression as an online optimization problem and derive a dynamic memory update rule based on a single gradient descent step. The resulting recurrence features a state- and input-dependent gating mechanism, offering an interpretable memory update process. The core innovation is the orthogonal update: each memory slot is updated exclusively with information orthogonal to its current state hence incorporation of only novel, non-redundant data, which minimizes the interference with previously stored information. The experimental results show that Lattice achieves the best perplexity compared to all baselines across diverse context lengths, with performance improvement becoming more pronounced as the context length increases.

Accelerators improve performance but lack flexibility and require data transfers. Existing compute in- and near-memory solutions mitigate these issues but face usability challenges due to data placement constraints. We propose a novel cache architecture that doubles as a tightly-coupled compute-near-memory coprocessor. Our RISC-V cache controller executes custom instructions from the host CPU using vector operations dispatched to near-memory vector processing units within the cache memory subsystem. This architecture abstracts memory synchronization and data mapping from application software while offering software-based Instruction Set Architecture extensibility. Our implementation shows $30\times$ to $84\times$ performance improvement when operating on 8-bit data over the same system with a traditional cache when executing a worst-case 32-bit CNN workload, with only $41.3\%$ area overhead.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Most log-based anomaly detectors assume logs are stable, though logs are often unstable due to software or environmental changes. Anomaly detection on unstable logs (ULAD) is therefore a more realistic, yet under-investigated challenge. Current approaches predominantly employ machine learning (ML) models, which often require extensive labeled data for training. To mitigate data insufficiency, we propose FlexLog, a novel hybrid approach for ULAD that combines ML models -- decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, and a feedforward neural network -- with a Large Language Model (Mistral) through ensemble learning. FlexLog also incorporates a cache and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to further enhance efficiency and effectiveness. To evaluate FlexLog, we configured four datasets for ULAD, namely ADFA-U, LOGEVOL-U, SynHDFS-U, and SYNEVOL-U. FlexLog outperforms all baselines by at least 1.2 percentage points in F1 score while using 62.87 percentage points less labeled data. When trained on the same amount of data as the baselines, FlexLog achieves up to a 13 percentage points increase in F1 score on ADFA-U across varying training dataset sizes. Additionally, FlexLog maintains inference time under one second per log sequence, making it suitable for most applications except latency-sensitive systems. Further analysis reveals the positive impact of FlexLog's key components: cache, RAG and ensemble learning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Test-time scaling has emerged as a prominent research direction in machine learning, enabling models to enhance their expressive capabilities during inference.Transformers, renowned for striking a delicate balance between efficiency and expressiveness, have benefited from test-time scaling techniques that leverage an expanding key-value (KV) cache to significantly improve performance.In this paper, we introduce a novel state-based approach to test-time scaling, which we term state tuning, tailored to the RNN-based RWKV-7 model.By exploiting the unique strengths of RWKV-7, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the target task without altering the model's pre-trained weights. Our approach centers on three key innovations. First, we develop an observer framework that allows a smaller model to replicate and learn the state dynamics of the RWKV-7 model. Second, we employ a kernel method to dynamically upscale the state size, enhancing the model's capacity to capture intricate patterns. Third, we integrate Decorrelated Backpropagation (DBP) to optimize the upscaled state matrix, thereby improving convergence and expressivity. By tuning only the state matrix, we demonstrate that a smaller model can outperform larger models on the given task. This method preserves the efficiency of the original RWKV-7 architecture while harnessing the power of test-time scaling to deliver superior results. Our findings underscore the potential of state tuning as an effective strategy for advancing model performance in resource-constrained settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex tasks, but their extended chain-of-thought reasoning process increases inference overhead. While quantization has been widely adopted to reduce the inference cost of large language models, its impact on reasoning models remains understudied. In this study, we conduct the first systematic study on quantized reasoning models, evaluating the open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Distilled Qwen and LLaMA families ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters, and QwQ-32B. Our investigation covers weight, KV cache, and activation quantization using state-of-the-art algorithms at varying bit-widths, with extensive evaluation across mathematical (AIME, MATH-500), scientific (GPQA), and programming (LiveCodeBench) reasoning benchmarks. Our findings reveal that while lossless quantization can be achieved with W8A8 or W4A16 quantization, lower bit-widths introduce significant accuracy risks. We further identify model size, model origin, and task difficulty as critical determinants of performance. Contrary to expectations, quantized models do not exhibit increased output lengths. In addition, strategically scaling the model sizes or reasoning steps can effectively enhance the performance. All quantized models and codes will be open-sourced in https://github.com/ruikangliu/Quantized-Reasoning-Models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Semantic parsers convert natural language to logical forms, which can be evaluated on knowledge bases (KBs) to produce denotations. Recent semantic parsers have been developed with sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) pre-trained language models (PLMs) or large language models, where the models treat logical forms as sequences of tokens. For syntactic and semantic validity, the semantic parsers use grammars that enable constrained decoding. However, the grammars lack the ability to utilize large information of KBs, although logical forms contain representations of KB elements, such as entities or relations. In this work, we propose a grammar augmented with candidate expressions for semantic parsing on a large KB with a seq2seq PLM. The grammar defines actions as production rules, and our semantic parser predicts actions during inference under the constraints by types and candidate expressions. We apply the grammar to knowledge base question answering, where the constraints by candidate expressions assist a semantic parser to generate valid KB elements. We also introduce two special rules, sub-type inference and union types, and a mask caching algorithm. In particular, sub-type inference and the mask caching algorithm greatly increase the decoding speed of our semantic parser. We experimented on two benchmarks, KQA Pro and Overnight, where the constraints by candidate expressions increased the accuracy of our semantic parser, whether it was trained with strong supervision or weak supervision. In addition, our semantic parser had a fast decoding speed in the experiments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing size of the Key-Value (KV) cache during the Large Language Models long-context inference is the main obstacle for its balance between the deployment cost and task accuracy. To reduce the KV cache size in such scenarios, most previous efforts leveraged on the attention weight to evict non-critical cache tokens. But there is a trade-off in those methods, they usually require major modifiation of the inference infrastructure and significant computation overhead. Base on the fact that the Large Lanuage models are autoregresssive models, we propose {\it LagKV}, a KV allocation strategy only relying on straight forward comparison among KV themself. It is a totally attention free method which offers easy integration to the main stream inference platform and comparable performance comparing to other complicated KV compression methods. Results on LongBench and PasskeyRetrieval show that, our approach achieves nearly zero loss when the ratio is $2\times$ and $\approx 90\%$ of the original model performance for $8\times$. Especially in the 64-digit passkey retrieval task, our mehod outperforms the attention weight based method $H_2O$ over $60\%$ with same compression ratios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Visual Autoregressive (VAR) modeling has gained popularity for its shift towards next-scale prediction. However, existing VAR paradigms process the entire token map at each scale step, leading to the complexity and runtime scaling dramatically with image resolution. To address this challenge, we propose FastVAR, a post-training acceleration method for efficient resolution scaling with VARs. Our key finding is that the majority of latency arises from the large-scale step where most tokens have already converged. Leveraging this observation, we develop the cached token pruning strategy that only forwards pivotal tokens for scale-specific modeling while using cached tokens from previous scale steps to restore the pruned slots. This significantly reduces the number of forwarded tokens and improves the efficiency at larger resolutions. Experiments show the proposed FastVAR can further speedup FlashAttention-accelerated VAR by 2.7$\times$ with negligible performance drop of <1%. We further extend FastVAR to zero-shot generation of higher resolution images. In particular, FastVAR can generate one 2K image with 15GB memory footprints in 1.5s on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The linear growth of key-value (KV) cache memory and quadratic computational in attention mechanisms complexity pose significant bottlenecks for large language models (LLMs) in long-context processing. While existing KV cache optimization methods address these challenges through token pruning or feature merging, they often incur irreversible information loss or require costly parameter retraining. To this end, we propose ZSMerge, a dynamic KV cache compression framework designed for efficient cache management, featuring three key operations: (1) fine-grained memory allocation guided by multi-dimensional token importance metrics at head-level granularity, (2) a residual merging mechanism that preserves critical context through compensated attention scoring, and (3) a zero-shot adaptation mechanism compatible with diverse LLM architectures without requiring retraining. ZSMerge significantly enhances memory efficiency and inference speed with negligible performance degradation across LLMs. When applied to LLaMA2-7B, it demonstrates a 20:1 compression ratio for key-value cache retention (reducing memory footprint to 5\% of baseline) while sustaining comparable generation quality, coupled with triple throughput gains at extreme 54k-token contexts that eliminate out-of-memory failures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid growth of multi-core systems highlights the need for efficient Network-on-Chip (NoC) design to ensure seamless communication. Cache coherence, essential for data consistency, substantially reduces task computation time by enabling data sharing among caches. As a result, routing serves two roles: facilitating data sharing (influenced by topology) and managing NoC-level communication. However, cache coherence is often overlooked in routing, causing mismatches between design expectations and evaluation outcomes. Two main challenges are the lack of specialized tools to assess cache coherence's impact and the neglect of topology selection in routing. In this work, we propose a cache coherence-aware routing approach with integrated topology selection, guided by our Cache Coherence Traffic Analyzer (CCTA). Our method achieves up to 10.52% lower packet latency, 55.51% faster execution time, and 49.02% total energy savings, underscoring the critical role of cache coherence in NoC design and enabling effective co-design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Aurora supercomputer is an exascale-class system designed to tackle some of the most demanding computational workloads. Equipped with both High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and DDR memory, it provides unique trade-offs in performance, latency, and capacity. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the memory systems on the Aurora supercomputer, with a focus on evaluating the trade-offs between HBM and DDR memory systems. We explore how different memory configurations, including memory modes (Flat and Cache) and clustering modes (Quad and SNC4), influence key system performance metrics such as memory bandwidth, latency, CPU-GPU PCIe bandwidth, and MPI communication bandwidth. Additionally, we examine the performance of three representative HPC applications -- HACC, QMCPACK, and BFS -- each illustrating the impact of memory configurations on performance. By using microbenchmarks and application-level analysis, we provide insights into how to select the optimal memory system and configuration to maximize performance based on the application characteristics. The findings presented in this paper offer guidance for users of the Aurora system and similar exascale systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Semantic prompt caches reduce the latency and cost of large language model (LLM) inference by reusing cached LLM-generated responses for semantically similar prompts. Vector similarity metrics assign a numerical score to quantify the similarity between an embedded prompt and its nearest neighbor in the cache. Existing systems rely on a static threshold to classify whether the similarity score is sufficiently high to result in a cache hit. We show that this one-size-fits-all threshold is insufficient across different embeddings. We propose VectorQ, an online framework with a threshold convergence guarantee to learn embedding-specific threshold regions that adapt to the uncertainty of an embedding. Through evaluations on a combination of three diverse datasets, we show that VectorQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems across all static thresholds, achieving up to 26x increases in cache hit rate and error rate reductions up to 74%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> High-precision modeling of systems is one of the main areas of industrial data analysis. Models of systems, their digital twins, are used to predict their behavior under various conditions. We have developed several models of a storage system using machine learning-based generative models. The system consists of several components: hard disk drive (HDD) and solid-state drive (SSD) storage pools with different RAID schemes and cache. Each storage component is represented by a probabilistic model that describes the probability distribution of the component performance in terms of IOPS and latency, depending on their configuration and external data load parameters. The results of the experiments demonstrate the errors of 4-10 % for IOPS and 3-16 % for latency predictions depending on the components and models of the system. The predictions show up to 0.99 Pearson correlation with Little's law, which can be used for unsupervised reliability checks of the models. In addition, we present novel data sets that can be used for benchmarking regression algorithms, conditional generative models, and uncertainty estimation methods in machine learning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> AI/ML-based tools are at the forefront of resource management solutions for communication networks. Deep learning, in particular, is highly effective in facilitating fast and high-performing decision-making whenever representative training data is available to build offline accurate models. Conversely, online learning solutions do not require training and enable adaptive decisions based on runtime observations, alas are often overly conservative. This extensive tutorial proposes the use of optimistic learning (OpL) as a decision engine for resource management frameworks in modern communication systems. When properly designed, such solutions can achieve fast and high-performing decisions -- comparable to offline-trained models -- while preserving the robustness and performance guarantees of the respective online learning approaches. We introduce the fundamental concepts, algorithms and results of OpL, discuss the roots of this theory and present different approaches to defining and achieving optimism. We proceed to showcase how OpL can enhance resource management in communication networks for several key problems such as caching, edge computing, network slicing, and workload assignment in decentralized O-RAN platforms. Finally, we discuss the open challenges that must be addressed to unlock the full potential of this new resource management approach.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose EVOlutionary Selector (EVOS), an efficient training paradigm for accelerating Implicit Neural Representation (INR). Unlike conventional INR training that feeds all samples through the neural network in each iteration, our approach restricts training to strategically selected points, reducing computational overhead by eliminating redundant forward passes. Specifically, we treat each sample as an individual in an evolutionary process, where only those fittest ones survive and merit inclusion in training, adaptively evolving with the neural network dynamics. While this is conceptually similar to Evolutionary Algorithms, their distinct objectives (selection for acceleration vs. iterative solution optimization) require a fundamental redefinition of evolutionary mechanisms for our context. In response, we design sparse fitness evaluation, frequency-guided crossover, and augmented unbiased mutation to comprise EVOS. These components respectively guide sample selection with reduced computational cost, enhance performance through frequency-domain balance, and mitigate selection bias from cached evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves approximately 48%-66% reduction in training time while ensuring superior convergence without additional cost, establishing state-of-the-art acceleration among recent sampling-based strategies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video generation. However, the computational intensity remains a significant challenge for practical applications. While feature caching has been proposed to reduce the computational burden of diffusion models, existing methods typically overlook the heterogeneous significance of individual blocks, resulting in suboptimal reuse and degraded output quality. To this end, we address this gap by introducing ProfilingDiT, a novel adaptive caching strategy that explicitly disentangles foreground and background-focused blocks. Through a systematic analysis of attention distributions in diffusion models, we reveal a key observation: 1) Most layers exhibit a consistent preference for either foreground or background regions. 2) Predicted noise shows low inter-step similarity initially, which stabilizes as denoising progresses. This finding inspires us to formulate a selective caching strategy that preserves full computation for dynamic foreground elements while efficiently caching static background features. Our approach substantially reduces computational overhead while preserving visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant acceleration (e.g., 2.01 times speedup for Wan2.1) while maintaining visual fidelity across comprehensive quality metrics, establishing a viable method for efficient video generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) often incorporate multiple text chunks in their inputs to provide the necessary contexts. To speed up the prefill of the long LLM inputs, one can pre-compute the KV cache of a text and re-use the KV cache when the context is reused as the prefix of another LLM input. However, the reused text chunks are not always the input prefix, which makes precomputed KV caches not directly usable since they ignore the text's cross-attention with the preceding texts. Thus, the benefits of reusing KV caches remain largely unrealized.   This paper tackles just one challenge: when an LLM input contains multiple text chunks, how to quickly combine their precomputed KV caches in order to achieve the same generation quality as the expensive full prefill (i.e., without reusing KV cache)? This challenge naturally arises in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where the input is supplemented with multiple retrieved texts as the context. We present CacheBlend, a scheme that reuses the precomputed KV caches, regardless prefix or not, and selectively recomputes the KV values of a small subset of tokens to partially update each reused KV cache. In the meantime, the small extra delay for recomputing some tokens can be pipelined with the retrieval of KV caches within the same job, allowing CacheBlend to store KV caches in slower devices with more storage capacity while retrieving them without increasing the inference delay. By comparing CacheBlend with the state-of-the-art KV cache reusing schemes on three open-source LLMs of various sizes and four popular benchmark datasets of different tasks, we show that CacheBlend reduces time-to-first-token (TTFT) by 2.2-3.3x and increases the inference throughput by 2.8-5x from full KV recompute without compromising generation quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in the coding, reasoning, and tool-using abilities of LLMs have spurred interest in library learning (i.e., online learning through the creation, storage, and retrieval of reusable and composable functions, knowledge, checklists, or lemmas). Such systems often promise improved task performance through the automatic creation of broadly applicable tools, as well as superior computational performance through the caching of reasoning (i.e., the storage of generated tools). However, we find strong reason to be skeptical. We perform a deep dive into one such system, LEGO-Prover, which purports to learn reusable lemmas for mathematical reasoning. We find no evidence of the direct reuse of learned lemmas, and find evidence against the soft reuse of learned lemmas (i.e., reuse by modifying relevant examples). Crucially, we find that LEGO-Prover does not in fact improve over the simple baseline of prompting the model - the improvements in task accuracy vanish once computational cost is accounted for. Our findings suggest that serious misconceptions exist as to the effectiveness of these techniques, that a serious re-examination of the state of LLM-based library learning is required, and that we require much stronger standards for evaluation including behavioural analysis and ensuring that an equal computational budget is used for baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This study investigates the localization of knowledge representation in fine-tuned GPT-2 models using Causal Layer Attribution via Activation Patching (CLAP), a method that identifies critical neural layers responsible for correct answer generation. The model was fine-tuned on 9,958 PubMed abstracts (epilepsy: 20,595 mentions, EEG: 11,674 mentions, seizure: 13,921 mentions) using two configurations with validation loss monitoring for early stopping. CLAP involved (1) caching clean (correct answer) and corrupted (incorrect answer) activations, (2) computing logit difference to quantify model preference, and (3) patching corrupted activations with clean ones to assess recovery. Results revealed three findings: First, patching the first feedforward layer recovered 56% of correct preference, demonstrating that associative knowledge is distributed across multiple layers. Second, patching the final output layer completely restored accuracy (100% recovery), indicating that definitional knowledge is localised. The stronger clean logit difference for definitional questions further supports this localized representation. Third, minimal recovery from convolutional layer patching (13.6%) suggests low-level features contribute marginally to high-level reasoning. Statistical analysis confirmed significant layer-specific effects (p<0.01). These findings demonstrate that factual knowledge is more localized and associative knowledge depends on distributed representations. We also showed that editing efficacy depends on task type. Our findings not only reconcile conflicting observations about localization in model editing but also emphasize on using task-adaptive techniques for reliable, interpretable updates.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Compact Genetic Algorithms (cGAs) are condensed variants of classical Genetic Algorithms (GAs) that use a probability vector representation of the population instead of the complete population. cGAs have been shown to significantly reduce the number of function evaluations required while producing outcomes similar to those of classical GAs. However, cGAs have a tendency to repeatedly generate the same chromosomes as they approach convergence, resulting in unnecessary evaluations of identical chromosomes. This article introduces the concept of caching in cGAs as a means of avoiding redundant evaluations of the same chromosomes. Our proposed approach operates equivalently to cGAs, but enhances the algorithm's time efficiency by reducing the number of function evaluations. We also present a data structure for efficient cache maintenance to ensure low overhead. The proposed caching approach has an asymptotically constant time complexity on average. The proposed method further generalizes the caching mechanism with higher selection pressure for elitism-based cGAs. We conduct a rigorous analysis based on experiments on benchmark optimization problems using two well-known cache replacement strategies. The results demonstrate that caching significantly reduces the number of function evaluations required while maintaining the same level of performance accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge into the generation process. A key component of RAG pipelines is the reranker, which selects the most relevant documents from a pool of retrieved candidates and significantly improves the quality of the generated responses. While rerankers refine the selection of retrieved documents in RAG pipelines, they introduce computational challenges that hinder high throughput and low latency. To address this problem, we propose HyperRAG, a system that optimizes the trade-off between quality and efficiency in RAG pipelines by leveraging KV-cache reuse for efficient reranker inference. By reusing document-side KV-cache, HyperRAG achieves both high-quality generation and system-level efficiency. To fully realize the benefits of KV-cache reuse, HyperRAG incorporates a range of system-level optimizations designed to enhance efficiency and scalability. Experiments show that HyperRAG achieves a 2 - 3 throughput improvement with decoder-only rerankers while also delivering higher downstream performance compared with traditional RAG service.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While mobile devices provide ever more compute power, improvements in DRAM bandwidth are much slower. This is unfortunate for large language model (LLM) token generation, which is heavily memory-bound. Previous work has proposed to leverage natural dynamic activation sparsity in ReLU-activated LLMs to reduce effective DRAM bandwidth per token. However, more recent LLMs use SwiGLU instead of ReLU, which results in little inherent sparsity. While SwiGLU activations can be pruned based on magnitude, the resulting sparsity patterns are difficult to predict, rendering previous approaches ineffective. To circumvent this issue, our work introduces Dynamic Input Pruning (DIP): a predictor-free dynamic sparsification approach, which preserves accuracy with minimal fine-tuning. DIP can further use lightweight LoRA adapters to regain some performance lost during sparsification. Lastly, we describe a novel cache-aware masking strategy, which considers the cache state and activation magnitude to further increase cache hit rate, improving LLM token rate on mobile devices. DIP outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy, memory and throughput trade-offs across simulated hardware settings. On Phi-3-Medium, DIP achieves a 46\% reduction in memory and 40\% increase in throughput with $<$ 0.1 loss in perplexity when compared to streaming the dense model from Flash.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper examines memory mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs), emphasizing their importance for context-rich responses, reduced hallucinations, and improved efficiency. It categorizes memory into sensory, short-term, and long-term, with sensory memory corresponding to input prompts, short-term memory processing immediate context, and long-term memory implemented via external databases or structures. The text-based memory section covers acquisition (selection and summarization), management (updating, accessing, storing, and resolving conflicts), and utilization (full-text search, SQL queries, semantic search). The KV cache-based memory section discusses selection methods (regularity-based summarization, score-based approaches, special token embeddings) and compression techniques (low-rank compression, KV merging, multimodal compression), along with management strategies like offloading and shared attention mechanisms. Parameter-based memory methods (LoRA, TTT, MoE) transform memories into model parameters to enhance efficiency, while hidden-state-based memory approaches (chunk mechanisms, recurrent transformers, Mamba model) improve long-text processing by combining RNN hidden states with current methods. Overall, the paper offers a comprehensive analysis of LLM memory mechanisms, highlighting their significance and future research directions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Disaggregated inference has become an essential framework that separates the prefill (P) and decode (D) stages in large language model inference to improve throughput. However, the KV cache transfer faces significant delays between prefill and decode nodes. The block-wise calling method and discontinuous KV cache memory allocation increase the number of calls to the transmission kernel. Additionally, existing frameworks often fix the roles of P and D nodes, leading to computational imbalances. In this paper, we propose FlowKV, a novel disaggregated inference framework, which reduces the average transmission latency of KV cache by 96%, from 0.944s to 0.053s, almost eliminating the transfer time relative to the total request latency by optimizing the KV cache transfer. FlowKV introduces the Load-Aware Scheduler for balanced request scheduling and flexible PD node allocation. This design maximizes hardware resource utilization, achieving peak system throughput across various scenarios, including normal, computational imbalance, and extreme overload conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowKV significantly accelerates inference by 15.2%-48.9% on LongBench dataset compared to the baseline and supports applications with heterogeneous GPUs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This report investigates enhancing semantic caching effectiveness by employing specialized, fine-tuned embedding models. Semantic caching relies on embedding similarity rather than exact key matching, presenting unique challenges in balancing precision, query latency, and computational efficiency. We propose leveraging smaller, domain-specific embedding models, fine-tuned with targeted real-world and synthetically generated datasets. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that compact embedding models fine-tuned for just one epoch on specialized datasets significantly surpass both state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary alternatives in precision and recall. Moreover, we introduce a novel synthetic data generation pipeline for the semantic cache that mitigates the challenge of limited domain-specific annotated data, further boosting embedding performance. Our approach effectively balances computational overhead and accuracy, establishing a viable and efficient strategy for practical semantic caching implementations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present a comprehensive framework for enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems through dynamic retrieval strategies and reinforcement fine-tuning. This approach significantly improves large language models on knowledge-intensive tasks, including opendomain question answering and complex reasoning. Our framework integrates two complementary techniques: Policy-Optimized RetrievalAugmented Generation (PORAG), which optimizes the use of retrieved information, and Adaptive Token-Layer Attention Scoring (ATLAS), which dynamically determines retrieval timing and content based on contextual needs. Together, these techniques enhance both the utilization and relevance of retrieved content, improving factual accuracy and response quality. Designed as a lightweight solution compatible with any Transformer-based LLM without requiring additional training, our framework excels in knowledge-intensive tasks, boosting output accuracy in RAG settings. We further propose CRITIC, a novel method to selectively compress key-value caches by token importance, mitigating memory bottlenecks in long-context applications. The framework also incorporates test-time scaling techniques to dynamically balance reasoning depth and computational resources, alongside optimized decoding strategies for faster inference. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our framework reduces hallucinations, strengthens domain-specific reasoning, and achieves significant efficiency and scalability gains over traditional RAG systems. This integrated approach advances the development of robust, efficient, and scalable RAG systems across diverse applications.

Through the use of low-bitwidth integer units and cache-coherent Unified Memory Architecture, we emulate double-precision matrix multiplications in the MuST application without code changes. We find that accuracy depends on both arithmetic precision and the properties of the operator, which can be dealt with through tunable precision emulation. Unlike traditional mixed-precision approaches, this method preserves original algorithms while optimizing hardware utilization. We showcases the potential of improving accuracy and performance at the same time. This work highlights the potential of AI-driven hardware to transform HPC, advocating for adaptive precision strategies in future scientific computing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Runahead execution is a technique to mask memory latency caused by irregular memory accesses. By pre-executing the application code during occurrences of long-latency operations and prefetching anticipated cache-missed data into the cache hierarchy, runahead effectively masks memory latency for subsequent cache misses and achieves high prefetching accuracy; however, this technique has been limited to superscalar out-of-order and superscalar in-order cores. For implementation in scalar in-order cores, the challenges of area-/energy-constraint and severe cache contention remain.   Here, we build the first full-stack system featuring runahead, MERE, from SoC and a dedicated ISA to the OS and programming model. Through this deployment, we show that enabling runahead in scalar in-order cores is possible, with minimal area and power overheads, while still achieving high performance. By re-constructing the sequential runahead employing a hardware/software co-design approach, the system can be implemented on a mature processor and SoC. Building on this, an adaptive runahead mechanism is proposed to mitigate the severe cache contention in scalar in-order cores. Combining this, we provide a comprehensive solution for embedded processors managing irregular workloads. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed MERE attains 93.5% of a 2-wide out-of-order core's performance while constraining area and power overheads below 5%, with the adaptive runahead mechanism delivering an additional 20.1% performance gain through mitigating the severe cache contention issues.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a practical approach to scale up parameters for the Transformer model to achieve better generalization while maintaining a sub-linear increase in computation overhead. Current MoE models are mainly built with expert parallelism on distributed devices. However, it usually depends on homogeneous devices to deploy and suffers from heavy communication overhead and computation redundancy. In this paper, we explore developing a \texttt{H}eterogeneous-aware \texttt{EX}pert \texttt{A}llocation framework, \textbf{\texttt{HEXA-MoE}}, with significantly enhanced computing efficiency. It contains two components: ($1$) \textit{Expert-Specific Operators}. We replace the typical general matrix multiplication or grouped matrix multiplication interfaces with our operators, which allows the computing to be performed in an in-place manner with \textbf{ZERO} redundancy. ($2$) \textit{Adaptive Data- and Model-Centric Configurations} for different workload scales. Specifically, we introduce a pipeline-shared cache on each device to tackle the heavy memory consumption in the existing data-centric MoE library. Comprehensive experiments on the Swin-MoE benchmark consistently reveal the effectiveness of our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} framework, i.e., reducing $10\%\sim48\%$ memory consumption and achieving $0.5\sim4.3\times$ speed up compared to current state-of-the-art MoE libraries. Furthermore, we examine our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} with heterogeneous devices for both data- and model-centric settings. Promising results show that employing optimal parallel configuration with \texttt{HEXA-MoE} on heterogeneous devices can substantially minimize overall latency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have become more prevalent in long-context applications such as interactive chatbots, document analysis, and agent workflows, but it is challenging to serve long-context requests with low latency and high throughput. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used technique to reduce latency losslessly, but the conventional wisdom suggests that its efficacy is limited to small batch sizes. In MagicDec, we show that surprisingly SD can achieve speedup even for a high throughput inference regime for moderate to long sequences. More interestingly, an intelligent drafting strategy can achieve better speedup with increasing batch size based on our rigorous analysis. MagicDec first identifies the bottleneck shifts with increasing batch size and sequence length, and uses these insights to deploy SD more effectively for high throughput inference. We leverage draft model with sparse KV cache to address the KV bottleneck, which scales with both sequence length and batch size. Additionally, we propose a theoretical model to select the optimal drafting strategy for maximum speedup. Our work highlights the broad applicability of speculative decoding in long-context serving, as it can enhance throughput and reduce latency without compromising accuracy. For moderate to long sequences, we demonstrate up to 2.51x speedup for Llama3.1-8B when serving batch sizes ranging from 32 to 256 on various types of hardware and tasks.

Metal-dielectric-semiconductor structures are important to sustain high fields needed for future high-performance UWBG transistors. Using systematic experiments, we determined the fixed charge density (> 1013 cm-2), the dielectric/interface, and electric fields in the oxide of under flat-band conditions in the semiconductor. Low gate-to-drain leakage current of up to 5 x 10-7 A/cm2 were obtained in the metal-oxide-semiconductor structures. In lateral metal-semiconductor-insulator test structures, breakdown voltage exceeding 1 kV was obtained with a channel sheet charge density of 1.27 x 1013 cm-2. The effective peak electric field and average breakdown field were estimated to be > 4.27 MV/cm and 1.99 MV/cm, respectively. These findings demonstrate the potential of Al2O2 integration for enhancing the breakdown performance of UWBG AlGaN HEMTs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Knowledge-intensive analytical applications retrieve context from both structured tabular data and unstructured, text-free documents for effective decision-making. Large language models (LLMs) have made it significantly easier to prototype such retrieval and reasoning data pipelines. However, implementing these pipelines efficiently still demands significant effort and has several challenges. This often involves orchestrating heterogeneous data systems, managing data movement, and handling low-level implementation details, e.g., LLM context management.   To address these challenges, we introduce FlockMTL: an extension for DBMSs that deeply integrates LLM capabilities and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FlockMTL includes model-driven scalar and aggregate functions, enabling chained predictions through tuple-level mappings and reductions. Drawing inspiration from the relational model, FlockMTL incorporates: (i) cost-based optimizations, which seamlessly apply techniques such as batching and caching; and (ii) resource independence, enabled through novel SQL DDL abstractions: PROMPT and MODEL, introduced as first-class schema objects alongside TABLE. FlockMTL streamlines the development of knowledge-intensive analytical applications, and its optimizations ease the implementation burden.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The effective management of large amounts of data processed or required by today's cloud or edge computing systems remains a fundamental challenge. This paper focuses on cache management for applications where data objects can be stored in layered representations. In such representations, each additional data layer enhances the "quality" of the object's version but comes with an incremental cost of memory space. This layered approach proves beneficial in various scenarios, including the delivery of zoomable maps, video coding, future Virtual Reality gaming, and layered neural network models where additional data layers improve inference accuracy. In systems where users or devices demand different versions of a data object, layered representations offer flexibility for caching policies to achieve improved hit rates.   In this paper, we explore the performance of various traditionally studied caching policies, such as Belady, LRU, and LFU, both with and without layering. To this end, we develop an asymptotically accurate analytical model for Layered LRU (LLRU). We study how the performance of LLRU is impacted by factors such as the number of layers, the popularity of different objects and layers, and overheads associated with storing layered representations. For instance, we show that, for LLRU, more layers are not always beneficial and indeed performance depends in subtle ways on the popularity and size profiles of layers.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Water drops spontaneously accumulate charges when they move on hydrophobic dielectric surfaces by slide electrification. On the one hand, slide electrification generates electricity with possible applications on tiny devices. On the other hand, the potential of up to 1 KV generated by slide electrification alters wetting and drop motion. Therefore, it is important to know the factors that affect slide electrification. To find out how surfactants affect slide electrification, we measured drop charges of aqueous drops containing cationic CTAB, anionic SDS and neutral C8E3 sliding on different hydrophobic surfaces. The result is: addition of surfactant significantly reduces the spontaneous charging of moving water drops. Based on zeta potential measurements, confocal microscopy of deposited surface-active dyes and drop impact studies, we propose that several factors contribute to this suppression of charge separation: (1) Surfactants tend to lower the contact angles, which reduces charge separation. (2) Surfactant adsorption at the solid-liquid interface can reduce the density of primary ions, particularly for anionic surfactants. (3) Anionic and neutral surfactants are mostly transferred to the liquid-air interface at the rear of the sliding drop, retaining primary ions within the drop. (4) Deposited cationic surfactant directly reduces the charge of the drop.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with Vector Quantization (VQ) has achieved great success in both self-supervised pre-training and image generation. However, most existing methods struggle to address the trade-off in shared latent space for generation quality vs. representation learning and efficiency. To push the limits of this paradigm, we propose MergeVQ, which incorporates token merging techniques into VQ-based generative models to bridge the gap between image generation and visual representation learning in a unified architecture. During pre-training, MergeVQ decouples top-k semantics from latent space with the token merge module after self-attention blocks in the encoder for subsequent Look-up Free Quantization (LFQ) and global alignment and recovers their fine-grained details through cross-attention in the decoder for reconstruction. As for the second-stage generation, we introduce MergeAR, which performs KV Cache compression for efficient raster-order prediction. Extensive experiments on ImageNet verify that MergeVQ as an AR generative model achieves competitive performance in both visual representation learning and image generation tasks while maintaining favorable token efficiency and inference speed. The code and model will be available at https://apexgen-x.github.io/MergeVQ.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models face significant computational and memory challenges when processing long contexts. During inference, efficient management of the key-value (KV) cache, which stores intermediate activations for autoregressive generation, is critical to reducing memory overhead and improving computational efficiency. Traditional token-level efficient KV caching methods overlook semantic information, treating tokens independently without considering their semantic relationships. Meanwhile, existing semantic-preserving KV cache management approaches often suffer from substantial memory usage and high time-to-first-token. To address these limitations, we propose SentenceKV, a novel sentence-level semantic KV caching approach designed to enhance inference efficiency while preserving semantic coherence. During prefilling, SentenceKV groups tokens based on sentence-level semantic similarity, compressing sentence representations into concise semantic vectors stored directly on the GPU, while individual KV pairs are offloaded to CPU. During decoding, SentenceKV generates tokens by selectively retrieving semantically relevant sentence-level KV entries, leveraging the semantic similarity between the prefilling-stage semantic vectors and decoding-stage queries. This ensures efficient and contextually accurate predictions, minimizing the loading of redundant or irrelevant data into GPU memory and significantly reducing memory overhead while maintaining stable inference latency, even for extremely long contexts. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks including PG-19, LongBench, and Needle-In-A-Haystack demonstrate that SentenceKV significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and memory usage, without compromising model accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce a novel large language model (LLM)-driven agent framework, which iteratively refines queries and filters contextual evidence by leveraging dynamically evolving knowledge. A defining feature of the system is its decoupling of external sources from an internal knowledge cache that is progressively updated to guide both query generation and evidence selection. This design mitigates bias-reinforcement loops and enables dynamic, trackable search exploration paths, thereby optimizing the trade-off between exploring diverse information and maintaining accuracy through autonomous agent decision-making. Our approach is evaluated on a broad range of open-domain question answering benchmarks, including multi-step tasks that mirror real-world scenarios where integrating information from multiple sources is critical, especially given the vulnerabilities of LLMs that lack explicit reasoning or planning capabilities. The results show that the proposed system not only outperforms single-step baselines regardless of task difficulty but also, compared to conventional iterative retrieval methods, demonstrates pronounced advantages in complex tasks through precise evidence-based reasoning and enhanced efficiency. The proposed system supports both competitive and collaborative sharing of updated context, enabling multi-agent extension. The benefits of multi-agent configurations become especially prominent as task difficulty increases. The number of convergence steps scales with task difficulty, suggesting cost-effective scalability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated Learning (FL) trains machine learning models on edge devices with distributed data. However, the computational and memory limitations of these devices restrict the training of large models using FL. Split Federated Learning (SFL) addresses this challenge by distributing the model across the device and server, but it introduces a tightly coupled data flow, leading to computational bottlenecks and high communication costs. We propose EMO as a solution to enable the training of large models in FL while mitigating the challenges of SFL. EMO introduces Edge Model Overlay(s) between the device and server, enabling the creation of a larger ensemble model without modifying the FL workflow. The key innovation in EMO is Augmented Federated Learning (AFL), which builds an ensemble model by connecting the original (smaller) FL model with model(s) trained in the overlay(s) to facilitate horizontal or vertical scaling. This is accomplished through three key modules: a hierarchical activation replay cache to decouple AFL from FL, a convergence-aware communication controller to optimize communication overhead, and an ensemble inference module. Evaluations on a real-world prototype show that EMO improves accuracy by up to 17.77% compared to FL, and reduces communication costs by up to 7.17x and decreases training time by up to 6.9x compared to SFL.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Visual token reduction lowers inference costs caused by extensive image features in large vision-language models (LVLMs). Unlike relevant studies that prune tokens in self-attention-only LVLMs, our work uniquely addresses cross-attention-based models, which achieve superior performance. We identify that the key-value (KV) cache size for image tokens in cross-attention layers significantly exceeds that of text tokens in self-attention layers, posing a major compute bottleneck. To mitigate this issue, we exploit the sparse nature in cross-attention maps to selectively prune redundant visual features. Our Trimmed Llama effectively reduces KV cache demands without requiring additional training. By benefiting from 50%-reduced visual features, our model can reduce inference latency and memory usage while achieving benchmark parity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This study demonstrates the feasibility of using smaller capillary emitters to achieve higher specific impulse ($I_\text{sp}$) in electrospray propulsion. Four ionic liquids were characterized using capillary emitters with tip diameters from 15 to 50 $\mu$m. Smaller diameter capillaries produced smaller and more stable Taylor cones. This stabilization enabled steady cone-jet operation at significantly lower flow rates compared to larger emitters. This was unexpected because when the jet diameter is much smaller than far-field geometric features, the minimum flow rate is thought to be solely determined by the physical properties of the propellant. Using the smaller emitters and acceleration voltages of 10 kV, specific impulses up to 3000 s could be achieved with efficiencies above 50%, approximately doubling the $I_\text{sp}$ observed with larger emitters. For one of the liquids and the smallest emitters, the beam consisted solely of ions at the lowest flow rates, similarly to studies using externally wetted and porous emitters. Another important finding was that at sufficiently low flow rates, a significant fraction of the propellant fed to the emitter is not accelerated by the electrostatic field. These propellant losses make the time-of-flight technique unreliable for determining the $I_\text{sp}$.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The key-value (KV) cache accelerates LLMs decoding by storing KV tensors from previously generated tokens. It reduces redundant computation at the cost of increased memory usage. To mitigate this overhead, existing approaches compress KV tensors into lower-bit representations; however, quantization errors can accumulate as more tokens are generated, potentially resulting in undesired outputs. In this paper, we introduce SQuat (Subspace-orthogonal KV cache quantization). It first constructs a subspace spanned by query tensors to capture the most critical task-related information. During key tensor quantization, it enforces that the difference between the (de)quantized and original keys remains orthogonal to this subspace, minimizing the impact of quantization errors on the attention mechanism's outputs. SQuat requires no model fine-tuning, no additional calibration dataset for offline learning, and is grounded in a theoretical framework we develop. Through numerical experiments, we show that our method reduces peak memory by 2.17 to 2.82, improves throughput by 2.45 to 3.60, and achieves more favorable benchmark scores than existing KV cache quantization algorithms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Covariates play an indispensable role in practical time series forecasting, offering rich context from the past and sometimes extending into the future. However, their availability varies depending on the scenario, and situations often involve multiple target variables simultaneously. Moreover, the cross-variate dependencies between them are multi-granular, with some covariates having a short-term impact on target variables and others showing long-term correlations. This heterogeneity and the intricate dependencies arising in covariate-informed forecasting present significant challenges to existing deep models. To address these issues, we propose CITRAS, a patch-based Transformer that flexibly leverages multiple targets and covariates covering both the past and the future forecasting horizon. While preserving the strong autoregressive capabilities of the canonical Transformer, CITRAS introduces two novel mechanisms in patch-wise cross-variate attention: Key-Value (KV) Shift and Attention Score Smoothing. KV Shift seamlessly incorporates future known covariates into the forecasting of target variables based on their concurrent dependencies. Additionally, Attention Score Smoothing transforms locally accurate patch-wise cross-variate dependencies into global variate-level dependencies by smoothing the past series of attention scores. Experimentally, CITRAS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both covariate-informed and multivariate forecasting, demonstrating its versatile ability to leverage cross-variate dependency for improved forecasting accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Key-Value cache (\texttt{KV} \texttt{cache}) compression has emerged as a promising technique to optimize Large Language Model (LLM) serving. It primarily decreases the memory consumption of \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} to reduce the computation cost. Despite the development of many compression algorithms, their applications in production environments are still not prevalent. In this paper, we revisit mainstream \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression solutions from a practical perspective. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we comprehensively review existing algorithmic designs and benchmark studies for \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression and identify missing pieces in their performance measurement, which could hinder their adoption in practice. Second, we empirically evaluate representative \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression methods to uncover two key issues that affect the computational efficiency: (1) while compressing \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} can reduce memory consumption, current implementations (e.g., FlashAttention, PagedAttention) do not optimize for production-level LLM serving, resulting in suboptimal throughput performance; (2) compressing \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} may lead to longer outputs, resulting in increased end-to-end latency. We further investigate the accuracy performance of individual samples rather than the overall performance, revealing the intrinsic limitations in \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression when handling specific LLM tasks. Third, we provide tools to shed light on future \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression studies and facilitate their practical deployment in production.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The deployment of Machine Learning models at cloud have grown by tech companies. Hardware requirements are higher when these models involve Deep Learning (DL) techniques and the cloud providers' costs may be a barrier. We explore deploying DL models using for experiments the GECToR model, a DL solution for Grammatical Error Correction, across three of the major cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure). We evaluate real-time latency, hardware usage and cost at each cloud provider by 7 execution environments with 10 experiments reproduced. We found that while GPUs excel in performance, they had an average cost 300% higher than solutions without GPU. Our analysis also identifies that processor cache size is crucial for cost-effective CPU deployments, enabling over 50% of cost reduction compared to GPUs. This study demonstrates the feasibility and affordability of cloud-based DL inference solutions without GPUs, benefiting resource-constrained users like startups.

  Variational Autoencoders with Estimating Background Covariances via

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This study proposes a theory of unsupervised super-resolution data assimilation (SRDA) using conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs). We derive an evidence lower bound for unsupervised learning, showing that our theory is an extension of a traditional data assimilation (DA) method, namely the three-dimensional variational (3D-Var) formalism. In contrast to 3D-Var, our theory exploits the non-locality of super-resolution (SR) to learn background covariances without explicitly imposing them for assimilating distant observations. For linear SR, SR operators serve as background error covariance matrices,whereas for nonlinear SR, error backpropagation through SR neural networks induces covariance structures in inference. SRDA can naturally be realized with CVAEs because the loss function for CVAEs is generally an evidence lower bound. By incorporating the SR neural network into the CVAE, the encoder estimates the high-resolution (HR) analysis from HR observations and low-resolution forecasts. The decoder acts as the observation operator by reconstructing the HR observations from the estimated HR analysis. The effectiveness of SRDA was evaluated through numerical experiments using an idealized barotropic ocean jet system. Compared to inference with an ensemble Kalman filter, SRDA demonstrated superior accuracy in HR inference. SRDA was also computationally efficient because it does not require HR numerical integration or ensemble calculations. The findings of this study provide a theoretical basis for integrating SR and DA, which will stimulate further research in this direction.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Post-training Large Language Models (LLMs) with explicit reasoning trajectories can enhance their reasoning abilities. However, acquiring such high-quality trajectory data typically demands meticulous supervision from humans or superior models, which can be either expensive or license-constrained. In this paper, we explore how far an LLM can improve its reasoning by self-synthesizing reasoning paths as training data without any additional supervision. Existing self-synthesizing methods, such as STaR, suffer from poor generalization to out-of-domain (OOD) reasoning tasks. We hypothesize it is due to that their self-synthesized reasoning paths are too task-specific, lacking general task-agnostic reasoning guidance. To address this, we propose Reasoning Generalist via Self-Improvement (ReGenesis), a method to self-synthesize reasoning paths as post-training data by progressing from abstract to concrete. More specifically, ReGenesis self-synthesizes reasoning paths by converting general reasoning guidelines into task-specific ones, generating reasoning structures, and subsequently transforming these structures into reasoning paths, without the need for human-designed task-specific examples used in existing methods. We show that ReGenesis achieves superior performance on all in-domain and OOD settings tested compared to existing methods. For six OOD tasks specifically, while previous methods exhibited an average performance decrease of approximately 4.6% after post training, ReGenesis delivers around 6.1% performance improvement. We also conduct in-depth analysis of our framework and show ReGenesis is effective across various LLMs and design choices.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present a geometry-driven method for normalizing dysarthric speech using local Lie group transformations of spectrograms. Time, frequency, and amplitude distortions are modeled as smooth, invertible deformations, parameterized by scalar fields and applied via exponential maps. A neural network is trained to infer these fields from synthetic distortions of typical speech-without using any pathological data. At test time, the model applies an approximate inverse to real dysarthric inputs. Despite zero-shot generalization, we observe substantial ASR gains, including up to 16 percentage points WER reduction on challenging TORGO samples, with no degradation on clean speech.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we propose an optimal sequential procedure for the early detection of potential side effects resulting from the administration of some treatment (e.g. a vaccine, say). The results presented here extend previous results obtained in Wang and Boukai (2024) who study the single side effect case to the case of two (or more) side effects. While the sequential procedure we employ, simultaneously monitors several of the treatment's side effects, the $(\alpha, \beta)$-optimal test we propose does not require any information about the inter-correlation between these potential side effects. However, in all of the subsequent analyses, including the derivations of the exact expressions of the Average Sample Number (ASN), the Power function, and the properties of the post-test (or post-detection) estimators, we accounted specifically, for the correlation between the potential side effects. In the real-life application (such as post-marketing surveillance), the number of available observations is large enough to justify asymptotic analyses of the sequential procedure (testing and post-detection estimation) properties. Accordingly, we also derive the consistency and asymptotic normality of our post-test estimators; results which enable us to also provide (asymptotic, post-detection) confidence intervals for the probabilities of various side-effects. Moreover, to compare two specific side effects, their relative risk plays an important role. We derive the distribution of the estimated relative risk in the asymptotic framework to provide appropriate inference. To illustrate the theoretical results presented, we provide two detailed examples based on the data of side effects on COVID-19 vaccine collected in Nigeria (see Nigeria (see Ilori et al. (2022)).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven the need for increasingly sophisticated inference pipelines and hardware platforms. Modern LLM serving extends beyond traditional prefill-decode workflows, incorporating multi-stage processes such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), key-value (KV) cache retrieval, dynamic model routing, and multi step reasoning. These stages exhibit diverse computational demands, requiring distributed systems that integrate GPUs, ASICs, CPUs, and memory-centric architectures. However, existing simulators lack the fidelity to model these heterogeneous, multi-engine workflows, limiting their ability to inform architectural decisions.   To address this gap, we introduce HERMES, a Heterogeneous Multi-stage LLM inference Execution Simulator. HERMES models diverse request stages; including RAG, KV retrieval, reasoning, prefill, and decode across complex hardware hierarchies. HERMES supports heterogeneous clients executing multiple models concurrently unlike prior frameworks while incorporating advanced batching strategies and multi-level memory hierarchies. By integrating real hardware traces with analytical modeling, HERMES captures critical trade-offs such as memory bandwidth contention, inter-cluster communication latency, and batching efficiency in hybrid CPU-accelerator deployments. Through case studies, we explore the impact of reasoning stages on end-to-end latency, optimal batching strategies for hybrid pipelines, and the architectural implications of remote KV cache retrieval. HERMES empowers system designers to navigate the evolving landscape of LLM inference, providing actionable insights into optimizing hardware-software co-design for next-generation AI workloads.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid scaling of large language model (LLM) training and inference has driven their adoption in semiconductor design across academia and industry. While most prior work evaluates LLMs on hardware description language (HDL) tasks, particularly Verilog, designers are increasingly using high-level synthesis (HLS) to build domain-specific accelerators and complex hardware systems. However, benchmarks and tooling to comprehensively evaluate LLMs for HLS design tasks remain scarce.   To address this, we introduce HLS-Eval, the first complete benchmark and evaluation framework for LLM-driven HLS design. HLS-Eval targets two core tasks: (1) generating HLS code from natural language descriptions, and (2) performing HLS-specific code edits to optimize performance and hardware efficiency. The benchmark includes 94 unique designs drawn from standard HLS benchmarks and novel sources. Each case is prepared via a semi-automated flow that produces a natural language description and a paired testbench for C-simulation and synthesis validation, ensuring each task is "LLM-ready."   Beyond the benchmark, HLS-Eval offers a modular Python framework for automated, parallel evaluation of both local and hosted LLMs. It includes a parallel evaluation engine, direct HLS tool integration, and abstractions for to support different LLM interaction paradigms, enabling rapid prototyping of new benchmarks, tasks, and LLM methods.   We demonstrate HLS-Eval through baseline evaluations of open-source LLMs on Vitis HLS, measuring outputs across four key metrics - parseability, compilability, runnability, and synthesizability - reflecting the iterative HLS design cycle. We also report pass@k metrics, establishing clear baselines and reusable infrastructure for the broader LLM-for-hardware community.   All benchmarks, framework code, and results are open-sourced at https://github.com/stefanpie/hls-eval.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The sub-Neptune frontier has opened a new window into the rich diversity of planetary environments beyond the solar system. The possibility of hycean worlds, with planet-wide oceans and H$_2$-rich atmospheres, significantly expands and accelerates the search for habitable environments elsewhere. Recent JWST transmission spectroscopy of the candidate hycean world K2-18 b in the near-infrared led to the first detections of carbon-bearing molecules CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ in its atmosphere, with a composition consistent with predictions for hycean conditions. The observations also provided a tentative hint of dimethyl sulfide (DMS), a possible biosignature gas, but the inference was of low statistical significance. We report a mid-infrared transmission spectrum of K2-18 b obtained using the JWST MIRI LRS instrument in the ~6-12 $\mu$m range. The spectrum shows distinct features and is inconsistent with a featureless spectrum at 3.4-$\sigma$ significance compared to our canonical model. We find that the spectrum cannot be explained by most molecules predicted for K2-18 b with the exception of DMS and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), also a potential biosignature gas. We report new independent evidence for DMS and/or DMDS in the atmosphere at 3-$\sigma$ significance, with high abundance ($\gtrsim$10 ppmv) of at least one of the two molecules. More observations are needed to increase the robustness of the findings and resolve the degeneracy between DMS and DMDS. The results also highlight the need for additional experimental and theoretical work to determine accurate cross sections of important biosignature gases and identify potential abiotic sources. We discuss the implications of the present findings for the possibility of biological activity on K2-18 b.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The mean-variance portfolio model, based on the risk-return trade-off for optimal asset allocation, remains foundational in portfolio optimization. However, its reliance on restrictive assumptions about asset return distributions limits its applicability to real-world data. Parametric copula structures provide a novel way to overcome these limitations by accounting for asymmetry, heavy tails, and time-varying dependencies. Existing methods have been shown to rely on fixed or static dependence structures, thus overlooking the dynamic nature of the financial market. In this study, a semiparametric model is proposed that combines non-parametrically estimated copulas with parametrically estimated marginals to allow all parameters to dynamically evolve over time. A novel framework was developed that integrates time-varying dependence modeling with flexible empirical beta copula structures. Marginal distributions were modeled using the Skewed Generalized T family. This effectively captures asymmetry and heavy tails and makes the model suitable for predictive inferences in real world scenarios. Furthermore, the model was applied to rolling windows of financial returns from the USA, India and Hong Kong economies to understand the influence of dynamic market conditions. The approach addresses the limitations of models that rely on parametric assumptions. By accounting for asymmetry, heavy tails, and cross-correlated asset prices, the proposed method offers a robust solution for optimizing diverse portfolios in an interconnected financial market. Through adaptive modeling, it allows for better management of risk and return across varying economic conditions, leading to more efficient asset allocation and improved portfolio performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose CAL (Complete Anything in Lidar) for Lidar-based shape-completion in-the-wild. This is closely related to Lidar-based semantic/panoptic scene completion. However, contemporary methods can only complete and recognize objects from a closed vocabulary labeled in existing Lidar datasets. Different to that, our zero-shot approach leverages the temporal context from multi-modal sensor sequences to mine object shapes and semantic features of observed objects. These are then distilled into a Lidar-only instance-level completion and recognition model. Although we only mine partial shape completions, we find that our distilled model learns to infer full object shapes from multiple such partial observations across the dataset. We show that our model can be prompted on standard benchmarks for Semantic and Panoptic Scene Completion, localize objects as (amodal) 3D bounding boxes, and recognize objects beyond fixed class vocabularies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Over the past years, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have demonstrated how AI can solve many perception and generation tasks, such as image classification and text writing, yet reasoning remains a challenge. This paper introduces the FLIP dataset, a benchmark for evaluating AI reasoning capabilities based on human verification tasks on the Idena blockchain. FLIP challenges present users with two orderings of 4 images, requiring them to identify the logically coherent one. By emphasizing sequential reasoning, visual storytelling, and common sense, FLIP provides a unique testbed for multimodal AI systems. Our experiments evaluate state-of-the-art models, leveraging both vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs). Results reveal that even the best open-sourced and closed-sourced models achieve maximum accuracies of 75.5% and 77.9%, respectively, in zero-shot settings, compared to human performance of 95.3%. Captioning models aid reasoning models by providing text descriptions of images, yielding better results than when using the raw images directly, 69.6% vs. 75.2% for Gemini 1.5 Pro. Combining the predictions from 15 models in an ensemble increases the accuracy to 85.2%. These findings highlight the limitations of existing reasoning models and the need for robust multimodal benchmarks like FLIP. The full codebase and dataset will be available at https://github.com/aplesner/FLIP-Reasoning-Challenge.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We consider a Bayesian estimator of sample size (BESS) and an application to oncology dose optimization clinical trials. BESS is built upon three pillars, Sample size, Evidence from observed data, and Confidence in posterior inference. It uses a simple logic of "given the evidence from data, a specific sample size can achieve a degree of confidence in the posterior inference." The key distinction between BESS and standard sample size estimation (SSE) is that SSE, typically based on Frequentist inference, specifies the true parameters values in its calculation while BESS assumes possible outcome from the observed data. As a result, the calibration of the sample size is not based on type I or type II error rates, but on posterior probabilities. We demonstrate that BESS leads to a more interpretable statement for investigators, and can easily accommodates prior information as well as sample size re-estimation. We explore its performance in comparison to the standard SSE and demonstrate its usage through a case study of oncology optimization trial. BESS can be applied to general hypothesis tests.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The scarcity of high-quality public log datasets has become a critical bottleneck in advancing log-based anomaly detection techniques. Current datasets exhibit three fundamental limitations: (1) incomplete event coverage, (2) artificial patterns introduced by static analysis-based generation frameworks, and (3) insufficient semantic awareness. To address these challenges, we present AnomalyGen, the first automated log synthesis framework specifically designed for anomaly detection. Our framework introduces a novel four-phase architecture that integrates enhanced program analysis with Chain-of-Thought reasoning (CoT reasoning), enabling iterative log generation and anomaly annotation without requiring physical system execution. Evaluations on Hadoop and HDFS distributed systems demonstrate that AnomalyGen achieves substantially broader log event coverage (38-95 times improvement over existing datasets) while producing more operationally realistic log sequences compared to static analysis-based approaches. When augmenting benchmark datasets with synthesized logs, we observe maximum F1-score improvements of 3.7% (average 1.8% improvement across three state-of-the-art anomaly detection models). This work not only establishes a high-quality benchmarking resource for automated log analysis but also pioneers a new paradigm for applying large language models (LLMs) in software engineering workflows.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The applications of large language models (LLMs) in various biological domains have been explored recently, but their reasoning ability in complex biological systems, such as pathways, remains underexplored, which is crucial for predicting biological phenomena, formulating hypotheses, and designing experiments. This work explores the potential of LLMs in pathway reasoning. We introduce BioMaze, a dataset with 5.1K complex pathway problems derived from real research, covering various biological contexts including natural dynamic changes, disturbances, additional intervention conditions, and multi-scale research targets. Our evaluation of methods such as CoT and graph-augmented reasoning, shows that LLMs struggle with pathway reasoning, especially in perturbed systems. To address this, we propose PathSeeker, an LLM agent that enhances reasoning through interactive subgraph-based navigation, enabling a more effective approach to handling the complexities of biological systems in a scientifically aligned manner.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The comic production industry requires reference-based line art colorization with high accuracy, efficiency, contextual consistency, and flexible control. A comic page often involves diverse characters, objects, and backgrounds, which complicates the coloring process. Despite advancements in diffusion models for image generation, their application in line art colorization remains limited, facing challenges related to handling extensive reference images, time-consuming inference, and flexible control. We investigate the necessity of extensive contextual image guidance on the quality of line art colorization. To address these challenges, we introduce Cobra, an efficient and versatile method that supports color hints and utilizes over 200 reference images while maintaining low latency. Central to Cobra is a Causal Sparse DiT architecture, which leverages specially designed positional encodings, causal sparse attention, and Key-Value Cache to effectively manage long-context references and ensure color identity consistency. Results demonstrate that Cobra achieves accurate line art colorization through extensive contextual reference, significantly enhancing inference speed and interactivity, thereby meeting critical industrial demands.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Smart contract vulnerabilities pose significant security risks to blockchain systems, potentially leading to severe financial losses. Existing methods face several limitations: (1) Program analysis-based approaches rely on predefined patterns, lacking flexibility for new vulnerability types; (2) Deep learning-based methods lack explanations; (3) Large language model-based approaches suffer from high false positives. We propose MOS, a smart contract vulnerability detection framework based on mixture-of-experts tuning (MOE-Tuning) of large language models. First, we conduct continual pre-training on a large-scale smart contract dataset to provide domain-enhanced initialization. Second, we construct a high-quality MOE-Tuning dataset through a multi-stage pipeline combining LLM generation and expert verification for reliable explanations. Third, we design a vulnerability-aware routing mechanism that activates the most relevant expert networks by analyzing code features and their matching degree with experts. Finally, we extend the feed-forward layers into multiple parallel expert networks, each specializing in specific vulnerability patterns. We employ a dual-objective loss function: one for optimizing detection and explanation performance, and another for ensuring reasonable distribution of vulnerability types to experts through entropy calculation. Experiments show that MOS significantly outperforms existing methods with average improvements of 6.32% in F1 score and 4.80% in accuracy. The vulnerability explanations achieve positive ratings (scores of 3-4 on a 4-point scale) of 82.96%, 85.21% and 94.58% for correctness, completeness, and conciseness through human and LLM evaluation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) raised concerns over potential misuse, such as for spreading misinformation. In response two counter measures emerged: machine learning-based detectors that predict if text is synthetic, and LLM watermarking, which subtly marks generated text for identification and attribution. Meanwhile, humans are known to adjust language to their conversational partners both syntactically and lexically. By implication, it is possible that humans or unwatermarked LLMs could unintentionally mimic properties of LLM generated text, making counter measures unreliable. In this work we investigate the extent to which such conversational adaptation happens. We call the concept $\textit{mimicry}$ and demonstrate that both humans and LLMs end up mimicking, including the watermarking signal even in seemingly improbable settings. This challenges current academic assumptions and suggests that for long-term watermarking to be reliable, the likelihood of false positives needs to be significantly lower, while longer word sequences should be used for seeding watermarking mechanisms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LLMs exhibit advanced reasoning capabilities, offering the potential to transform natural language questions into mathematical models. However, existing open-source datasets in operations research domain lack detailed annotations of the modeling process, such as variable definitions, focusing solely on objective values, which hinders reinforcement learning applications. To address this, we release the StructuredOR dataset, annotated with comprehensive labels that capture the complete mathematical modeling process. We further propose BPP-Search, an algorithm that integrates reinforcement learning into a tree-of-thought structure using Beam search, a Process reward model, and a pairwise Preference algorithm. This approach enables efficient exploration of tree structures, avoiding exhaustive search while improving accuracy. Extensive experiments on StructuredOR, NL4OPT, and MAMO-ComplexLP datasets show that BPP-Search significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In tree-based reasoning, BPP-Search excels in accuracy and efficiency, enabling faster retrieval of correct solutions. The StructuredOR dataset is available at https://github.com/tengwang0318/StructuredOR.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities that benefits from online reinforcement learning (RL). These capabilities have primarily been demonstrated within the left-to-right autoregressive (AR) generation paradigm. In contrast, non-autoregressive paradigms based on diffusion generate text in a coarse-to-fine manner. Although recent diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have achieved competitive language modeling performance compared to their AR counterparts, it remains unclear if dLLMs can also leverage recent advances in LLM reasoning. To this end, we propose d1, a framework to adapt pre-trained masked dLLMs into reasoning models via a combination of supervised finetuning (SFT) and RL. Specifically, we develop and extend techniques to improve reasoning in pretrained dLLMs: (a) we utilize a masked SFT technique to distill knowledge and instill self-improvement behavior directly from existing datasets, and (b) we introduce a novel critic-free, policy-gradient based RL algorithm called diffu-GRPO. Through empirical studies, we investigate the performance of different post-training recipes on multiple mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks. We find that d1 yields the best performance and significantly improves performance of a state-of-the-art dLLM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) may have formed in the early Universe due to the collapse of super-horizon curvature fluctuations. Simulations of PBH formation have been essential for inferring the initial conditions that lead to black hole formation and for studying their properties and impact on our Universe. The Misner-Sharp formalism is commonly used as a standard approach for these simulations. Recently, type-II fluctuations, characterized by a non-monotonic areal radius, have gained interest. In the standard Misner-Sharp approach for simulating PBH formation with these fluctuations, the evolution equations exhibit divergent terms ($0/0$), which complicate and prevent the simulations. We formulate a new approach to overcome this issue in a simple manner by using the trace of the extrinsic curvature as an auxiliary variable, allowing simulations of type-II fluctuations within the Misner-Sharp formalism. Using a set of standard exponential-shaped curvature profiles, we apply our new approach and numerical code based on pseudospectral methods to study the time evolution of the gravitational collapse, threshold values of type A/B PBHs and PBH mass. Interestingly, we identify cases of type-II fluctuations that do not necessarily result in PBH formation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Personality assessment, particularly through situational judgment tests (SJTs), is a vital tool for psychological research, talent selection, and educational evaluation. This study explores the potential of GPT-4, a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM), to automate the generation of personality situational judgment tests (PSJTs) in Chinese. Traditional SJT development is labor-intensive and prone to biases, while GPT-4 offers a scalable, efficient alternative. Two studies were conducted: Study 1 evaluated the impact of prompt design and temperature settings on content validity, finding that optimized prompts with a temperature of 1.0 produced creative and accurate items. Study 2 assessed the psychometric properties of GPT-4-generated PSJTs, revealing that they demonstrated satisfactory reliability and validity, surpassing the performance of manually developed tests in measuring the Big Five personality traits. This research highlights GPT-4's effectiveness in developing high-quality PSJTs, providing a scalable and innovative method for psychometric test development. These findings expand the possibilities of automatic item generation and the application of LLMs in psychology, and offer practical implications for streamlining test development processes in resource-limited settings.

This method involves the architect's close collaboration with LLM-fueled tooling over the whole process. The architect is guided through Domain Model creation, Use Case specification, architectural decisions, and architecture evaluation. While the architect can take complete control of the process and the results, and use the tooling as a building set, they can follow the intended process for maximum tooling support. The preliminary results suggest the feasibility of this process and indicate major time savings for the architect.

But what -- if anything -- do LLMs actually know? In this paper, I argue that LLMs can acquire tacit knowledge as defined by Martin Davies (1990). Whereas Davies himself denies that neural networks can acquire tacit knowledge, I demonstrate that certain architectural features of LLMs satisfy the constraints of semantic description, syntactic structure, and causal systematicity. Thus, tacit knowledge may serve as a conceptual framework for describing, explaining, and intervening on LLMs and their behavior.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, fine-tuning Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) often leads to the issue of spurious correlations, which negatively impacts performance, particularly when dealing with out-of-distribution data. To address this problem, we propose SALAD}(Structure Aware and LLM-driven Augmented Data), a novel approach designed to enhance model robustness and generalization by generating structure-aware and counterfactually augmented data for contrastive learning. Our method leverages a tagging-based approach to generate structure-aware positive samples and utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate counterfactual negative samples with diverse sentence patterns. By applying contrastive learning, SALAD enables the model to focus on learning the structural relationships between key sentence components while minimizing reliance on spurious correlations. We validate our approach through experiments on three tasks: Sentiment Classification, Sexism Detection, and Natural Language Inference. The results demonstrate that SALAD not only improves model robustness and performance across different environments but also enhances generalization to out-of-distribution datasets and cross-domain scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) guardrail systems are designed to protect against prompt injection and jailbreak attacks. However, they remain vulnerable to evasion techniques. We demonstrate two approaches for bypassing LLM prompt injection and jailbreak detection systems via traditional character injection methods and algorithmic Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) evasion techniques. Through testing against six prominent protection systems, including Microsoft's Azure Prompt Shield and Meta's Prompt Guard, we show that both methods can be used to evade detection while maintaining adversarial utility achieving in some instances up to 100% evasion success. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adversaries can enhance Attack Success Rates (ASR) against black-box targets by leveraging word importance ranking computed by offline white-box models. Our findings reveal vulnerabilities within current LLM protection mechanisms and highlight the need for more robust guardrail systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The nature of sub-Neptunes is one of the hottest topics in exoplanetary science. Temperate sub-Neptunes are of special interest because some could be habitable. Here, we consider whether these planets might instead be rocky worlds with thick, hot atmospheres. Can recent JWST observations of TOI-270 d be understood in terms of such a model? We perform thermochemical equilibrium calculations to infer conditions of quenching of C-H-O-N species. Our results indicate apparent CO$_2$-CH$_4$ equilibrium between ~900 and ~1100 K. The CO abundance should be quenched higher in the atmosphere where the equilibrium CO/CO$_2$ ratio is lower, potentially explaining a lack of CO. N$_2$ is predicted to dominate the nitrogen budget. We confirm that the atmosphere of TOI-270 d is strongly enriched in both C and O$_g$$_a$$_s$ relative to protosolar H, whereas N is likely to be less enriched or even depleted. We attempt to reproduce these enrichments by modeling the atmosphere as nebular gas that extracted heavy elements from accreted solids. This type of model can explain the C/H and O$_g$$_a$$_s$/H ratios, but despite supersolar C/N ratios provided by solids, the NH$_3$ abundance will probably be too high unless there is a nitrogen sink in addition to N$_2$. A magma ocean may be implied, and indeed the oxygen fugacity of the deep atmosphere seems sufficiently low to support the sequestration of reduced N in silicate melt. The evaluation presented here demonstrates that exoplanetary geochemistry now approaches a level of sophistication comparable to that achieved within our own solar system.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Along with the proliferating research interest in Semantic Communication (SemCom), Joint Source Channel Coding (JSCC) has dominated the attention due to the widely assumed existence in efficiently delivering information semantics. %has emerged as a pivotal area of research, aiming to enhance the efficiency and reliability of information transmission through deep learning-based methods. Nevertheless, this paper challenges the conventional JSCC paradigm, and advocates for adoption of Separate Source Channel Coding (SSCC) to enjoy the underlying more degree of freedom for optimization. We demonstrate that SSCC, after leveraging the strengths of Large Language Model (LLM) for source coding and Error Correction Code Transformer (ECCT) complemented for channel decoding, offers superior performance over JSCC. Our proposed framework also effectively highlights the compatibility challenges between SemCom approaches and digital communication systems, particularly concerning the resource costs associated with the transmission of high precision floating point numbers. Through comprehensive evaluations, we establish that empowered by LLM-based compression and ECCT-enhanced error correction, SSCC remains a viable and effective solution for modern communication systems. In other words, separate source and channel coding is still what we need!

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current research in adversarial robustness of LLMs focuses on discrete input manipulations in the natural language space, which can be directly transferred to closed-source models. However, this approach neglects the steady progression of open-source models. As open-source models advance in capability, ensuring their safety also becomes increasingly imperative. Yet, attacks tailored to open-source LLMs that exploit full model access remain largely unexplored. We address this research gap and propose the embedding space attack, which directly attacks the continuous embedding representation of input tokens. We find that embedding space attacks circumvent model alignments and trigger harmful behaviors more efficiently than discrete attacks or model fine-tuning. Furthermore, we present a novel threat model in the context of unlearning and show that embedding space attacks can extract supposedly deleted information from unlearned LLMs across multiple datasets and models. Our findings highlight embedding space attacks as an important threat model in open-source LLMs. Trigger Warning: the appendix contains LLM-generated text with violence and harassment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep generative models have been studied and developed primarily in the context of natural images and computer vision. This has spurred the development of (Bayesian) methods that use these generative models for inverse problems in image restoration, such as denoising, inpainting, and super-resolution. In recent years, generative modeling for Bayesian inference on sensory data has also gained traction. Nevertheless, the direct application of generative modeling techniques initially designed for natural images on raw sensory data is not straightforward, requiring solutions that deal with high dynamic range signals acquired from multiple sensors or arrays of sensors that interfere with each other, and that typically acquire data at a very high rate. Moreover, the exact physical data-generating process is often complex or unknown. As a consequence, approximate models are used, resulting in discrepancies between model predictions and the observations that are non-Gaussian, in turn complicating the Bayesian inverse problem. Finally, sensor data is often used in real-time processing or decision-making systems, imposing stringent requirements on, e.g., latency and throughput. In this paper, we will discuss some of these challenges and offer approaches to address them, all in the context of high-rate real-time sensing applications in automotive radar and medical imaging.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Designing Verilog modules requires meticulous attention to correctness, efficiency, and adherence to design specifications. However, manually writing Verilog code remains a complex and time-consuming task that demands both expert knowledge and iterative refinement. Leveraging recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and their structured text generation capabilities, we propose VeriMind, an agentic LLM framework for Verilog code generation that significantly automates and optimizes the synthesis process. Unlike traditional LLM-based code generators, VeriMind employs a structured reasoning approach: given a user-provided prompt describing design requirements, the system first formulates a detailed train of thought before the final Verilog code is generated. This multi-step methodology enhances interpretability, accuracy, and adaptability in hardware design. In addition, we introduce a novel evaluation metric-pass@ARC-which combines the conventional pass@k measure with Average Refinement Cycles (ARC) to capture both success rate and the efficiency of iterative refinement. Experimental results on diverse hardware design tasks demonstrated that our approach achieved up to $8.3\%$ improvement on pass@k metric and $8.1\%$ on pass@ARC metric. These findings underscore the transformative potential of agentic LLMs in automated hardware design, RTL development, and digital system synthesis.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> An AI system can create and maintain knowledge only to the extent that it can verify that knowledge itself. Recent work on long Chain-of-Thought reasoning has demonstrated great potential of LLMs on solving competitive problems, but their verification ability remains to be weak and not sufficiently investigated. In this paper, we propose Heimdall, the long CoT verification LLM that can accurately judge the correctness of solutions. With pure reinforcement learning, we boost the verification accuracy from 62.5% to 94.5% on competitive math problems. By scaling with repeated sampling, the accuracy further increases to 97.5%. Through human evaluation, Heimdall demonstrates impressive generalization capabilities, successfully detecting most issues in challenging math proofs, the type of which is not included during training. Furthermore, we propose Pessimistic Verification to extend the functionality of Heimdall to scaling up the problem solving. It calls Heimdall to judge the solutions from a solver model and based on the pessimistic principle, selects the most likely correct solution with the least uncertainty. Taking DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B as the solver model, Pessimistic Verification improves the solution accuracy on AIME2025 from 54.2% to 70.0% with 16x compute budget and to 83.3% with more compute budget. With the stronger solver Gemini 2.5 Pro, the score reaches 93.0%. Finally, we prototype an automatic knowledge discovery system, a ternary system where one poses questions, another provides solutions, and the third verifies the solutions. Using the data synthesis work NuminaMath for the first two components, Heimdall effectively identifies problematic records within the dataset and reveals that nearly half of the data is flawed, which interestingly aligns with the recent ablation studies from NuminaMath.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The properties of the entire neutron star population can be inferred by modeling their evolution, from birth to the present, through pulsar population synthesis. This involves simulating a mock population, applying observational filters, and comparing the resulting sources to the limited subset of detected pulsars. We specifically focus on the magneto-rotational properties of Galactic isolated neutron stars and provide new insights into the intrinsic radio luminosity law by combining pulsar population synthesis with a simulation-based inference (SBI) technique called truncated sequential neural posterior estimation (TSNPE). We employ TSNPE to train a neural density estimator on simulated pulsar populations to approximate the posterior distribution of the underlying parameters. This technique efficiently explores the parameter space by concentrating on regions that are most likely to match the observed data thus allowing a significant reduction in training dataset size. We demonstrate the efficiency of TSNPE over standard neural posterior estimation (NPE), achieving robust inferences of magneto-rotational parameters consistent with previous studies using only around 4% of the simulations required by NPE approaches. Moreover, for the first time, we incorporate data from the Thousand Pulsar Array (TPA) program on MeerKAT, the largest unified sample of neutron stars with consistent fluxes measurement to date, to help constrain the stars' intrinsic radio luminosity. We find that adding flux information as an input to the neural network largely improves the constraints on the pulsars' radio luminosity, as well as improving the estimates on other input parameters.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The growing and evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats necessitates the development of supporting tools and platforms that allow for the creation of realistic IT environments operating within virtual, controlled settings as Cyber Ranges (CRs). CRs can be exploited for analyzing vulnerabilities and experimenting with the effectiveness of devised countermeasures, as well as serving as training environments for building cyber security skills and abilities for IT operators. This paper proposes ARCeR as an innovative solution for the automatic generation and deployment of CRs, starting from user-provided descriptions in a natural language. ARCeR relies on the Agentic RAG paradigm, which allows it to fully exploit state-of-art AI technologies. Experimental results show that ARCeR is able to successfully process prompts even in cases that LLMs or basic RAG systems are not able to cope with. Furthermore, ARCeR is able to target any CR framework provided that specific knowledge is made available to it.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The growing demand for highly reliable communication systems drives the research and development of algorithms that identify and correct errors during data transmission and storage. This need becomes even more critical in hard-to-access or sensitive systems, such as those used in space applications, passenger transportation, and the financial sector. In this context, Error Correction Codes (ECCs) are essential tools for ensuring a certain level of reliability. This work proposes a technique to enhance ECC error correction capability by overlapping data regions. The approach consists of protecting the same data area with multiple ECCs organized in a two-dimensional structure, enabling logical inferences that correlate the codes and improve their error detection and correction capabilities. More specifically, the overlapping is characterized by the organization of multiple ECCs, whose intersection exclusively covers the entire data region. Different configurations of overlapping ECCs were analyzed to evaluate the proposal regarding error detection and correction capability, scalability, and reliability. Experimental results confirm the technique's effectiveness and demonstrate its high scalability potential, reducing the need for redundancy bits relative to the number of data bits. Furthermore, comparisons with state-of-the-art ECC approaches indicate the technique's applicability in critical systems that require high reliability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in sentence-level machine translation, but scaling to document-level translation remains challenging, particularly in modeling long-range dependencies and discourse phenomena across sentences and paragraphs. In this work, we propose a method to improve LLM-based long-document translation through targeted fine-tuning on high-quality document-level data, which we curate and introduce as DocBlocks. Our approach supports multiple translation paradigms, including direct document-to-document and chunk-level translation, by integrating instructions both with and without surrounding context. This enables models to better capture cross-sentence dependencies while maintaining strong sentence-level translation performance. Experimental results show that incorporating multiple translation paradigms improves document-level translation quality and inference speed compared to prompting and agent-based methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite recent advances in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), these models still suffer from generating hallucinatory responses that do not align with the visual input provided. To mitigate such hallucinations, we introduce Efficient Contrastive Decoding (ECD), a simple method that leverages probabilistic hallucination detection to shift the output distribution towards contextually accurate answers at inference time. By contrasting token probabilities and hallucination scores, ECD subtracts hallucinated concepts from the original distribution, effectively suppressing hallucinations. Notably, our proposed method can be applied to any open-source LVLM and does not require additional LVLM training. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and across different LVLMs. Our experiments show that ECD effectively mitigates hallucinations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with respect to performance on LVLM benchmarks and computation time.

  Extensions for Multi-Step LLM Agent Tasks</h2>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as autonomous agents for multi-step tasks. However, most existing frameworks fail to maintain a structured understanding of the task state, often relying on linear prompt concatenation or shallow memory buffers. This leads to brittle performance, frequent hallucinations, and poor long-range coherence. In this work, we propose the Task Memory Engine (TME), a lightweight and structured memory module that tracks task execution using a hierarchical Task Memory Tree (TMT). Each node in the tree corresponds to a task step, storing relevant input, output, status, and sub-task relationships. We introduce a prompt synthesis method that dynamically generates LLM prompts based on the active node path, significantly improving execution consistency and contextual grounding. Through case studies and comparative experiments on multi-step agent tasks, we demonstrate that TME leads to better task completion accuracy and more interpretable behavior with minimal implementation overhead. A reference implementation of the core TME components is available at https://github.com/biubiutomato/TME-Agent, including basic examples and structured memory integration. While the current implementation uses a tree-based structure, TME is designed to be graph-aware, supporting reusable substeps, converging task paths, and shared dependencies. This lays the groundwork for future DAG-based memory architectures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language model unlearning has become a critical challenge in ensuring safety and controlled model behavior by removing undesired data-model influences from the pretrained model while preserving general utility. Significant recent efforts have been dedicated to developing LLM unlearning benchmarks such as WMDP (Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy) and MUSE (Machine Unlearning Six-way Evaluation), facilitating standardized unlearning performance assessment and method comparison. Despite their usefulness, we uncover for the first time a novel coreset effect within these benchmarks. Specifically, we find that LLM unlearning achieved with the original (full) forget set can be effectively maintained using a significantly smaller subset (functioning as a "coreset"), e.g., as little as 5% of the forget set, even when selected at random. This suggests that LLM unlearning in these benchmarks can be performed surprisingly easily, even in an extremely low-data regime. We demonstrate that this coreset effect remains strong, regardless of the LLM unlearning method used, such as NPO (Negative Preference Optimization) and RMU (Representation Misdirection Unlearning), the popular ones in these benchmarks. The surprisingly strong coreset effect is also robust across various data selection methods, ranging from random selection to more sophisticated heuristic approaches. We explain the coreset effect in LLM unlearning through a keyword-based perspective, showing that keywords extracted from the forget set alone contribute significantly to unlearning effectiveness and indicating that current unlearning is driven by a compact set of high-impact tokens rather than the entire dataset. We further justify the faithfulness of coreset-unlearned models along additional dimensions, such as mode connectivity and robustness to jailbreaking attacks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reconstructing posed 3D human models from monocular images has important applications in the sports industry, including performance tracking, injury prevention and virtual training. In this work, we combine 3D human pose and shape estimation with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a representation of the scene composed of a mixture of Gaussians. This allows training or fine-tuning a human model predictor on multi-view images alone, without 3D ground truth. Predicting such mixtures for a human from a single input image is challenging due to self-occlusions and dependence on articulations, while also needing to retain enough flexibility to accommodate a variety of clothes and poses. Our key observation is that the vertices of standardized human meshes (such as SMPL) can provide an adequate spatial density and approximate initial position for the Gaussians. We can then train a transformer model to jointly predict comparatively small adjustments to these positions, as well as the other 3DGS attributes and the SMPL parameters. We show empirically that this combination (using only multi-view supervision) can achieve near real-time inference of 3D human models from a single image without expensive diffusion models or 3D points supervision, thus making it ideal for the sport industry at any level. More importantly, rendering is an effective auxiliary objective to refine 3D pose estimation by accounting for clothes and other geometric variations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In information retrieval (IR), providing appropriate clarifications to better understand users' information needs is crucial for building a proactive search-oriented dialogue system. Due to the strong in-context learning ability of large language models (LLMs), recent studies investigate prompting methods to generate clarifications using few-shot or Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts. However, vanilla CoT prompting does not distinguish the characteristics of different information needs, making it difficult to understand how LLMs resolve ambiguities in user queries. In this work, we focus on the concept of ambiguity for clarification, seeking to model and integrate ambiguities in the clarification process. To this end, we comprehensively study the impact of prompting schemes based on reasoning and ambiguity for clarification. The idea is to enhance the reasoning abilities of LLMs by limiting CoT to predict first ambiguity types that can be interpreted as instructions to clarify, then correspondingly generate clarifications. We name this new prompting scheme Ambiguity Type-Chain of Thought (AT-CoT). Experiments are conducted on various datasets containing human-annotated clarifying questions to compare AT-CoT with multiple baselines. We also perform user simulations to implicitly measure the quality of generated clarifications under various IR scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Earth Observation (EO) provides critical planetary data for environmental monitoring, disaster management, climate science, and other scientific domains. Here we ask: Are AI systems ready for reliable Earth Observation? We introduce \datasetnamenospace, a benchmark of 140 yes/no questions from NASA Earth Observatory articles across 13 topics and 17 satellite sensors. Using Google Earth Engine API as a tool, LLM agents can only achieve an accuracy of 33% because the code fails to run over 58% of the time. We improve the failure rate for open models by fine-tuning synthetic data, allowing much smaller models (Llama-3.1-8B) to achieve comparable accuracy to much larger ones (e.g., DeepSeek-R1). Taken together, our findings identify significant challenges to be solved before AI agents can automate earth observation, and suggest paths forward.

Existing watermarking schemes for sampled text often face trade-offs between maintaining text quality and ensuring robust detection against various attacks. To address these issues, we propose a novel watermarking scheme that improves both detectability and text quality by introducing a cumulative watermark entropy threshold. Our approach is compatible with and generalizes existing sampling functions, enhancing adaptability. Experimental results across multiple LLMs show that our scheme significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving over 80\% improvements on widely-used datasets, e.g., MATH and GSM8K, while maintaining high detection accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, overconfidence in large language models (LLMs) has garnered considerable attention due to its fundamental importance in quantifying the trustworthiness of LLM generation. However, existing approaches prompt the \textit{black box LLMs} to produce their confidence (\textit{verbalized confidence}), which can be subject to many biases and hallucinations. Inspired by a different aspect of overconfidence in cognitive science called \textit{overprecision}, we designed a framework for its study in black box LLMs. This framework contains three main phases: 1) generation, 2) refinement and 3) evaluation. In the generation phase we prompt the LLM to generate answers to numerical questions in the form of intervals with a certain level of confidence. This confidence level is imposed in the prompt and not required for the LLM to generate as in previous approaches. We use various prompting techniques and use the same prompt multiple times to gauge the effects of randomness in the generation process. In the refinement phase, answers from the previous phase are refined to generate better answers. The LLM answers are evaluated and studied in the evaluation phase to understand its internal workings. This study allowed us to gain various insights into LLM overprecision: 1) LLMs are highly uncalibrated for numerical tasks 2) {\color{blue}there is no correlation between the length of the interval and the imposed confidence level, which can be symptomatic of a a) lack of understanding of the concept of confidence or b) inability to adjust self-confidence by following instructions}, {\color{blue}3)} LLM numerical precision differs depending on the task, scale of answer and prompting technique {\color{blue}4) Refinement of answers doesn't improve precision in most cases}. We believe this study offers new perspectives on LLM overconfidence and serves as a strong baseline for overprecision in LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present a novel framework that bridges the gap between the interpretability of decision trees and the advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to predict startup success. Our approach leverages chain-of-thought prompting to generate detailed reasoning logs, which are subsequently distilled into structured, human-understandable logical rules. The pipeline integrates multiple enhancements - efficient data ingestion, a two-step refinement process, ensemble candidate sampling, simulated reinforcement learning scoring, and persistent memory - to ensure both stable decision-making and transparent output. Experimental evaluations on curated startup datasets demonstrate that our combined pipeline improves precision by 54% from 0.225 to 0.346 and accuracy by 50% from 0.46 to 0.70 compared to a standalone OpenAI o3 model. Notably, our model achieves over 2x the precision of a random classifier (16%). By combining state-of-the-art AI reasoning with explicit rule-based explanations, our method not only augments traditional decision-making processes but also facilitates expert intervention and continuous policy refinement. This work lays the foundation for the implementation of interpretable LLM-powered decision frameworks in high-stakes investment environments and other domains that require transparent and data-driven insights.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Learning causal relationships among a set of variables, as encoded by a directed acyclic graph, from observational data is complicated by the presence of unobserved confounders. Instrumental variables (IVs) are a popular remedy for this issue, but most existing methods either assume the validity of all IVs or postulate a specific form of relationship, such as a linear model, between the primary variables and the IVs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a partially linear structural equation model for causal discovery and inference that accommodates potentially invalid IVs and allows for general dependence of the primary variables on the IVs. We establish identification under this semiparametric model by constructing surrogate valid IVs, and develop a finite-sample procedure for estimating the causal structures and effects. Theoretically, we show that our procedure consistently learns the causal structures, yields asymptotically normal estimates, and effectively controls the false discovery rate in edge recovery. Simulation studies demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing competitors, and an application to inferring gene regulatory networks in Alzheimer's disease illustrates its usefulness.

We propose an efficient representation of the floorplanning problem and introduce a method for generating high-quality datasets tailored for model fine-tuning. We fine-tune LLMs on datasets with a specified number of modules to test whether LLMs can emulate the human ability to quickly count and arrange items. Our experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs, particularly GPT4o-mini, achieve high success and optimal rates while attaining relatively low average dead space. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs as promising solutions for complex optimization tasks in VLSI design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern retrieval systems do not rely on a single ranking model to construct their rankings. Instead, they generally take a cascading approach where a sequence of ranking models are applied in multiple re-ranking stages. Thereby, they balance the quality of the top-K ranking with computational costs by limiting the number of documents each model re-ranks. However, the cascading approach is not the only way models can interact to form a retrieval system.   We propose the concept of compound retrieval systems as a broader class of retrieval systems that apply multiple prediction models. This encapsulates cascading models but also allows other types of interactions than top-K re-ranking. In particular, we enable interactions with large language models (LLMs) which can provide relative relevance comparisons. We focus on the optimization of compound retrieval system design which uniquely involves learning where to apply the component models and how to aggregate their predictions into a final ranking. This work shows how our compound approach can combine the classic BM25 retrieval model with state-of-the-art (pairwise) LLM relevance predictions, while optimizing a given ranking metric and efficiency target. Our experimental results show optimized compound retrieval systems provide better trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency than cascading approaches, even when applied in a self-supervised manner.   With the introduction of compound retrieval systems, we hope to inspire the information retrieval field to more out-of-the-box thinking on how prediction models can interact to form rankings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The performance of deep learning models depends heavily on test samples at runtime, and shifts from the training data distribution can significantly reduce accuracy. Test-time adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adapting models during inference without requiring labeled test data or access to the original training set. While research has explored TTA from various perspectives like algorithmic complexity, data and class distribution shifts, model architectures, and offline versus continuous learning, constraints specific to mobile and edge devices remain underexplored. We propose BoTTA, a benchmark designed to evaluate TTA methods under practical constraints on mobile and edge devices. Our evaluation targets four key challenges caused by limited resources and usage conditions: (i) limited test samples, (ii) limited exposure to categories, (iii) diverse distribution shifts, and (iv) overlapping shifts within a sample. We assess state-of-the-art TTA methods under these scenarios using benchmark datasets and report system-level metrics on a real testbed. Furthermore, unlike prior work, we align with on-device requirements by advocating periodic adaptation instead of continuous inference-time adaptation. Experiments reveal key insights: many recent TTA algorithms struggle with small datasets, fail to generalize to unseen categories, and depend on the diversity and complexity of distribution shifts. BoTTA also reports device-specific resource use. For example, while SHOT improves accuracy by $2.25\times$ with $512$ adaptation samples, it uses $1.08\times$ peak memory on Raspberry Pi versus the base model. BoTTA offers actionable guidance for TTA in real-world, resource-constrained deployments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present a Bayesian dynamic borrowing (BDB) approach to enhance the quantitative identification of adverse events (AEs) in spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs). The method embeds a robust meta-analytic predictive (MAP) prior within a Bayesian hierarchical model and incorporates semantic similarity measures (SSMs) to enable weighted information sharing from MedDRA Preferred Terms (PTs) that are clinical similar to the target PT. This continuous similarity-based borrowing addresses limitation of rigid hierarchical grouping in current disproportionality analysis (DPA).   Using data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) between 2015 and 2019, we evalute this approach - termed IC SSM - against standard Information Component (IC) analysis and IC with borrowing at the MedDRA high-level group term (HLGT) level. A novel references set (PVLens), derived from FDA product label updates, enabled prospective evaluation of method performance in identifying AEs prior to official labeling.   The IC SSM approach demonstrated improved sensitivity compared to both traditional IC and HLGT-based borrowing, with minor trade-offs in F1 scores and Youden's index. IC SSM consistently identified more true positives and detected signals over 5 months sooner than traditional IC. Despite a marginally lower aggregate Youden's index, IC SSM showed higher performance in the early post-marketing period, providing more stable and relevant estimates than HLGT-based borrowing and traditional IC.   These findings support the use of SSM-informed Bayesian borrowing as a scalable and context-aware enhancement to traditional DPA methods. Future research should validate this approach across other datasets and explore additional similarity metrics and Bayesian inference strategies using case-level data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text-to-Video generation, which utilizes the provided text prompt to generate high-quality videos, has drawn increasing attention and achieved great success due to the development of diffusion models recently. Existing methods mainly rely on a pre-trained text encoder to capture the semantic information and perform cross attention with the encoded text prompt to guide the generation of video. However, when it comes to complex prompts that contain dynamic scenes and multiple camera-view transformations, these methods can not decompose the overall information into separate scenes, as well as fail to smoothly change scenes based on the corresponding camera-views. To solve these problems, we propose a novel method, i.e., Modular-Cam. Specifically, to better understand a given complex prompt, we utilize a large language model to analyze user instructions and decouple them into multiple scenes together with transition actions. To generate a video containing dynamic scenes that match the given camera-views, we incorporate the widely-used temporal transformer into the diffusion model to ensure continuity within a single scene and propose CamOperator, a modular network based module that well controls the camera movements. Moreover, we propose AdaControlNet, which utilizes ControlNet to ensure consistency across scenes and adaptively adjusts the color tone of the generated video. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments prove our proposed Modular-Cam's strong capability of generating multi-scene videos together with its ability to achieve fine-grained control of camera movements.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Abundant, well-annotated multimodal data in remote sensing are pivotal for aligning complex visual remote sensing (RS) scenes with human language, enabling the development of specialized vision language models across diverse RS interpretation tasks. However, annotating RS images with rich linguistic semantics at scale demands expertise in RS and substantial human labor, making it costly and often impractical. In this study, we propose a workflow that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate multimodal datasets with semantically rich captions at scale from plain OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for images sourced from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. This approach facilitates the generation of paired remote sensing data and can be readily scaled up using openly available data. Within this framework, we present RSTeller, a multimodal dataset comprising over 1.3 million RS images, each accompanied by two descriptive captions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSTeller enhances the performance of multiple existing vision language models for RS scene understanding through continual pre-training. Our methodology significantly reduces the manual effort and expertise needed for annotating remote sensing imagery while democratizing access to high-quality annotated data. This advancement fosters progress in visual language modeling and encourages broader participation in remote sensing research and applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Incomplete data, confounding effects, and violations of the Markov property are interrelated problems which are ubiquitous in Reinforcement Learning applications. We introduce the concept of ``partial ignorabilty" and leverage it to establish a novel convergence theorem for adaptive Reinforcement Learning. This theoretical result relaxes the Markov assumption on the stochastic process underlying conventional $Q$-learning, deploying a generalized form of the Robbins-Monro stochastic approximation theorem to establish optimality. This result has clear downstream implications for most active subfields of Reinforcement Learning, with clear paths for extension to the field of Causal Inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Centralization enhances the efficiency of Artificial Intelligence (AI), but it also brings critical challenges, such as single points of failure, inherent biases, data privacy concerns, and scalability issues, for AI systems. These problems are especially common in closed-source large language models (LLMs), where user data is collected and used with full transparency. To address these issues, blockchain-based decentralized AI (DeAI) has been introduced. DeAI leverages the strengths of blockchain technologies to enhance the transparency, security, decentralization, as well as trustworthiness of AI systems. Although DeAI has been widely developed in industry, a comprehensive understanding of state-of-the-art practical DeAI solutions is still lacking. In this work, we present a Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) for blockchain-based DeAI solutions. We propose a taxonomy to classify existing DeAI protocols based on the model lifecycle. Based on this taxonomy, we provide a structured way to clarify the landscape of DeAI protocols and identify their similarities and differences. Specifically, we analyze the functionalities of blockchain in DeAI, investigate how blockchain features contribute to enhancing the security, transparency, and trustworthiness of AI processes, and also ensure fair incentives for AI data and model contributors. In addition, we provide key insights and research gaps in developing DeAI protocols for future research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As Ethereum continues to thrive, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) has become the cornerstone powering tens of millions of active smart contracts. Intuitively, security issues in EVMs could lead to inconsistent behaviors among smart contracts or even denial-of-service of the entire blockchain network. However, to the best of our knowledge, only a limited number of studies focus on the security of EVMs. Moreover, they suffer from 1) insufficient test input diversity and invalid semantics; and 2) the inability to automatically identify bugs and locate root causes. To bridge this gap, we propose OpDiffer, a differential testing framework for EVM, which takes advantage of LLMs and static analysis methods to address the above two limitations. We conducted the largest-scale evaluation, covering nine EVMs and uncovering 26 previously unknown bugs, 22 of which have been confirmed by developers and three have been assigned CNVD IDs. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, OpDiffer can improve code coverage by at most 71.06%, 148.40% and 655.56%, respectively. Through an analysis of real-world deployed Ethereum contracts, we estimate that 7.21% of the contracts could trigger our identified EVM bugs under certain environmental settings, potentially resulting in severe negative impact on the Ethereum ecosystem.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple clients, such as mobile phones and IoT devices, to collaboratively train a global machine learning model while keeping their data localized. However, recent studies have revealed that the training phase of FL is vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, such as attribute inference attacks (AIA), where adversaries exploit exchanged messages and auxiliary public information to uncover sensitive attributes of targeted clients. While these attacks have been extensively studied in the context of classification tasks, their impact on regression tasks remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing novel model-based AIAs specifically designed for regression tasks in FL environments. Our approach considers scenarios where adversaries can either eavesdrop on exchanged messages or directly interfere with the training process. We benchmark our proposed attacks against state-of-the-art methods using real-world datasets. The results demonstrate a significant increase in reconstruction accuracy, particularly in heterogeneous client datasets, a common scenario in FL. The efficacy of our model-based AIAs makes them better candidates for empirically quantifying privacy leakage for federated regression tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We study the problem of a run and tumble particle in a harmonic trap, with a finite run and tumble time, by a direct integration of the equation of motion. An exact 1D steady state distribution, diagram laws and a programmable Volterra difference equation are derived to calculate any order of moments in any other dimension, both for steady state as well as the Laplace transform in time for the intermediate states. We also use the moments to infer the distribution by considering a Gaussian quadrature for the corresponding measure, and from the scaling law of high order moments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Collecting human preference feedback is often expensive, leading recent works to develop principled algorithms to select them more efficiently. However, these works assume that the underlying reward function is linear, an assumption that does not hold in many real-life applications, such as online recommendation and LLM alignment. To address this limitation, we propose Neural-ADB, an algorithm based on the neural contextual dueling bandit framework that provides a principled and practical method for collecting human preference feedback when the underlying latent reward function is non-linear. We theoretically show that when preference feedback follows the Bradley-Terry-Luce model, the worst sub-optimality gap of the policy learned by Neural-ADB decreases at a sub-linear rate as the preference dataset increases. Our experimental results on problem instances derived from synthetic preference datasets further validate the effectiveness of Neural-ADB.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely regarded as errors - outputs that deviate from factual accuracy. However, in creative or exploratory contexts, these "mistakes" may represent unexpected avenues for innovation. We introduce Purposefully Induced Psychosis (PIP), a novel approach that amplifies LLM hallucinations for imaginative tasks such as speculative fiction, interactive storytelling, and mixed-reality simulations. Drawing on Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, where Pip's "madness" reveals profound insight, we reframe hallucinations as a source of computational imagination rather than a flaw. Our method fine-tunes LLMs to encourage speculative, metaphorical, and surreal outputs - hallucinations that are useful when factual accuracy is not the chief objective. Inspired by the consensual illusions of theater and stage magic, PIP situates these creative missteps in contexts where users willingly suspend disbelief, thereby transforming "errors" into catalysts for new ways of thinking. We discuss potential applications, design principles for ensuring user consent, preliminary observations, and implications for broader AI ethics and human-AI collaboration.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, there has been a significant trend toward using large language model (LLM)-based recommender systems (RecSys). Current research primarily focuses on representing complex user-item interactions within a discrete space to align with the inherent discrete nature of language models. However, this approach faces limitations due to its discrete nature: (i) information is often compressed during discretization; (ii) the tokenization and generation for the vast number of users and items in real-world scenarios are constrained by a limited vocabulary. Embracing continuous data presents a promising alternative to enhance expressive capabilities, though this approach is still in its early stages. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework, DeftRec, which incorporates \textbf{de}noising di\textbf{f}fusion models to enable LLM-based RecSys to seamlessly support continuous \textbf{t}oken as input and target. First, we introduce a robust tokenizer with a masking operation and an additive K-way architecture to index users and items, capturing their complex collaborative relationships into continuous tokens. Crucially, we develop a denoising diffusion model to process user preferences within continuous domains by conditioning on reasoning content from pre-trained large language model. During the denoising process, we reformulate the objective to include negative interactions, building a comprehensive understanding of user preferences for effective and accurate recommendation generation. Finally, given a continuous token as output, recommendations can be easily generated through score-based retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, showing that DeftRec surpasses competitive benchmarks, including both traditional and emerging LLM-based RecSys.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated Learning (FL) allows users to collaboratively train a global machine learning model by sharing local model only, without exposing their private data to a central server. This distributed learning is particularly appealing in scenarios where data privacy is crucial, and it has garnered substantial attention from both industry and academia. However, studies have revealed privacy vulnerabilities in FL, where adversaries can potentially infer sensitive information from the shared model parameters. In this paper, we present an efficient masking-based secure aggregation scheme utilizing lightweight cryptographic primitives to mitigate privacy risks. Our scheme offers several advantages over existing methods. First, it requires only a single setup phase for the entire FL training session, significantly reducing communication overhead. Second, it minimizes user-side overhead by eliminating the need for user-to-user interactions, utilizing an intermediate server layer and a lightweight key negotiation method. Third, the scheme is highly resilient to user dropouts, and the users can join at any FL round. Fourth, it can detect and defend against malicious server activities, including recently discovered model inconsistency attacks. Finally, our scheme ensures security in both semi-honest and malicious settings. We provide security analysis to formally prove the robustness of our approach. Furthermore, we implemented an end-to-end prototype of our scheme. We conducted comprehensive experiments and comparisons, which show that it outperforms existing solutions in terms of communication and computation overhead, functionality, and security.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The YOLO (You Only Look Once) series has been a leading framework in real-time object detection, consistently improving the balance between speed and accuracy. However, integrating attention mechanisms into YOLO has been challenging due to their high computational overhead. YOLOv12 introduces a novel approach that successfully incorporates attention-based enhancements while preserving real-time performance. This paper provides a comprehensive review of YOLOv12's architectural innovations, including Area Attention for computationally efficient self-attention, Residual Efficient Layer Aggregation Networks for improved feature aggregation, and FlashAttention for optimized memory access. Additionally, we benchmark YOLOv12 against prior YOLO versions and competing object detectors, analyzing its improvements in accuracy, inference speed, and computational efficiency. Through this analysis, we demonstrate how YOLOv12 advances real-time object detection by refining the latency-accuracy trade-off and optimizing computational resources.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This essay proposes an analogy between large language models (LLMs) and quasicrystals: systems that exhibit global coherence without periodic repetition and that are generated through local constraints. While LLMs are often evaluated in terms of predictive accuracy, factuality, or alignment, this structural perspective suggests that their most characteristic behavior is the production of internally resonant linguistic patterns. Just as quasicrystals forced a redefinition of order in physical systems, viewing LLMs as generators of quasi-structured language opens new paths for evaluation and design: privileging propagation of constraint over token-level accuracy, and coherence of form over fixed meaning. LLM outputs should be read not only for what they say, but for the patterns of constraint and coherence that organize them. This shift reframes generative language as a space of emergent patterning: LLMs are neither fully random nor strictly rule-based, but defined by a logic of constraint, resonance, and structural depth.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays is an open problem in astroparticle physics. It is usually inferred from the depth of the shower maximum (Xmax) of cosmic-ray showers, which is only ambiguously determined by modern hadronic interaction models. We examine a data-driven scenario, in which we consider the expectation value of Xmax as a free parameter. We test the novel hypothesis whether the cosmic-ray data from the Pierre Auger Observatory can be interpreted in a consistent picture, under the assumption that the mass composition of cosmic rays at the highest energies is dominated by high metallicity, resulting in pure iron nuclei at energies above ~40 EeV. We investigate the implications on astrophysical observations and hadronic interactions, and we discuss the global consistency of the data assuming this heavy-metal scenario. We conclude that the data from the Pierre Auger Observatory can be interpreted consistently if the expectation values for Xmax from modern hadronic interaction models are shifted to larger values.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The exponential growth of cyber threat knowledge, exemplified by the expansion of databases such as MITRE-CVE and NVD, poses significant challenges for cyber threat analysis. Security professionals are increasingly burdened by the sheer volume and complexity of information, creating an urgent need for effective tools to navigate, synthesize, and act on large-scale data to counter evolving threats proactively. However, conventional threat intelligence tools often fail to scale with the dynamic nature of this data and lack the adaptability to support diverse threat intelligence tasks.   In this work, we introduce CYLENS, a cyber threat intelligence copilot powered by large language models (LLMs). CYLENS is designed to assist security professionals throughout the entire threat management lifecycle, supporting threat attribution, contextualization, detection, correlation, prioritization, and remediation. To ensure domain expertise, CYLENS integrates knowledge from 271,570 threat reports into its model parameters and incorporates six specialized NLP modules to enhance reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, CYLENS can be customized to meet the unique needs of different or ganizations, underscoring its adaptability. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that CYLENS consistently outperforms industry-leading LLMs and state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents. By detailing its design, development, and evaluation, this work provides a blueprint for leveraging LLMs to address complex, data-intensive cybersecurity challenges.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Extractive reading comprehension question answering (QA) datasets are typically evaluated using Exact Match (EM) and F1-score, but these metrics often fail to fully capture model performance. With the success of large language models (LLMs), they have been employed in various tasks, including serving as judges (LLM-as-a-judge). In this paper, we reassess the performance of QA models using LLM-as-a-judge across four reading comprehension QA datasets. We examine different families of LLMs and various answer types to evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-as-a-judge in these tasks. Our results show that LLM-as-a-judge is highly correlated with human judgments and can replace traditional EM/F1 metrics. By using LLM-as-a-judge, the correlation with human judgments improves significantly, from 0.17 (EM) and 0.36 (F1-score) to 0.85. These findings confirm that EM and F1 metrics underestimate the true performance of the QA models. While LLM-as-a-judge is not perfect for more difficult answer types (e.g., job), it still outperforms EM/F1, and we observe no bias issues, such as self-preference, when the same model is used for both the QA and judgment tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A delayed feedback reservoir (DFR) is a hardwarefriendly reservoir computing system. Implementing DFRs in embedded hardware requires efficient online training. However, two main challenges prevent this: hyperparameter selection, which is typically done by offline grid search, and training of the output linear layer, which is memory-intensive. This paper introduces a fast and accurate parameter optimization method for the reservoir layer utilizing backpropagation and gradient descent by adopting a modular DFR model. A truncated backpropagation strategy is proposed to reduce memory consumption associated with the expansion of the recursive structure while maintaining accuracy. The computation time is significantly reduced compared to grid search. Additionally, an in-place Ridge regression for the output layer via 1-D Cholesky decomposition is presented, reducing memory usage to be 1/4. These methods enable the realization of an online edge training and inference system of DFR on an FPGA, reducing computation time by about 1/13 and power consumption by about 1/27 compared to software implementation on the same board.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Identifying dependency between two random variables is a fundamental problem. The clear interpretability and ability of a procedure to provide information on the form of possible dependence is particularly important when exploring dependencies. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that employs a new estimator of the quantile dependence function and pertinent local acceptance regions. This leads to an insightful visualisation and a rigorous evaluation of the underlying dependence structure. We also propose a test of independence of two random variables, pertinent to this new estimator. Our procedures are based on ranks, and we derive a finite-sample theory that guarantees the inferential validity of our solutions at any given sample size. The procedures are simple to implement and computationally efficient. The large sample consistency of the proposed test is also proved. We show that, in terms of power, the new test is one of the best statistics for independence testing when considering a wide range of alternative models. Finally, we demonstrate the use of our approach to visualise dependence structure and to detect local departures from independence through analysing some real-world datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Finding the parameters of a latent variable causal model is central to causal inference and causal identification. In this article, we show that existing graphical structures that are used in causal inference are not stable under marginalization of Gaussian Bayesian networks, and present a graphical structure that faithfully represent margins of Gaussian Bayesian networks. We present the first duality between parameter optimization of a latent variable model and training a feed-forward neural network in the parameter space of the assumed family of distributions. Based on this observation, we develop an algorithm for parameter optimization of these graphical structures based on a given observational distribution. Then, we provide conditions for causal effect identifiability in the Gaussian setting. We propose an meta-algorithm that checks whether a causal effect is identifiable or not. Moreover, we lay a grounding for generalizing the duality between a neural network and a causal model from the Gaussian to other distributions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> An ideal detection system for machine generated content is supposed to work well on any generator as many more advanced LLMs come into existence day by day. Existing systems often struggle with accurately identifying AI-generated content over shorter texts. Further, not all texts might be entirely authored by a human or LLM, hence we focused more over partial cases i.e human-LLM co-authored texts. Our paper introduces a set of models built for the task of token classification which are trained on an extensive collection of human-machine co-authored texts, which performed well over texts of unseen domains, unseen generators, texts by non-native speakers and those with adversarial inputs. We also introduce a new dataset of over 2.4M such texts mostly co-authored by several popular proprietary LLMs over 23 languages. We also present findings of our models' performance over each texts of each domain and generator. Additional findings include comparison of performance against each adversarial method, length of input texts and characteristics of generated texts compared to the original human authored texts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sequential Recommendation (SeqRec) aims to predict the next item by capturing sequential patterns from users' historical interactions, playing a crucial role in many real-world recommender systems. However, existing approaches predominantly adopt a direct forward computation paradigm, where the final hidden state of the sequence encoder serves as the user representation. We argue that this inference paradigm, due to its limited computational depth, struggles to model the complex evolving nature of user preferences and lacks a nuanced understanding of long-tail items, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{ReaRec}, the first inference-time computing framework for recommender systems, which enhances user representations through implicit multi-step reasoning. Specifically, ReaRec autoregressively feeds the sequence's last hidden state into the sequential recommender while incorporating special reasoning position embeddings to decouple the original item encoding space from the multi-step reasoning space. Moreover, we introduce two lightweight reasoning-based learning methods, Ensemble Reasoning Learning (ERL) and Progressive Reasoning Learning (PRL), to further effectively exploit ReaRec's reasoning potential. Extensive experiments on five public real-world datasets and different SeqRec architectures demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our proposed ReaRec. Remarkably, post-hoc analyses reveal that ReaRec significantly elevates the performance ceiling of multiple sequential recommendation backbones by approximately 30\%-50\%. Thus, we believe this work can open a new and promising avenue for future research in inference-time computing for sequential recommendation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding time series is crucial for its application in real-world scenarios. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to time series tasks, leveraging their strong language capabilities to enhance various applications. However, research on multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for time series understanding and reasoning remains limited, primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets that align time series with textual information. This paper introduces ChatTS, a novel MLLM designed for time series analysis. ChatTS treats time series as a modality, similar to how vision MLLMs process images, enabling it to perform both understanding and reasoning with time series. To address the scarcity of training data, we propose an attribute-based method for generating synthetic time series with detailed attribute descriptions. We further introduce Time Series Evol-Instruct, a novel approach that generates diverse time series Q&As, enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, ChatTS is the first TS-MLLM that takes multivariate time series as input for understanding and reasoning, which is fine-tuned exclusively on synthetic datasets. We evaluate its performance using benchmark datasets with real-world data, including six alignment tasks and four reasoning tasks. Our results show that ChatTS significantly outperforms existing vision-based MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and text/agent-based LLMs, achieving a 46.0% improvement in alignment tasks and a 25.8% improvement in reasoning tasks. We have open-sourced the source code, model checkpoint and datasets at https://github.com/NetManAIOps/ChatTS.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Gender-neutral translation (GNT) aims to avoid expressing the gender of human referents when the source text lacks explicit cues about the gender of those referents. Evaluating GNT automatically is particularly challenging, with current solutions being limited to monolingual classifiers. Such solutions are not ideal because they do not factor in the source sentence and require dedicated data and fine-tuning to scale to new languages. In this work, we address such limitations by investigating the use of large language models (LLMs) as evaluators of GNT. Specifically, we explore two prompting approaches: one in which LLMs generate sentence-level assessments only, and another, akin to a chain-of-thought approach, where they first produce detailed phrase-level annotations before a sentence-level judgment. Through extensive experiments on multiple languages with five models, both open and proprietary, we show that LLMs can serve as evaluators of GNT. Moreover, we find that prompting for phrase-level annotations before sentence-level assessments consistently improves the accuracy of all models, providing a better and more scalable alternative to current solutions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose a novel Bayesian wavelet regression approach using a three-component spike-and-slab prior for wavelet coefficients, combining a point mass at zero, a moment (MOM) prior, and an inverse moment (IMOM) prior. This flexible prior supports small and large coefficients differently, offering advantages for highly dispersed data where wavelet coefficients span multiple scales. The IMOM prior's heavy tails capture large coefficients, while the MOM prior is better suited for smaller non-zero coefficients. Further, our method introduces innovative hyperparameter specifications for mixture probabilities and scale parameters, including generalized logit, hyperbolic secant, and generalized normal decay for probabilities, and double exponential decay for scaling. Hyperparameters are estimated via an empirical Bayes approach, enabling posterior inference tailored to the data. Extensive simulations demonstrate significant performance gains over two-component wavelet methods. Applications to electroencephalography and noisy audio data illustrate the method's utility in capturing complex signal characteristics. We implement our method in an R package NLPwavelet.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) deals with statistical inference in problems where the data are generated from a system that is described by a complex stochastic simulator. The challenge for inference in these problems is that the likelihood is intractable; SBI proceeds by using the simulator to sample from the likelihood. In many real world applications, simulator calls are expensive, limiting the associated sample size. Our goal in this work is to extend SBI to exploit two proposals for reducing simulator calls: to draw likelihood samples from a Neural Density Estimator (NDE) surrogate rather than from the stochastic simulator; and use of Support Points rather than simple random sampling to generate evaluation sites. We embed these methods in the Sequential Neural Posterior Estimator (SNPE) algorithm. Across a suite of test cases, we find that the NDE surrogate improves the quality of the inference; support points worked well in some examples, but not in others.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, DeepSeek-R1 (671B) (DeepSeek-AIet al., 2025) has demonstrated its excellent reasoning ability in complex tasks and has publiclyshared its methodology. This provides potentially high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data for stimulating the reasoning abilities of small-sized large language models (LLMs). To generate high-quality CoT data for different LLMs, we seek an efficient method for generating high-quality CoT data with LLM-Adaptive questiondifficulty levels. First, we grade the difficulty of the questions according to the reasoning ability of the LLMs themselves and construct a LLM-Adaptive question database. Second, we sample the problem database based on a distribution of difficulty levels of the questions and then use DeepSeek-R1 (671B) (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) to generate the corresponding high-quality CoT data with correct answers. Thanks to the construction of CoT data with LLM-Adaptive difficulty levels, we have significantly reduced the cost of data generation and enhanced the efficiency of model supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Finally, we have validated the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed method in the fields of complex mathematical competitions and code generation tasks. Notably, with only 2k high-quality mathematical CoT data, our ZMath-32B surpasses DeepSeek-Distill-32B in math reasoning task. Similarly, with only 2k high-quality code CoT data, our ZCode-32B surpasses DeepSeek-Distill-32B in code reasoning tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) based on transformer architectures have sparked significant interest in understanding their inner workings. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to modeling transformer architectures using highly flexible non-autonomous neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Our proposed model parameterizes all weights of attention and feed-forward blocks through neural networks, expressing these weights as functions of a continuous layer index. Through spectral analysis of the model's dynamics, we uncover an increase in eigenvalue magnitude that challenges the weight-sharing assumption prevalent in existing theoretical studies. We also leverage the Lyapunov exponent to examine token-level sensitivity, enhancing model interpretability. Our neural ODE transformer demonstrates performance comparable to or better than vanilla transformers across various configurations and datasets, while offering flexible fine-tuning capabilities that can adapt to different architectural constraints.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) through Transformer structures have dominated many machine learning tasks, especially text processing. However, these models require massive amounts of data for training and induce high resource requirements, particularly in terms of the large number of Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) and the high amounts of memory needed. To fine-tune such a model in a parameter-efficient way, techniques like Adapter or LoRA have been developed. However, we observe that the application of LoRA, when used in federated learning (FL), while still being parameter-efficient, is memory and FLOP inefficient. Based on that observation, we develop a novel layer finetuning scheme that allows devices in cross-device FL to make use of pretrained neural networks (NNs) while adhering to given resource constraints. We show that our presented scheme outperforms the current state of the art when dealing with homogeneous or heterogeneous computation and memory constraints and is on par with LoRA regarding limited communication, thereby achieving significantly higher accuracies in FL training.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, with their performance heavily dependent on the quality of input prompts. While prompt engineering has proven effective, it typically relies on manual adjustments, making it time-consuming and potentially suboptimal. This paper introduces GAAPO (Genetic Algorithm Applied to Prompt Optimization), a novel hybrid optimization framework that leverages genetic algorithm principles to evolve prompts through successive generations. Unlike traditional genetic approaches that rely solely on mutation and crossover operations, GAAPO integrates multiple specialized prompt generation strategies within its evolutionary framework. Through extensive experimentation on diverse datasets including ETHOS, MMLU-Pro, and GPQA, our analysis reveals several important point for the future development of automatic prompt optimization methods: importance of the tradeoff between the population size and the number of generations, effect of selection methods on stability results, capacity of different LLMs and especially reasoning models to be able to automatically generate prompts from similar queries... Furthermore, we provide insights into the relative effectiveness of different prompt generation strategies and their evolution across optimization phases. These findings contribute to both the theoretical understanding of prompt optimization and practical applications in improving LLM performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Isolated wide binary stars provide natural laboratories to directly probe gravity for Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$. Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have been performed only with sky-projected relative velocities $v_p$ in the pairs. A new method of Bayesian orbit modeling exploiting three relative velocity components including the radial (line-of-sight) component $v_r$ is developed to measure a gravitational anomaly parameter $\Gamma\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{\gamma_g}\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{G_{\rm{eff}}/G_{\rm{N}}}$ where $G_{\rm{eff}}$ is the effective gravitational constant for pseudo-Newtonian elliptical orbits, while $G_{\rm{N}}$ is Newton's constant. The method infers individual probability distributions of $\Gamma$ and then combines the independent distributions to obtain a consolidated distribution in a specific range of $g_{\rm{N}}$. Here the method is described and applied to a sample of 312 wide binaries in a broad dynamic range $10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$ with $v_r$ uncertainties in the range $168<\sigma_{v_r}<380$ m s$^{-1}$ selected from the Gaia DR3 database. The following results are obtained: $\Gamma = 0.000\pm 0.011$ ($N_{\rm{binary}}=125$) for a high acceleration regime ($10^{-7.9} \lesssim g_{\rm{N}} \lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$) agreeing well with Newton, but $\Gamma = 0.085\pm 0.040$ or $\gamma_g=1.48_{-0.23}^{+0.33}$ (35) for a MOND regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) and $\Gamma = 0.063\pm 0.015$ or $\gamma_g=1.34_{-0.08}^{+0.10}$ (111) for a MOND+transition regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-8.5}$ m s$^{-2}$). These results show that gravitational anomaly is evident for $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$ and $\Gamma$ in the MOND regime ($\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) agrees with the prediction ($\approx 0.07$) of MOND gravity theories.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The growing integration of robots in shared environments -- such as warehouses, shopping centres, and hospitals -- demands a deep understanding of the underlying dynamics and human behaviours, including how, when, and where individuals engage in various activities and interactions. This knowledge goes beyond simple correlation studies and requires a more comprehensive causal analysis. By leveraging causal inference to model cause-and-effect relationships, we can better anticipate critical environmental factors and enable autonomous robots to plan and execute tasks more effectively. To this end, we propose a novel causality-based decision-making framework that reasons over a learned causal model to predict battery usage and human obstructions, understanding how these factors could influence robot task execution. Such reasoning framework assists the robot in deciding when and how to complete a given task. To achieve this, we developed also PeopleFlow, a new Gazebo-based simulator designed to model context-sensitive human-robot spatial interactions in shared workspaces. PeopleFlow features realistic human and robot trajectories influenced by contextual factors such as time, environment layout, and robot state, and can simulate a large number of agents. While the simulator is general-purpose, in this paper we focus on a warehouse-like environment as a case study, where we conduct an extensive evaluation benchmarking our causal approach against a non-causal baseline. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solutions, highlighting how causal reasoning enables autonomous robots to operate more efficiently and safely in dynamic environments shared with humans.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Stories are a fundamental aspect of human experience. Engaging deeply with stories and spotting plot holes -- inconsistencies in a storyline that break the internal logic or rules of a story's world -- requires nuanced reasoning skills, including tracking entities and events and their interplay, abstract thinking, pragmatic narrative understanding, commonsense and social reasoning, and theory of mind. As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly generate, interpret, and modify text, rigorously assessing their narrative consistency and deeper language understanding becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks focus mainly on surface-level comprehension. In this work, we propose plot hole detection in stories as a proxy to evaluate language understanding and reasoning in LLMs. We introduce FlawedFictionsMaker, a novel algorithm to controllably and carefully synthesize plot holes in human-written stories. Using this algorithm, we construct a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' plot hole detection abilities in stories -- FlawedFictions -- , which is robust to contamination, with human filtering ensuring high quality. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle in accurately solving FlawedFictions regardless of the reasoning effort allowed, with performance significantly degrading as story length increases. Finally, we show that LLM-based story summarization and story generation are prone to introducing plot holes, with more than 50% and 100% increases in plot hole detection rates with respect to human-written originals.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Existing large language model LLM-based recommendation methods face several challenges, including inefficiency in handling large candidate pools, sensitivity to item order within prompts ("lost in the middle" phenomenon) poor scalability, and unrealistic evaluation due to random negative sampling. To address these issues, we propose a Query-to-Recommendation approach that leverages LLMs to generate personalized queries for retrieving relevant items from the entire candidate pool, eliminating the need for candidate pre-selection. This method can be integrated into an ID-based recommendation system without additional training, enhances recommendation performance and diversity through LLMs' world knowledge, and performs well even for less popular item groups. Experiments on three datasets show up to 57 percent improvement, with an average gain of 31 percent, demonstrating strong zero-shot performance and further gains when ensembled with existing models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Context. Tracing wave activity from the photosphere to the corona has important implications for coronal heating and prediction of the solar wind. Despite extensive theory and simulations, the detection of waves in realistic MHD simulations still presents a large challenge due to wave interaction, mode conversion, and damping mechanisms. Aims. We conducted this study to detect localised wave activity within a realistic MHD simulation of the solar atmosphere by the Bifrost code. Methods. We present a new method of detecting the most significant contributions of wave activity within localised areas of the domain, aided by Discrete Fourier Transforms and frequency filtering. We correlate oscillations in the vertical & horizontal magnetic field, velocities parallel & perpendicular to the magnetic field, and pressure to infer the nature of the dominant wave modes. Results. Our method captures the most powerful frequencies and wavenumbers, as well as providing a new diagnostic for damping processes. We infer the presence of magnetoacoustic waves in the boundaries of prominent chromospheric/coronal swirling features. We find these waves are likely damped by viscous heating in the swirl boundaries, contributing to heating in the upper atmosphere. Conclusions. Using the most significant frequencies decomposition, we highlight that energy can be transported from the lower atmosphere to the upper atmosphere through waves and fluctuations along the swirl boundaries. Although further analysis is needed to confirm these findings, our new method provides a path forward to investigate wave activity in the solar atmosphere

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Although LLM-based agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), can use external tools and memory mechanisms to solve complex real-world tasks, they may also introduce critical security vulnerabilities. However, the existing literature does not comprehensively evaluate attacks and defenses against LLM-based agents. To address this, we introduce Agent Security Bench (ASB), a comprehensive framework designed to formalize, benchmark, and evaluate the attacks and defenses of LLM-based agents, including 10 scenarios (e.g., e-commerce, autonomous driving, finance), 10 agents targeting the scenarios, over 400 tools, 27 different types of attack/defense methods, and 7 evaluation metrics. Based on ASB, we benchmark 10 prompt injection attacks, a memory poisoning attack, a novel Plan-of-Thought backdoor attack, 4 mixed attacks, and 11 corresponding defenses across 13 LLM backbones. Our benchmark results reveal critical vulnerabilities in different stages of agent operation, including system prompt, user prompt handling, tool usage, and memory retrieval, with the highest average attack success rate of 84.30\%, but limited effectiveness shown in current defenses, unveiling important works to be done in terms of agent security for the community. We also introduce a new metric to evaluate the agents' capability to balance utility and security. Our code can be found at https://github.com/agiresearch/ASB.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The growing demand for robots to operate effectively in diverse environments necessitates the need for robust real-time anomaly detection techniques during robotic operations. However, deep learning-based models in robotics face significant challenges due to limited training data and highly noisy signal features. In this paper, we present Sparse Masked Autoregressive Flow-based Adversarial AutoEncoders model to address these problems. This approach integrates Masked Autoregressive Flow model into Adversarial AutoEncoders to construct a flexible latent space and utilize Sparse autoencoder to efficiently focus on important features, even in scenarios with limited feature space. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a 4.96% to 9.75% higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for pick-and-place robotic operations with randomly placed cans, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it showed up to 19.67% better performance in scenarios involving collisions with lightweight objects. Additionally, unlike the existing state-of-the-art model, our model performs inferences within 1 millisecond, ensuring real-time anomaly detection. These capabilities make our model highly applicable to machine learning-based robotic safety systems in dynamic environments. The code will be made publicly available after acceptance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper investigates deploying semantic edge inference systems for performing a common image clarification task. In particular, each system consists of multiple Internet of Things (IoT) devices that first locally encode the sensing data into semantic features and then transmit them to an edge server for subsequent data fusion and task inference. The inference accuracy is determined by efficient training of the feature encoder/decoder using labeled data samples. Due to the difference in sensing data and communication channel distributions, deploying the system in a new environment may induce high costs in annotating data labels and re-training the encoder/decoder models. To achieve cost-effective transferable system deployment, we propose an efficient Domain Adaptation method for Semantic Edge INference systems (DASEIN) that can maintain high inference accuracy in a new environment without the need for labeled samples. Specifically, DASEIN exploits the task-relevant data correlation between different deployment scenarios by leveraging the techniques of unsupervised domain adaptation and knowledge distillation. It devises an efficient two-step adaptation procedure that sequentially aligns the data distributions and adapts to the channel variations. Numerical results show that, under a substantial change in sensing data distributions, the proposed DASEIN outperforms the best-performing benchmark method by 7.09% and 21.33% in inference accuracy when the new environment has similar or 25 dB lower channel signal to noise power ratios (SNRs), respectively. This verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method in adapting both data and channel distributions in practical transfer deployment applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The population intervention indirect effect (PIIE) is a novel mediation effect representing the indirect component of the population intervention effect. Unlike traditional mediation measures, such as the natural indirect effect, the PIIE holds particular relevance in observational studies involving unethical exposures, when hypothetical interventions that impose harmful exposures are inappropriate. Although prior research has identified PIIE under unmeasured confounders between exposure and outcome, it has not fully addressed the confounding that affects the mediator. This study extends the PIIE identification to settings where unmeasured confounders influence exposure-outcome, exposure-mediator, and mediator-outcome relationships. Specifically, we leverage observed covariates as proxy variables for unmeasured confounders, constructing three proximal identification frameworks. Additionally, we characterize the semiparametric efficiency bound and develop multiply robust and locally efficient estimators. To handle high-dimensional nuisance parameters, we propose a debiased machine learning approach that achieves $\sqrt{n}$-consistency and asymptotic normality to estimate the true PIIE values, even when the machine learning estimators for the nuisance functions do not converge at $\sqrt{n}$-rate. In simulations, our estimators demonstrate higher confidence interval coverage rates than conventional methods across various model misspecifications. In a real data application, our approaches reveal an indirect effect of alcohol consumption on depression risk mediated by depersonalization symptoms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To what extent do LLMs use their capabilities towards their given goal? We take this as a measure of their goal-directedness. We evaluate goal-directedness on tasks that require information gathering, cognitive effort, and plan execution, where we use subtasks to infer each model's relevant capabilities. Our evaluations of LLMs from Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and Anthropic show that goal-directedness is relatively consistent across tasks, differs from task performance, and is only moderately sensitive to motivational prompts. Notably, most models are not fully goal-directed. We hope our goal-directedness evaluations will enable better monitoring of LLM progress, and enable more deliberate design choices of agentic properties in LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The recent advance of edge computing technology enables significant sensing performance improvement of Internet of Things (IoT) networks. In particular, an edge server (ES) is responsible for gathering sensing data from distributed sensing devices, and immediately executing different sensing tasks to accommodate the heterogeneous service demands of mobile users. However, as the number of users surges and the sensing tasks become increasingly compute-intensive, the huge amount of computation workloads and data transmissions may overwhelm the edge system of limited resources. Accordingly, we propose in this paper a scalable edge sensing framework for multi-task execution, in the sense that the computation workload and communication overhead of the ES do not increase with the number of downstream users or tasks. By exploiting the task-relevant correlations, the proposed scheme implements a unified encoder at the ES, which produces a common low-dimensional message from the sensing data and broadcasts it to all users to execute their individual tasks. To achieve high sensing accuracy, we extend the well-known information bottleneck theory to a multi-task scenario to jointly optimize the information gathering and broadcast processes. We also develop an efficient two-step training procedure to optimize the parameters of the neural network-based codecs deployed in the edge sensing system. Experiment results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the considered representative benchmark methods in multi-task inference accuracy. Besides, the proposed scheme is scalable to the network size, which maintains almost constant computation delay with less than 1% degradation of inference performance when the user number increases by four times.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) aim to engage users in dialogue to provide tailored recommendations. While traditional CRSs focus on eliciting preferences and retrieving items, real-world e-commerce interactions involve more complex decision-making, where users consider multiple factors beyond simple attributes. To bridge this gap, we introduce Conversational Sales (CSales), a novel task that unifies preference elicitation, recommendation, and persuasion to better support user decision-making. For a realistic evaluation of CSales, we present CSUser, an LLM-based user simulator constructed from real-world data, modeling diverse user profiles with needs and personalities. Additionally, we propose CSI, a conversational sales agent that proactively infers contextual profiles through dialogue for personalized action planning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CSUser effectively replicates real-world users and emphasize the importance of contextual profiling for strategic action selection, ultimately driving successful purchases in e-commerce.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph Transformers (GTs), which simultaneously integrate message-passing and self-attention mechanisms, have achieved promising empirical results in some graph prediction tasks. Although these approaches show the potential of Transformers in capturing long-range graph topology information, issues concerning the quadratic complexity and high computing energy consumption severely limit the scalability of GTs on large-scale graphs. Recently, as brain-inspired neural networks, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), facilitate the development of graph representation learning methods with lower computational and storage overhead through the unique event-driven spiking neurons. Inspired by these characteristics, we propose a linear-time Graph Transformer using Spiking Vector Quantization (GT-SVQ) for node classification. GT-SVQ reconstructs codebooks based on rate coding outputs from spiking neurons, and injects the codebooks into self-attention blocks to aggregate global information in linear complexity. Besides, spiking vector quantization effectively alleviates codebook collapse and the reliance on complex machinery (distance measure, auxiliary loss, etc.) present in previous vector quantization-based graph learning methods. In experiments, we compare GT-SVQ with other state-of-the-art baselines on node classification datasets ranging from small to large. Experimental results show that GT-SVQ has achieved competitive performances on most datasets while maintaining up to 130x faster inference speed compared to other GTs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Emotional support conversation (ESC) aims to alleviate the emotional distress of individuals through effective conversations. Although large language models (LLMs) have obtained remarkable progress on ESC, most of these studies might not define the diagram from the state model perspective, therefore providing a suboptimal solution for long-term satisfaction. To address such an issue, we leverage the Finite State Machine (FSM) on LLMs, and propose a framework called FiSMiness. Our framework allows a single LLM to bootstrap the planning during ESC, and self-reason the seeker's emotion, support strategy and the final response upon each conversational turn. Substantial experiments on ESC datasets suggest that FiSMiness outperforms many baselines, including direct inference, self-refine, chain of thought, finetuning, and external-assisted methods, even those with many more parameters.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Infectious disease transmission is often modelled by discrete-valued stochastic state-transition processes. Due to a lack of complete data, Bayesian inference for these models often relies on data-augmentation techniques. These techniques are often inefficient or time consuming to implement. We introduce a novel data-augmentation Markov chain Monte Carlo method for discrete-time individual-based epidemic models, which we call the Rippler algorithm. This method uses the transmission model in the proposal step of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, rather than in the accept-reject step. We test the Rippler algorithm on simulated data and apply it to data on extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli collected in Blantyre, Malawi. We compare the Rippler algorithm to two other commonly used Bayesian inference methods for partially observed epidemic data, and find that it has a good balance between mixing speed and computational complexity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are fundamental tools for modeling complex dynamic systems across scientific disciplines. However, parameter estimation in ODE models is challenging due to the multimodal nature of the likelihood function, which can lead to local optima and unstable inference. In this paper, we propose particle data cloning (PDC), a novel approach that enhances global optimization by leveraging data cloning and annealed sequential Monte Carlo (ASMC). PDC mitigates multimodality by refining the likelihood through data clones and progressively extracting information from the sharpened posterior. Compared to standard data cloning, PDC provides more reliable frequentist inference and demonstrates superior global optimization performance. We offer practical guidelines for efficient implementation and illustrate the method through simulation studies and an application to a prey-predator ODE model. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/SONDONGHUI/PDC.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Many statistical problems can be reduced to a linear inverse problem in which only a noisy version of the operator is available. Particular examples include random design regression, deconvolution problem, instrumental variable regression, functional data analysis, error-in-variable regression, drift estimation in stochastic diffusion, and many others. The pragmatic plug-in approach can be well justified in the classical asymptotic setup with a growing sample size. However, recent developments in high dimensional inference reveal some new features of this problem. In high dimensional linear regression with a random design, the plug-in approach is questionable but the use of a simple ridge penalization yields a benign overfitting phenomenon; see \cite{baLoLu2020}, \cite{ChMo2022}, \cite{NoPuSp2024}. This paper revisits the general Error-in-Operator problem for finite samples and high dimension of the source and image spaces. A particular focus is on the choice of a proper regularization. We show that a simple ridge penalty (Tikhonov regularization) works properly in the case when the operator is more regular than the signal. In the opposite case, some model reduction technique like spectral truncation should be applied.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Previous work indicates that large language models exhibit a significant "English bias", i.e. they often perform better when tasks are presented in English. Interestingly, we have observed that using certain other languages in reasoning tasks can yield better performance than English. However, this phenomenon remains under-explored. In this paper, we explore the upper bound of harnessing multilingualism in reasoning tasks, suggesting that multilingual reasoning promises significantly (by nearly 10 Acc@$k$ points) and robustly (tolerance for variations in translation quality and language choice) higher upper bounds than English-only reasoning. Besides analyzing the reason behind the upper bound and challenges in reaching it, we also find that common answer selection methods cannot achieve this upper bound, due to their limitations and biases. These insights could pave the way for future research aimed at fully harnessing the potential of multilingual reasoning in LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Fine-grained radio map presents communication parameters of interest, e.g., received signal strength, at every point across a large geographical region. It can be leveraged to improve the efficiency of spectrum utilization for a large area, particularly critical for the unlicensed WiFi spectrum. The problem of fine-grained radio map estimation is to utilize radio samples collected by sparsely distributed sensors to infer the map. This problem is challenging due to the ultra-low sampling rate, where the number of available samples is far less than the fine-grained resolution required for radio map estimation. We propose WiFi-Diffusion -- a novel generative framework for achieving fine-grained WiFi radio map estimation using diffusion models. WiFi-Diffusion employs the creative power of generative AI to address the ultra-low sampling rate challenge and consists of three blocks: 1) a boost block, using prior information such as the layout of obstacles to optimize the diffusion model; 2) a generation block, leveraging the diffusion model to generate a candidate set of radio maps; and 3) an election block, utilizing the radio propagation model as a guide to find the best radio map from the candidate set. Extensive simulations demonstrate that 1) the fine-grained radio map generated by WiFi-Diffusion is ten times better than those produced by state-of-the-art (SOTA) when they use the same ultra-low sampling rate; and 2) WiFi-Diffusion achieves comparable fine-grained radio map quality with only one-fifth of the sampling rate required by SOTA.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Post-training Large Language Models (LLMs) with explicit reasoning trajectories can enhance their reasoning abilities. However, acquiring such high-quality trajectory data typically demands meticulous supervision from humans or superior models, which can be either expensive or license-constrained. In this paper, we explore how far an LLM can improve its reasoning by self-synthesizing reasoning paths as training data without any additional supervision. Existing self-synthesizing methods, such as STaR, suffer from poor generalization to out-of-domain (OOD) reasoning tasks. We hypothesize it is due to that their self-synthesized reasoning paths are too task-specific, lacking general task-agnostic reasoning guidance. To address this, we propose Reasoning Generalist via Self-Improvement (ReGenesis), a method to self-synthesize reasoning paths as post-training data by progressing from abstract to concrete. More specifically, ReGenesis self-synthesizes reasoning paths by converting general reasoning guidelines into task-specific ones, generating reasoning structures, and subsequently transforming these structures into reasoning paths, without the need for human-designed task-specific examples used in existing methods. We show that ReGenesis achieves superior performance on all in-domain and OOD settings tested compared to existing methods. For six OOD tasks specifically, while previous methods exhibited an average performance decrease of approximately 4.6% after post training, ReGenesis delivers around 6.1% performance improvement. We also conduct in-depth analysis of our framework and show ReGenesis is effective across various LLMs and design choices.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven the need for increasingly sophisticated inference pipelines and hardware platforms. Modern LLM serving extends beyond traditional prefill-decode workflows, incorporating multi-stage processes such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), key-value (KV) cache retrieval, dynamic model routing, and multi step reasoning. These stages exhibit diverse computational demands, requiring distributed systems that integrate GPUs, ASICs, CPUs, and memory-centric architectures. However, existing simulators lack the fidelity to model these heterogeneous, multi-engine workflows, limiting their ability to inform architectural decisions.   To address this gap, we introduce HERMES, a Heterogeneous Multi-stage LLM inference Execution Simulator. HERMES models diverse request stages; including RAG, KV retrieval, reasoning, prefill, and decode across complex hardware hierarchies. HERMES supports heterogeneous clients executing multiple models concurrently unlike prior frameworks while incorporating advanced batching strategies and multi-level memory hierarchies. By integrating real hardware traces with analytical modeling, HERMES captures critical trade-offs such as memory bandwidth contention, inter-cluster communication latency, and batching efficiency in hybrid CPU-accelerator deployments. Through case studies, we explore the impact of reasoning stages on end-to-end latency, optimal batching strategies for hybrid pipelines, and the architectural implications of remote KV cache retrieval. HERMES empowers system designers to navigate the evolving landscape of LLM inference, providing actionable insights into optimizing hardware-software co-design for next-generation AI workloads.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid scaling of large language model (LLM) training and inference has driven their adoption in semiconductor design across academia and industry. While most prior work evaluates LLMs on hardware description language (HDL) tasks, particularly Verilog, designers are increasingly using high-level synthesis (HLS) to build domain-specific accelerators and complex hardware systems. However, benchmarks and tooling to comprehensively evaluate LLMs for HLS design tasks remain scarce.   To address this, we introduce HLS-Eval, the first complete benchmark and evaluation framework for LLM-driven HLS design. HLS-Eval targets two core tasks: (1) generating HLS code from natural language descriptions, and (2) performing HLS-specific code edits to optimize performance and hardware efficiency. The benchmark includes 94 unique designs drawn from standard HLS benchmarks and novel sources. Each case is prepared via a semi-automated flow that produces a natural language description and a paired testbench for C-simulation and synthesis validation, ensuring each task is "LLM-ready."   Beyond the benchmark, HLS-Eval offers a modular Python framework for automated, parallel evaluation of both local and hosted LLMs. It includes a parallel evaluation engine, direct HLS tool integration, and abstractions for to support different LLM interaction paradigms, enabling rapid prototyping of new benchmarks, tasks, and LLM methods.   We demonstrate HLS-Eval through baseline evaluations of open-source LLMs on Vitis HLS, measuring outputs across four key metrics - parseability, compilability, runnability, and synthesizability - reflecting the iterative HLS design cycle. We also report pass@k metrics, establishing clear baselines and reusable infrastructure for the broader LLM-for-hardware community.   All benchmarks, framework code, and results are open-sourced at https://github.com/stefanpie/hls-eval.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Over the past years, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have demonstrated how AI can solve many perception and generation tasks, such as image classification and text writing, yet reasoning remains a challenge. This paper introduces the FLIP dataset, a benchmark for evaluating AI reasoning capabilities based on human verification tasks on the Idena blockchain. FLIP challenges present users with two orderings of 4 images, requiring them to identify the logically coherent one. By emphasizing sequential reasoning, visual storytelling, and common sense, FLIP provides a unique testbed for multimodal AI systems. Our experiments evaluate state-of-the-art models, leveraging both vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs). Results reveal that even the best open-sourced and closed-sourced models achieve maximum accuracies of 75.5% and 77.9%, respectively, in zero-shot settings, compared to human performance of 95.3%. Captioning models aid reasoning models by providing text descriptions of images, yielding better results than when using the raw images directly, 69.6% vs. 75.2% for Gemini 1.5 Pro. Combining the predictions from 15 models in an ensemble increases the accuracy to 85.2%. These findings highlight the limitations of existing reasoning models and the need for robust multimodal benchmarks like FLIP.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The scarcity of high-quality public log datasets has become a critical bottleneck in advancing log-based anomaly detection techniques. Current datasets exhibit three fundamental limitations: (1) incomplete event coverage, (2) artificial patterns introduced by static analysis-based generation frameworks, and (3) insufficient semantic awareness. To address these challenges, we present AnomalyGen, the first automated log synthesis framework specifically designed for anomaly detection. Our framework introduces a novel four-phase architecture that integrates enhanced program analysis with Chain-of-Thought reasoning (CoT reasoning), enabling iterative log generation and anomaly annotation without requiring physical system execution. Evaluations on Hadoop and HDFS distributed systems demonstrate that AnomalyGen achieves substantially broader log event coverage (38-95 times improvement over existing datasets) while producing more operationally realistic log sequences compared to static analysis-based approaches. When augmenting benchmark datasets with synthesized logs, we observe maximum F1-score improvements of 3.7% (average 1.8% improvement across three state-of-the-art anomaly detection models). This work not only establishes a high-quality benchmarking resource for automated log analysis but also pioneers a new paradigm for applying large language models (LLMs) in software engineering workflows.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The applications of large language models (LLMs) in various biological domains have been explored recently, but their reasoning ability in complex biological systems, such as pathways, remains underexplored, which is crucial for predicting biological phenomena, formulating hypotheses, and designing experiments. This work explores the potential of LLMs in pathway reasoning. We introduce BioMaze, a dataset with 5.1K complex pathway problems derived from real research, covering various biological contexts including natural dynamic changes, disturbances, additional intervention conditions, and multi-scale research targets. Our evaluation of methods such as CoT and graph-augmented reasoning, shows that LLMs struggle with pathway reasoning, especially in perturbed systems. To address this, we propose PathSeeker, an LLM agent that enhances reasoning through interactive subgraph-based navigation, enabling a more effective approach to handling the complexities of biological systems in a scientifically aligned manner.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D\mbox{-}MIMO) is a promising technology to realize the promise of massive MIMO gains by fiber-connecting the distributed antenna arrays, thereby overcoming the form factor limitations of co-located MIMO. In this paper, we introduce the concept of mobile D-MIMO (MD-MIMO) network, a further extension of the D-MIMO technology where distributed antenna arrays are connected to the base station with a wireless link allowing all radio network nodes to be mobile. This approach significantly improves deployment flexibility and reduces operating costs, enabling the network to adapt to the highly dynamic nature of next-generation (NextG) networks. We discuss use cases, system design, network architecture, and the key enabling technologies for MD-MIMO. Furthermore, we investigate a case study of MD-MIMO for vehicular networks, presenting detailed performance evaluations for both downlink and uplink. The results show that an MD-MIMO network can provide substantial improvements in network throughput and reliability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Smart contract vulnerabilities pose significant security risks to blockchain systems, potentially leading to severe financial losses. Existing methods face several limitations: (1) Program analysis-based approaches rely on predefined patterns, lacking flexibility for new vulnerability types; (2) Deep learning-based methods lack explanations; (3) Large language model-based approaches suffer from high false positives. We propose MOS, a smart contract vulnerability detection framework based on mixture-of-experts tuning (MOE-Tuning) of large language models. First, we conduct continual pre-training on a large-scale smart contract dataset to provide domain-enhanced initialization. Second, we construct a high-quality MOE-Tuning dataset through a multi-stage pipeline combining LLM generation and expert verification for reliable explanations. Third, we design a vulnerability-aware routing mechanism that activates the most relevant expert networks by analyzing code features and their matching degree with experts. Finally, we extend the feed-forward layers into multiple parallel expert networks, each specializing in specific vulnerability patterns. We employ a dual-objective loss function: one for optimizing detection and explanation performance, and another for ensuring reasonable distribution of vulnerability types to experts through entropy calculation. Experiments show that MOS significantly outperforms existing methods with average improvements of 6.32% in F1 score and 4.80% in accuracy. The vulnerability explanations achieve positive ratings (scores of 3-4 on a 4-point scale) of 82.96%, 85.21% and 94.58% for correctness, completeness, and conciseness through human and LLM evaluation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) raised concerns over potential misuse, such as for spreading misinformation. In response two counter measures emerged: machine learning-based detectors that predict if text is synthetic, and LLM watermarking, which subtly marks generated text for identification and attribution. Meanwhile, humans are known to adjust language to their conversational partners both syntactically and lexically. By implication, it is possible that humans or unwatermarked LLMs could unintentionally mimic properties of LLM generated text, making counter measures unreliable. In this work we investigate the extent to which such conversational adaptation happens. We call the concept $\textit{mimicry}$ and demonstrate that both humans and LLMs end up mimicking, including the watermarking signal even in seemingly improbable settings. This challenges current academic assumptions and suggests that for long-term watermarking to be reliable, the likelihood of false positives needs to be significantly lower, while longer word sequences should be used for seeding watermarking mechanisms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present Seedream 3.0, a high-performance Chinese-English bilingual image generation foundation model. We develop several technical improvements to address existing challenges in Seedream 2.0, including alignment with complicated prompts, fine-grained typography generation, suboptimal visual aesthetics and fidelity, and limited image resolutions. Specifically, the advancements of Seedream 3.0 stem from improvements across the entire pipeline, from data construction to model deployment. At the data stratum, we double the dataset using a defect-aware training paradigm and a dual-axis collaborative data-sampling framework. Furthermore, we adopt several effective techniques such as mixed-resolution training, cross-modality RoPE, representation alignment loss, and resolution-aware timestep sampling in the pre-training phase. During the post-training stage, we utilize diversified aesthetic captions in SFT, and a VLM-based reward model with scaling, thereby achieving outputs that well align with human preferences. Furthermore, Seedream 3.0 pioneers a novel acceleration paradigm. By employing consistent noise expectation and importance-aware timestep sampling, we achieve a 4 to 8 times speedup while maintaining image quality. Seedream 3.0 demonstrates significant improvements over Seedream 2.0: it enhances overall capabilities, in particular for text-rendering in complicated Chinese characters which is important to professional typography generation. In addition, it provides native high-resolution output (up to 2K), allowing it to generate images with high visual quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LLMs exhibit advanced reasoning capabilities, offering the potential to transform natural language questions into mathematical models. However, existing open-source datasets in operations research domain lack detailed annotations of the modeling process, such as variable definitions, focusing solely on objective values, which hinders reinforcement learning applications. To address this, we release the StructuredOR dataset, annotated with comprehensive labels that capture the complete mathematical modeling process. We further propose BPP-Search, an algorithm that integrates reinforcement learning into a tree-of-thought structure using Beam search, a Process reward model, and a pairwise Preference algorithm. This approach enables efficient exploration of tree structures, avoiding exhaustive search while improving accuracy. Extensive experiments on StructuredOR, NL4OPT, and MAMO-ComplexLP datasets show that BPP-Search significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In tree-based reasoning, BPP-Search excels in accuracy and efficiency, enabling faster retrieval of correct solutions. The StructuredOR dataset is available at https://github.com/tengwang0318/StructuredOR.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities that benefits from online reinforcement learning (RL). These capabilities have primarily been demonstrated within the left-to-right autoregressive (AR) generation paradigm. In contrast, non-autoregressive paradigms based on diffusion generate text in a coarse-to-fine manner. Although recent diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have achieved competitive language modeling performance compared to their AR counterparts, it remains unclear if dLLMs can also leverage recent advances in LLM reasoning. To this end, we propose d1, a framework to adapt pre-trained masked dLLMs into reasoning models via a combination of supervised finetuning (SFT) and RL. Specifically, we develop and extend techniques to improve reasoning in pretrained dLLMs: (a) we utilize a masked SFT technique to distill knowledge and instill self-improvement behavior directly from existing datasets, and (b) we introduce a novel critic-free, policy-gradient based RL algorithm called diffu-GRPO. Through empirical studies, we investigate the performance of different post-training recipes on multiple mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks. We find that d1 yields the best performance and significantly improves performance of a state-of-the-art dLLM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Personality assessment, particularly through situational judgment tests (SJTs), is a vital tool for psychological research, talent selection, and educational evaluation. This study explores the potential of GPT-4, a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM), to automate the generation of personality situational judgment tests (PSJTs) in Chinese. Traditional SJT development is labor-intensive and prone to biases, while GPT-4 offers a scalable, efficient alternative. Two studies were conducted: Study 1 evaluated the impact of prompt design and temperature settings on content validity, finding that optimized prompts with a temperature of 1.0 produced creative and accurate items. Study 2 assessed the psychometric properties of GPT-4-generated PSJTs, revealing that they demonstrated satisfactory reliability and validity, surpassing the performance of manually developed tests in measuring the Big Five personality traits. This research highlights GPT-4's effectiveness in developing high-quality PSJTs, providing a scalable and innovative method for psychometric test development. These findings expand the possibilities of automatic item generation and the application of LLMs in psychology, and offer practical implications for streamlining test development processes in resource-limited settings.

This method involves the architect's close collaboration with LLM-fueled tooling over the whole process. The architect is guided through Domain Model creation, Use Case specification, architectural decisions, and architecture evaluation. While the architect can take complete control of the process and the results, and use the tooling as a building set, they can follow the intended process for maximum tooling support. The preliminary results suggest the feasibility of this process and indicate major time savings for the architect.

But what -- if anything -- do LLMs actually know? In this paper, I argue that LLMs can acquire tacit knowledge as defined by Martin Davies (1990). Whereas Davies himself denies that neural networks can acquire tacit knowledge, I demonstrate that certain architectural features of LLMs satisfy the constraints of semantic description, syntactic structure, and causal systematicity. Thus, tacit knowledge may serve as a conceptual framework for describing, explaining, and intervening on LLMs and their behavior.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, fine-tuning Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) often leads to the issue of spurious correlations, which negatively impacts performance, particularly when dealing with out-of-distribution data. To address this problem, we propose SALAD}(Structure Aware and LLM-driven Augmented Data), a novel approach designed to enhance model robustness and generalization by generating structure-aware and counterfactually augmented data for contrastive learning. Our method leverages a tagging-based approach to generate structure-aware positive samples and utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate counterfactual negative samples with diverse sentence patterns. By applying contrastive learning, SALAD enables the model to focus on learning the structural relationships between key sentence components while minimizing reliance on spurious correlations. We validate our approach through experiments on three tasks: Sentiment Classification, Sexism Detection, and Natural Language Inference. The results demonstrate that SALAD not only improves model robustness and performance across different environments but also enhances generalization to out-of-distribution datasets and cross-domain scenarios.

We demonstrate two approaches for bypassing LLM prompt injection and jailbreak detection systems via traditional character injection methods and algorithmic Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) evasion techniques. Through testing against six prominent protection systems, including Microsoft's Azure Prompt Shield and Meta's Prompt Guard, we show that both methods can be used to evade detection while maintaining adversarial utility achieving in some instances up to 100% evasion success. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adversaries can enhance Attack Success Rates (ASR) against black-box targets by leveraging word importance ranking computed by offline white-box models. Our findings reveal vulnerabilities within current LLM protection mechanisms and highlight the need for more robust guardrail systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Along with the proliferating research interest in Semantic Communication (SemCom), Joint Source Channel Coding (JSCC) has dominated the attention due to the widely assumed existence in efficiently delivering information semantics. %has emerged as a pivotal area of research, aiming to enhance the efficiency and reliability of information transmission through deep learning-based methods. Nevertheless, this paper challenges the conventional JSCC paradigm, and advocates for adoption of Separate Source Channel Coding (SSCC) to enjoy the underlying more degree of freedom for optimization. We demonstrate that SSCC, after leveraging the strengths of Large Language Model (LLM) for source coding and Error Correction Code Transformer (ECCT) complemented for channel decoding, offers superior performance over JSCC. Our proposed framework also effectively highlights the compatibility challenges between SemCom approaches and digital communication systems, particularly concerning the resource costs associated with the transmission of high precision floating point numbers. Through comprehensive evaluations, we establish that empowered by LLM-based compression and ECCT-enhanced error correction, SSCC remains a viable and effective solution for modern communication systems. In other words, separate source and channel coding is still what we need!

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The most advanced future AI systems will first be deployed inside the frontier AI companies developing them. According to these companies and independent experts, AI systems may reach or even surpass human intelligence and capabilities by 2030. Internal deployment is, therefore, a key source of benefits and risks from frontier AI systems. Despite this, the governance of the internal deployment of highly advanced frontier AI systems appears absent. This report aims to address this absence by priming a conversation around the governance of internal deployment. It presents a conceptualization of internal deployment, learnings from other sectors, reviews of existing legal frameworks and their applicability, and illustrative examples of the type of scenarios we are most concerned about. Specifically, it discusses the risks correlated to the loss of control via the internal application of a misaligned AI system to the AI research and development pipeline, and unconstrained and undetected power concentration behind closed doors. The report culminates with a small number of targeted recommendations that provide a first blueprint for the governance of internal deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current research in adversarial robustness of LLMs focuses on discrete input manipulations in the natural language space, which can be directly transferred to closed-source models. However, this approach neglects the steady progression of open-source models. As open-source models advance in capability, ensuring their safety also becomes increasingly imperative. Yet, attacks tailored to open-source LLMs that exploit full model access remain largely unexplored. We address this research gap and propose the embedding space attack, which directly attacks the continuous embedding representation of input tokens. We find that embedding space attacks circumvent model alignments and trigger harmful behaviors more efficiently than discrete attacks or model fine-tuning. Furthermore, we present a novel threat model in the context of unlearning and show that embedding space attacks can extract supposedly deleted information from unlearned LLMs across multiple datasets and models. Our findings highlight embedding space attacks as an important threat model in open-source LLMs. Trigger Warning: the appendix contains LLM-generated text with violence and harassment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The deployment of federated learning (FL) in non-terrestrial networks (NTN) that are supported by high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) offers numerous advantages. Due to its large footprint, it facilitates interaction with a large number of line-of-sight (LoS) ground clients, each possessing diverse datasets along with distinct communication and computational capabilities. The presence of many clients enhances the accuracy of the FL model and speeds up convergence. However, the variety of datasets among these clients poses a significant challenge, as it leads to pervasive non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. The data non-IIDness results in markedly reduced training accuracy and slower convergence rates. To address this issue, we propose a novel weighted attribute-based client selection strategy that leverages multiple user-specific attributes, including historical traffic patterns, instantaneous channel conditions, computational capabilities, and previous-round learning performance. By combining these attributes into a composite score for each user at every FL round and selecting users with higher scores as FL clients, the framework ensures more uniform and representative data distributions, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of non-IID data. Simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed client selection strategy in enhancing FL model accuracy and convergence rate, as well as reducing training loss, by effectively addressing the critical challenge of data non-IIDness in large-scale FL system implementations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Designing Verilog modules requires meticulous attention to correctness, efficiency, and adherence to design specifications. However, manually writing Verilog code remains a complex and time-consuming task that demands both expert knowledge and iterative refinement. Leveraging recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and their structured text generation capabilities, we propose VeriMind, an agentic LLM framework for Verilog code generation that significantly automates and optimizes the synthesis process. Unlike traditional LLM-based code generators, VeriMind employs a structured reasoning approach: given a user-provided prompt describing design requirements, the system first formulates a detailed train of thought before the final Verilog code is generated. This multi-step methodology enhances interpretability, accuracy, and adaptability in hardware design. In addition, we introduce a novel evaluation metric-pass@ARC-which combines the conventional pass@k measure with Average Refinement Cycles (ARC) to capture both success rate and the efficiency of iterative refinement. Experimental results on diverse hardware design tasks demonstrated that our approach achieved up to $8.3\%$ improvement on pass@k metric and $8.1\%$ on pass@ARC metric. These findings underscore the transformative potential of agentic LLMs in automated hardware design, RTL development, and digital system synthesis.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> An AI system can create and maintain knowledge only to the extent that it can verify that knowledge itself. Recent work on long Chain-of-Thought reasoning has demonstrated great potential of LLMs on solving competitive problems, but their verification ability remains to be weak and not sufficiently investigated. In this paper, we propose Heimdall, the long CoT verification LLM that can accurately judge the correctness of solutions. With pure reinforcement learning, we boost the verification accuracy from 62.5% to 94.5% on competitive math problems. By scaling with repeated sampling, the accuracy further increases to 97.5%. Through human evaluation, Heimdall demonstrates impressive generalization capabilities, successfully detecting most issues in challenging math proofs, the type of which is not included during training. Furthermore, we propose Pessimistic Verification to extend the functionality of Heimdall to scaling up the problem solving. It calls Heimdall to judge the solutions from a solver model and based on the pessimistic principle, selects the most likely correct solution with the least uncertainty. Taking DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B as the solver model, Pessimistic Verification improves the solution accuracy on AIME2025 from 54.2% to 70.0% with 16x compute budget and to 83.3% with more compute budget. With the stronger solver Gemini 2.5 Pro, the score reaches 93.0%. Finally, we prototype an automatic knowledge discovery system, a ternary system where one poses questions, another provides solutions, and the third verifies the solutions. Using the data synthesis work NuminaMath for the first two components, Heimdall effectively identifies problematic records within the dataset and reveals that nearly half of the data is flawed, which interestingly aligns with the recent ablation studies from NuminaMath.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The growing and evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats necessitates the development of supporting tools and platforms that allow for the creation of realistic IT environments operating within virtual, controlled settings as Cyber Ranges (CRs). CRs can be exploited for analyzing vulnerabilities and experimenting with the effectiveness of devised countermeasures, as well as serving as training environments for building cyber security skills and abilities for IT operators. This paper proposes ARCeR as an innovative solution for the automatic generation and deployment of CRs, starting from user-provided descriptions in a natural language. ARCeR relies on the Agentic RAG paradigm, which allows it to fully exploit state-of-art AI technologies. Experimental results show that ARCeR is able to successfully process prompts even in cases that LLMs or basic RAG systems are not able to cope with. Furthermore, ARCeR is able to target any CR framework provided that specific knowledge is made available to it.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in sentence-level machine translation, but scaling to document-level translation remains challenging, particularly in modeling long-range dependencies and discourse phenomena across sentences and paragraphs. In this work, we propose a method to improve LLM-based long-document translation through targeted fine-tuning on high-quality document-level data, which we curate and introduce as DocBlocks. Our approach supports multiple translation paradigms, including direct document-to-document and chunk-level translation, by integrating instructions both with and without surrounding context. This enables models to better capture cross-sentence dependencies while maintaining strong sentence-level translation performance. Experimental results show that incorporating multiple translation paradigms improves document-level translation quality and inference speed compared to prompting and agent-based methods.

  Extensions for Multi-Step LLM Agent Tasks</h2>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as autonomous agents for multi-step tasks. However, most existing frameworks fail to maintain a structured understanding of the task state, often relying on linear prompt concatenation or shallow memory buffers. This leads to brittle performance, frequent hallucinations, and poor long-range coherence. In this work, we propose the Task Memory Engine (TME), a lightweight and structured memory module that tracks task execution using a hierarchical Task Memory Tree (TMT). Each node in the tree corresponds to a task step, storing relevant input, output, status, and sub-task relationships. We introduce a prompt synthesis method that dynamically generates LLM prompts based on the active node path, significantly improving execution consistency and contextual grounding. Through case studies and comparative experiments on multi-step agent tasks, we demonstrate that TME leads to better task completion accuracy and more interpretable behavior with minimal implementation overhead. A reference implementation of the core TME components is available at https://github.com/biubiutomato/TME-Agent, including basic examples and structured memory integration. While the current implementation uses a tree-based structure, TME is designed to be graph-aware, supporting reusable substeps, converging task paths, and shared dependencies. This lays the groundwork for future DAG-based memory architectures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language model unlearning has become a critical challenge in ensuring safety and controlled model behavior by removing undesired data-model influences from the pretrained model while preserving general utility. Significant recent efforts have been dedicated to developing LLM unlearning benchmarks such as WMDP (Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy) and MUSE (Machine Unlearning Six-way Evaluation), facilitating standardized unlearning performance assessment and method comparison. Despite their usefulness, we uncover for the first time a novel coreset effect within these benchmarks. Specifically, we find that LLM unlearning achieved with the original (full) forget set can be effectively maintained using a significantly smaller subset (functioning as a "coreset"), e.g., as little as 5% of the forget set, even when selected at random. This suggests that LLM unlearning in these benchmarks can be performed surprisingly easily, even in an extremely low-data regime. We demonstrate that this coreset effect remains strong, regardless of the LLM unlearning method used, such as NPO (Negative Preference Optimization) and RMU (Representation Misdirection Unlearning), the popular ones in these benchmarks. The surprisingly strong coreset effect is also robust across various data selection methods, ranging from random selection to more sophisticated heuristic approaches. We explain the coreset effect in LLM unlearning through a keyword-based perspective, showing that keywords extracted from the forget set alone contribute significantly to unlearning effectiveness and indicating that current unlearning is driven by a compact set of high-impact tokens rather than the entire dataset. We further justify the faithfulness of coreset-unlearned models along additional dimensions, such as mode connectivity and robustness to jailbreaking attacks. Codes are available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/MU-Coreset.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In information retrieval (IR), providing appropriate clarifications to better understand users' information needs is crucial for building a proactive search-oriented dialogue system. Due to the strong in-context learning ability of large language models (LLMs), recent studies investigate prompting methods to generate clarifications using few-shot or Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts. However, vanilla CoT prompting does not distinguish the characteristics of different information needs, making it difficult to understand how LLMs resolve ambiguities in user queries. In this work, we focus on the concept of ambiguity for clarification, seeking to model and integrate ambiguities in the clarification process. To this end, we comprehensively study the impact of prompting schemes based on reasoning and ambiguity for clarification. The idea is to enhance the reasoning abilities of LLMs by limiting CoT to predict first ambiguity types that can be interpreted as instructions to clarify, then correspondingly generate clarifications. We name this new prompting scheme Ambiguity Type-Chain of Thought (AT-CoT). Experiments are conducted on various datasets containing human-annotated clarifying questions to compare AT-CoT with multiple baselines. We also perform user simulations to implicitly measure the quality of generated clarifications under various IR scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Earth Observation (EO) provides critical planetary data for environmental monitoring, disaster management, climate science, and other scientific domains. Here we ask: Are AI systems ready for reliable Earth Observation? We introduce \datasetnamenospace, a benchmark of 140 yes/no questions from NASA Earth Observatory articles across 13 topics and 17 satellite sensors. Using Google Earth Engine API as a tool, LLM agents can only achieve an accuracy of 33% because the code fails to run over 58% of the time. We improve the failure rate for open models by fine-tuning synthetic data, allowing much smaller models (Llama-3.1-8B) to achieve comparable accuracy to much larger ones (e.g., DeepSeek-R1). Taken together, our findings identify significant challenges to be solved before AI agents can automate earth observation, and suggest paths forward.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified concerns about content traceability and potential misuse. Existing watermarking schemes for sampled text often face trade-offs between maintaining text quality and ensuring robust detection against various attacks. To address these issues, we propose a novel watermarking scheme that improves both detectability and text quality by introducing a cumulative watermark entropy threshold. Our approach is compatible with and generalizes existing sampling functions, enhancing adaptability. Experimental results across multiple LLMs show that our scheme significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving over 80\% improvements on widely-used datasets, e.g., MATH and GSM8K, while maintaining high detection accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) endeavors to bridge the gap between a model trained on a labeled source domain and its deployment in an unlabeled target domain. However, current high-performance models demand significant resources, making deployment costs prohibitive and highlighting the need for compact, yet effective models. For UDA of lightweight models, Knowledge Distillation (KD) leveraging a Teacher-Student framework could be a common approach, but we found that domain shift in UDA leads to a significant increase in non-salient parameters in the teacher model, degrading model's generalization ability and transferring misleading information to the student model. Interestingly, we observed that this phenomenon occurs considerably less in the student model. Driven by this insight, we introduce Collaborative Learning for UDA (CLDA), a method that updates the teacher's non-salient parameters using the student model and at the same time utilizes the updated teacher model to improve UDA performance of the student model. Experiments show consistent performance improvements for both student and teacher models. For example, in semantic segmentation, CLDA achieves an improvement of +0.7% mIoU for the teacher model and +1.4% mIoU for the student model compared to the baseline model in the GTA-to-Cityscapes datasets. In the Synthia-to-Cityscapes dataset, it achieves an improvement of +0.8% mIoU and +2.0% mIoU for the teacher and student models, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, overconfidence in large language models (LLMs) has garnered considerable attention due to its fundamental importance in quantifying the trustworthiness of LLM generation. However, existing approaches prompt the \textit{black box LLMs} to produce their confidence (\textit{verbalized confidence}), which can be subject to many biases and hallucinations. Inspired by a different aspect of overconfidence in cognitive science called \textit{overprecision}, we designed a framework for its study in black box LLMs. This framework contains three main phases: 1) generation, 2) refinement and 3) evaluation. In the generation phase we prompt the LLM to generate answers to numerical questions in the form of intervals with a certain level of confidence. This confidence level is imposed in the prompt and not required for the LLM to generate as in previous approaches. We use various prompting techniques and use the same prompt multiple times to gauge the effects of randomness in the generation process. In the refinement phase, answers from the previous phase are refined to generate better answers. The LLM answers are evaluated and studied in the evaluation phase to understand its internal workings. This study allowed us to gain various insights into LLM overprecision: 1) LLMs are highly uncalibrated for numerical tasks 2) {\color{blue}there is no correlation between the length of the interval and the imposed confidence level, which can be symptomatic of a a) lack of understanding of the concept of confidence or b) inability to adjust self-confidence by following instructions}, {\color{blue}3)} LLM numerical precision differs depending on the task, scale of answer and prompting technique {\color{blue}4) Refinement of answers doesn't improve precision in most cases}. We believe this study offers new perspectives on LLM overconfidence and serves as a strong baseline for overprecision in LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present a novel framework that bridges the gap between the interpretability of decision trees and the advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to predict startup success. Our approach leverages chain-of-thought prompting to generate detailed reasoning logs, which are subsequently distilled into structured, human-understandable logical rules. The pipeline integrates multiple enhancements - efficient data ingestion, a two-step refinement process, ensemble candidate sampling, simulated reinforcement learning scoring, and persistent memory - to ensure both stable decision-making and transparent output. Experimental evaluations on curated startup datasets demonstrate that our combined pipeline improves precision by 54% from 0.225 to 0.346 and accuracy by 50% from 0.46 to 0.70 compared to a standalone OpenAI o3 model. Notably, our model achieves over 2x the precision of a random classifier (16%). By combining state-of-the-art AI reasoning with explicit rule-based explanations, our method not only augments traditional decision-making processes but also facilitates expert intervention and continuous policy refinement. This work lays the foundation for the implementation of interpretable LLM-powered decision frameworks in high-stakes investment environments and other domains that require transparent and data-driven insights.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite recent advances in Large Video Language Models (LVLMs), they still struggle with fine-grained temporal understanding, hallucinate, and often make simple mistakes on even simple video question-answering tasks, all of which pose significant challenges to their safe and reliable deployment in real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose a self-alignment framework that enables LVLMs to learn from their own errors. Our proposed framework first obtains a training set of preferred and non-preferred response pairs, where non-preferred responses are generated by incorporating common error patterns that often occur due to inadequate spatio-temporal understanding, spurious correlations between co-occurring concepts, and over-reliance on linguistic cues while neglecting the vision modality, among others. To facilitate self-alignment of LVLMs with the constructed preferred and non-preferred response pairs, we introduce Refined Regularized Preference Optimization (RRPO), a novel preference optimization method that utilizes sub-sequence-level refined rewards and token-wise KL regularization to address the limitations of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We demonstrate that RRPO achieves more precise alignment and more stable training compared to DPO. Our experiments and analysis validate the effectiveness of our approach across diverse video tasks, including video hallucination, short- and long-video understanding, and fine-grained temporal reasoning.

We fine-tune LLMs on datasets with a specified number of modules to test whether LLMs can emulate the human ability to quickly count and arrange items. Our experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs, particularly GPT4o-mini, achieve high success and optimal rates while attaining relatively low average dead space. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs as promising solutions for complex optimization tasks in VLSI design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph neural networks are becoming increasingly popular in the field of machine learning due to their unique ability to process data structured in graphs. They have also been applied in safety-critical environments where perturbations inherently occur. However, these perturbations require us to formally verify neural networks before their deployment in safety-critical environments as neural networks are prone to adversarial attacks. While there exists research on the formal verification of neural networks, there is no work verifying the robustness of generic graph convolutional network architectures with uncertainty in the node features and in the graph structure over multiple message-passing steps. This work addresses this research gap by explicitly preserving the non-convex dependencies of all elements in the underlying computations through reachability analysis with (matrix) polynomial zonotopes. We demonstrate our approach on three popular benchmark datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern retrieval systems do not rely on a single ranking model to construct their rankings. Instead, they generally take a cascading approach where a sequence of ranking models are applied in multiple re-ranking stages. Thereby, they balance the quality of the top-K ranking with computational costs by limiting the number of documents each model re-ranks. However, the cascading approach is not the only way models can interact to form a retrieval system.   We propose the concept of compound retrieval systems as a broader class of retrieval systems that apply multiple prediction models. This encapsulates cascading models but also allows other types of interactions than top-K re-ranking. In particular, we enable interactions with large language models (LLMs) which can provide relative relevance comparisons. We focus on the optimization of compound retrieval system design which uniquely involves learning where to apply the component models and how to aggregate their predictions into a final ranking. This work shows how our compound approach can combine the classic BM25 retrieval model with state-of-the-art (pairwise) LLM relevance predictions, while optimizing a given ranking metric and efficiency target. Our experimental results show optimized compound retrieval systems provide better trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency than cascading approaches, even when applied in a self-supervised manner.   With the introduction of compound retrieval systems, we hope to inspire the information retrieval field to more out-of-the-box thinking on how prediction models can interact to form rankings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The performance of deep learning models depends heavily on test samples at runtime, and shifts from the training data distribution can significantly reduce accuracy. Test-time adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adapting models during inference without requiring labeled test data or access to the original training set. While research has explored TTA from various perspectives like algorithmic complexity, data and class distribution shifts, model architectures, and offline versus continuous learning, constraints specific to mobile and edge devices remain underexplored. We propose BoTTA, a benchmark designed to evaluate TTA methods under practical constraints on mobile and edge devices. Our evaluation targets four key challenges caused by limited resources and usage conditions: (i) limited test samples, (ii) limited exposure to categories, (iii) diverse distribution shifts, and (iv) overlapping shifts within a sample. We assess state-of-the-art TTA methods under these scenarios using benchmark datasets and report system-level metrics on a real testbed. Furthermore, unlike prior work, we align with on-device requirements by advocating periodic adaptation instead of continuous inference-time adaptation. Experiments reveal key insights: many recent TTA algorithms struggle with small datasets, fail to generalize to unseen categories, and depend on the diversity and complexity of distribution shifts. BoTTA also reports device-specific resource use. For example, while SHOT improves accuracy by $2.25\times$ with $512$ adaptation samples, it uses $1.08\times$ peak memory on Raspberry Pi versus the base model. BoTTA offers actionable guidance for TTA in real-world, resource-constrained deployments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text-to-Video generation, which utilizes the provided text prompt to generate high-quality videos, has drawn increasing attention and achieved great success due to the development of diffusion models recently. Existing methods mainly rely on a pre-trained text encoder to capture the semantic information and perform cross attention with the encoded text prompt to guide the generation of video. However, when it comes to complex prompts that contain dynamic scenes and multiple camera-view transformations, these methods can not decompose the overall information into separate scenes, as well as fail to smoothly change scenes based on the corresponding camera-views. To solve these problems, we propose a novel method, i.e., Modular-Cam. Specifically, to better understand a given complex prompt, we utilize a large language model to analyze user instructions and decouple them into multiple scenes together with transition actions. To generate a video containing dynamic scenes that match the given camera-views, we incorporate the widely-used temporal transformer into the diffusion model to ensure continuity within a single scene and propose CamOperator, a modular network based module that well controls the camera movements. Moreover, we propose AdaControlNet, which utilizes ControlNet to ensure consistency across scenes and adaptively adjusts the color tone of the generated video. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments prove our proposed Modular-Cam's strong capability of generating multi-scene videos together with its ability to achieve fine-grained control of camera movements.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Abundant, well-annotated multimodal data in remote sensing are pivotal for aligning complex visual remote sensing (RS) scenes with human language, enabling the development of specialized vision language models across diverse RS interpretation tasks. However, annotating RS images with rich linguistic semantics at scale demands expertise in RS and substantial human labor, making it costly and often impractical. In this study, we propose a workflow that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate multimodal datasets with semantically rich captions at scale from plain OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for images sourced from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. This approach facilitates the generation of paired remote sensing data and can be readily scaled up using openly available data. Within this framework, we present RSTeller, a multimodal dataset comprising over 1.3 million RS images, each accompanied by two descriptive captions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSTeller enhances the performance of multiple existing vision language models for RS scene understanding through continual pre-training. Our methodology significantly reduces the manual effort and expertise needed for annotating remote sensing imagery while democratizing access to high-quality annotated data. This advancement fosters progress in visual language modeling and encourages broader participation in remote sensing research and applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Radar-based HAR has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional monitoring approaches, such as wearable devices and camera-based systems, due to its unique privacy preservation and robustness advantages. However, existing solutions based on convolutional and recurrent neural networks, although effective, are computationally demanding during deployment. This limits their applicability in scenarios with constrained resources or those requiring multiple sensors. Advanced architectures, such as ViT and SSM architectures, offer improved modeling capabilities and have made efforts toward lightweight designs. However, their computational complexity remains relatively high. To leverage the strengths of transformer architectures while simultaneously enhancing accuracy and reducing computational complexity, this paper introduces RadMamba, a parameter-efficient, radar micro-Doppler-oriented Mamba SSM specifically tailored for radar-based HAR. Across three diverse datasets, RadMamba matches the top-performing previous model's 99.8% classification accuracy on Dataset DIAT with only 1/400 of its parameters and equals the leading models' 92.0% accuracy on Dataset CI4R with merely 1/10 of their parameters. In scenarios with continuous sequences of actions evaluated on Dataset UoG2020, RadMamba surpasses other models with significantly higher parameter counts by at least 3%, achieving this with only 6.7k parameters.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Centralization enhances the efficiency of Artificial Intelligence (AI), but it also brings critical challenges, such as single points of failure, inherent biases, data privacy concerns, and scalability issues, for AI systems. These problems are especially common in closed-source large language models (LLMs), where user data is collected and used with full transparency. To address these issues, blockchain-based decentralized AI (DeAI) has been introduced. DeAI leverages the strengths of blockchain technologies to enhance the transparency, security, decentralization, as well as trustworthiness of AI systems. Although DeAI has been widely developed in industry, a comprehensive understanding of state-of-the-art practical DeAI solutions is still lacking. In this work, we present a Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) for blockchain-based DeAI solutions. We propose a taxonomy to classify existing DeAI protocols based on the model lifecycle. Based on this taxonomy, we provide a structured way to clarify the landscape of DeAI protocols and identify their similarities and differences. Specifically, we analyze the functionalities of blockchain in DeAI, investigate how blockchain features contribute to enhancing the security, transparency, and trustworthiness of AI processes, and also ensure fair incentives for AI data and model contributors. In addition, we provide key insights and research gaps in developing DeAI protocols for future research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As Ethereum continues to thrive, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) has become the cornerstone powering tens of millions of active smart contracts. Intuitively, security issues in EVMs could lead to inconsistent behaviors among smart contracts or even denial-of-service of the entire blockchain network. However, to the best of our knowledge, only a limited number of studies focus on the security of EVMs. Moreover, they suffer from 1) insufficient test input diversity and invalid semantics; and 2) the inability to automatically identify bugs and locate root causes. To bridge this gap, we propose OpDiffer, a differential testing framework for EVM, which takes advantage of LLMs and static analysis methods to address the above two limitations. We conducted the largest-scale evaluation, covering nine EVMs and uncovering 26 previously unknown bugs, 22 of which have been confirmed by developers and three have been assigned CNVD IDs. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, OpDiffer can improve code coverage by at most 71.06%, 148.40% and 655.56%, respectively. Through an analysis of real-world deployed Ethereum contracts, we estimate that 7.21% of the contracts could trigger our identified EVM bugs under certain environmental settings, potentially resulting in severe negative impact on the Ethereum ecosystem.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Collecting human preference feedback is often expensive, leading recent works to develop principled algorithms to select them more efficiently. However, these works assume that the underlying reward function is linear, an assumption that does not hold in many real-life applications, such as online recommendation and LLM alignment. To address this limitation, we propose Neural-ADB, an algorithm based on the neural contextual dueling bandit framework that provides a principled and practical method for collecting human preference feedback when the underlying latent reward function is non-linear. We theoretically show that when preference feedback follows the Bradley-Terry-Luce model, the worst sub-optimality gap of the policy learned by Neural-ADB decreases at a sub-linear rate as the preference dataset increases. Our experimental results on problem instances derived from synthetic preference datasets further validate the effectiveness of Neural-ADB.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely regarded as errors - outputs that deviate from factual accuracy. However, in creative or exploratory contexts, these "mistakes" may represent unexpected avenues for innovation. We introduce Purposefully Induced Psychosis (PIP), a novel approach that amplifies LLM hallucinations for imaginative tasks such as speculative fiction, interactive storytelling, and mixed-reality simulations. Drawing on Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, where Pip's "madness" reveals profound insight, we reframe hallucinations as a source of computational imagination rather than a flaw. Our method fine-tunes LLMs to encourage speculative, metaphorical, and surreal outputs - hallucinations that are useful when factual accuracy is not the chief objective. Inspired by the consensual illusions of theater and stage magic, PIP situates these creative missteps in contexts where users willingly suspend disbelief, thereby transforming "errors" into catalysts for new ways of thinking. We discuss potential applications, design principles for ensuring user consent, preliminary observations, and implications for broader AI ethics and human-AI collaboration.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, there has been a significant trend toward using large language model (LLM)-based recommender systems (RecSys). Current research primarily focuses on representing complex user-item interactions within a discrete space to align with the inherent discrete nature of language models. However, this approach faces limitations due to its discrete nature: (i) information is often compressed during discretization; (ii) the tokenization and generation for the vast number of users and items in real-world scenarios are constrained by a limited vocabulary. Embracing continuous data presents a promising alternative to enhance expressive capabilities, though this approach is still in its early stages. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework, DeftRec, which incorporates \textbf{de}noising di\textbf{f}fusion models to enable LLM-based RecSys to seamlessly support continuous \textbf{t}oken as input and target. First, we introduce a robust tokenizer with a masking operation and an additive K-way architecture to index users and items, capturing their complex collaborative relationships into continuous tokens. Crucially, we develop a denoising diffusion model to process user preferences within continuous domains by conditioning on reasoning content from pre-trained large language model. During the denoising process, we reformulate the objective to include negative interactions, building a comprehensive understanding of user preferences for effective and accurate recommendation generation. Finally, given a continuous token as output, recommendations can be easily generated through score-based retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, showing that DeftRec surpasses competitive benchmarks, including both traditional and emerging LLM-based RecSys.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This essay proposes an analogy between large language models (LLMs) and quasicrystals: systems that exhibit global coherence without periodic repetition and that are generated through local constraints. While LLMs are often evaluated in terms of predictive accuracy, factuality, or alignment, this structural perspective suggests that their most characteristic behavior is the production of internally resonant linguistic patterns. Just as quasicrystals forced a redefinition of order in physical systems, viewing LLMs as generators of quasi-structured language opens new paths for evaluation and design: privileging propagation of constraint over token-level accuracy, and coherence of form over fixed meaning. LLM outputs should be read not only for what they say, but for the patterns of constraint and coherence that organize them. This shift reframes generative language as a space of emergent patterning: LLMs are neither fully random nor strictly rule-based, but defined by a logic of constraint, resonance, and structural depth.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> AI is poised to revolutionize telecommunication networks by boosting efficiency, automation, and decision-making. However, the black-box nature of most AI models introduces substantial risk, possibly deterring adoption by network operators. These risks are not addressed by the current prevailing deployment strategy, which typically follows a best-effort train-and-deploy paradigm. This paper reviews conformal calibration, a general framework that moves beyond the state of the art by adopting computationally lightweight, advanced statistical tools that offer formal reliability guarantees without requiring further training or fine-tuning. Conformal calibration encompasses pre-deployment calibration via uncertainty quantification or hyperparameter selection; online monitoring to detect and mitigate failures in real time; and counterfactual post-deployment performance analysis to address "what if" diagnostic questions after deployment. By weaving conformal calibration into the AI model lifecycle, network operators can establish confidence in black-box AI models as a dependable enabling technology for wireless systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The exponential growth of cyber threat knowledge, exemplified by the expansion of databases such as MITRE-CVE and NVD, poses significant challenges for cyber threat analysis. Security professionals are increasingly burdened by the sheer volume and complexity of information, creating an urgent need for effective tools to navigate, synthesize, and act on large-scale data to counter evolving threats proactively. However, conventional threat intelligence tools often fail to scale with the dynamic nature of this data and lack the adaptability to support diverse threat intelligence tasks.   In this work, we introduce CYLENS, a cyber threat intelligence copilot powered by large language models (LLMs). CYLENS is designed to assist security professionals throughout the entire threat management lifecycle, supporting threat attribution, contextualization, detection, correlation, prioritization, and remediation. To ensure domain expertise, CYLENS integrates knowledge from 271,570 threat reports into its model parameters and incorporates six specialized NLP modules to enhance reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, CYLENS can be customized to meet the unique needs of different or ganizations, underscoring its adaptability. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that CYLENS consistently outperforms industry-leading LLMs and state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents. By detailing its design, development, and evaluation, this work provides a blueprint for leveraging LLMs to address complex, data-intensive cybersecurity challenges.

We received 2,618 submissions from 43 participating teams employing diverse methodologies. The large number of submissions underscores the interest of the community in hallucination detection. We present the results of the participating systems and conduct an empirical analysis to identify key factors contributing to strong performance in this task. We also emphasize relevant current challenges, notably the varying degree of hallucinations across languages and the high annotator disagreement when labeling hallucination spans.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Extractive reading comprehension question answering (QA) datasets are typically evaluated using Exact Match (EM) and F1-score, but these metrics often fail to fully capture model performance. With the success of large language models (LLMs), they have been employed in various tasks, including serving as judges (LLM-as-a-judge). In this paper, we reassess the performance of QA models using LLM-as-a-judge across four reading comprehension QA datasets. We examine different families of LLMs and various answer types to evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-as-a-judge in these tasks. Our results show that LLM-as-a-judge is highly correlated with human judgments and can replace traditional EM/F1 metrics. By using LLM-as-a-judge, the correlation with human judgments improves significantly, from 0.17 (EM) and 0.36 (F1-score) to 0.85. These findings confirm that EM and F1 metrics underestimate the true performance of the QA models. While LLM-as-a-judge is not perfect for more difficult answer types (e.g., job), it still outperforms EM/F1, and we observe no bias issues, such as self-preference, when the same model is used for both the QA and judgment tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> An ideal detection system for machine generated content is supposed to work well on any generator as many more advanced LLMs come into existence day by day. Existing systems often struggle with accurately identifying AI-generated content over shorter texts. Further, not all texts might be entirely authored by a human or LLM, hence we focused more over partial cases i.e human-LLM co-authored texts. Our paper introduces a set of models built for the task of token classification which are trained on an extensive collection of human-machine co-authored texts, which performed well over texts of unseen domains, unseen generators, texts by non-native speakers and those with adversarial inputs. We also introduce a new dataset of over 2.4M such texts mostly co-authored by several popular proprietary LLMs over 23 languages. We also present findings of our models' performance over each texts of each domain and generator. Additional findings include comparison of performance against each adversarial method, length of input texts and characteristics of generated texts compared to the original human authored texts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding time series is crucial for its application in real-world scenarios. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to time series tasks, leveraging their strong language capabilities to enhance various applications. However, research on multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for time series understanding and reasoning remains limited, primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets that align time series with textual information. This paper introduces ChatTS, a novel MLLM designed for time series analysis. ChatTS treats time series as a modality, similar to how vision MLLMs process images, enabling it to perform both understanding and reasoning with time series. To address the scarcity of training data, we propose an attribute-based method for generating synthetic time series with detailed attribute descriptions. We further introduce Time Series Evol-Instruct, a novel approach that generates diverse time series Q&As, enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, ChatTS is the first TS-MLLM that takes multivariate time series as input for understanding and reasoning, which is fine-tuned exclusively on synthetic datasets. We evaluate its performance using benchmark datasets with real-world data, including six alignment tasks and four reasoning tasks. Our results show that ChatTS significantly outperforms existing vision-based MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and text/agent-based LLMs, achieving a 46.0% improvement in alignment tasks and a 25.8% improvement in reasoning tasks. We have open-sourced the source code, model checkpoint and datasets at https://github.com/NetManAIOps/ChatTS.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Gender-neutral translation (GNT) aims to avoid expressing the gender of human referents when the source text lacks explicit cues about the gender of those referents. Evaluating GNT automatically is particularly challenging, with current solutions being limited to monolingual classifiers. Such solutions are not ideal because they do not factor in the source sentence and require dedicated data and fine-tuning to scale to new languages. In this work, we address such limitations by investigating the use of large language models (LLMs) as evaluators of GNT. Specifically, we explore two prompting approaches: one in which LLMs generate sentence-level assessments only, and another, akin to a chain-of-thought approach, where they first produce detailed phrase-level annotations before a sentence-level judgment. Through extensive experiments on multiple languages with five models, both open and proprietary, we show that LLMs can serve as evaluators of GNT. Moreover, we find that prompting for phrase-level annotations before sentence-level assessments consistently improves the accuracy of all models, providing a better and more scalable alternative to current solutions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, DeepSeek-R1 (671B) (DeepSeek-AIet al., 2025) has demonstrated its excellent reasoning ability in complex tasks and has publiclyshared its methodology. This provides potentially high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data for stimulating the reasoning abilities of small-sized large language models (LLMs). To generate high-quality CoT data for different LLMs, we seek an efficient method for generating high-quality CoT data with LLM-Adaptive questiondifficulty levels. First, we grade the difficulty of the questions according to the reasoning ability of the LLMs themselves and construct a LLM-Adaptive question database. Second, we sample the problem database based on a distribution of difficulty levels of the questions and then use DeepSeek-R1 (671B) (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) to generate the corresponding high-quality CoT data with correct answers. Thanks to the construction of CoT data with LLM-Adaptive difficulty levels, we have significantly reduced the cost of data generation and enhanced the efficiency of model supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Finally, we have validated the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed method in the fields of complex mathematical competitions and code generation tasks. Notably, with only 2k high-quality mathematical CoT data, our ZMath-32B surpasses DeepSeek-Distill-32B in math reasoning task. Similarly, with only 2k high-quality code CoT data, our ZCode-32B surpasses DeepSeek-Distill-32B in code reasoning tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) based on transformer architectures have sparked significant interest in understanding their inner workings. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to modeling transformer architectures using highly flexible non-autonomous neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Our proposed model parameterizes all weights of attention and feed-forward blocks through neural networks, expressing these weights as functions of a continuous layer index. Through spectral analysis of the model's dynamics, we uncover an increase in eigenvalue magnitude that challenges the weight-sharing assumption prevalent in existing theoretical studies. We also leverage the Lyapunov exponent to examine token-level sensitivity, enhancing model interpretability. Our neural ODE transformer demonstrates performance comparable to or better than vanilla transformers across various configurations and datasets, while offering flexible fine-tuning capabilities that can adapt to different architectural constraints.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) through Transformer structures have dominated many machine learning tasks, especially text processing. However, these models require massive amounts of data for training and induce high resource requirements, particularly in terms of the large number of Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) and the high amounts of memory needed. To fine-tune such a model in a parameter-efficient way, techniques like Adapter or LoRA have been developed. However, we observe that the application of LoRA, when used in federated learning (FL), while still being parameter-efficient, is memory and FLOP inefficient. Based on that observation, we develop a novel layer finetuning scheme that allows devices in cross-device FL to make use of pretrained neural networks (NNs) while adhering to given resource constraints. We show that our presented scheme outperforms the current state of the art when dealing with homogeneous or heterogeneous computation and memory constraints and is on par with LoRA regarding limited communication, thereby achieving significantly higher accuracies in FL training.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, with their performance heavily dependent on the quality of input prompts. While prompt engineering has proven effective, it typically relies on manual adjustments, making it time-consuming and potentially suboptimal. This paper introduces GAAPO (Genetic Algorithm Applied to Prompt Optimization), a novel hybrid optimization framework that leverages genetic algorithm principles to evolve prompts through successive generations. Unlike traditional genetic approaches that rely solely on mutation and crossover operations, GAAPO integrates multiple specialized prompt generation strategies within its evolutionary framework. Through extensive experimentation on diverse datasets including ETHOS, MMLU-Pro, and GPQA, our analysis reveals several important point for the future development of automatic prompt optimization methods: importance of the tradeoff between the population size and the number of generations, effect of selection methods on stability results, capacity of different LLMs and especially reasoning models to be able to automatically generate prompts from similar queries... Furthermore, we provide insights into the relative effectiveness of different prompt generation strategies and their evolution across optimization phases. These findings contribute to both the theoretical understanding of prompt optimization and practical applications in improving LLM performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Stories are a fundamental aspect of human experience. Engaging deeply with stories and spotting plot holes -- inconsistencies in a storyline that break the internal logic or rules of a story's world -- requires nuanced reasoning skills, including tracking entities and events and their interplay, abstract thinking, pragmatic narrative understanding, commonsense and social reasoning, and theory of mind. As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly generate, interpret, and modify text, rigorously assessing their narrative consistency and deeper language understanding becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks focus mainly on surface-level comprehension. In this work, we propose plot hole detection in stories as a proxy to evaluate language understanding and reasoning in LLMs. We introduce FlawedFictionsMaker, a novel algorithm to controllably and carefully synthesize plot holes in human-written stories. Using this algorithm, we construct a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' plot hole detection abilities in stories -- FlawedFictions -- , which is robust to contamination, with human filtering ensuring high quality. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle in accurately solving FlawedFictions regardless of the reasoning effort allowed, with performance significantly degrading as story length increases. Finally, we show that LLM-based story summarization and story generation are prone to introducing plot holes, with more than 50% and 100% increases in plot hole detection rates with respect to human-written originals.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent progress in AI capabilities has heightened concerns that AI systems could pose a threat to national security, for example, by making it easier for malicious actors to perform cyberattacks on critical national infrastructure, or through loss of control of autonomous AI systems. In parallel, federal legislators in the US have proposed nascent 'AI incident regimes' to identify and counter similar threats. In this paper, we consolidate these two trends and present a timely proposal for a legally mandated post-deployment AI incident regime that aims to counter potential national security threats from AI systems. We start the paper by introducing the concept of 'security-critical' to describe sectors that pose extreme risks to national security, before arguing that 'security-critical' describes civilian nuclear power, aviation, life science dual-use research of concern, and frontier AI development. We then present in detail our AI incident regime proposal, justifying each component of the proposal by demonstrating its similarity to US domestic incident regimes in other 'security-critical' sectors. Finally, we sketch a hypothetical scenario where our proposed AI incident regime deals with an AI cyber incident. Our proposed AI incident regime is split into three phases. The first phase revolves around a novel operationalization of what counts as an 'AI incident' and we suggest that AI providers must create a 'national security case' before deploying a frontier AI system. The second and third phases spell out that AI providers should notify a government agency about incidents, and that the government agency should be involved in amending AI providers' security and safety procedures, in order to counter future threats to national security.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Existing large language model LLM-based recommendation methods face several challenges, including inefficiency in handling large candidate pools, sensitivity to item order within prompts ("lost in the middle" phenomenon) poor scalability, and unrealistic evaluation due to random negative sampling. To address these issues, we propose a Query-to-Recommendation approach that leverages LLMs to generate personalized queries for retrieving relevant items from the entire candidate pool, eliminating the need for candidate pre-selection. This method can be integrated into an ID-based recommendation system without additional training, enhances recommendation performance and diversity through LLMs' world knowledge, and performs well even for less popular item groups. Experiments on three datasets show up to 57 percent improvement, with an average gain of 31 percent, demonstrating strong zero-shot performance and further gains when ensembled with existing models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Although LLM-based agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), can use external tools and memory mechanisms to solve complex real-world tasks, they may also introduce critical security vulnerabilities. However, the existing literature does not comprehensively evaluate attacks and defenses against LLM-based agents. To address this, we introduce Agent Security Bench (ASB), a comprehensive framework designed to formalize, benchmark, and evaluate the attacks and defenses of LLM-based agents, including 10 scenarios (e.g., e-commerce, autonomous driving, finance), 10 agents targeting the scenarios, over 400 tools, 27 different types of attack/defense methods, and 7 evaluation metrics. Based on ASB, we benchmark 10 prompt injection attacks, a memory poisoning attack, a novel Plan-of-Thought backdoor attack, 4 mixed attacks, and 11 corresponding defenses across 13 LLM backbones. Our benchmark results reveal critical vulnerabilities in different stages of agent operation, including system prompt, user prompt handling, tool usage, and memory retrieval, with the highest average attack success rate of 84.30\%, but limited effectiveness shown in current defenses, unveiling important works to be done in terms of agent security for the community. We also introduce a new metric to evaluate the agents' capability to balance utility and security. Our code can be found at https://github.com/agiresearch/ASB.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Asymmetric retrieval is a typical scenario in real-world retrieval systems, where compatible models of varying capacities are deployed on platforms with different resource configurations. Existing methods generally train pre-defined networks or subnetworks with capacities specifically designed for pre-determined platforms, using compatible learning. Nevertheless, these methods suffer from limited flexibility for multi-platform deployment. For example, when introducing a new platform into the retrieval systems, developers have to train an additional model at an appropriate capacity that is compatible with existing models via backward-compatible learning. In this paper, we propose a Prunable Network with self-compatibility, which allows developers to generate compatible subnetworks at any desired capacity through post-training pruning. Thus it allows the creation of a sparse subnetwork matching the resources of the new platform without additional training. Specifically, we optimize both the architecture and weight of subnetworks at different capacities within a dense network in compatible learning. We also design a conflict-aware gradient integration scheme to handle the gradient conflicts between the dense network and subnetworks during compatible learning. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks and visual backbones demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/Bunny-Black/PrunNet.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper investigates deploying semantic edge inference systems for performing a common image clarification task. In particular, each system consists of multiple Internet of Things (IoT) devices that first locally encode the sensing data into semantic features and then transmit them to an edge server for subsequent data fusion and task inference. The inference accuracy is determined by efficient training of the feature encoder/decoder using labeled data samples. Due to the difference in sensing data and communication channel distributions, deploying the system in a new environment may induce high costs in annotating data labels and re-training the encoder/decoder models. To achieve cost-effective transferable system deployment, we propose an efficient Domain Adaptation method for Semantic Edge INference systems (DASEIN) that can maintain high inference accuracy in a new environment without the need for labeled samples. Specifically, DASEIN exploits the task-relevant data correlation between different deployment scenarios by leveraging the techniques of unsupervised domain adaptation and knowledge distillation. It devises an efficient two-step adaptation procedure that sequentially aligns the data distributions and adapts to the channel variations. Numerical results show that, under a substantial change in sensing data distributions, the proposed DASEIN outperforms the best-performing benchmark method by 7.09% and 21.33% in inference accuracy when the new environment has similar or 25 dB lower channel signal to noise power ratios (SNRs), respectively. This verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method in adapting both data and channel distributions in practical transfer deployment applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The recent proliferation of blockchain-based decentralized applications (DApp) has catalyzed transformative advancements in distributed systems, with extensive deployments observed across financial, entertainment, media, and cybersecurity domains. These trustless architectures, characterized by their decentralized nature and elimination of third-party intermediaries, have garnered substantial institutional attention. Consequently, the escalating security challenges confronting DApp demand rigorous scholarly investigation. This study initiates with a systematic analysis of behavioral patterns derived from empirical DApp datasets, establishing foundational insights for subsequent methodological developments. The principal security vulnerabilities in Ethereum-based smart contracts developed via Solidity are then critically examined. Specifically, reentrancy vulnerability attacks are addressed by formally representing contract logic using highly expressive code fragments. This enables precise source code-level detection via bidirectional long short-term memory networks with attention mechanisms (BLSTM-ATT). Regarding privacy preservation challenges, contemporary solutions are evaluated through dual analytical lenses: identity privacy preservation and transaction anonymity enhancement, while proposing future research trajectories in cryptographic obfuscation techniques.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable image synthesis capabilities, but their indiscriminate training on Internet-scale data has led to learned concepts that enable harmful, copyrighted, or otherwise undesirable content generation. We address the task of concept erasure in diffusion models, i.e., removing a specified concept from a pre-trained model such that prompting the concept (or related synonyms) no longer yields its depiction, while preserving the model's ability to generate other content. We propose a novel method, Attentional Concept Erasure (ACE), that integrates a closed-form attention manipulation with lightweight fine-tuning. Theoretically, we formulate concept erasure as aligning the model's conditional distribution on the target concept with a neutral distribution. Our approach identifies and nullifies concept-specific latent directions in the cross-attention modules via a gated low-rank adaptation, followed by adversarially augmented fine-tuning to ensure thorough erasure of the concept and its synonyms. Empirically, we demonstrate on multiple benchmarks, including object classes, celebrity faces, explicit content, and artistic styles, that ACE achieves state-of-the-art concept removal efficacy and robustness. Compared to prior methods, ACE better balances generality (erasing concept and related terms) and specificity (preserving unrelated content), scales to dozens of concepts, and is efficient, requiring only a few seconds of adaptation per concept. We will release our code to facilitate safer deployment of diffusion models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To what extent do LLMs use their capabilities towards their given goal? We take this as a measure of their goal-directedness. We evaluate goal-directedness on tasks that require information gathering, cognitive effort, and plan execution, where we use subtasks to infer each model's relevant capabilities. Our evaluations of LLMs from Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and Anthropic show that goal-directedness is relatively consistent across tasks, differs from task performance, and is only moderately sensitive to motivational prompts. Notably, most models are not fully goal-directed. We hope our goal-directedness evaluations will enable better monitoring of LLM progress, and enable more deliberate design choices of agentic properties in LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) aim to engage users in dialogue to provide tailored recommendations. While traditional CRSs focus on eliciting preferences and retrieving items, real-world e-commerce interactions involve more complex decision-making, where users consider multiple factors beyond simple attributes. To bridge this gap, we introduce Conversational Sales (CSales), a novel task that unifies preference elicitation, recommendation, and persuasion to better support user decision-making. For a realistic evaluation of CSales, we present CSUser, an LLM-based user simulator constructed from real-world data, modeling diverse user profiles with needs and personalities. Additionally, we propose CSI, a conversational sales agent that proactively infers contextual profiles through dialogue for personalized action planning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CSUser effectively replicates real-world users and emphasize the importance of contextual profiling for strategic action selection, ultimately driving successful purchases in e-commerce.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline automates software development to speed up and enhance the efficiency of engineering software. These workflows consist of various jobs, such as code validation and testing, which developers must wait to complete before receiving feedback. The jobs can fail, which leads to unnecessary delays in build times, decreasing productivity for developers, and increasing costs for companies. To explore how companies adopt CI/CD workflows and balance cost with quality assurance during optimization, we studied 4 companies, reporting industry experiences with CI/CD practices. Our findings reveal that organizations can confuse the distinction between CI and CD, whereas code merge and product release serve as more effective milestones for process optimization and risk control. While numerous tools and research efforts target the post-merge phase to enhance productivity, limited attention has been given to the pre-merge phase, where early failure prevention brings more impacts and less risks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Emotional support conversation (ESC) aims to alleviate the emotional distress of individuals through effective conversations. Although large language models (LLMs) have obtained remarkable progress on ESC, most of these studies might not define the diagram from the state model perspective, therefore providing a suboptimal solution for long-term satisfaction. To address such an issue, we leverage the Finite State Machine (FSM) on LLMs, and propose a framework called FiSMiness. Our framework allows a single LLM to bootstrap the planning during ESC, and self-reason the seeker's emotion, support strategy and the final response upon each conversational turn. Substantial experiments on ESC datasets suggest that FiSMiness outperforms many baselines, including direct inference, self-refine, chain of thought, finetuning, and external-assisted methods, even those with many more parameters.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Previous work indicates that large language models exhibit a significant "English bias", i.e. they often perform better when tasks are presented in English. Interestingly, we have observed that using certain other languages in reasoning tasks can yield better performance than English. However, this phenomenon remains under-explored. In this paper, we explore the upper bound of harnessing multilingualism in reasoning tasks, suggesting that multilingual reasoning promises significantly (by nearly 10 Acc@$k$ points) and robustly (tolerance for variations in translation quality and language choice) higher upper bounds than English-only reasoning. Besides analyzing the reason behind the upper bound and challenges in reaching it, we also find that common answer selection methods cannot achieve this upper bound, due to their limitations and biases. These insights could pave the way for future research aimed at fully harnessing the potential of multilingual reasoning in LLMs.

However, evaluation practices for generative abilities of mLLMs are still lacking comprehensiveness, scientific rigor, and consistent adoption across research labs, which undermines their potential to meaningfully guide mLLM development. We draw parallels with machine translation (MT) evaluation, a field that faced similar challenges and has, over decades, developed transparent reporting standards and reliable evaluations for multilingual generative models. Through targeted experiments across key stages of the generative evaluation pipeline, we demonstrate how best practices from MT evaluation can deepen the understanding of quality differences between models. Additionally, we identify essential components for robust meta-evaluation of mLLMs, ensuring the evaluation methods themselves are rigorously assessed. We distill these insights into a checklist of actionable recommendations for mLLM research and development.

An NL outline for a code function comprises multiple statements written in concise prose, which partition the code and summarize its main ideas in the style of literate programming. Crucially, we find that modern LLMs can generate accurate and high-quality NL outlines in practice. Moreover, NL outlines enable a bidirectional sync between code and NL: a developer can change one and the LLM automatically updates the other. We discuss many use cases for NL outlines: they can accelerate understanding and navigation of code and diffs, simplify code maintenance, augment code search, steer code generation, and more. We then propose and compare multiple LLM prompting techniques for generating outlines and ask professional developers to judge outline quality. Finally, we present two case studies applying NL outlines toward code review and malware detection.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The recent DeepSeek-R1 has showcased the emergence of reasoning capabilities in LLMs through reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards. Despite its success in language models, its application in multi-modal domains, particularly in graphic user interface (GUI) agent tasks, remains under-explored. To address this issue, we propose UI-R1, the first framework to explore how rule-based RL can enhance the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for GUI action prediction tasks. Specifically, UI-R1 introduces a novel rule-based action reward, enabling model optimization via policy-based algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). For efficient training, we curate a small yet high-quality dataset of 136 challenging tasks, encompassing five common action types on mobile devices. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed UI-R1-3B achieves significant improvements over the base model (i.e. Qwen2.5-VL-3B) on both in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) tasks, with average accuracy gains of 22.1% on ScreenSpot, 6.0% on ScreenSpot-Pro, and 12.7% on ANDROIDCONTROL. Furthermore, UI-R1-3B delivers competitive performance compared to larger models (e.g., OS-Atlas-7B) trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on 76K samples. These results underscore the potential of rule-based reinforcement learning to advance GUI understanding and control, paving the way for future research in this domain.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LLM inference is essential for applications like text summarization, translation, and data analysis, but the high cost of GPU instances from Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) like AWS is a major burden. This paper proposes InferSave, a cost-efficient VM selection framework for cloud based LLM inference. InferSave optimizes KV cache offloading based on Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and workload charac teristics, estimating GPU memory needs, and recommending cost-effective VM instances. Additionally, the Compute Time Calibration Function (CTCF) improves instance selection accuracy by adjusting for discrepancies between theoretical and actual GPU performance. Experiments on AWS GPU instances show that selecting lower-cost instances without KV cache offloading improves cost efficiency by up to 73.7% for online workloads, while KV cache offloading saves up to 20.19% for offline workloads.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Simultaneous speech translation (SimulST) produces translations incrementally while processing partial speech input. Although large language models (LLMs) have showcased strong capabilities in offline translation tasks, applying them to SimulST poses notable challenges. Existing LLM-based SimulST approaches either incur significant computational overhead due to repeated encoding of bidirectional speech encoder, or they depend on a fixed read/write policy, limiting the efficiency and performance. In this work, we introduce Efficient and Adaptive Simultaneous Speech Translation (EASiST) with fully unidirectional architecture, including both speech encoder and LLM. EASiST includes a multi-latency data curation strategy to generate semantically aligned SimulST training samples and redefines SimulST as an interleaved generation task with explicit read/write tokens. To facilitate adaptive inference, we incorporate a lightweight policy head that dynamically predicts read/write actions. Additionally, we employ a multi-stage training strategy to align speech-text modalities and optimize both translation and policy behavior. Experiments on the MuST-C En$\rightarrow$De and En$\rightarrow$Es datasets demonstrate that EASiST offers superior latency-quality trade-offs compared to several strong baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong potential as agents for tool invocation due to their advanced comprehension and planning capabilities. Users increasingly rely on LLM-based agents to solve complex missions through iterative interactions. However, existing benchmarks predominantly access agents in single-mission scenarios, failing to capture real-world complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose the Multi-Mission Tool Bench. In the benchmark, each test case comprises multiple interrelated missions. This design requires agents to dynamically adapt to evolving demands. Moreover, the proposed benchmark explores all possible mission-switching patterns within a fixed mission number. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent data generation framework to construct the benchmark. We also propose a novel method to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of agent decisions with dynamic decision trees. Experiments on diverse open-source and closed-source LLMs reveal critical factors influencing agent robustness and provide actionable insights to the tool invocation society.

To address these, we introduce Selective Attention Federated Learning (SAFL), a novel approach that dynamically fine-tunes only those transformer layers identified as attention-critical. By employing attention patterns to determine layer importance, SAFL significantly reduces communication bandwidth and enhances differential privacy resilience. Evaluations on clinical NLP benchmarks (i2b2 Clinical Concept Extraction and MIMIC-III discharge summaries) demonstrate that SAFL achieves competitive performance with centralized models while substantially improving communication efficiency and privacy preservation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The ability to predict drug overdose risk from a patient's medical records is crucial for timely intervention and prevention. Traditional machine learning models have shown promise in analyzing longitudinal medical records for this task. However, recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer an opportunity to enhance prediction performance by leveraging their ability to process long textual data and their inherent prior knowledge across diverse tasks. In this study, we assess the effectiveness of Open AI's GPT-4o LLM in predicting drug overdose events using patients' longitudinal insurance claims records. We evaluate its performance in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings, comparing them to strong traditional machine learning methods as baselines. Our results show that LLMs not only outperform traditional models in certain settings but can also predict overdose risk in a zero-shot setting without task-specific training. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs in clinical decision support, particularly for drug overdose risk prediction.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Among ML operators today, GEneralMatrix Multiplication (GEMM)-based operators are known to be key operators that build the main backbone of ML models. As their computational overhead dominates the overall execution time (e.g., 42.8% - 96.6% in our results), GEMM operators have been the prime optimization targets for fast ML inference. This led to advanced GPUs and accelerators available today, which provided significant boost in the GEMM performance compared to CPUs, aligned with the lesson from Amdahl's law. However, accelerating GEMM has significantly shifted the Amdahl's law's landscape for ML inference; due to the decreased GEMM execution time, the relative execution time of non-GEMM operators is now significant. Although the importance of non-GEMM performance is increasing, we have little knowledge about the non-GEMM performance horizon in the latest hardware platforms and models. Therefore, to guide non-GEMM-oriented optimizations, we conduct a thorough performance analysis of 17 widely adopted ML models in Hugging Face and Torchvision on workstation and data center platforms with/without GPUs. We discover that non-GEMM performance bottleneck is a considerable issue across all the platforms and models, accounting for 11.3% to 73.6% of total latency, on average. The challenge significantly aggravates when we apply quantization, which is a common model compression technique, due to the boosted GEMM performance and extra non-GEMM operators for dequantization and requantization. To provide insights into non-GEMM optimization targets, we demystify the most dominant non-GEMM operators for each model and deployment software. We also show that widely adopted optimizations such as operator fusion do not completely address the non-GEMM performance bottleneck, where non-GEMM operators still account for 15% to 48% of total latency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Growing evidence suggests that social determinants of health (SDoH), a set of nonmedical factors, affect individuals' risks of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. Nevertheless, the etiological mechanisms underlying such relationships remain largely unclear, mainly due to difficulties in collecting relevant information. This study presents a novel, automated framework that leverages recent advancements of large language model (LLM) and natural language processing techniques to mine SDoH knowledge from extensive literature and integrate it with AD-related biological entities extracted from the general-purpose knowledge graph PrimeKG. Utilizing graph neural networks, we performed link prediction tasks to evaluate the resultant SDoH-augmented knowledge graph. Our framework shows promise for enhancing knowledge discovery in AD and can be generalized to other SDoH-related research areas, offering a new tool for exploring the impact of social determinants on health outcomes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing deployment of large language models (LLMs) in the cybersecurity domain underscores the need for effective model selection and evaluation. However, traditional evaluation methods often overlook specific cybersecurity knowledge gaps that contribute to performance limitations. To address this, we develop CSEBenchmark, a fine-grained cybersecurity evaluation framework based on 345 knowledge points expected of cybersecurity experts. Drawing from cognitive science, these points are categorized into factual, conceptual, and procedural types, enabling the design of 11,050 tailored multiple-choice questions. We evaluate 12 popular LLMs on CSEBenchmark and find that even the best-performing model achieves only 85.42% overall accuracy, with particular knowledge gaps in the use of specialized tools and uncommon commands. Different LLMs have unique knowledge gaps. Even large models from the same family may perform poorly on knowledge points where smaller models excel. By identifying and addressing specific knowledge gaps in each LLM, we achieve up to an 84% improvement in correcting previously incorrect predictions across three existing benchmarks for two cybersecurity tasks. Furthermore, our assessment of each LLM's knowledge alignment with specific cybersecurity roles reveals that different models align better with different roles, such as GPT-4o for the Google Senior Intelligence Analyst and Deepseek-V3 for the Amazon Privacy Engineer. These findings underscore the importance of aligning LLM selection with the specific knowledge requirements of different cybersecurity roles for optimal performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Unsupervised anomaly detection in hyperspectral images (HSI), aiming to detect unknown targets from backgrounds, is challenging for earth surface monitoring. However, current studies are hindered by steep computational costs due to the high-dimensional property of HSI and dense sampling-based training paradigm, constraining their rapid deployment. Our key observation is that, during training, not all samples within the same homogeneous area are indispensable, whereas ingenious sampling can provide a powerful substitute for reducing costs. Motivated by this, we propose an Asymmetrical Consensus State Space Model (ACMamba) to significantly reduce computational costs without compromising accuracy. Specifically, we design an asymmetrical anomaly detection paradigm that utilizes region-level instances as an efficient alternative to dense pixel-level samples. In this paradigm, a low-cost Mamba-based module is introduced to discover global contextual attributes of regions that are essential for HSI reconstruction. Additionally, we develop a consensus learning strategy from the optimization perspective to simultaneously facilitate background reconstruction and anomaly compression, further alleviating the negative impact of anomaly reconstruction. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments across eight benchmarks verify the superiority of ACMamba, demonstrating a faster speed and stronger performance over the state-of-the-art.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Medical Visual Question Answering (MVQA) systems can interpret medical images in response to natural language queries. However, linguistic variability in question phrasing often undermines the consistency of these systems. To address this challenge, we propose a Semantically Equivalent Question Augmentation (SEQA) framework, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate diverse yet semantically equivalent rephrasings of questions. Specifically, this approach enriches linguistic diversity while preserving semantic meaning. We further introduce an evaluation metric, Total Agreement Rate with Semantically Equivalent Input and Correct Answer (TAR-SC), which assesses a model's capability to generate consistent and correct responses to semantically equivalent linguistic variations. In addition, we also propose three other diversity metrics - average number of QA items per image (ANQI), average number of questions per image with the same answer (ANQA), and average number of open-ended questions per image with the same semantics (ANQS). Using the SEQA framework, we augmented the benchmarked MVQA public datasets of SLAKE, VQA-RAD, and PathVQA. As a result, all three datasets achieved significant improvements by incorporating more semantically equivalent questions: ANQI increased by an average of 86.1, ANQA by 85.1, and ANQS by 46. Subsequent experiments evaluate three MVQA models (M2I2, MUMC, and BiomedGPT) under both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings on the enhanced datasets. Experimental results in MVQA datasets show that fine-tuned models achieve an average accuracy improvement of 19.35%, while our proposed TAR-SC metric shows an average improvement of 11. 61%, indicating a substantial enhancement in model consistency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Predicting phenotypes with complex genetic bases based on a small, interpretable set of variant features remains a challenging task. Conventionally, data-driven approaches are utilized for this task, yet the high dimensional nature of genotype data makes the analysis and prediction difficult. Motivated by the extensive knowledge encoded in pre-trained LLMs and their success in processing complex biomedical concepts, we set to examine the ability of LLMs in feature selection and engineering for tabular genotype data, with a novel knowledge-driven framework. We develop FREEFORM, Free-flow Reasoning and Ensembling for Enhanced Feature Output and Robust Modeling, designed with chain-of-thought and ensembling principles, to select and engineer features with the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs. Evaluated on two distinct genotype-phenotype datasets, genetic ancestry and hereditary hearing loss, we find this framework outperforms several data-driven methods, particularly on low-shot regimes. FREEFORM is available as open-source framework at GitHub: https://github.com/PennShenLab/FREEFORM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances the reasoning of large language models (LLMs) by decomposing problems into sequential steps, mimicking human logic and reducing errors. However, complex tasks with vast solution spaces and vague constraints often exceed the capacity of a single reasoning chain. Inspired by Minimal Free Resolution (MFR) in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, we propose Syzygy of Thoughts (SoT)-a novel framework that extends CoT by introducing auxiliary, interrelated reasoning paths. SoT captures deeper logical dependencies, enabling more robust and structured problem-solving. MFR decomposes a module into a sequence of free modules with minimal rank, providing a structured analytical approach to complex systems. This method introduces the concepts of "Module", "Betti numbers","Freeness", "Mapping", "Exactness" and "Minimality", enabling the systematic decomposition of the original complex problem into logically complete minimal subproblems while preserving key problem features and reducing reasoning length. We tested SoT across diverse datasets (e.g., GSM8K, MATH) and models (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Qwen2.5), achieving inference accuracy that matches or surpasses mainstream CoTs standards. Additionally, by aligning the sampling process with algebraic constraints, our approach enhances the scalability of inference time in LLMs, ensuring both transparent reasoning and high performance. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/dlMARiA/Syzygy-of-thoughts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent large language models (LLMs) face increasing inference latency as input context length and model size continue to grow. In particular, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique, which enhances LLM responses by incorporating external knowledge, exacerbates this issue by significantly increasing the number of input tokens. This expansion in token length leads to a substantial rise in computational overhead, particularly during the prefill stage, resulting in prolonged time-to-first-token (TTFT). To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to reduce TTFT by leveraging a disk-based key-value (KV) cache to lessen the computational burden during the prefill stage. We also introduce a disk-based shared KV cache management system, called Shared RAG-DCache, for multi-instance LLM RAG service environments. This system, together with an optimal system configuration, improves both throughput and latency under given resource constraints. Shared RAG-DCache exploits the locality of documents related to user queries in RAG, as well as the queueing delay in LLM inference services. It proactively generates and stores disk KV caches for query-related documents and shares them across multiple LLM instances to enhance inference performance. In experiments on a single host equipped with 2 GPUs and 1 CPU, Shared RAG-DCache achieved a 15~71% increase in throughput and up to a 12~65% reduction in latency, depending on the resource configuration.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As enthusiasm for scaling computation (data and parameters) in the pretraining era gradually diminished, test-time scaling (TTS), also referred to as ``test-time computing'' has emerged as a prominent research focus. Recent studies demonstrate that TTS can further elicit the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling significant breakthroughs not only in specialized reasoning tasks, such as mathematics and coding, but also in general tasks like open-ended Q&A. However, despite the explosion of recent efforts in this area, there remains an urgent need for a comprehensive survey offering a systemic understanding. To fill this gap, we propose a unified, multidimensional framework structured along four core dimensions of TTS research: what to scale, how to scale, where to scale, and how well to scale. Building upon this taxonomy, we conduct an extensive review of methods, application scenarios, and assessment aspects, and present an organized decomposition that highlights the unique functional roles of individual techniques within the broader TTS landscape. From this analysis, we distill the major developmental trajectories of TTS to date and offer hands-on guidelines for practical deployment. Furthermore, we identify several open challenges and offer insights into promising future directions, including further scaling, clarifying the functional essence of techniques, generalizing to more tasks, and more attributions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce RoboMorph, an automated approach for generating and optimizing modular robot designs using large language models (LLMs) and evolutionary algorithms. In this framework, we represent each robot design as a grammar and leverage the capabilities of LLMs to navigate the extensive robot design space, which is traditionally time-consuming and computationally demanding. By introducing a best-shot prompting technique and a reinforcement learning-based control algorithm, RoboMorph iteratively improves robot designs through feedback loops. Experimental results demonstrate that RoboMorph successfully generates nontrivial robots optimized for different terrains while showcasing improvements in robot morphology over successive evolutions. Our approach highlights the potential of using LLMs for data-driven, modular robot design, providing a promising methodology that can be extended to other domains with similar design frameworks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work quantifies the risk of training data leakage from LLMs (Large Language Models) using sequence-level probabilities. Computing extraction probabilities for individual sequences provides finer-grained information than has been studied in prior benchmarking work. We re-analyze the effects of decoding schemes, model sizes, prefix lengths, partial sequence leakages, and token positions to uncover new insights that were not possible in previous works due to their choice of metrics. We perform this study on two pre-trained models, Llama and OPT, trained on the Common Crawl and The Pile respectively. We discover that 1) Extraction Rate, the predominant metric used in prior quantification work, underestimates the threat of leakage of training data in randomized LLMs by as much as 2.14X. 2) Although on average, larger models and longer prefixes can extract more data, this is not true for a substantial portion of individual sequences. 30.4-41.5% of our sequences are easier to extract with either shorter prefixes or smaller models. 3) Contrary to previous beliefs, partial leakage in commonly used decoding schemes like top-k and top-p is not easier than leaking verbatim training data. The aim of this work is to encourage the adoption of this metric for future work on quantification of training data extraction.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language model (LLM)-based inference workloads increasingly dominate data center costs and resource utilization. Therefore, understanding the inference workload characteristics on evolving CPU-GPU coupled architectures is crucial for optimization. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of LLM inference behavior on loosely-coupled (PCIe A100/H100) and closely-coupled (GH200) systems. We analyze performance dynamics using fine-grained operator-to-kernel trace analysis, facilitated by our novel profiler SKIP and metrics like Total Kernel Launch and Queuing Time (TKLQT). Results show that closely-coupled (CC) GH200 significantly outperforms loosely-coupled (LC) systems at large batch sizes, achieving 1.9x-2.7x faster prefill latency for Llama 3.2-1B. However, our analysis also reveals that GH200 remains CPU-bound up to 4x larger batch sizes than LC systems. In this extended CPU-bound region, we identify the performance characteristics of the Grace CPU as a key factor contributing to higher inference latency at low batch sizes on GH200. We demonstrate that TKLQT accurately identifies this CPU/GPU-bound transition point. Based on this analysis, we further show that kernel fusion offers significant potential to mitigate GH200's low-batch latency bottleneck by reducing kernel launch overhead. This detailed kernel-level characterization provides critical insights for optimizing diverse CPU-GPU coupling strategies. This work is an initial effort, and we plan to explore other major AI/DL workloads that demand different degrees of CPU-GPU heterogeneous architectures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approaches have significantly improved language models' performance on mathematical reasoning tasks, even when models are trained at a small scale. However, the specific capabilities enhanced through such fine-tuning remain poorly understood. In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of model performance on the AIME24 dataset to understand how reasoning capabilities evolve. We discover a ladder-like structure in problem difficulty, categorize questions into four tiers (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Extremely Hard (Exh)), and identify the specific requirements for advancing between tiers. We find that progression from Easy to Medium tier requires adopting an R1 reasoning style with minimal SFT (500-1K instances), while Hard-level questions suffer from frequent model's errors at each step of the reasoning chain, with accuracy plateauing at around 65% despite logarithmic scaling. Exh-level questions present a fundamentally different challenge; they require unconventional problem-solving skills that current models uniformly struggle with. Additional findings reveal that carefully curated small-scale datasets offer limited advantage-scaling dataset size proves far more effective. Our analysis provides a clearer roadmap for advancing language model capabilities in mathematical reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Chaos Engineering (CE) is an engineering technique aimed at improving the resiliency of distributed systems. It involves artificially injecting specific failures into a distributed system and observing its behavior in response. Based on the observation, the system can be proactively improved to handle those failures. Recent CE tools implement the automated execution of predefined CE experiments. However, defining these experiments and improving the system based on the experimental results still remain manual. To reduce the costs of the manual operations, we propose ChaosEater, a system for automating the entire CE operations with Large Language Models (LLMs). It predefines the agentic workflow according to a systematic CE cycle and assigns subdivided operations within the workflow to LLMs. ChaosEater targets CE for Kubernetes systems, which are managed through code (i.e., Infrastructure as Code). Therefore, the LLMs in ChaosEater perform software engineering tasks to complete CE cycles, including requirement definition, code generation, debugging, and testing. We evaluate ChaosEater through case studies on both small and large Kubernetes systems. The results demonstrate that it stably completes reasonable single CE cycles with significantly low time and monetary costs. The CE cycles are also qualitatively validated by human engineers and LLMs.

However, the sensitivity of T2V generative models to input prompts highlights the critical role of prompt design in influencing generative outcomes. Prior research has predominantly relied on Large Language Models (LLMs) to align user-provided prompts with the distribution of training prompts, albeit without tailored guidance encompassing prompt vocabulary and sentence structure nuances. To this end, we introduce \textbf{RAPO}, a novel \textbf{R}etrieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{O}ptimization framework. In order to address potential inaccuracies and ambiguous details generated by LLM-generated prompts. RAPO refines the naive prompts through dual optimization branches, selecting the superior prompt for T2V generation. The first branch augments user prompts with diverse modifiers extracted from a learned relational graph, refining them to align with the format of training prompts via a fine-tuned LLM. Conversely, the second branch rewrites the naive prompt using a pre-trained LLM following a well-defined instruction set. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAPO can effectively enhance both the static and dynamic dimensions of generated videos, demonstrating the significance of prompt optimization for user-provided prompts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Small language models (SLMs) support efficient deployments on resource-constrained edge devices, but their limited capacity compromises inference performance. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising solution to enhance model performance by integrating external databases, without requiring intensive on-device model retraining. However, large-scale public databases and user-specific private contextual documents are typically located on the cloud and the device separately, while existing RAG implementations are primarily centralized. To bridge this gap, we propose DRAGON, a distributed RAG framework to enhance on-device SLMs through both general and personal knowledge without the risk of leaking document privacy. Specifically, DRAGON decomposes multi-document RAG into multiple parallel token generation processes performed independently and locally on the cloud and the device, and employs a newly designed Speculative Aggregation, a dual-side speculative algorithm to avoid frequent output synchronization between the cloud and device. A new scheduling algorithm is further introduced to identify the optimal aggregation side based on real-time network conditions. Evaluations on real-world hardware testbed demonstrate a significant performance improvement of DRAGON-up to 1.9x greater gains over standalone SLM compared to the centralized RAG, substantial reduction in per-token latency, and negligible Time to First Token (TTFT) overhead.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Catastrophic forgetting (CF) poses a significant challenge in machine learning, where a model forgets previously learned information upon learning new tasks. Despite the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they continue to face challenges with CF during continual learning. The majority of existing research focuses on analyzing forgetting patterns through a singular training sequence, thereby overlooking the intricate effects that diverse tasks have on model behavior. Our study explores CF across various settings, discovering that model forgetting is influenced by both the specific training tasks and the models themselves. To this end, we interpret forgetting by examining the function vector (FV), a compact representation of functions in LLMs, offering a model-dependent indicator for the occurrence of CF. Through theoretical and empirical analyses, we demonstrated that CF in LLMs primarily stems from biases in function activation rather than the overwriting of task processing functions. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel function vector guided training methodology, incorporating a regularization technique to stabilize the FV and mitigate forgetting. Empirical tests on four benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our proposed training method, substantiating our theoretical framework concerning CF and model function dynamics. We plan to make our code publicly accessible in the near future.
