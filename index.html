                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has exhibited impressive generation capabilities but faces great challenges due to its high computational complexity. To address this issue, various methods, notably feature caching, have been introduced. However, these approaches focus on aligning non-cache diffusion without analyzing why caching damage the generation processes. In this paper, we first confirm that the cache greatly amplifies the exposure bias, resulting in a decline in the generation quality. However, directly applying noise scaling is challenging for this issue due to the non-smoothness of exposure bias. We found that this phenomenon stems from the mismatch between its frequency response characteristics and the simple cache of Attention and MLP. Since these two components exhibit unique preferences for frequency signals, which provides us with a caching strategy to separate Attention and MLP to achieve an enhanced fit of exposure bias and reduce it. Based on this, we introduced FEB-Cache, a joint caching strategy that aligns with the non-exposed bias diffusion process (which gives us a higher performance cap) of caching Attention and MLP based on the frequency-guided cache table. Our approach combines a comprehensive understanding of the caching mechanism and offers a new perspective on leveraging caching to accelerate the diffusion process. Empirical results indicate that FEB-Cache optimizes model performance while concurrently facilitating acceleration.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While TLS has become the de-facto standard for end-to-end security, its use to secure critical communication in evolving industrial IoT scenarios is severely limited by prevalent resource constraints of devices and networks. Most notably, the TLS handshake to establish secure connections incurs significant bandwidth and processing overhead that often cannot be handled in constrained environments. To alleviate this situation, we present BiTHaC which realizes bidirectional TLS handshake caching by exploiting that significant parts of repeated TLS handshakes, especially certificates, are static. Thus, redundant information neither needs to be transmitted nor corresponding computations performed, saving valuable bandwidth and processing resources. By implementing BiTHaC for wolfSSL, we show that we can reduce the bandwidth consumption of TLS handshakes by up to 61.1% and the computational overhead by up to 8.5%, while incurring only well-manageable memory overhead and preserving the strict security guarantees of TLS.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Llama have shown remarkable capabilities in a variety of software engineering tasks. Despite the advancements, their practical deployment faces challenges, including high financial costs, long response time, and varying performance, especially when handling a large number of queries (jobs). Existing optimization strategies for deploying LLMs for diverse tasks focus on static scheduling, which requires extensive training data for performance prediction, increasing the computational costs and limiting the applicability and flexibility. In this paper, we propose the SmartLLMs Scheduler (SLS), a dynamic and cost-effective scheduling solution. The key idea is to learn LLMs' performance on diverse tasks and incorporate their real-time feedback to update strategies periodically. Specifically, SLS incorporates three key components, including an Adaptive Cache Manager, a Performance-Cost Optimized Scheduler, and a Dynamic Update Manager. The Cache Manager stores the outputs of previously processed queries and employs an adaptive strategy to reduce redundant computations and minimize response times. For queries not found in the cache, the Scheduler dynamically allocates them to the most suitable LLM based on the predicted performance and cost from models that take both query-specific and LLM-specific features as input. The Update Manager continuously refines the cache and scheduling strategies based on real-time feedback from the assigned queries to enhance decision-making and adapt to evolving task characteristics. To evaluate the effectiveness of SLS, we conduct extensive experiments on two LLM-based software engineering tasks, including log parsing and code generation. The results show that SLS significantly outperforms the baseline methods, achieving an average performance improvement of 198.82% and an average processing time reduction of 63.28%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, their low inference speed limits their deployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches exploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past representations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer instead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion. However, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g., attention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate features, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it adopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of predictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when prediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to better leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor prediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly reducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong sequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error between the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an indicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor prediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation, thereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our method achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x acceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible quality drop.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As AI workloads drive increasing memory requirements, domain-specific accelerators need higher-density on-chip memory beyond what current SRAM scaling trends can provide. Simultaneously, the vast amounts of short-lived data in these workloads make SRAM overprovisioned in retention capability. To address this mismatch, we propose a wholesale shift from uniform SRAM arrays to heterogeneous on-chip memory, incorporating denser short-term RAM (StRAM) devices whose limited retention times align with transient data lifetimes. To facilitate this shift, we introduce GainSight, the first comprehensive, open-source framework that aligns dynamic, fine-grained workload lifetime profiles with memory device characteristics to enable generation of optimal StRAM memory compositions. GainSight combines retargetable profiling backends with an architecture-agnostic analytical frontend. The various backends capture cycle-accurate data lifetimes, while the frontend correlates workload patterns with StRAM retention properties to generate optimal memory compositions and project performance. GainSight elevates data lifetime to a first-class design consideration for next-generation AI accelerators, enabling systematic exploitation of data transience for improved on-chip memory density and efficiency. Applying GainSight to MLPerf Inference and PolyBench workloads reveals that 64.3% of first-level GPU cache accesses and 79.01% of systolic array scratchpad accesses exhibit sub-microsecond lifetimes suitable for high-density StRAM, with optimal heterogeneous on-chip memory compositions achieving up to 3x active energy and 4x area reductions compared to uniform SRAM hierarchies. To facilitate adoption and further research, GainSight is open-sourced at https://gainsight.stanford.edu/.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) enable breakthroughs in reasoning and parallel decoding but suffer from prohibitive quadratic computational complexity and memory overhead during inference. Current caching techniques accelerate decoding by storing full-layer states, yet impose substantial memory usage that limit long-context applications. Our analysis of attention patterns in dLLMs reveals persistent cross-layer sparsity, with pivotal tokens remaining salient across decoding steps and low-relevance tokens staying unimportant, motivating selective cache eviction. We propose Sparse-dLLM, the first training-free framework integrating dynamic cache eviction with sparse attention via delayed bidirectional sparse caching. By leveraging the stability of token saliency over steps, it retains critical tokens and dynamically evicts unimportant prefix/suffix entries using an attention-guided strategy. Extensive experiments on LLaDA and Dream series demonstrate Sparse-dLLM achieves up to 10$\times$ higher throughput than vanilla dLLMs, with comparable performance and similar peak memory costs, outperforming previous methods in efficiency and effectiveness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly boosted long-context processing. However, the increasing key-value (KV) cache size poses critical challenges to memory and execution efficiency. Most KV cache compression methods rely on heuristic token eviction using all attention heads in Grouped Query Attention (GQA)-based LLMs. This method ignores the different functionalities of attention heads, leading to the eviction of critical tokens and thus degrades the performance of LLMs.   To address the issue above, instead of using all the attention heads in GQA-based LLMs to determine important tokens as in the previous work, we first identify the attention heads in each layer that are not only capable of retrieving the initial and final tokens of a prompt, but also capable of retrieving important tokens within the text and attending to their surrounding semantic context. Afterwards, we exploit such heads to determine the important tokens and retain their corresponding KV cache pairs. Furthermore, we analyze the cache eviction error of each layer individually and introduce a layer-adaptive KV cache allocation strategy. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed CompressKV consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches under various memory budgets on LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present OnPair, a dictionary-based compression algorithm designed to meet the needs of in-memory database systems that require both high compression and fast random access. Existing methods either achieve strong compression ratios at significant computational and memory cost (e.g., BPE) or prioritize speed at the expense of compression quality (e.g., FSST). OnPair bridges this gap by employing a cache-friendly dictionary construction technique that incrementally merges frequent adjacent substrings in a single sequential pass over a data sample. This enables fast, memory-efficient training without tracking global pair positions, as required by traditional BPE. We also introduce OnPair16, a variant that limits dictionary entries to 16 bytes, enabling faster parsing via optimized longest prefix matching. Both variants compress strings independently, supporting fine-grained random access without block-level overhead. Experiments on real-world datasets show that OnPair and OnPair16 achieve compression ratios comparable to BPE while significantly improving compression speed and memory usage.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) enable long-context tasks but face efficiency challenges due to the growing key-value (KV) cache. We propose LeanK, a learning-based method that prunes unimportant key (K) cache channels by leveraging static channel sparsity. With a novel two-stage training process, LeanK learns channel-wise static mask that could satisfy specific sparsity ratio and hardware alignment requirement. LeanK reduces GPU memory and accelerates decoding without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments demonstrate up to 70% K cache and 16%-18% V cache memory reduction.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) require substantial computational resources during generation. While the Key-Value (KV) cache significantly accelerates this process by storing attention intermediates, its memory footprint grows linearly with sequence length, batch size, and model size, creating a bottleneck in long-context scenarios. Various KV cache compression techniques, including token eviction, quantization, and low-rank projection, have been proposed to mitigate this bottleneck, often complementing each other. This paper focuses on enhancing token eviction strategies. Token eviction leverages the observation that the attention patterns are often sparse, allowing for the removal of less critical KV entries to save memory. However, this reduction usually comes at the cost of notable accuracy degradation, particularly under high compression ratios. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{CaliDrop}, a novel strategy that enhances token eviction through calibration. Our preliminary experiments show that queries at nearby positions exhibit high similarity. Building on this observation, CaliDrop performs speculative calibration on the discarded tokens to mitigate the accuracy loss caused by token eviction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CaliDrop significantly improves the accuracy of existing token eviction methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Skiplists are widely used for in-memory indexing in many key-value stores, such as RocksDB and LevelDB, due to their ease of implementation and simple concurrency control mechanisms. However, traditional skiplists suffer from poor cache locality, as they store only a single element per node, leaving performance on the table. Minimizing last-level cache misses is key to maximizing in-memory index performance, making high cache locality essential. In this paper, we present a practical concurrent B-skiplist that enhances cache locality and performance while preserving the simplicity of traditional skiplist structures and concurrency control schemes. Our key contributions include a top-down, single-pass insertion algorithm for B-skiplists and a corresponding simple and efficient top-down concurrency control scheme. On 128 threads, the proposed concurrent B-skiplist achieves between 2x-9x higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art concurrent skiplist implementations, including Facebook's concurrent skiplist from Folly and the Java ConcurrentSkipListMap. Furthermore, we find that the B-skiplist achieves competitive (0.9x-1.7x) throughput on point workloads compared to state-of-the-art cache-optimized tree-based indices (e.g., Masstree). For a more complete picture of the performance, we also measure the latency of skiplist and tree-based indices and find that the B-skiplist achieves between 3.5x-103x lower 99% latency compared to other concurrent skiplists and between 0.85x-64x lower 99% latency compared to tree-based indices on point workloads with inserts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rising demand for high-rate and timely communications, fog radio access networks (F-RANs) offer a promising solution. This work investigates age of information (AoI) performance in F-RANs, consisting of multiple content users (CUs), enhanced remote radio heads (eRRHs), and content providers (CPs). Time-critical CUs need rapid content updates from CPs but cannot communicate directly with them; instead, eRRHs act as intermediaries. CUs decide whether to request content from a CP and which eRRH to send the request to, while eRRHs decide whether to command CPs to update content or use cached content. We study two general classes of policies: (i) oblivious policies, where decision-making is independent of historical information, and (ii) non-oblivious policies, where decisions are influenced by historical information. First, we obtain closed-form expressions for the average AoI of eRRHs under both policy types. Due to the complexity of calculating closed-form expressions for CUs, we then derive general upper bounds for their average AoI. Next, we identify optimal policies for both types. Under both optimal policies, each CU requests content from each CP at an equal rate, consolidating all requests to a single eRRH when demand is low or resources are limited, and distributing requests evenly among eRRHs when demand is high and resources are ample. eRRHs command content from each CP at an equal rate under an optimal oblivious policy, while prioritize the CP with the highest age under an optimal non-oblivious policy. Our numerical results validate these theoretical findings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid expansion of context window sizes in Large Language Models~(LLMs) has enabled them to tackle increasingly complex tasks involving lengthy documents. However, this progress comes at the cost of a substantial increase in memory usage during inference, primarily due to the linear growth of the key-value~(KV) cache. Existing KV cache compression methods often discard less relevant tokens, which can lead to significant performance degradation when critical information is lost. In this paper, we propose \textsc{PoD}~(Proximal tokens over Distant tokens), a novel KV cache compression framework that allocates memory according to token importance, retaining less important tokens in a more compact, shared form rather than discarding them entirely. Our approach is motivated by two key observations: (1) proximal tokens -- those at the beginning and end of the context -- are significantly more important for next-token prediction, and (2) attention scores for distant tokens are highly redundant across consecutive layers. Leveraging these insights, \textsc{PoD} preserves the full KV cache for proximal tokens, while for distant tokens, it shares key states across layers. Since attention scores are determined by both queries and keys, sharing key states enables multiple layers to reuse a single set of keys for distant tokens, substantially reducing KV cache memory without discarding essential context. We further introduce a lightweight post-training adaptation to enable the model to adjust to this new attention-sharing structure. Extensive experiments on both synthetic~(Needle in a Haystack) and real-world long-context benchmarks demonstrate that \textsc{PoD} reduces KV cache memory usage by up to 35\% without compromising performance. Our method is orthogonal to existing token-selection-based techniques and can be combined with them for further KV cache compression.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video caching can significantly improve delivery efficiency and enhance quality of video streaming, which constitutes the majority of wireless communication traffic. Due to limited cache size, caching strategies must be designed to adapt to and dynamic user demand in order to maximize system revenue. The system revenue depends on the benefits of delivering the requested videos and costs for (a) transporting the files to the users and (b) cache replacement. Since the cache content at any point in time impacts the replacement costs in the future, demand predictions over multiple cache placement slots become an important prerequisite for efficient cache planning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel two-stage privacy-preserving solution for revenue optimization in wireless video caching networks. First, we train a Transformer using privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) to predict multi-slot future demands. Given that prediction results are never entirely accurate, especially for longer horizons, we further combine global content popularity with per-user prediction results to estimate the content demand distribution. Then, in the second stage, we leverage these estimation results to find caching strategies that maximize the long-term system revenue. This latter problem takes on the form of a multi-stage knapsack problem, which we then transform to a integer linear program. Our extensive simulation results demonstrate that (i) our FL solution delivers nearly identical performance to that of the ideal centralized solution and outperforms other existing caching methods, and (ii) our novel revenue optimization approach provides deeper system performance insights than traditional cache hit ratio (CHR)-based optimization approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However, existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world streaming scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text-to-SQL is a fundamental yet challenging task in the NLP area, aiming at translating natural language questions into SQL queries. While recent advances in large language models have greatly improved performance, most existing approaches depend on models with tens of billions of parameters or costly APIs, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained environments. For real world, especially on edge devices, it is crucial for Text-to-SQL to ensure cost-effectiveness. Therefore, enabling the light-weight models for Text-to-SQL is of great practical significance. However, smaller LLMs often struggle with complicated user instruction, redundant schema linking or syntax correctness. To address these challenges, we propose MCTS-SQL, a novel framework that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to guide SQL generation through multi-step refinement. Since the light-weight models' weak performance of single-shot prediction, we generate better results through several trials with feedback. However, directly applying MCTS-based methods inevitably leads to significant time and computational overhead. Driven by this issue, we propose a token-level prefix-cache mechanism that stores prior information during iterations, effectively improved the execution speed. Experiments results on the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using a small open-source Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B, our method outperforms ChatGPT-3.5. When leveraging a more powerful model Gemini 2.5 to explore the performance upper bound, we achieved results competitive with the SOTA. Our findings demonstrate that even small models can be effectively deployed in practical Text-to-SQL systems with the right strategy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution to alleviate resource constraints faced by LLMs in long-context scenarios. However, existing token-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their irreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns during decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both marginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the collective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal information over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two compensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices between LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted compensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention matching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in perceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller model's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger model. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and LongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV. Moreover, efficiency evaluations show that SmallKV achieves 1.75 - 2.56 times higher throughput than baseline methods, highlighting its potential for efficient and performant LLM inference in resource constrained environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Real-time path tracing is rapidly becoming the standard for rendering in entertainment and professional applications. In scientific visualization, volume rendering plays a crucial role in helping researchers analyze and interpret complex 3D data. Recently, photorealistic rendering techniques have gained popularity in scientific visualization, yet they face significant challenges. One of the most prominent issues is slow rendering performance and high pixel variance caused by Monte Carlo integration. In this work, we introduce a novel radiance caching approach for path-traced volume rendering. Our method leverages advances in volumetric scene representation and adapts 3D Gaussian splatting to function as a multi-level, path-space radiance cache. This cache is designed to be trainable on the fly, dynamically adapting to changes in scene parameters such as lighting configurations and transfer functions. By incorporating our cache, we achieve less noisy, higher-quality images without increasing rendering costs. To evaluate our approach, we compare it against a baseline path tracer that supports uniform sampling and next-event estimation and the state-of-the-art for neural radiance caching. Through both quantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that our path-space radiance cache is a robust solution that is easy to integrate and significantly enhances the rendering quality of volumetric visualization applications while maintaining comparable computational efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we introduce PESTO, a self-supervised learning approach for single-pitch estimation using a Siamese architecture. Our model processes individual frames of a Variable-$Q$ Transform (VQT) and predicts pitch distributions. The neural network is designed to be equivariant to translations, notably thanks to a Toeplitz fully-connected layer. In addition, we construct pitch-shifted pairs by translating and cropping the VQT frames and train our model with a novel class-based transposition-equivariant objective, eliminating the need for annotated data. Thanks to this architecture and training objective, our model achieves remarkable performances while being very lightweight ($130$k parameters). Evaluations on music and speech datasets (MIR-1K, MDB-stem-synth, and PTDB) demonstrate that PESTO not only outperforms self-supervised baselines but also competes with supervised methods, exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Finally, we enhance PESTO's practical utility by developing a streamable VQT implementation using cached convolutions. Combined with our model's low latency (less than 10 ms) and minimal parameter count, this makes PESTO particularly suitable for real-time applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Content-Centric Networking (CCN) offers a novel architectural paradigm that seeks to address the inherent limitations of the prevailing Internet Protocol (IP)-based networking model. In contrast to the host-centric communication approach of IP networks, CCN prioritizes content by enabling direct addressing and routing based on content identifiers. The potential performance improvements of CCN can be further amplified through optimized management of coded data storage and transmission strategies. Decentralized Coded Caching (DCC) emerges as a promising technique that harnesses the collective caching power of distributed network elements. By strategically pre-positioning frequently accessed content closer to potential consumers during periods of low network utilization, DCC has the potential to mitigate content transfer rates during peak traffic periods. This paper proposes a series of fundamental modifications to the CCN architecture by integrating DCC. The proposed framework incorporates differentiated coding strategies tailored to user access privileges, thereby eliminating the overhead associated with queue-based searching. Additionally, the framework facilitates recoding of uncoded data encountered along the content delivery path. These combined methodologies demonstrably enhance network throughput, elevate cache hit ratios, and consequently, reduce content delivery latency compared to conventional CCN implementations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present MoE-MLA-RoPE, a novel architecture combination that combines Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) for efficient language modeling. Our approach addresses the fundamental trade-off between model capacity and computational efficiency through three key innovations: (1) fine-grained expert routing with 64 micro-experts and top-$k$ selection, enabling flexible specialization through 3.6 * 10^7 possible expert combinations; (2) shared expert isolation that dedicates 2 always active experts for common patterns while routing to 6 of 62 specialized experts; and (3) gradient-conflict-free load balancing that maintains expert utilization without interfering with primary loss optimization.   Extensive experiments on models ranging from 17M to 202M parameters demonstrate that MoE-MLA-RoPE with compression ratio r=d/2 achieves 68% KV cache memory reduction and 3.2x inference speedup while maintaining competitive perplexity (0.8% degradation). Compared to the parameters with 53.9M parameters, MoE-MLA-RoPE improves the validation loss by 6.9% over the vanilla transformers while using 42% fewer active parameters per forward pass. FLOP-matched experiments reveal even larger gains: 11.1% improvement with 3.2x inference acceleration. Automated evaluation using GPT-4 as a judge confirms quality improvements in generation, with higher scores on coherence (8.1/10), creativity (7.9/10) and grammatical correctness (8.2/10). Our results establish that architectural novelty, not parameter scaling, defines the efficiency frontier for resource-constrained language model deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models trade latency for quality: small models are fast but generate lower-quality images, while large models produce better images but are slow.   We present MoDM, a novel caching-based serving system for diffusion models that dynamically balances latency and quality through a mixture of diffusion models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on model-specific internal features, MoDM caches final images, allowing seamless retrieval and reuse across multiple diffusion model families.   This design enables adaptive serving by dynamically balancing latency and image quality: using smaller models for cache-hit requests to reduce latency while reserving larger models for cache-miss requests to maintain quality. Small model image quality is preserved using retrieved cached images.   We design a global monitor that optimally allocates GPU resources and balances inference workload, ensuring high throughput while meeting service-level objectives under varying request rates. Our evaluations show that MoDM significantly reduces average serving time by 2.5x while retaining image quality, making it a practical solution for scalable and resource-efficient model deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using unlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test distributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy criterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class compactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution shifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class distributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using high-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype residual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve state-of-the-art generalization performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Online display advertising platforms rely on pre-ranking systems to efficiently filter and prioritize candidate ads from large corpora, balancing relevance to users with strict computational constraints. The prevailing two-tower architecture, though highly efficient due to its decoupled design and pre-caching, suffers from cross-domain interaction and coarse similarity metrics, undermining its capacity to model complex user-ad relationships. In this study, we propose the Hierarchical Interaction-Enhanced Two-Tower (HIT) model, a new architecture that augments the two-tower paradigm with two key components: $\textit{generators}$ that pre-generate holistic vectors incorporating coarse-grained user-ad interactions through a dual-generator framework with a cosine-similarity-based generation loss as the training objective, and $\textit{multi-head representers}$ that project embeddings into multiple latent subspaces to capture fine-grained, multi-faceted user interests and multi-dimensional ad attributes. This design enhances modeling effectiveness without compromising inference efficiency. Extensive experiments on public datasets and large-scale online A/B testing on Tencent's advertising platform demonstrate that HIT significantly outperforms several baselines in relevance metrics, yielding a $1.66\%$ increase in Gross Merchandise Volume and a $1.55\%$ improvement in Return on Investment, alongside similar serving latency to the vanilla two-tower models. The HIT model has been successfully deployed in Tencent's online display advertising system, serving billions of impressions daily.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose and experimentally demonstrate the \emph{Quasi-Superposition Quantum-inspired System (QSQS)} -- a conceptual quantum system for randomness generation built on measuring two conjugate observables of a permutation sorting process: the deterministic permutation count $n_p$ and the fundamentally non-deterministic sorting time $t$. By analogy with quantum systems, these observables are linked by an uncertainty-like constraint: algorithmic determinism ensures structural uniformity, while system-level fluctuations introduce irreducible unpredictability. We realize this framework concretely as \emph{QPP-RNG}, a system-embedded, software-based true random number generator (TRNG). In QPP-RNG, real-time measurements of sorting time $t$ -- shaped by CPU pipeline jitter, cache latency, and OS scheduling -- dynamically reseed the PRNG driving the permutation sequence. Crucially, QSQS transforms initially right-skewed raw distributions of $n_p$ and $t$ into nearly uniform outputs after modulo reduction, thanks to internal degeneracies that collapse many distinct states into the same output symbol. Empirical results show that as the repetition factor $m$ increases, output entropy converges toward theoretical maxima: Shannon and min-entropy values approach 8 bits, chi-squared statistics stabilize near ideal uniformity, and bell curves visually confirm the flattening from skewed to uniform distributions. Beyond practical implications, QSQS unifies deterministic algorithmic processes with non-deterministic physical fluctuations, offering a physics-based perspective for engineering true randomness in post-quantum cryptographic systems.

CUSP will allow to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures of our star. CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed to develop new CubeSat missions. CUSP undergoing the Phase B started in December 2024 that will last for 12 month. The Compton polarimeter of the CUSP payload performs coincidence measurements between plastic scintilaltors and GaGG(Ce) crystals to derive the polarization of X-rays. These sensors are readout by Multi Anode Photomultiplier Tubes (MAPMTs) and Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs) respectively. Both sensors need an HV power supply up to -1~kV (for the MAPMT) and +500~V (for the APD). We tested precision regulated High Voltage DC/DC Converters by HVM Technology Inc. with Sub-Miniature Case Size ($0.85''\times0.85''\times0.60''$) of the SMHV series. These modules are compact and suited for CubeSat missions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The transition toward softwarized Radio Access Networks (RANs), driven by the Open RAN (O-RAN) paradigm, enables flexible, vendor-neutral deployments through disaggregation and virtualization of base station functions. However, this shift introduces new challenges in managing CPU resources efficiently under strict real-time constraints. In particular, the interplay between latency-sensitive RAN workloads and general-purpose Operating System (OS) schedulers often leads to sub-optimal performance and unnecessary energy consumption. This work proposes a lightweight, programmable distributed application (dApp) deployed at the Distributed Unit (DU) level to dynamically orchestrate CPU usage. The dApp operates in closed loop with the OS, leveraging thread-level telemetry like context switches, Instructions Per Cycle (IPC), and cache metrics, to adapt CPU thread affinity, core isolation, and frequency scaling in real time. Unlike existing solutions, it requires no access to proprietary RAN software, hardware-specific features, or kernel modifications. Fully compliant with the O-RAN architecture and agnostic to the underlying RAN stack, the proposed solution introduces negligible overhead while improving energy efficiency and CPU utilization. Experimental results using a commercial-grade srsRAN deployment demonstrate consistent power savings without compromising real-time processing performance, highlighting the potential of low-latency dApps for fine-grained resource control in next-generation networks

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have emerged as a promising technology for realizing wave-domain signal processing, while the fixed SIMs will limit the communication performance of the system compared to the mobile SIMs. In this work, we consider a UAV-mounted SIMs (UAV-SIMs) assisted communication system, where UAVs as base stations (BSs) can cache the data processed by SIMs, and also as mobile vehicles flexibly deploy SIMs to enhance the communication performance. To this end, we formulate a UAV-SIM-based joint optimization problem (USBJOP) to comprehensively consider the association between UAV-SIMs and users, the locations of UAV-SIMs, and the phase shifts of UAV-SIMs, aiming to maximize the network capacity. Due to the non-convexity and NP-hardness of USBJOP, we decompose it into three sub-optimization problems, which are the association between UAV-SIMs and users optimization problem (AUUOP), the UAV location optimization problem (ULOP), and the UAV-SIM phase shifts optimization problem (USPSOP). Then, these three sub-optimization problems are solved by an alternating optimization (AO) strategy. Specifically, AUUOP and ULOP are transformed to a convex form and then solved by the CVX tool, while we employ a layer-by-layer iterative optimization method for USPSOP. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy under different simulation setups.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities, particularly benefiting from Transformer architectures that enhance visual and artistic fidelity. However, their inherently sequential denoising process results in high inference latency, limiting their deployment in real-time scenarios. Existing training-free acceleration approaches typically reuse intermediate features at fixed timesteps or layers, overlooking the evolving semantic focus across denoising stages and Transformer blocks.To address this, we propose Sortblock, a training-free inference acceleration framework that dynamically caches block-wise features based on their similarity across adjacent timesteps. By ranking the evolution of residuals, Sortblock adaptively determines a recomputation ratio, selectively skipping redundant computations while preserving generation quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a lightweight linear prediction mechanism to reduce accumulated errors in skipped blocks.Extensive experiments across various tasks and DiT architectures demonstrate that Sortblock achieves over 2$\times$ inference speedup with minimal degradation in output quality, offering an effective and generalizable solution for accelerating diffusion-based generative models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deploying Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices for long-sequence tasks remains challenging due to the quadratic time complexity of self-attention and growing Key-Value (KV) cache demands. While existing KV cache optimizations improve memory efficiency, they often fail to reduce time to first token (TTFT) and may degrade performance through token pruning. Alternative sequence modeling architectures address some of these limitations, but typically require full retraining and lack infrastructure support. EdgeInfinite offers an efficient solution by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, maintaining quality while reducing both computational and memory costs, including improved TTFT. However, its instruction-following ability is limited, and it lacks mobile-specific optimizations. To address these issues, we propose EdgeInfinite-Instruct, which introduces a Segmented Supervised Fine-Tuning (S-SFT) strategy tailored to long-sequence tasks such as summarization and question answering. We further optimized EdgeInfinite-Instruct for efficient deployment on edge NPUs by employing fine-grained post-training quantization (PTQ) to reduce computational demands while maintaining accuracy, and by implementing a fixed-shape computation graph that balances memory usage and on-device efficiency through scenario-specific customization of input token and cache sizes. Experiments on long-context benchmarks and real-world mobile tasks show that our approach improves domain-specific performance while maintaining efficiency on NPU-accelerated edge devices.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Low-precision matrix engines, such as FP16 cube, offer high throughput but lack support for full-precision computation. In this work, we propose SGEMM-cube, a high-performance algorithm for emulating FP32 general matrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM) using only FP16 computation units on a representative AI accelerator. The method decomposes each FP32 operand into two FP16 values and compensates for numerical errors through a tunable scaling strategy. A detailed analysis of numerical errors, including underflow conditions and precision loss, guides the selection of scaling parameters to preserve up to 22 bits of mantissa accuracy. We further investigate the effect of computation order on accuracy and demonstrate that a term-wise accumulation scheme improves numerical stability over conventional FP32 GEMM in low-exponent regimes. Finally, a cache-aware blocking strategy and double-buffered pipeline are introduced to overlap memory transfers with computation, enabling SGEMM-cube to achieve up to 77\% of the theoretical FP32-equivalent peak performance on Ascend 910A NPU lacking native FP32 support. Extensive numerical experiments confirm that our method not only recovers the accuracy of native FP32 GEMM but also exhibits superior numerical stability under certain conditions, due to its structured and error-aware computation order.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While diffusion and autoregressive (AR) models have significantly advanced generative modeling, they each present distinct limitations. AR models, which rely on causal attention, cannot exploit future context and suffer from slow generation speeds. Conversely, diffusion models struggle with key-value (KV) caching. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dragon-FM, a novel text-to-speech (TTS) design that unifies AR and flow-matching. This model processes 48 kHz audio codec tokens in chunks at a compact rate of 12.5 tokens per second. This design enables AR modeling across chunks, ensuring global coherence, while parallel flow-matching within chunks facilitates fast iterative denoising. Thus, the model leverages KV-cache across chunks and utilizes bidirectional context within each chunk. Furthermore, it bridges continuous and discrete feature modeling, demonstrating that continuous AR flow-matching can predict discrete tokens with finite scalar quantizers. This efficient codec and fast chunk-autoregressive architecture also make the model highly effective for generating long-form content, such as podcasts. Experiments on podcast datasets demonstrate its capability to efficiently generate high-quality zero-shot podcasts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably, OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding; and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The co-location of multiple database instances on resource constrained edge nodes creates significant cache contention, where traditional schemes are inefficient and unstable under dynamic workloads. To address this, we present SAM(a Stability-Aware Manager), an autonomic cache manager that establishes decision stability as a first-class design principle. It achieves this through its core control policy, AURA(Autonomic Utility-balancing Resource Allocator), which resolves the classic exploitation-exploration dilemma by synthesizing two orthogonal factors: the H-factor, representing proven historical efficiency (exploitation), and the V-factor, for estimated marginal gain (exploration). Through this practical synthesis and adaptive control, SAM achieves sustained high performance with strategic stability and robustness in volatile conditions.   Extensive experiments against 14 diverse baselines demonstrate SAM's superiority. It achieves top-tier throughput while being uniquely resilient to complex workload shifts and adversarial workloads like cache pollution. Furthermore, its decision latency is highly scalable, remaining nearly constant as the system grows to 120 databases. Crucially, SAM achieves superior decision stability -- maintaining consistent optimization directions despite noise, avoiding performance oscillations while ensuring predictable Quality of Service. These results prove that a principled, stability-aware design is essential for sustained high performance in real-world, large-scale systems.

However, their tendency to generate lengthy chain-of-thought sequences leads to substantial memory overhead during inference. We observe that LRMs frequently produce highly similar intermediate reasoning steps, which correspond to similar KV cache states across layers. Motivated by this observation, we propose MemShare, a novel KV cache management approach that effectively reduces memory overhead. MemShare employs a collaborative filtering algorithm to efficiently identify reusable KV cache blocks and enables zero copy cache reuse to significantly reduce memory overhead, improve throughput while maintaining accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that MemShare delivers up to 84.79\% improvement in throughput while maintaining better accuracy compared to existing KV cache management methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as promising alternative in 3D representation. However, it still suffers from high training cost. This paper introduces LiteGS, a high performance framework that systematically optimizes the 3DGS training pipeline from multiple aspects. At the low-level computation layer, we design a ``warp-based raster'' associated with two hardware-aware optimizations to significantly reduce gradient reduction overhead. At the mid-level data management layer, we introduce dynamic spatial sorting based on Morton coding to enable a performant ``Cluster-Cull-Compact'' pipeline and improve data locality, therefore reducing cache misses. At the top-level algorithm layer, we establish a new robust densification criterion based on the variance of the opacity gradient, paired with a more stable opacity control mechanism, to achieve more precise parameter growth. Experimental results demonstrate that LiteGS accelerates the original 3DGS training by up to 13.4x with comparable or superior quality and surpasses the current SOTA in lightweight models by up to 1.4x speedup. For high-quality reconstruction tasks, LiteGS sets a new accuracy record and decreases the training time by an order of magnitude.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce a neural network layer API and library for sequence modeling, designed for easy creation of sequence models that can be executed both layer-by-layer (e.g., teacher-forced training) and step-by-step (e.g., autoregressive sampling). To achieve this, layers define an explicit representation of their state over time (e.g., a Transformer KV cache, a convolution buffer, an RNN hidden state), and a step method that evolves that state, tested to give identical results to a stateless layer-wise invocation. This and other aspects of the SequenceLayers contract enables complex models to be immediately streamable, mitigates a wide range of common bugs arising in both streaming and parallel sequence processing, and can be implemented in any deep learning library. A composable and declarative API, along with a comprehensive suite of layers and combinators, streamlines the construction of production-scale models from simple streamable components while preserving strong correctness guarantees. Our current implementations of SequenceLayers (JAX, TensorFlow 2) are available at https://github.com/google/sequence-layers.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 104K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling. In our experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves strong performance on video benchmarks, reaching 65.1% and 71.1% accuracy on VideoMME without and with subtitles, respectively, and consistently outperforming LongVILA-7B across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, LongVILA-R1-7B supports processing up to 8,192 video frames per video, and configurable FPS settings. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Edge Storage Systems have emerged as a critical enabler of low latency data access in modern cloud networks by bringing storage and computation closer to end users. However, the limited storage capacity of edge servers poses significant challenges in handling high volume and latency sensitive data access requests, particularly under dynamic workloads. In this work, we propose a profit driven framework that integrates three key mechanisms which are collaborative caching, erasure coding, and elastic storage partitioning. Unlike traditional replication, erasure coding enables space efficient redundancy, allowing data to be reconstructed from any subset of K out of K plus M coded blocks. We dynamically partition each edge server s storage into private and public regions. The private region is further subdivided among access points based on their incoming request rates, enabling adaptive control over data locality and ownership. We design a data placement and replacement policy that determines how and where to store or evict coded data blocks to maximize data access within deadlines. While the private region serves requests from local APs, the public region handles cooperative storage requests from neighboring servers. Our proposed Dynamic Space Partitioning and Elastic caching strategy is evaluated on both synthetic and real world traces from Netflix and Spotify. Experimental results show that our method improves overall system profitability by approximately 5 to 8% compared to state of the art approaches under varied workload conditions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The efficient computation of color-summed QCD amplitudes at high parton multiplicities remains a central challenge for precision collider predictions. Existing approaches using trace, color-flow, or adjoint bases suffer from non-orthogonality, which complicates the color algebra and scales poorly with multiplicity. In this work, we present an off-shell recursive framework for computing all-gluon tree-level amplitudes directly in orthogonal multiplet bases. Utilizing Wigner $6j$ coefficients, we construct an algorithm that builds multiplet-projected off-shell currents from lower-point currents. By optimizing the recursion through partial summation and caching, we find that the computational complexity of calculating $n$-gluon color-summed squared amplitudes scales as $\mathcal{O}(17^n)$. This demonstrates the potential competitiveness of multiplet bases for high-multiplicity processes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While frontier large language models (LLMs) continue to push capability boundaries, their deployment remains confined to GPU-powered cloud infrastructure. We challenge this paradigm with SmallThinker, a family of LLMs natively designed - not adapted - for the unique constraints of local devices: weak computational power, limited memory, and slow storage. Unlike traditional approaches that mainly compress existing models built for clouds, we architect SmallThinker from the ground up to thrive within these limitations. Our innovation lies in a deployment-aware architecture that transforms constraints into design principles. First, We introduce a two-level sparse structure combining fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse feed-forward networks, drastically reducing computational demands without sacrificing model capacity. Second, to conquer the I/O bottleneck of slow storage, we design a pre-attention router that enables our co-designed inference engine to prefetch expert parameters from storage while computing attention, effectively hiding storage latency that would otherwise cripple on-device inference. Third, for memory efficiency, we utilize NoPE-RoPE hybrid sparse attention mechanism to slash KV cache requirements. We release SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B and SmallThinker-21B-A3B, which achieve state-of-the-art performance scores and even outperform larger LLMs. Remarkably, our co-designed system mostly eliminates the need for expensive GPU hardware: with Q4_0 quantization, both models exceed 20 tokens/s on ordinary consumer CPUs, while consuming only 1GB and 8GB of memory respectively. SmallThinker is publicly available at hf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-4BA0.6B-Instruct and hf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-21BA3B-Instruct.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized a wide range of domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal tasks due to their ability to comprehend context and perform logical reasoning. However, the computational and memory demands of LLMs, particularly during inference, pose significant challenges when scaling them to real-world, long-context, and real-time applications. Key-Value (KV) cache management has emerged as a critical optimization technique for accelerating LLM inference by reducing redundant computations and improving memory utilization. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of KV cache management strategies for LLM acceleration, categorizing them into token-level, model-level, and system-level optimizations. Token-level strategies include KV cache selection, budget allocation, merging, quantization, and low-rank decomposition, while model-level optimizations focus on architectural innovations and attention mechanisms to enhance KV reuse. System-level approaches address memory management, scheduling, and hardware-aware designs to improve efficiency across diverse computing environments. Additionally, the survey provides an overview of both text and multimodal datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate these strategies. By presenting detailed taxonomies and comparative analyses, this work aims to offer useful insights for researchers and practitioners to support the development of efficient and scalable KV cache management techniques, contributing to the practical deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly deployed as local agents on personal devices with CPUs, NPUs and integrated GPUs. However, forecasting inference performance on devices with such heterogeneity remains challenging due to the dynamic compute and memory demands. Existing approaches rely on GPU benchmarking or machine learning-based latency predictors, which are often hardware-specific and lack generalizability. To this end, we introduce LIFE, a lightweight and modular analytical framework that is comprised of modular analytical model of operators, configurable to characterize LLM inference workloads in a hardware and dataset-agnostic manner. LIFE characterizes the influence of software and model optimizations, such as quantization, KV cache compression, LoRA adapters, chunked prefill, different attentions, and operator fusion, on performance metrics such as time-to-first-token (TTFT), time-per-output-token (TPOT) and tokens-per-second (TPS). LIFE enables performance forecasting using only hardware specifications, such as TOPS and memory bandwidth, without requiring extensive dataset benchmarking. We validate LIFE's forecasting with inference on AMD Ryzen CPUs, NPUs, iGPUs and NVIDIA V100 GPUs, with Llama2-7B variants, demonstrating the utility of LIFE in forecasting LLM performance through lens of system efficiency to enable efficient LLM deployment across different hardware platforms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The key-value (KV) cache accelerates LLMs decoding by storing KV tensors from previously generated tokens. It reduces redundant computation at the cost of increased memory usage. To mitigate this overhead, existing approaches compress KV tensors into lower-bit representations; however, quantization errors can accumulate as more tokens are generated, potentially resulting in undesired outputs. In this paper, we introduce SQuat (Subspace-orthogonal KV cache quantization). It first constructs a subspace spanned by query tensors to capture the most critical task-related information. During key tensor quantization, it enforces that the difference between the (de)quantized and original keys remains orthogonal to this subspace, minimizing the impact of quantization errors on the attention mechanism's outputs. SQuat requires no model fine-tuning, no additional calibration dataset for offline learning, and is grounded in a theoretical framework we develop. Through numerical experiments, we show that our method reduces peak memory by 2.17 to 2.82, improves throughput by 2.45 to 3.60, and achieves more favorable benchmark scores than existing KV cache quantization algorithms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep learning models deployed on edge devices frequently encounter resource variability, which arises from fluctuating energy levels, timing constraints, or prioritization of other critical tasks within the system. State-of-the-art machine learning pipelines generate resource-agnostic models that are not capable to adapt at runtime. In this work, we introduce Resource-Efficient Deep Subnetworks (REDS) to tackle model adaptation to variable resources. In contrast to the state-of-the-art, REDS leverages structured sparsity constructively by exploiting permutation invariance of neurons, which allows for hardware-specific optimizations. Specifically, REDS achieves computational efficiency by (1) skipping sequential computational blocks identified by a novel iterative knapsack optimizer, and (2) taking advantage of data cache by re-arranging the order of operations in REDS computational graph. REDS supports conventional deep networks frequently deployed on the edge and provides computational benefits even for small and simple networks. We evaluate REDS on eight benchmark architectures trained on the Visual Wake Words, Google Speech Commands, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K datasets, and test on four off-the-shelf mobile and embedded hardware platforms. We provide a theoretical result and empirical evidence demonstrating REDS' outstanding performance in terms of submodels' test set accuracy, and demonstrate an adaptation time in response to dynamic resource constraints of under 40$\mu$s, utilizing a fully-connected network on Arduino Nano 33 BLE.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Utility-scale quantum programs contain operations on the order of $>10^{15}$ which must be prepared and piped from a classical co-processor to the control unit of the quantum device. The latency of this process significantly increases with the size of the program: existing high-level classical representations of quantum programs are typically memory intensive and do not na\"ively efficiently scale to the degree required to execute utility-scale programs in real-time. To combat this limitation, we propose the utilization of high-level quantum circuit caches and compressors. The first save on the time associated with repetitive tasks and sub-circuits, and the latter are useful for representing the programs/circuits in memory-efficient formats. We present numerical evidence that caches and compressors can offer five orders of magnitude lower latencies during the automatic transpilation of extremely large quantum circuits.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large multimodal models (LMMs) have advanced significantly by integrating visual encoders with extensive language models, enabling robust reasoning capabilities. However, compressing LMMs for deployment on edge devices remains a critical challenge. In this work, we propose an adaptive search algorithm that optimizes sparsity and KV cache compression to enhance LMM efficiency. Utilizing the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator, our method dynamically adjusts pruning ratios and KV cache quantization bandwidth across different LMM layers, using model performance as the optimization objective. This approach uniquely combines pruning with key-value cache quantization and incorporates a fast pruning technique that eliminates the need for additional fine-tuning or weight adjustments, achieving efficient compression without compromising accuracy. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, including LLaVA-1.5 7B and 13B, demonstrate our method superiority over state-of-the-art techniques such as SparseGPT and Wanda across various compression levels. Notably, our framework automatic allocation of KV cache compression resources sets a new standard in LMM optimization, delivering memory efficiency without sacrificing much performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The encoding of input parameters is one of the fundamental building blocks of neural network algorithms. Its goal is to map the input data to a higher-dimensional space, typically supported by trained feature vectors. The mapping is crucial for the efficiency and approximation quality of neural networks. We propose a novel geometry-aware encoding called GATE that stores feature vectors on the surface of triangular meshes. Our encoding is suitable for neural rendering-related algorithms, for example, neural radiance caching. It also avoids limitations of previous hash-based encoding schemes, such as hash collisions, selection of resolution versus scene size, and divergent memory access. Our approach decouples feature vector density from geometry density using mesh colors, while allowing for finer control over neural network training and adaptive level-of-detail.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents an in-depth investigation into the high-performance parallel optimization of the Fish School Behaviour (FSB) algorithm on the Setonix supercomputing platform using the OpenMP framework. Given the increasing demand for enhanced computational capabilities for complex, large-scale calculations across diverse domains, there's an imperative need for optimized parallel algorithms and computing structures. The FSB algorithm, inspired by nature's social behavior patterns, provides an ideal platform for parallelization due to its iterative and computationally intensive nature. This study leverages the capabilities of the Setonix platform and the OpenMP framework to analyze various aspects of multi-threading, such as thread counts, scheduling strategies, and OpenMP constructs, aiming to discern patterns and strategies that can elevate program performance. Experiments were designed to rigorously test different configurations, and our results not only offer insights for parallel optimization of FSB on Setonix but also provide valuable references for other parallel computational research using OpenMP. Looking forward, other factors, such as cache behavior and thread scheduling strategies at micro and macro levels, hold potential for further exploration and optimization.

In this paper, we present PeerSync, a decentralized P2P-based system designed to optimize image distribution in edge environments. PeerSync employs a popularity- and network-aware download engine that dynamically adapts to content popularity and real-time network conditions using a sliding window mechanism. PeerSync further integrates automated tracker election for rapid peer discovery and dynamic cache management for efficient storage utilization. We implement PeerSync with 8000+ lines of Rust code and test its performance extensively on both physical edge devices and Docker-based emulations. Experimental results show that PeerSync delivers a remarkable speed increase of 2.72$\times$, 1.79$\times$, and 1.28$\times$ compared to the Baseline, Dragonfly, and Kraken, respectively, while significantly reducing peak cross-network traffic by 90.72\% under congested and varying network conditions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose a history-driven target (HDT) framework in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to improve any random walk algorithm on discrete state spaces, such as general undirected graphs, for efficient sampling from target distribution $\boldsymbol{\mu}$. With broad applications in network science and distributed optimization, recent innovations like the self-repellent random walk (SRRW) achieve near-zero variance by prioritizing under-sampled states through transition kernel modifications based on past visit frequencies. However, SRRW's reliance on explicit computation of transition probabilities for all neighbors at each step introduces substantial computational overhead, while its strict dependence on time-reversible Markov chains excludes advanced non-reversible MCMC methods. To overcome these limitations, instead of direct modification of transition kernel, HDT introduces a history-dependent target distribution $\boldsymbol{\pi}[\mathbf{x}]$ to replace the original target $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ in any graph sampler, where $\mathbf{x}$ represents the empirical measure of past visits. This design preserves lightweight implementation by requiring only local information between the current and proposed states and achieves compatibility with both reversible and non-reversible MCMC samplers, while retaining unbiased samples with target distribution $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and near-zero variance performance. Extensive experiments in graph sampling demonstrate consistent performance gains, and a memory-efficient Least Recently Used (LRU) cache ensures scalability to large general graphs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long-context tasks is often hampered by the substantial memory footprint and computational demands of the Key-Value (KV) cache. Current compression strategies, including token eviction and learned projections, frequently lead to biased representations -- either by overemphasizing recent/high-attention tokens or by repeatedly degrading information from earlier context -- and may require costly model retraining. We present FAEDKV (Frequency-Adaptive Infinite-Window for KV cache), a novel, training-free KV cache compression framework that ensures unbiased information retention. FAEDKV operates by transforming the KV cache into the frequency domain using a proposed Infinite-Window Fourier Transform (IWDFT). This approach allows for the equalized contribution of all tokens to the compressed representation, effectively preserving both early and recent contextual information. A preliminary frequency ablation study identifies critical spectral components for layer-wise, targeted compression. Experiments on LongBench benchmark demonstrate FAEDKV's superiority over existing methods by up to 22\%. In addition, our method shows superior, position-agnostic retrieval accuracy on the Needle-In-A-Haystack task compared to compression based approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video generation. However, the computational intensity remains a significant challenge for practical applications. While feature caching has been proposed to reduce the computational burden of diffusion models, existing methods typically overlook the heterogeneous significance of individual blocks, resulting in suboptimal reuse and degraded output quality. To this end, we address this gap by introducing ProfilingDiT, a novel adaptive caching strategy that explicitly disentangles foreground and background-focused blocks. Through a systematic analysis of attention distributions in diffusion models, we reveal a key observation: 1) Most layers exhibit a consistent preference for either foreground or background regions. 2) Predicted noise shows low inter-step similarity initially, which stabilizes as denoising progresses. This finding inspires us to formulate a selective caching strategy that preserves full computation for dynamic foreground elements while efficiently caching static background features. Our approach substantially reduces computational overhead while preserving visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant acceleration (e.g., 2.01 times speedup for Wan2.1) while maintaining visual fidelity across comprehensive quality metrics, establishing a viable method for efficient video generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a critical technique for efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs). This work proposes NestQuant, a novel PTQ scheme for weights and activations that is based on self-similar nested lattices. Recent works have mathematically shown such quantizers to be information-theoretically optimal for low-precision matrix multiplication. We implement a practical low-complexity version of NestQuant based on Gosset lattice, making it a drop-in quantizer for any matrix multiplication step (e.g., in self-attention, MLP etc). For example, NestQuant quantizes weights, KV-cache, and activations of Llama-3-8B to 4 bits, achieving perplexity of 6.6 on wikitext2. This represents more than 55% reduction in perplexity gap with respect to unquantized model (perplexity of 6.14) compared to state-of-the-art Metas SpinQuant (perplexity 7.3), OstQuant (7.3) and QuaRot (8.2). Comparisons on bigger models (up to 70B) and on various LLM evaluation benchmarks confirm uniform superiority of NestQuant.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across diverse natural language processing tasks. However, as the model size and the input sequence's length increase, the linearly increasing key-value (KV) cache significantly degrades inference throughput. Therefore, grouped-query attention (GQA), as an alternative to multi-head attention (MHA), has been widely introduced into LLMs. In this work, we propose a cost-effective method for converting MHA into GQA with any compression ratio of KV heads. The key point of our method lies in the application of Procrustes analysis to the attention heads, which enhances the similarity among attention heads while preserving computational invariance, thereby improving the model's post-training performance. Subsequently, we employ $\mathit{L_0}$ regularization to prune redundant parameters. The model after pruning can be adapted to the standard GQA framework. Experimental results show that our strategy can compress up to 87.5\% KV heads of LLaMA2-7B model and 75\% KV heads of Sheared-LLaMA-1.3B with acceptable performance degradation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Processing long-context inputs with large language models presents a significant challenge due to the enormous memory requirements of the Key-Value (KV) cache during inference. Existing KV cache compression methods exhibit noticeable performance degradation when memory is reduced by more than 85%. Additionally, strategies that leverage GPU-CPU collaboration for approximate attention remain underexplored in this setting. We propose HCAttention, a heterogeneous attention computation framework that integrates key quantization, value offloading, and dynamic KV eviction to enable efficient inference under extreme memory constraints. The method is compatible with existing transformer architectures and does not require model fine-tuning. Experimental results on the LongBench benchmark demonstrate that our approach preserves the accuracy of full-attention model while shrinking the KV cache memory footprint to 25% of its original size. Remarkably, it stays competitive with only 12.5% of the cache, setting a new state-of-the-art in LLM KV cache compression. To the best of our knowledge, HCAttention is the first to extend the Llama-3-8B model to process 4 million tokens on a single A100 GPU with 80GB memory.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) face low hardware efficiency during decoding, especially for long-context reasoning tasks. This paper introduces Step-3, a 321B-parameter VLM with hardware-aware model-system co-design optimized for minimizing decoding costs. Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel Multi-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces both KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention expressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed inference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers into specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost efficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared with models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at longer context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per token (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that hardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are critical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with DeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios. Our implementation on Hopper GPUs achieves a decoding throughput of up to 4,039 tokens per second per GPU under 50ms TPOT SLA (4K context, FP8, no MTP). It is higher than DeepSeek-V3's 2,324 in the same setup and sets a new Pareto frontier for LLM decoding.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Firmware updates remain the primary line of defense for IoT devices; however, the update channel itself has become a well-established attack vector. Existing defenses mainly focus on securing monolithic firmware images, leaving module-level customization -a growing user demand-largely unprotected and insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we conduct a pilot study on the update workflows of 200 Linux-based IoT devices across 23 vendors, uncovering five previously undocumented vulnerabilities caused by customization practices. A broader analysis of update-related CVEs from 2020 to 2024 reveals that over half originate from customization-induced issues. These findings highlight a critical yet underexamined reality: as customization increases, so does the attack surface, while current defenses fail to keep pace. We propose IMUP (Integrity-Centric Modular Update Platform), the first framework to address two key challenges: constructing a trustworthy cross-module integrity chain and scaling update performance under mass customization. IMUP combines three techniques: per-module chameleon hashing for integrity, server-side proof-of-work offloading to reduce device overhead, and server-side caching to reuse module combinations, minimizing rebuild costs. Security analysis shows that even when 95 percent of secret keys are exposed, forging a valid image incurs over 300 times the cost of the legitimate server. Experiments on heterogeneous IoT devices demonstrate that IMUP reduces server-side generation time by 2.9 times and device downtime by 5.9 times compared to a package-manager baseline.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A kinetic ion induced electron emission (IIEE) model for general applications is developed to obtain the emitted electron energy spectrum for a distribution of ion impacts on a metallic surface. We assume an ionization cascade mechanism and use empirical models for the ion and electron stopping powers. The emission spectrum and the secondary electron yield (SEY) are validated for a variety of materials. The IIEE model is used to study the effect of IIEE on the plasma-material interactions of Z-pinch electrodes. Un-magnetized Boltzmann-Poisson simulations are performed for a Z-pinch plasma doubly bounded by two biased copper electrodes with and without IIEE at bias potentials from 0 to 9 kV. At the anode, the SEY decreases from 0 to 1 kV, but then increases at higher bias potentials. At the cathode, the SEY is much larger due to higher energy ion bombardment and grows with bias potential. As the bias potential increases, the emitted cathode electrons are accelerated to higher energies into the domain collisionally heating the plasma. Above 1 kV, the heating is strong enough to increase the plasma potential. Despite SEY greater than 1, only a classical sheath forms as opposed to a space-charge limited or inverse sheath due to the emitted electron flux not reaching the space charge current saturation limits. Furthermore, the current in the emissionless cases saturates to a value lower than experiment. With IIEE, the current does not saturate and continues to increase with the 4 kV case matching most closely with experiment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Knowledge distillation can be a cost-effective technique to distill knowledge in Large Language Models, if the teacher output logits can be pre-computed and cached. However, successfully applying this to pre-training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we prove that naive approaches for sparse knowledge distillation such as caching Top-K probabilities, while intuitive, provide biased estimates of teacher probability distribution to the student, resulting in suboptimal performance and calibration. We propose an importance-sampling-based method `Random Sampling Knowledge Distillation', which provides unbiased estimates, preserves the gradient in expectation, and requires storing significantly sparser logits. Our method enables faster training of student models with marginal overhead (<10%) compared to cross-entropy based training, while maintaining competitive performance compared to full distillation, across a range of model sizes from 300M to 3B.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing size of the Key-Value (KV) cache during the Large Language Models long-context inference is the main obstacle for its balance between the deployment cost and task accuracy. To reduce the KV cache size in such scenarios, most previous efforts leveraged on the attention weight to evict non-critical cache tokens. But there is a trade-off in those methods, they usually require major modification of the inference infrastructure and significant computation overhead. Based on the fact that the Large Language models are autoregressive models, we propose LagKV, a KV compression strategy only relying on straight forward comparison among KV themselves. It is a totally attention free method which offers easy integration to the main stream inference platform and comparable performance comparing to other complicated KV compression methods. Results on RULER benchmark show that, our approach outperforms SnapKV and StreamingLLM in different compression ratios. Especially in the 64-digit passkey retrieval task, our method outperforms the attention weight based method $H_2O$ over $50\%$ with same compression ratios. Our code is available at https://github.com/AI-Lab-China-Merchants-Bank/LagKV.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents a streaming extension for the Sortformer speaker diarization framework, whose key property is the arrival-time ordering of output speakers. The proposed approach employs an Arrival-Order Speaker Cache (AOSC) to store frame-level acoustic embeddings of previously observed speakers. Unlike conventional speaker-tracing buffers, AOSC orders embeddings by speaker index corresponding to their arrival time order, and is dynamically updated by selecting frames with the highest scores based on the model's past predictions. Notably, the number of stored embeddings per speaker is determined dynamically by the update mechanism, ensuring efficient cache utilization and precise speaker tracking. Experiments on benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach, even in low-latency setups. These results establish Streaming Sortformer as a robust solution for real-time multi-speaker tracking and a foundation for streaming multi-talker speech processing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficiently editing knowledge stored in large language models (LLMs) enables model updates without large-scale training. One possible solution is Locate-and-Edit (L\&E), allowing simultaneous modifications of a massive number of facts. However, such editing may compromise the general abilities of LLMs and even result in forgetting edited facts when scaling up to thousands of edits. In this paper, we model existing linear L\&E methods as querying a Key-Value (KV) database. From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an editing framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV database equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular, our gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts, effectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments involving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and CounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results demonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization, specificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance across six representative text understanding and generation tasks. Further experiments indicate that NeuralDB maintains its effectiveness even when scaled to 100,000 facts (\textbf{50x} more than in prior work).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Yume aims to use images, text, or videos to create an interactive, realistic, and dynamic world, which allows exploration and control using peripheral devices or neural signals. In this report, we present a preview version of \method, which creates a dynamic world from an input image and allows exploration of the world using keyboard actions. To achieve this high-fidelity and interactive video world generation, we introduce a well-designed framework, which consists of four main components, including camera motion quantization, video generation architecture, advanced sampler, and model acceleration. First, we quantize camera motions for stable training and user-friendly interaction using keyboard inputs. Then, we introduce the Masked Video Diffusion Transformer~(MVDT) with a memory module for infinite video generation in an autoregressive manner. After that, training-free Anti-Artifact Mechanism (AAM) and Time Travel Sampling based on Stochastic Differential Equations (TTS-SDE) are introduced to the sampler for better visual quality and more precise control. Moreover, we investigate model acceleration by synergistic optimization of adversarial distillation and caching mechanisms. We use the high-quality world exploration dataset \sekai to train \method, and it achieves remarkable results in diverse scenes and applications. All data, codebase, and model weights are available on https://github.com/stdstu12/YUME. Yume will update monthly to achieve its original goal. Project page: https://stdstu12.github.io/YUME-Project/.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search is a fundamental problem in computer science for which in-memory graph-based methods, such as Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW), perform exceptionally well. To scale beyond billions of high-dimensional vectors, the index must be distributed. The disaggregated memory architecture physically separates compute and memory into two distinct hardware units and has become popular in modern data centers. Both units are connected via RDMA networks that allow compute nodes to directly access remote memory and perform all the computations, posing unique challenges for disaggregated indexes.   In this work, we propose a scalable HNSW index for ANN search in disaggregated memory. In contrast to existing distributed approaches, which partition the graph at the cost of accuracy, our method builds a graph-preserving index that reaches the same accuracy as a single-machine HNSW. Continuously fetching high-dimensional vector data from remote memory leads to severe network bandwidth limitations, which we overcome by employing an efficient caching mechanism. Since answering a single query involves processing numerous unique graph nodes, caching alone is not sufficient to achieve high scalability. We logically combine the caches of the compute nodes to increase the overall cache effectiveness and confirm the efficiency and scalability of our method in our evaluation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The online caching problem aims to minimize cache misses when serving a sequence of requests under a limited cache size. While naive learning-augmented caching algorithms achieve ideal $1$-consistency, they lack robustness guarantees. Existing robustification methods either sacrifice $1$-consistency or introduce significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce Guard, a lightweight robustification framework that enhances the robustness of a broad class of learning-augmented caching algorithms to $2H_k + 2$, while preserving their $1$-consistency. Guard achieves the current best-known trade-off between consistency and robustness, with only $O(1)$ additional per-request overhead, thereby maintaining the original time complexity of the base algorithm. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets and prediction models validate the effectiveness of Guard in practice.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images from few samples raises significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding unauthorized modifications of private content. This concerning issue has renewed the efforts in developing protection mechanisms based on adversarial attacks, which generate effective perturbations to poison diffusion models. Our work is motivated by the observation that these models exhibit a high degree of abstraction within their semantic latent space (`h-space'), which encodes critical high-level features for generating coherent and meaningful content. In this paper, we propose a novel anti-customization approach, called HAAD (h-space based Adversarial Attack for Diffusion models), that leverages adversarial attacks to craft perturbations based on the h-space that can efficiently degrade the image generation process. Building upon HAAD, we further introduce a more efficient variant, HAAD-KV, that constructs perturbations solely based on the KV parameters of the h-space. This strategy offers a stronger protection, that is computationally less expensive. Despite their simplicity, our methods outperform state-of-the-art adversarial attacks, highlighting their effectiveness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained significant attention due to their remarkable reasoning capabilities and proficiency in generalization. However, processing a large number of visual tokens and generating long-context outputs impose substantial computational overhead, leading to excessive demands for key-value (KV) cache. To address this critical bottleneck, we propose AirCache, a novel KV cache compression method aimed at accelerating LVLMs inference. This work systematically investigates the correlations between visual and textual tokens within the attention mechanisms of LVLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals considerable redundancy in cached visual tokens, wherein strategically eliminating these tokens preserves model performance while significantly accelerating context generation. Inspired by these findings, we introduce an elite observation window for assessing the importance of visual components in the KV cache, focusing on stable inter-modal relevancy modeling with enhanced multi-perspective consistency. Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise budget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of token importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to uniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the full cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing decoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of inputs. Notably, as cache retention rates decrease, our method exhibits increasing performance advantages over existing approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We study the problem of scheduling a general computational DAG on multiple processors in a 2-level memory hierarchy. This setting is a natural generalization of several prominent models in the literature, and it simultaneously captures workload balancing, communication, and data movement due to cache size limitations. We first analyze the fundamental properties of this problem from a theoretical perspective, such as its computational complexity. We also prove that optimizing parallelization and memory management separately, as done in many applications, can result in a solution that is a linear factor away from the optimum.   On the algorithmic side, we discuss a natural technique to represent and solve the problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). We develop a holistic scheduling algorithm based on this approach, and we experimentally study its performance and properties on a small benchmark of computational tasks. Our results confirm that the ILP-based method can indeed find considerably better solutions than a baseline which combines classical scheduling algorithms and memory management policies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diagnostic Neutral Beam Injectors (DNBI), through the combined use of Charge Exchange Recombination Spectroscopy (CHERS) and Motional Stark effect diagnostics (MSE), are a well-known tool to access important information about magnetically confined plasmas, such as radial profiles of ion temperature, ion flow, impurity content and intensity and direction of the magnetic field. For this purpose, a DNBI was installed and operated in the RFX-mod experiment, which was designed to confine plasma mainly through the Reversed Field Pinch configuration. The DNBI, designed and built by the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics (BINP), was based on a source of positive hydrogen ions, accelerated to 50 keV and for a maximum ion current of 5 A. The beam could be modulated and the maximum overall duration was 50 ms. With the upgrade of RFX-mod to the present RFX-mod2 machine, the DNBI is being renovated to solve several power units faults and improve the overall reliability of the system. The 50 kV power supply is being improved, as well as the power supplies in the high voltage deck and its insulation transformer. Magnetic field survival tests were performed on the toroidal-core-based DC-DC converters that should power the electronic boards in a reliable way. The control system, originally based on CAMAC technology, was redesigned to be fully replaced. This contribution reviews the technical criticalities emerged in the DNBI check-up and the new solutions adopted to make the DNBI operative and more reliable.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the wide application of machine learning (ML), privacy concerns arise with user data as they may contain sensitive information. Privacy-preserving ML (PPML) based on cryptographic primitives has emerged as a promising solution in which an ML model is directly computed on the encrypted data to provide a formal privacy guarantee. However, PPML frameworks heavily rely on the oblivious transfer (OT) primitive to compute nonlinear functions. OT mainly involves the computation of single-point correlated OT (SPCOT) and learning parity with noise (LPN) operations. As OT is still computed extensively on general-purpose CPUs, it becomes the latency bottleneck of modern PPML frameworks.   In this paper, we propose a novel OT accelerator, dubbed Ironman, to significantly increase the efficiency of OT and the overall PPML framework. We observe that SPCOT is computation-bounded, and thus propose a hardware-friendly SPCOT algorithm with a customized accelerator to improve SPCOT computation throughput. In contrast, LPN is memory-bandwidth-bounded due to irregular memory access patterns. Hence, we further leverage the near-memory processing (NMP) architecture equipped with memory-side cache and index sorting to improve effective memory bandwidth. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate Ironman achieves a 39.2-237.4 times improvement in OT throughput across different NMP configurations compared to the full-thread CPU implementation. For different PPML frameworks, Ironman demonstrates a 2.1-3.4 times reduction in end-to-end latency for both CNN and Transformer models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Serving large language models (LLMs) is important for cloud providers, and caching intermediate results (KV\$) after processing each request substantially improves serving throughput and latency. However, there is limited understanding of how LLM serving benefits from KV\$ caching, where system design decisions like cache eviction policies are highly workload-dependent. In this paper, we present the first systematic characterization of the KV\$ workload patterns from one of the leading LLM service providers. We draw observations that were not covered by previous studies focusing on synthetic workloads, including: KV\$ reuses are skewed across requests, where reuses between single-turn requests are equally important as multi-turn requests; the reuse time and probability are diverse considering all requests, but for a specific request category, the pattern tends to be predictable; and the overall cache size required for an ideal cache hit ratio is moderate. Based on the characterization, we further propose a workload-aware cache eviction policy that improves the serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Attention mechanisms underpin the success of large language models (LLMs), yet their substantial computational and memory overhead poses challenges for optimizing efficiency and performance. A critical bottleneck arises as KV cache and attention computations scale rapidly with text length, challenging deployment on hardware with limited computational and memory resources. We observe that attention mechanisms exhibit substantial redundancy, since the KV cache can be significantly compressed and attention maps across heads display high similarity, revealing that much of the computation and storage is unnecessary. Leveraging these insights, we propose \textbf{G}rouped-Head Laten\textbf{T} \textbf{A}ttention (GTA), a novel attention mechanism that reduces memory usage and computational complexity while maintaining performance. GTA comprises two components: (1) a shared attention map mechanism that reuses attention scores across multiple heads, decreasing the key cache size; and (2) a nonlinear value decoder with learned projections that compresses the value cache into a latent space, further cutting memory needs. GTA cuts attention computation FLOPs by up to \emph{62.5\%} versus Grouped-Query Attention and shrink the KV cache by up to \emph{70\%}, all while avoiding the extra overhead of Multi-Head Latent Attention to improve LLM deployment efficiency. Consequently, GTA models achieve a \emph{2x} increase in end-to-end inference speed, with prefill benefiting from reduced computational cost and decoding benefiting from the smaller cache footprint.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transaction processing systems are the crux for modern data-center applications, yet current multi-node systems are slow due to network overheads. This paper advocates for Compute Express Link (CXL) as a network alternative, which enables low-latency and cache-coherent shared memory accesses. However, directly adopting standard CXL primitives leads to performance degradation due to the high cost of maintaining cross-node cache coherence. To address the CXL challenges, this paper introduces CtXnL, a software-hardware co-designed system that implements a novel hybrid coherence primitive tailored to the loosely coherent nature of transactional data. The core innovation of CtXnL is empowering transaction system developers with the ability to selectively achieve data coherence. Our evaluations on OLTP workloads demonstrate that CtXnL enhances performance, outperforming current network-based systems and achieves with up to 2.08x greater throughput than vanilla CXL memory sharing architectures across universal transaction processing policies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As power consumption from AI training and inference continues to increase, AI accelerators are being integrated directly into the CPU. Intel's Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX) is one such example, debuting on the 4th generation Intel Xeon Scalable CPU. We discover a timing side and covert channel, GATEBLEED, caused by the aggressive power gating utilized to keep the CPU within operating limits. We show that the GATEBLEED side channel is a threat to AI privacy as many ML models such as transformers and CNNs make critical computationally-heavy decisions based on private values like confidence thresholds and routing logits. Timing delays from selective powering down of AMX components mean that each matrix multiplication is a potential leakage point when executed on the AMX accelerator. Our research identifies over a dozen potential gadgets across popular ML libraries (HuggingFace, PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.), revealing that they can leak sensitive and private information. GATEBLEED poses a risk for local and remote timing inference, even under previous protective measures. GATEBLEED can be used as a high performance, stealthy remote covert channel and a generic magnifier for timing transmission channels, capable of bypassing traditional cache defenses to leak arbitrary memory addresses and evading state of the art microarchitectural attack detectors under realistic network conditions and system configurations in which previous attacks fail. We implement an end-to-end microarchitectural inference attack on a transformer model optimized with Intel AMX, achieving a membership inference accuracy of 81% and a precision of 0.89. In a CNN-based or transformer-based mixture-of-experts model optimized with Intel AMX, we leak expert choice with 100% accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose StreamME, a method focuses on fast 3D avatar reconstruction. The StreamME synchronously records and reconstructs a head avatar from live video streams without any pre-cached data, enabling seamless integration of the reconstructed appearance into downstream applications. This exceptionally fast training strategy, which we refer to as on-the-fly training, is central to our approach. Our method is built upon 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), eliminating the reliance on MLPs in deformable 3DGS and relying solely on geometry, which significantly improves the adaptation speed to facial expression. To further ensure high efficiency in on-the-fly training, we introduced a simplification strategy based on primary points, which distributes the point clouds more sparsely across the facial surface, optimizing points number while maintaining rendering quality. Leveraging the on-the-fly training capabilities, our method protects the facial privacy and reduces communication bandwidth in VR system or online conference. Additionally, it can be directly applied to downstream application such as animation, toonify, and relighting.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models can be quantized to reduce inference time latency, model size, and energy consumption, thereby delivering a better user experience at lower cost. A challenge exists to deliver quantized models with minimal loss of accuracy in reasonable time, and in particular to do so without requiring mechanisms incompatible with specialized inference accelerators. Here, we demonstrate a simple, end-to-end quantization-aware training approach that, with an increase in total model training budget of less than 0.1%, outperforms the leading published quantization methods by large margins on several modern benchmarks, with both base and instruct model variants. The approach easily generalizes across different model architectures, can be applied to activations, cache, and weights, and requires the introduction of no additional operations to the model other than the quantization itself.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To break the context limits of large language models (LLMs) that bottleneck reasoning accuracy and efficiency, we propose the Thread Inference Model (TIM), a family of LLMs trained for recursive and decompositional problem solving, and TIMRUN, an inference runtime enabling long-horizon structured reasoning beyond context limits. Together, TIM hosted on TIMRUN supports virtually unlimited working memory and multi-hop tool calls within a single language model inference, overcoming output limits, positional-embedding constraints, and GPU-memory bottlenecks. Performance is achieved by modeling natural language as reasoning trees measured by both length and depth instead of linear sequences. The reasoning trees consist of tasks with thoughts, recursive subtasks, and conclusions based on the concept we proposed in Schroeder et al, 2025. During generation, we maintain a working memory that retains only the key-value states of the most relevant context tokens, selected by a rule-based subtask-pruning mechanism, enabling reuse of positional embeddings and GPU memory pages throughout reasoning. Experimental results show that our system sustains high inference throughput, even when manipulating up to 90% of the KV cache in GPU memory. It also delivers accurate reasoning on mathematical tasks and handles information retrieval challenges that require long-horizon reasoning and multi-hop tool use.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Structured decoding enables large language models (LLMs) to generate outputs in formats required by downstream systems, such as HTML or JSON. However, existing methods suffer from efficiency bottlenecks due to grammar compilation, state tracking, and mask creation. We observe that many real-world tasks embed strong prior knowledge about output structure. Leveraging this, we propose a decomposition of constraints into static and dynamic components -- precompiling static structures offline and instantiating dynamic arguments at runtime using grammar snippets. Instead of relying on pushdown automata, we employ a compositional set of operators to model regular formats, achieving lower transition latency. We introduce wgrammar, a lightweight decoding engine that integrates domain-aware simplification, constraint decomposition, and mask caching, achieving up to 250x speedup over existing systems. wgrammar's source code is publicly available at https://github.com/wrran/wgrammar.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Serverless is an attractive computing model that offers seamless scalability and elasticity; it takes the infrastructure management burden away from users and enables a pay-as-you-use billing model. As a result, serverless is becoming increasingly popular to support highly elastic and bursty workloads. However, existing platforms are supported by bloated virtualization stacks, which, combined with bursty and irregular invocations, lead to high memory and latency overheads.   To reduce the virtualization stack bloat, we propose Hydra, a virtualized multi-language runtime and platform capable of hosting multiple sandboxes running concurrently. To fully leverage Hydra's virtualized runtime, we revisit the existing serverless platform design to make it colocation-aware across owners and functions, and to feature a caching layer of pre-allocated Hydra instances that can be used by different functions written in different languages to reduce cold starts. We also propose a snapshotting mechanism to checkpoint and restore individual sandboxes.   By consolidating multiple serverless function invocations through Hydra, we improve the overall function density (ops/GB-sec) by 2.41x on average compared to OpenWhisk runtimes, the state-of-the-art single-language runtimes used in most serverless platforms, and by 1.43x on average compared to Knative runtimes supporting invocation colocation within the same function. When reproducing the Azure Functions trace, our serverless platform operating Hydra instances reduces the overall memory footprint by 21.3-43.9% compared to operating OpenWhisk instances and by 14.5-30% compared to operating Knative instances. Hydra eliminates cold starts thanks to the pool of pre-warmed runtime instances, reducing p99 latency by 45.3-375.5x compared to OpenWhisk and by 1.9-51.4x compared to Knative.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Using the language of moperads-monoids in the category of right modules over an operad-we reinterpret the Alekseev-Enriquez-Torossian construction of Kashiwara-Vergne (KV) solutions from associators. We show that any isomorphism between the moperad of parenthesized braids with a frozen strand and the moperad of chord diagrams gives rise to a family of genus zero KV solutions operadically generated by a single classical KV solution. We show that the Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller module groups act on the latter, intertwining the actions of the KV symmetry groups. In the other direction, we show that any symmetric KV solution gives rise to a morphism from the moperad of parenthesized braids with a frozen strand to the moperad of tangential automorphisms of free Lie algebras. This morphism factors through the moperad of chord diagrams if and only if the associated KV associator is a Drinfeld associator.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Long-context large language models (LLMs) are able to process inputs containing up to several million tokens. In the scope of in-context learning (ICL), this translates into using hundreds/thousands of demonstrations in the input prompt, enabling many-shot ICL. In practice, a fixed set of demonstrations is often selected at random in many-shot settings due to (1) high inference costs, (2) the benefits of caching and reusing computations, and (3) the similar performance offered by this strategy compared to others when scaled. In this work, we propose two straightforward strategies for demonstration selection in many-shot ICL that improve performance with minimal computational overhead. Our first method combines a small number of demonstrations, selected based on their similarity to each test sample, with a disproportionately larger set of random demonstrations that are cached. The second strategy improves the first by replacing random demonstrations with those selected using centroids derived from test sample representations via k-means clustering. Our experiments with Gemini Pro and Flash across several datasets indicate that our strategies consistently outperform random selection and surpass or match the most performant selection approach while supporting caching and reducing inference cost by up to an order of magnitude. We also show that adjusting the proportion of demonstrations selected based on different criteria can balance performance and inference cost in many-shot ICL.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid development in scientific research provides a need for more compute power, which is partly being solved by GPUs. This paper presents a microarchitectural analysis of the modern NVIDIA Blackwell architecture by studying GPU performance   features with thought through microbenchmarks. We unveil key subsystems, including the memory hierarchy, SM execution   pipelines, and the SM sub-core units, including the 5th generation tensor cores supporting FP4 and FP6 precisions.   To understand the different key features of the NVIDIA GPU, we study latency, throughput, cache behavior, and scheduling   details, revealing subtle tuning metrics in the design of Blackwell. To develop a comprehensive analysis, we compare the   Blackwell architecture with the previous Hopper architecture by using the GeForce RTX 5080 and H100 PCIe, respectively. We   evaluate and compare results, presenting both generational improvements and performance regressions. Additionally, we   investigate the role of power efficiency and energy consumption under varied workloads. Our findings provide actionable insights   for application developers, compiler writers, and performance engineers to optimize workloads on Blackwell-based platforms,   and contribute new data to the growing research on GPU architectures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) multicore processors have advanced memory hierarchies that enhance memory-level parallelism (MLP), which is crucial for high performance. To support high MLP, shared last-level caches (LLCs) are divided into multiple banks, allowing parallel access. However, uneven distribution of cache requests from the cores, especially when requests from multiple cores are concentrated on a single bank, can result in significant contention affecting all cores that access the cache. Such cache bank contention can even be maliciously induced -- known as cache bank-aware denial-of-service (DoS) attacks -- in order to jeopardize the system's timing predictability.   In this paper, we propose a per-bank bandwidth regulation approach for multi-banked shared LLC based multicore real-time systems. By regulating bandwidth on a per-bank basis, the approach aims to prevent unnecessary throttling of cache accesses to non-contended banks, thus improving overall performance (throughput) without compromising isolation benefits of throttling. We implement our approach on a RISC-V system-on-chip (SoC) platform using FireSim and evaluate extensively using both synthetic and real-world workloads. Our evaluation results show that the proposed per-bank regulation approach effectively protects real-time tasks from co-running cache bank-aware DoS attacks, and offers up to a 3.66$\times$ performance improvement for the throttled benign best-effort tasks compared to prior bank-oblivious bandwidth throttling approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Detecting maximal square submatrices of ones in binary matrices is a fundamental problem with applications in computer vision and pattern recognition. While the standard dynamic programming (DP) solution achieves optimal asymptotic complexity, its practical performance suffers from repeated minimum operations and inefficient memory access patterns that degrade cache utilization. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel frequency-based algorithm that employs a greedy approach to track the columnar continuity of ones through an adaptive frequency array and a dynamic thresholding mechanism. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates that the frequency-based algorithm achieves faster performance than the standard DP in 100% of test cases with an average speedup of 3.32x, a maximum speedup of 4.60x, and a minimum speedup of 2.31x across matrices up to 5000x5000 with densities from 0.1 to 0.9. The algorithm's average speedup exceeds 2.5x for all densities and rises to over 3.5x for densities of 0.7 and higher across all matrix sizes. These results demonstrate that the frequency-based approach is a superior alternative to standard DP and opens new possibilities for efficient matrix analysis in performance-critical applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scaling language models unlocks impressive capabilities, but the accompanying computational and memory demands make both training and deployment expensive. Existing efficiency efforts typically target either parameter sharing or adaptive computation, leaving open the question of how to attain both simultaneously. We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework that combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer. MoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter efficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by dynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This allows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still active at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency by selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core mechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the first recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory footprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms a new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it significantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy, while delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive baselines. These gains demonstrate that MoR is an effective path towards large-model quality without incurring large-model cost.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose Lizard, a linearization framework that transforms pretrained Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) into flexible, subquadratic architectures for infinite-context generation. Transformer-based LLMs face significant memory and computational bottlenecks as context lengths increase, due to the quadratic complexity of softmax attention and the growing key-value (KV) cache. Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic attention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while preserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are often limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating mechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent state-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports constant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more flexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global context compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory, forming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and fine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware algorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive experiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher model's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while significantly outperforming previous linearization methods. On the 5-shot MMLU benchmark, Lizard improves over prior models by 18 points and shows significant improvements on associative recall tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly advanced large language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs in external tools and knowledge sources. However, existing RAG systems are typically constrained to static, single-turn interactions with fixed toolsets, making them ill-suited for dynamic domains such as healthcare and smart homes, where user intent, available tools, and contextual factors evolve over time. We present Dynamic Context Tuning (DCT), a lightweight framework that extends RAG to support multi-turn dialogue and evolving tool environments without requiring retraining. DCT integrates an attention-based context cache to track relevant past information, LoRA-based retrieval to dynamically select domain-specific tools, and efficient context compression to maintain inputs within LLM context limits. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that DCT improves plan accuracy by 14% and reduces hallucinations by 37%, while matching GPT-4 performance at significantly lower cost. Furthermore, DCT generalizes to previously unseen tools, enabling scalable and adaptable AI assistants across a wide range of dynamic environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple distributed devices to jointly train a shared model without centralizing data, but communication cost remains a major bottleneck, especially in resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces caching strategies - FIFO, LRU, and Priority-Based - to reduce unnecessary model update transmissions. By selectively forwarding significant updates, our approach lowers bandwidth usage while maintaining model accuracy. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and medical datasets show reduced communication with minimal accuracy loss. Results confirm that intelligent caching improves scalability, memory efficiency, and supports reliable FL in edge IoT networks, making it practical for deployment in smart cities, healthcare, and other latency-sensitive applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We describe KVLink, an approach for efficient key-value (KV) cache reuse in large language models (LLMs). In many LLM applications, different inputs can share overlapping context, such as the same retrieved document appearing in multiple queries. However, the LLMs still need to encode the entire context for each query, leading to redundant computation. In this paper, we investigate a new strategy to eliminate such inefficiency, where the KV cache of each document is precomputed independently. During inference, the KV caches of retrieved documents are concatenated, allowing the model to reuse cached representations instead of recomputing them. To mitigate the performance degradation when using KV caches computed independently for each document, KVLink introduces two key techniques: adjusting positional embeddings of the KV cache at inference to match the global position after concatenation, and using trainable special tokens to restore self-attention across independently encoded documents. Experiments across 7 datasets demonstrate that KVLink improves question answering accuracy by an average of 4% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, by leveraging precomputed KV caches, our approach reduces time-to-first-token by up to 96% compared to standard LLM inference, making it a scalable and efficient solution for context reuse. Additionally, KVLink can be combined with KV cache compression to further save cache loading and storage overhead while outperforming the baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Optimizing inference for long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly important due to the quadratic compute and linear memory complexity of Transformers. Existing approximation methods, such as key-value (KV) cache dropping, sparse attention, and prompt compression, typically rely on rough predictions of token or KV pair importance. We propose a novel framework for approximate LLM inference that leverages small draft models to more accurately predict the importance of tokens and KV pairs. Specifically, we introduce two instantiations of our proposed framework: (i) SpecKV, the first method that leverages a draft output to accurately assess the importance of each KV pair for more effective KV cache dropping, and (ii) SpecPC, which uses the draft model's attention activations to identify and discard unimportant prompt tokens. We motivate our methods with theoretical and empirical analyses, and show a strong correlation between the attention patterns of draft and target models. Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks show that our methods consistently achieve higher accuracy than existing baselines, while preserving the same improvements in memory usage, latency, and throughput.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The emergence of heterogeneity and domain-specific architectures targeting deep learning inference show great potential for enabling the deployment of modern CNNs on resource-constrained embedded platforms. A significant development is the diversification of custom hardware solely targeting the most expensive parts of CNNs. DLAs (deep learning accelerators) and NPUs (neural processing units), among others, can overcome the approaching limits of traditional silicon scaling and provide a solution to the power/performance tradeoff within embedded SoCs. Efficient DSA utilization requires proper system integration and a compilation/execution model for balanced execution in these heterogeneous architectures. There is a critical need for proper system integration and an efficient compilation/execution model for balanced execution in these heterogeneous architectures. This work highlights the hardware integration challenges for efficiently placing these units within the memory hierarchy and correct proximity to other execution blocks. We experimentally verify performance bottlenecks in CNN execution and pre/post-processing at runtime, where previous attention has generally been given to accelerator speedup alone. This work takes advantage of the ratification of the RISC-V Vector 1.0 extension and demonstrates its potential as a flexible target within a well-suited cache hierarchy scheme to reduce pre-processing bottlenecks and CPU fallback processes. Our results show up to a 9x speedup of image pre-processing and YOLOv3 fallback layer execution by up to 3x compared to CPU. We demonstrate RVV-1.0 in exposing a flexible programming model that can enable a balanced computation and memory footprint on accelerator-rich embedded SoCs supporting modern deep-learning dataflows while consuming less power than traditional parallel execution platforms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this work, we consider a coded caching model called \textit{hotplug coded caching}, in which some users are offline during the delivery phase. The concept of Hotplug Placement Delivery Arrays (HpPDAs) for hotplug coded caching systems has been introduced in the literature, and two classes of HpPDAs are known. In this paper, we consider a secrecy constraint in hotplug coded caching setup, where users should not learn anything about any file from their cache content, and active users should not gain any information about files other than their demanded file from either their cache content or the server transmissions. We propose two secretive schemes for the two classes of HpPDAs and compare them with a baseline scheme, which is a secretive scheme using PDAs for the classical coded caching setup and can be trivially adapted for the hotplug coded caching setup. We numerically show that our schemes outperform the baseline scheme in certain memory regions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modeling ultra-long user behavior sequences is critical for capturing both long- and short-term preferences in industrial recommender systems. Existing solutions typically rely on two-stage retrieval or indirect modeling paradigms, incuring upstream-downstream inconsistency and computational inefficiency. In this paper, we present LONGER, a Long-sequence Optimized traNsformer for GPU-Efficient Recommenders. LONGER incorporates (i) a global token mechanism for stabilizing attention over long contexts, (ii) a token merge module with lightweight InnerTransformers and hybrid attention strategy to reduce quadratic complexity, and (iii) a series of engineering optimizations, including training with mixed-precision and activation recomputation, KV cache serving, and the fully synchronous model training and serving framework for unified GPU-based dense and sparse parameter updates. LONGER consistently outperforms strong baselines in both offline metrics and online A/B testing in both advertising and e-commerce services at ByteDance, validating its consistent effectiveness and industrial-level scaling laws. Currently, LONGER has been fully deployed at more than 10 influential scenarios at ByteDance, serving billion users.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multi-turn dialogues are essential in many real-world applications of large language models, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. As conversation histories become longer, existing large language models face increasing computational and memory challenges, which hinder their ability to provide efficient and responsive interactions. Most current acceleration methods either compress the context or optimize key value caching, but they often rely on fixed or position-based heuristics that do not adapt well to the dynamic and unpredictable patterns found in actual multi-turn conversations. In this paper, we present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework for large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two main innovations. First, it performs online sparsification during the prefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the attention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value compression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient cache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/TreeAILab/Multi-turn_Long-context_Benchmark_for_LLMs}{new benchmark} with eleven multi-turn datasets that reflect realistic query positions and conversational dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoopServe consistently achieves superior effectiveness compared to existing baselines and significantly accelerates LLM inference across a wide range of long-context dialogue tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Transformer (DiT) is a crucial method for content generation. However, it needs a lot of time to sample. Many studies have attempted to use caching to reduce the time consumption of sampling. Existing caching methods accelerate generation by reusing DiT features from the previous time step and skipping calculations in the next, but they tend to locate and cache low-error modules without focusing on reducing caching-induced errors, resulting in a sharp decline in generated content quality when increasing caching intensity. To solve this problem, we propose the \textbf{E}rror-\textbf{O}ptimized \textbf{C}ache (\textbf{EOC}). This method introduces three key improvements: \textbf{(1)} Prior knowledge extraction: Extract and process the caching differences; \textbf{(2)} A judgment method for cache optimization: Determine whether certain caching steps need to be optimized; \textbf{(3)} Cache optimization: reduce caching errors. Experiments show that this algorithm significantly reduces the error accumulation caused by caching, especially excessive caching. On the ImageNet dataset, without substantially increasing the computational load, this method improves the FID of the generated images when the rule-based model FORA has a caching level of \textbf{75}\%, \textbf{50}\%, and \textbf{25}\%, and the training-based model Learning-to-cache has a caching level of \textbf{22}\%. Specifically, the FID values change from 30.454 to 21.690 (\textbf{28.8}\%), from 6.857 to 5.821 (\textbf{15.1}\%), from 3.870 to 3.692 (\textbf{4.6}\%), and from 3.539 to 3.451 (\textbf{2.5}\%) respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Feature caching has emerged as an effective strategy to accelerate diffusion transformer (DiT) sampling through temporal feature reuse. It is a challenging problem since (1) Progressive error accumulation from cached blocks significantly degrades generation quality, particularly when over 50\% of blocks are cached; (2) Current error compensation approaches neglect dynamic perturbation patterns during the caching process, leading to suboptimal error correction. To solve these problems, we propose the Gradient-Optimized Cache (GOC) with two key innovations: (1) Cached Gradient Propagation: A gradient queue dynamically computes the gradient differences between cached and recomputed features. These gradients are weighted and propagated to subsequent steps, directly compensating for the approximation errors introduced by caching. (2) Inflection-Aware Optimization: Through statistical analysis of feature variation patterns, we identify critical inflection points where the denoising trajectory changes direction. By aligning gradient updates with these detected phases, we prevent conflicting gradient directions during error correction. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet demonstrate GOC's superior trade-off between efficiency and quality. With 50\% cached blocks, GOC achieves IS 216.28 (26.3\% higher) and FID 3.907 (43\% lower) compared to baseline DiT, while maintaining identical computational costs. These improvements persist across various cache ratios, demonstrating robust adaptability to different acceleration requirements. Code is available at https://github.com/qiujx0520/GOC_ICCV2025.git.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce two multilingual, multimodal foundation language models that power Apple Intelligence features across Apple devices and services: i a 3B-parameter on-device model optimized for Apple silicon through architectural innovations such as KV-cache sharing and 2-bit quantization-aware training; and ii a scalable server model built on a novel Parallel-Track Mixture-of-Experts PT-MoE transformer that combines track parallelism, mixture-of-experts sparse computation, and interleaved global-local attention to deliver high quality with competitive cost on Apple's Private Cloud Compute platform. Both models are trained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal datasets sourced via responsible web crawling, licensed corpora, and high-quality synthetic data, then further refined with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on a new asynchronous platform. The resulting models support several additional languages while understanding images and executing tool calls. In public benchmarks and human evaluations, both the server model and the on-device model match or surpass comparably sized open baselines.   A new Swift-centric Foundation Models framework exposes guided generation, constrained tool calling, and LoRA adapter fine-tuning, allowing developers to integrate these capabilities with a few lines of code. The latest advancements in Apple Intelligence models are grounded in our Responsible AI approach with safeguards like content filtering and locale-specific evaluation, as well as our commitment to protecting our users' privacy with innovations like Private Cloud Compute.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, reliably aligning their decision-making to human preferences is essential. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer preferences from demonstrations. These preferences can then be used to produce an apprentice policy that performs well on the demonstrated task. However, in domains like autonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we need not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal guarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability guarantees can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically selecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration. We introduce PAC-EIG, an information-theoretic acquisition function that directly targets probably-approximately-correct (PAC) guarantees for the learned policy -- providing the first such theoretical guarantee for active IRL with noisy expert demonstrations. Our method maximises information gain about the regret of the apprentice policy, efficiently identifying states requiring further demonstration. We also present Reward-EIG as an alternative when learning the reward itself is the primary objective. Focusing on finite state-action spaces, we prove convergence bounds, illustrate failure modes of prior heuristic methods, and demonstrate our method's advantages experimentally.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A no-go theorem for parity-violation in even $D$-dimensional spacetimes invariant under $ISO(d)$ and dilatations (as well as the implications for odd $D$) is derived. For the case of real massless scalar and gravitons (as well as any massless even integer spin-$s$ field) at $\mathcal{I}^+$, the reality of wavefunction coefficients in Fourier space to all orders in perturbation theory (any order in loops) coming from a local, unitary, IR- and UV-finite theory, which start from the initial \CRT-invariant Bunch-Davies state in the infinite past, is proven. From this it is inferred that a parity-odd correlator with any massless scalar fields and even integer spin-$s$ fields vanishes in the presence of any number of interactions of massless fields. The same is true for correlators with an even number of conformally-coupled and massless odd integer spin-$s$ external fields, which is used to derive the cosmological analogue of Furry's theorem. The fundamental implications of \CRT symmetry for theories with chemical potentials, such as Chern-Simons and Axion inflation, is also discussed. Given the recent interest in parity-violation coming from observational claims of parity-violation detection, these results provide clear constraints on parity-violating models of inflation and establish the measurement of any parity-odd correlator as an exceptionally sensitive probe of new physics beyond vanilla inflation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex tasks like reasoning or planning, play a substantial role in many cutting-edge commercial applications, and continue to fascinate researchers across nearly all fields for their potential to accomplish expensive, complex tasks that, until recently, only humans have been trusted to do. These workflows depend critically on the prompts used to provide the roles models play in such workflows. Poorly designed prompts that fail even slightly to guide individual agents can lead to sub-optimal performance that may snowball within a system of agents, limiting their reliability and scalability. To address this important problem of inference-time prompt optimization, we introduce ProRefine, an innovative inference-time optimization method that uses an agentic loop of LLMs to generate and apply textual feedback. ProRefine dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to approach the performance of their larger counterparts. This highlights its potential for building more cost-effective and powerful hybrid AI systems, thereby democratizing access to high-performing AI.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Answer verification is crucial not only for evaluating large language models (LLMs) by matching their unstructured outputs against standard answers, but also serves as the reward model to guide LLM optimization. Most evaluation frameworks rely on regularized matching or employ general LLMs for answer verification, which demands extensive, repetitive customization for regex rules or evaluation prompts. Two fundamental limitations persist in current methodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically evaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent stage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the robustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across different domains. In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and robust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward. It demonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse reasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including multi-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively identifying abnormal/invalid responses. We introduce VerifierBench benchmark comprising model outputs collected from multiple data sources, augmented through manual analysis of metaerror patterns to enhance CompassVerifier. We anticipate that CompassVerifier and VerifierBench will facilitate answer verification, evaluation protocols, and reinforcement learning research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In most nearby galaxies, photometry of the integrated light of their globular clusters (GCs) has been obtained in only two filters, yielding just a single color index. However, NGC 4874, the brightest central galaxy in the Coma cluster, now has Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry available in ten filters, giving us a special opportunity to test SED fitting procedures on GCs in distant galaxies. We fitted 29 of the brightest GCs with a library of SEDs from E-MILES and calculated the best-fit metallicity and mass of each cluster. Using the fitted masses and luminosities derived from the reddest magnitudes, in the flat portion of the GC spectrum, we also calculated inferred mass-to-light ratios for our sample GCs; these were in the range (M/L) $\simeq 2 - 4$, slightly larger than the average values for Milky Way GCs but within the conventional range.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present Agent Lightning, a flexible and extensible framework that enables Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training of Large Language Models (LLMs) for any AI agent. Unlike existing methods that tightly couple RL training with agent or rely on sequence concatenation with masking, Agent Lightning achieves complete decoupling between agent execution and training, allowing seamless integration with existing agents developed via diverse ways (e.g., using frameworks like LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, AutoGen, and building from scratch) with almost ZERO code modifications. By formulating agent execution as Markov decision process, we define an unified data interface and propose a hierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, which contains a credit assignment module, allowing us to decompose trajectories generated by ANY agents into training transition. This enables RL to handle complex interaction logic, such as multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. For the system design, we introduce a Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture, and brings agent observability frameworks into agent runtime, providing a standardized agent finetuning interface. Experiments across text-to-SQL, retrieval-augmented generation, and math tool-use tasks demonstrate stable, continuous improvements, showcasing the framework's potential for real-world agent training and deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Gaussian Processes (GPs), as a nonparametric learning method, offer flexible modeling capabilities and calibrated uncertainty quantification for function approximations. Additionally, GPs support online learning by efficiently incorporating new data with polynomial-time computation, making them well-suited for safety-critical dynamical systems that require rapid adaptation. However, the inference and online updates of exact GPs, when processing streaming data, incur cubic computation time and quadratic storage memory complexity, limiting their scalability to large datasets in real-time settings. In this paper, we propose a streaming kernel-induced progressively generated expert framework of Gaussian processes (SkyGP) that addresses both computational and memory constraints by maintaining a bounded set of experts, while inheriting the learning performance guarantees from exact Gaussian processes. Furthermore, two SkyGP variants are introduced, each tailored to a specific objective, either maximizing prediction accuracy (SkyGP-Dense) or improving computational efficiency (SkyGP-Fast). The effectiveness of SkyGP is validated through extensive benchmarks and real-time control experiments demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Is this due to LLMs missing domain knowledge or insufficient prompt detail is given? To answer this, we introduce PartialOrderEval, which augments any code generation benchmark with a partial order of prompts from minimal to maximally detailed. Applying it to HumanEval and both serial and OpenMP subsets of ParEval, we measure how pass@1 scales with prompt specificity. Our experiments with Llama-3.x and Qwen2.5-Coder demonstrate varying degrees of prompt sensitivity across different tasks, and a qualitative analysis highlights explicit I/O specifications, edge-case handling, and stepwise breakdowns as the key drivers of prompt detail improvement.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The problem of identifying the brain regions activated through a particular cognitive task is pivotal in neuroimaging. This problem becomes even more complex if we have several cognitive tasks or several subjects. In this paper, we view this problem as a partial conjunction (PC) hypotheses testing problem, i.e., we are testing whether a specific brain region is activated in at least $\gamma$ (for some pre-fixed $\gamma$) subjects. We propose the application of a recent advance in the simultaneous statistical inference literature to activation localization in neuroimaging. We apply the recently proposed CoFilter method to neuroimaging data to discover brain regions activated in at least $\gamma$ subjects. Our proposal has two distinct advantages. First, it alleviates the conservativeness displayed by the traditional multiple testing procedures in testing PC hypotheses by eliminating many of the conservative PC $p$-values. Second, it is especially suitable for several high-dimensional studies, each of which examines a large number of null hypotheses. We also compare the performance of our proposal with existing methods for testing PC hypotheses through extensive simulation studies on neuroimaging data and a real dataset.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) struggles with domain-specific enterprise datasets, often isolated behind firewalls and rich in complex, specialized terminology unseen by LLMs during pre-training. Semantic variability across domains like medicine, networking, or law hampers RAG's context precision, while fine-tuning solutions are costly, slow, and lack generalization as new data emerges. Achieving zero-shot precision with retrievers without fine-tuning still remains a key challenge. We introduce 'MetaGen Blended RAG', a novel enterprise search approach that enhances semantic retrievers through a metadata generation pipeline and hybrid query indexes using dense and sparse vectors. By leveraging key concepts, topics, and acronyms, our method creates metadata-enriched semantic indexes and boosted hybrid queries, delivering robust, scalable performance without fine-tuning. On the biomedical PubMedQA dataset, MetaGen Blended RAG achieves 82% retrieval accuracy and 77% RAG accuracy, surpassing all prior zero-shot RAG benchmarks and even rivaling fine-tuned models on that dataset, while also excelling on datasets like SQuAD and NQ. This approach redefines enterprise search using a new approach to building semantic retrievers with unmatched generalization across specialized domains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generative models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), produce fluent outputs yet lack verifiable guarantees. We adapt Design by Contract (DbC) and type-theoretic principles to introduce a contract layer that mediates every LLM call. Contracts stipulate semantic and type requirements on inputs and outputs, coupled with probabilistic remediation to steer generation toward compliance. The layer exposes the dual view of LLMs as semantic parsers and probabilistic black-box components. Contract satisfaction is probabilistic and semantic validation is operationally defined through programmer-specified conditions on well-typed data structures. More broadly, this work postulates that any two agents satisfying the same contracts are \emph{functionally equivalent} with respect to those contracts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding a procedural activity requires modeling both how action steps transform the scene, and how evolving scene transformations can influence the sequence of action steps, even those that are accidental or erroneous. Existing work has studied procedure-aware video representations by modeling the temporal order of actions, but has not explicitly learned the state changes (scene transformations). In this work, we study procedure-aware video representation learning by incorporating state-change descriptions generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) as supervision signals for video encoders. Moreover, we generate state-change counterfactuals that simulate hypothesized failure outcomes, allowing models to learn by imagining unseen "What if" scenarios. This counterfactual reasoning facilitates the model's ability to understand the cause and effect of each step in an activity. We conduct extensive experiments on procedure-aware tasks, including temporal action segmentation, error detection, action phase classification, frame retrieval, multi-instance retrieval, and action recognition. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed state-change descriptions and their counterfactuals, and achieve significant improvements on multiple tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Motivated by the success of the IXPE mission, we elucidate what can be inferred about 3D matter structures forming about the equatorial plane of accreting compact objects from 0.1-100 keV linear polarization induced by non-relativistic large-scale reflection. We construct a model of an optically thick elevated axially symmetric reflecting medium with arbitrary ionization profile, representing the known diverse scattering environments: from thick winds and super-Eddington funnel structures formed around black holes and neutron stars, to Compton-thick dusty tori of active galactic nuclei and their broad line regions. We assume a central X-ray power-law source with an isotropic, cosine, and slab-corona emission distribution, including intrinsic polarization. The reprocessing is based on constant-density local reflection tables produced with a Monte Carlo method combined with detailed non-LTE radiative transfer, although we also show examples with classical (semi-)analytical reflection prescriptions. We conclude that varying ionization has a similarly strong impact on observed polarization as the observer's inclination and the skew and opening angle of the reflector's inner walls, altogether producing up to tens of % of reflected polarization both parallelly or perpendicularly to the projected axis, depending on the parameter values combination. After testing 3 different ad-hoc shapes of the reflector: a cone, an elliptical torus, and a bowl, we conclude that while in some configurations, their altered curvature produces more than 30% absolute difference in observed total polarization, in others, the adopted shape has a marginal impact. Lastly, we discuss the change of the observed polarization due to relaxing the optically thick assumption on equatorial winds and accreted matter, providing a continuous range of energy-dependent examples between the optically thick and thin scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Computational scientific discovery increasingly relies on algorithms to process complex data and identify meaningful patterns - yet faces persistent challenges in gravitational-wave signal identification. While existing algorithmic approaches like matched filtering (MF) and deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved partial success, their limitations directly stem from fundamental limitations: MF's excessive computational demands arise from its reliance on predefined theoretical waveform templates, while DNNs' black-box architectures obscure decision logic and introduce hidden biases. We propose Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (Evo-MCTS), a framework that addresses these limitations through systematic algorithm space exploration guided by domain-aware physical constraints. Our approach combines tree-structured search with evolutionary optimization and large language model heuristics to create interpretable algorithmic solutions. Our Evo-MCTS framework demonstrates substantial improvements, achieving a 20.2\% improvement over state-of-the-art gravitational wave detection algorithms on the MLGWSC-1 benchmark dataset. High-performing algorithm variants consistently exceed thresholds. The framework generates human-interpretable algorithmic pathways that reveal distinct performance patterns. Beyond performance improvements, our framework discovers novel algorithmic combinations, thereby establishing a transferable methodology for automated algorithmic discovery across computational science domains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding the memorization and privacy leakage risks in Contrastive Language--Image Pretraining (CLIP) is critical for ensuring the security of multimodal models. Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of extracting sensitive training examples from diffusion models, with conditional diffusion models exhibiting a stronger tendency to memorize and leak information. In this work, we investigate data memorization and extraction risks in CLIP through the lens of CLIP inversion, a process that aims to reconstruct training images from text prompts. To this end, we introduce \textbf{LeakyCLIP}, a novel attack framework designed to achieve high-quality, semantically accurate image reconstruction from CLIP embeddings. We identify three key challenges in CLIP inversion: 1) non-robust features, 2) limited visual semantics in text embeddings, and 3) low reconstruction fidelity. To address these challenges, LeakyCLIP employs 1) adversarial fine-tuning to enhance optimization smoothness, 2) linear transformation-based embedding alignment, and 3) Stable Diffusion-based refinement to improve fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of LeakyCLIP, achieving over 358% improvement in Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) for ViT-B-16 compared to baseline methods on LAION-2B subset. Furthermore, we uncover a pervasive leakage risk, showing that training data membership can even be successfully inferred from the metrics of low-fidelity reconstructions. Our work introduces a practical method for CLIP inversion while offering novel insights into the nature and scope of privacy risks in multimodal models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has significantly advanced the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it struggles to break through the inherent capability boundaries of the base LLM, due to its essentially on-policy strategy coupled with LLM's immense action space and sparse reward. Critically, RLVR can lead to the capability boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To address this problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel hybrid-policy optimization approach for LLMs that synergizes internal exploitation with external data to achieve stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base models. RL-PLUS integrates two core components, i.e., Multiple Importance Sampling to address distributional mismatch from external data, and Exploration-Based Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value, unexplored reasoning paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our approach. Compared with existing RLVR methods, RL-PLUS achieves 1) state-of-the-art performance on six math reasoning benchmarks; 2) superior performance on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks; 3) consistent and significant gains across diverse model families, with average relative improvements up to 69.2\%. Moreover, the analysis of Pass@k curves indicates that RL-PLUS effectively resolves the capability boundary collapse problem.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scientific knowledge is growing rapidly, making it difficult to track progress and high-level conceptual links across broad disciplines. While tools like citation networks and search engines help retrieve related papers, they lack the abstraction needed to capture the needed to represent the density and structure of activity across subfields.   We motivate SCIENCE HIERARCHOGRAPHY, the goal of organizing scientific literature into a high-quality hierarchical structure that spans multiple levels of abstraction -- from broad domains to specific studies. Such a representation can provide insights into which fields are well-explored and which are under-explored. To achieve this goal, we develop a hybrid approach that combines efficient embedding-based clustering with LLM-based prompting, striking a balance between scalability and semantic precision. Compared to LLM-heavy methods like iterative tree construction, our approach achieves superior quality-speed trade-offs. Our hierarchies capture different dimensions of research contributions, reflecting the interdisciplinary and multifaceted nature of modern science. We evaluate its utility by measuring how effectively an LLM-based agent can navigate the hierarchy to locate target papers. Results show that our method improves interpretability and offers an alternative pathway for exploring scientific literature beyond traditional search methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sellers at eBay are recommended keyphrases to bid on to enhance the performance of their advertising campaigns. The relevance of these keyphrases is crucial in avoiding the overcrowding of search systems with irrelevant items and maintaining a positive seller perception. It is essential that keyphrase recommendations align with both seller and Search judgments regarding auctions. Due to the difficulty in procuring negative human judgment at scale, employing LLM-as-a-judge to mimic seller judgment has been established as the norm in several studies. This study introduces a novel two-step LLM distillation process from a LLM-judge used to debias our Embedding Based Retrieval (EBR) model from the various biases that exist in click-data. We distill from an LLM teacher via a cross-encoder assistant into a bi-encoder student using a multi-task training approach, ultimately employing the student bi-encoder to retrieve relevant advertiser keyphrases. We show that integrating a knowledge distillation process from LLMs in a multi-task training setup enhances bi-encoder performance in retrieving relevant advertiser keyphrases at eBay.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Single-photon Lidar imaging offers a significant advantage in 3D imaging due to its high resolution and long-range capabilities, however it is challenging to apply in noisy environments with multiple targets per pixel. To tackle these challenges, several methods have been proposed. Statistical methods demonstrate interpretability on the inferred parameters, but they are often limited in their ability to handle complex scenes. Deep learning-based methods have shown superior performance in terms of accuracy and robustness, but they lack interpretability or they are limited to a single-peak per pixel. In this paper, we propose a deep unrolling algorithm for dual-peak single-photon Lidar imaging. We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian model for multiple targets and propose a neural network that unrolls the underlying statistical method. To support multiple targets, we adopt a dual depth maps representation and exploit geometric deep learning to extract features from the point cloud. The proposed method takes advantages of statistical methods and learning-based methods in terms of accuracy and quantifying uncertainty. The experimental results on synthetic and real data demonstrate the competitive performance when compared to existing methods, while also providing uncertainty information.

We prove that determining whether two ERA states can be merged while preserving sample consistency is an NP-complete problem, and address this with a practical SMT-based solution.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A simple device for balancing for a continuous covariate in clinical trials is to stratify by whether the covariate is above or below some target value, typically the predicted median. This raises an issue as to which model should be used for modelling the effect of treatment on the outcome variable, $Y$. Should one fit, the stratum indicator, $S$, the continuous covariate, $X$, both or neither?   This question has sometimes been investigated using simulations targeting the overall effect on inferences about treatment, in terms, for example, of power for a given alternative hypothesis. However, when a covariate is added to a linear model there are three consequences for inference: 1) the mean square error effect, 2) the variance inflation factor and 3) second order precision. We consider that it is valuable to consider these three factors separately, even if, ultimately, it is their joint effect that matters. We present some simple theory, concentrating in particular on the variance inflation factor, that may be used to guide trialists in their choice of model. We also consider the case where the precise form of the relationship between the outcome and the covariate is not known. We conclude by recommending that the continuous covariate should always be in the model but that, depending on circumstances, there may be some justification in fitting the stratum indicator also.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) tend to attend heavily to the first token in the sequence -- creating a so-called attention sink. Many works have studied this phenomenon in detail, proposing various ways to either leverage or alleviate it. Attention sinks have been connected to quantisation difficulties, security issues, and streaming attention. Yet, while many works have provided conditions in which they occur or not, a critical question remains shallowly answered: Why do LLMs learn such patterns and how are they being used? In this work, we argue theoretically and empirically that this mechanism provides a method for LLMs to avoid over-mixing, connecting this to existing lines of work that study mathematically how information propagates in Transformers. We conduct experiments to validate our theoretical intuitions and show how choices such as context length, depth, and data packing influence the sink behaviour. We hope that this study provides a new practical perspective on why attention sinks are useful in LLMs, leading to a better understanding of the attention patterns that form during training.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the advancement of code generation capabilities in large language models (LLMs), their reliance on input premises has intensified. When users provide inputs containing faulty premises, the probability of code generation hallucinations rises significantly, exposing deficiencies in their self-scrutiny capabilities. This paper proposes Faulty Premises Bench (FPBench), the first code generation evaluation framework targeting faulty premises. By systematically constructing three categories of faulty premises and integrating multi-dimensional evaluation metrics, it conducts in-depth assessments of 15 representative LLMs. The key findings are as follows: (1) Most models exhibit poor reasoning abilities and suboptimal code generation performance under faulty premises, heavily relying on explicit prompts for error detection, with limited self-scrutiny capabilities; (2) Faulty premises trigger a point of diminishing returns in resource investment, leading to blindly increasing length fails to enhance quality; (3) The three types of faulty premises respectively activate distinct defect patterns in models, revealing a triple dissociation in the cognitive mechanisms of code generation models. This study not only highlights the urgent need for LLMs to proactively verify premises in code generation but also, through the proposed FPBench framework and multi-dimensional evaluation system, provides a theoretical foundation and practical pathway for developing reliable, human-centric code generation models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We investigate serval models for two scalar fields in one space dimension with topologically stable solitons that are constructed from BPS equations. The asymptotic behavior of these solitons fully determines their classical energies. A particular feature of the considered mode ls is that there are several translationally invariant ground states that we call primary and secondary vacua. The former are those that ar e asymptotically assumed by the solitons. Solitons that occupy a secondary vacuum in finite but eventually large portions of space are clas sically degenerate. hus the quantum contributions to the energies are decisive for the energetically favored soliton. While some of these s olitons were constructed previously, we, for the first time, compute the leading (one-loop) quantum contribution their energies. In all ca ses considered we find that this contribution is not bounded from below and that it is the more negative the larger the region is in which the soliton approaches a secondary vacuum. This corroborates the conjecture, earlier inferred from the Shifman-Voloshin soliton, that the a vailability of secondary vacua destabilizes these solitons on the quantum level.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Unified Cognitive Consciousness Theory} (UCCT) casts them instead as vast unconscious pattern repositories: apparent reasoning arises only when external anchoring mechanisms, few shot prompts, retrieval-augmented context, fine-tuning, or multi-agent debate, activate task-relevant patterns. UCCT formalizes this process as Bayesian competition between statistical priors learned in pre-training and context-driven target patterns, yielding a single quantitative account that unifies existing adaptation techniques. We ground the theory in three principles: threshold crossing, modality universality, and density-distance predictive power, and validate them with (i) cross-domain demonstrations (text QA, image captioning, multi-agent debate) and (ii) two depth-oriented experiments: a controlled numeral-base study (bases 8, 9, 10) that isolates pattern-density effects, and a layer-wise trajectory analysis that reveals phase transitions inside a 7B-parameter model. Both experiments confirm UCCT's predictions of threshold behavior, asymmetric interference, and memory hysteresis. By showing that LLM ``intelligence'' is created through semantic anchoring rather than contained within the model, UCCT offers a principled foundation for interpretable diagnostics and practical guidance for prompt engineering, model selection, and alignment-centric system design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion models, which iteratively denoise data samples to synthesize high-quality outputs, have achieved empirical success across domains. However, optimizing these models for downstream tasks often involves nested bilevel structures, such as tuning hyperparameters for fine-tuning tasks or noise schedules in training dynamics, where traditional bilevel methods fail due to the infinite-dimensional probability space and prohibitive sampling costs. We formalize this challenge as a generative bilevel optimization problem and address two key scenarios: (1) fine-tuning pre-trained models via an inference-only lower-level solver paired with a sample-efficient gradient estimator for the upper level, and (2) training diffusion model from scratch with noise schedule optimization by reparameterizing the lower-level problem and designing a computationally tractable gradient estimator. Our first-order bilevel framework overcomes the incompatibility of conventional bilevel methods with diffusion processes, offering theoretical grounding and computational practicality. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing fine-tuning and hyperparameter search baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents Block, a distributed scheduling framework designed to optimize load balancing and auto-provisioning across instances in large language model serving frameworks by leveraging contextual information from incoming requests. Unlike popular model serving systems that rely on monolithic and heuristic task schedulers, Block operates as a fully distributed, stateless, and predictive scheduling system to achieve low overhead, reliability, and scalability. It leverages the deterministic and predictable characteristics of LLM inferences, such as host configurations, response lengths, and hardware performance, to make scheduling decisions based on accurately predicted metrics. Evaluation on a 12 GPUs cluster shows that Block significantly outperforms heuristic schedulers, boosting serving capacity by up to 16.7\% and reducing P99 tail latency by up to 49.5\%. These performance gains remain consistent across diverse models, workloads and configurations. Code and data are open-sourced.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generation-based fuzzing produces appropriate testing cases according to specifications of input grammars and semantic constraints to test systems and software. However, these specifications require significant manual efforts to construct. This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large Language Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based fuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over fuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels the synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance. Compared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of real-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2) synthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared ELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized by state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more coverage and triggers up to 174.0% more artificially injected bugs. We also used ELFuzz to conduct a real-world fuzzing campaign on the newest version of cvc5 for 14 days, and encouragingly, it found five 0-day bugs (three are exploitable). Moreover, we conducted an ablation study, which shows that the fuzzer space model, the key component of ELFuzz, contributes the most (up to 62.5%) to the effectiveness of ELFuzz. Further analysis of the fuzzers synthesized by ELFuzz confirms that they catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. The results present the promising potential of ELFuzz for more automated, efficient, and extensible input generation for fuzzing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex domains such as logical reasoning and experimental coding. Motivated by these advancements, numerous studies have explored the application of AI in the innovation process, particularly in the context of scientific research. These AI technologies primarily aim to develop systems that can autonomously conduct research processes across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Despite these significant strides, a comprehensive survey on AI for Research (AI4Research) remains absent, which hampers our understanding and impedes further development in this field. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive survey and offer a unified perspective on AI4Research. Specifically, the main contributions of our work are as follows: (1) Systematic taxonomy: We first introduce a systematic taxonomy to classify five mainstream tasks in AI4Research. (2) New frontiers: Then, we identify key research gaps and highlight promising future directions, focusing on the rigor and scalability of automated experiments, as well as the societal impact. (3) Abundant applications and resources: Finally, we compile a wealth of resources, including relevant multidisciplinary applications, data corpora, and tools. We hope our work will provide the research community with quick access to these resources and stimulate innovative breakthroughs in AI4Research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Existing LLM-based compiler fuzzers often produce syntactically or semantically invalid test programs, limiting their effectiveness in exercising compiler optimizations and backend components. We introduce ReFuzzer, a framework for refining LLM-generated test programs by systematically detecting and correcting compilation and runtime violations (e.g. division by zero or array out-of-bounds accesses). ReFuzzer employs a feedback loop with a local LLM to validate and filter erroneous programs before execution, improving fuzzing effectiveness beyond crash detection and enabling the generation of diverse yet valid test programs.   We evaluated ReFuzzer's effectiveness across black-, grey- and white-box fuzzing approaches targeting LLVM/Clang. ReFuzzer improved test programs' validity from 47.0-49.4% to 96.6-97.3%, with an average processing time of 2.9-3.5 s per test program on a dual-GPU machine. Further, refuzzing significantly increased code coverage in critical optimization and IR generation components. For example, vectorization coverage had an absolute improvement of 9.2%, 2.3%, and 7.1% in black-, grey-, and white-box fuzzing, enhancing testing effectiveness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in object detection rely on modular architectures with multi-scale fusion and attention mechanisms. However, static fusion heuristics and class-agnostic attention limit performance in dynamic scenes with occlusions, clutter, and class imbalance. We introduce Dynamic Class-Aware Fusion Network (DyCAF-Net) that addresses these challenges through three innovations: (1) an input-conditioned equilibrium-based neck that iteratively refines multi-scale features via implicit fixed-point modeling, (2) a dual dynamic attention mechanism that adaptively recalibrates channel and spatial responses using input- and class-dependent cues, and (3) class-aware feature adaptation that modulates features to prioritize discriminative regions for rare classes. Through comprehensive ablation studies with YOLOv8 and related architectures, alongside benchmarking against nine state-of-the-art baselines, DyCAF-Net achieves significant improvements in precision, mAP@50, and mAP@50-95 across 13 diverse benchmarks, including occlusion-heavy and long-tailed datasets. The framework maintains computational efficiency ($\sim$11.1M parameters) and competitive inference speeds, while its adaptability to scale variance, semantic overlaps, and class imbalance positions it as a robust solution for real-world detection tasks in medical imaging, surveillance, and autonomous systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Applying machine learning to real-world medical data, e.g. from hospital archives, has the potential to revolutionize disease detection in brain images. However, detecting pathology in such heterogeneous cohorts is a difficult challenge. Normative modeling, a form of unsupervised anomaly detection, offers a promising approach to studying such cohorts where the ``normal'' behavior is modeled and can be used at subject level to detect deviations relating to disease pathology. Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for anomaly detection due to their ability to capture complex data distributions and generate high-quality images. Their performance relies on image restoration; differences between the original and restored images highlight potential abnormalities. However, unlike normative models, these diffusion model approaches do not incorporate clinical information which provides important context to guide the disease detection process. Furthermore, standard approaches often poorly restore healthy regions, resulting in poor reconstructions and suboptimal detection performance. We present CADD, the first conditional diffusion model for normative modeling in 3D images. To guide the healthy restoration process, we propose a novel inference inpainting strategy which balances anomaly removal with retention of subject-specific features. Evaluated on three challenging datasets, including clinical scans, which may have lower contrast, thicker slices, and motion artifacts, CADD achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting neurological abnormalities in heterogeneous cohorts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurate crop yield forecasting is essential for global food security. However, current AI models systematically underperform when yields deviate from historical trends. This issue arises from key data challenges, including a major asymmetry between rich pretraining weather datasets and the limited data available for fine-tuning. We introduce VITA (Variational Inference Transformer for Asymmetric data), a variational pretraining framework that addresses this asymmetry. Instead of relying on input reconstruction, VITA uses detailed weather variables as proxy targets during pretraining and learns to predict rich atmospheric states through self-supervised feature masking. This allows the model to be fine-tuned using only basic weather statistics during deployment. Applied to 763 counties in the U.S. Corn Belt, VITA achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting corn and soybean yields across all evaluation scenarios. While it consistently delivers superior performance under normal conditions, its advantages are particularly pronounced during extreme weather years, with statistically significant improvements (paired t-test, $p \approx 0.01$). Importantly, VITA outperforms prior frameworks like GNN-RNN using less data, making it more practical for real-world use--particularly in data-scarce regions. This work highlights how domain-aware AI design can overcome data limitations and support resilient agricultural forecasting in a changing climate.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing adoption of web crawling opt-outs by copyright holders of online content raises critical questions about the impact of data compliance on large language model (LLM) performance. However, little is known about how these restrictions (and the resultant filtering of pretraining datasets) affect the capabilities of models trained using these corpora. In this work, we conceptualize this effect as the $\textit{data compliance gap}$ (DCG), which quantifies the performance difference between models trained on datasets that comply with web crawling opt-outs, and those that do not. We measure the data compliance gap in two settings: pretraining models from scratch and continual pretraining from existing compliant models (simulating a setting where copyrighted data could be integrated later in pretraining). Our experiments with 1.5B models show that, as of January 2025, compliance with web data opt-outs does not degrade general knowledge acquisition (close to 0\% DCG). However, in specialized domains such as biomedical research, excluding major publishers leads to performance declines. These findings suggest that while general-purpose LLMs can be trained to perform equally well using fully open data, performance in specialized domains may benefit from access to high-quality copyrighted sources later in training. Our study provides empirical insights into the long-debated trade-off between data compliance and downstream model performance, informing future discussions on AI training practices and policy decisions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Lifelogging refers to the process of passively collecting, storing, and analysing personal daily life data using wearable devices. This data can support applications in memory preservation and enhancement. For example, using an ask-and-answer strategy, question-answering (QA) on lifelog data opens an interactive and interesting way to explore memorable events and insights into daily life. However, research resources for QA on lifelog data are limited to small-sized or synthetic QA datasets. In this paper, we present a novel lifelog QA dataset called OpenLifelogQA, building upon an 18-month lifelog dataset. Our dataset focuses on an open-ended and practical QA with real-world application in daily lifelog usage. We construct 14,187 pairs of Q&A with diverse types and difficulty levels. A baseline experiment is reported for this dataset with competitive average performance of 89.7% BERT Score, 25.87% ROUGE-L and 3.9665 LLM Score from LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave 7B model. We release this Q&A dataset to the research community to support new research into lifelog technologies, such as enabling personal chat-based assistants for lifelog data to become a reality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Radar-based human pose estimation (HPE) provides a privacy-preserving, illumination-invariant sensing modality but is challenged by noisy, multipath-affected measurements. We introduce RadProPoser, a probabilistic encoder-decoder architecture that processes complex-valued radar tensors from a compact 3-transmitter, 4-receiver MIMO radar. By incorporating variational inference into keypoint regression, RadProPoser jointly predicts 26 three-dimensional joint locations alongside heteroscedastic aleatoric uncertainties and can be recalibrated to predict total uncertainty. We explore different probabilistic formulations using both Gaussian and Laplace distributions for latent priors and likelihoods. On our newly released dataset with optical motion-capture ground truth, RadProPoser achieves an overall mean per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 6.425 cm, with 5.678 cm at the 45 degree aspect angle. The learned uncertainties exhibit strong alignment with actual pose errors and can be calibrated to produce reliable prediction intervals, with our best configuration achieving an expected calibration error of 0.021. As an additional demonstration, sampling from these latent distributions enables effective data augmentation for downstream activity classification, resulting in an F1 score of 0.870. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end radar tensor-based HPE system to explicitly model and quantify per-joint uncertainty from raw radar tensor data, establishing a foundation for explainable and reliable human motion analysis in radar applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from performance degradation when faced with domain shifts, primarily due to catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose KILO (Knowledge-Instructed Learning for Continual Adaptation), a novel continual learning framework that integrates dynamic knowledge graphs with instruction tuning. By leveraging retrieved domain-specific knowledge as guidance during training, KILO enhances both adaptability to new domains and retention of previously acquired knowledge. We pretrain our model on WikiText-103 and evaluate sequential adaptation across four diverse target domains: BioASQ, SciQ, TweetEval, and MIND. Our experiments demonstrate that KILO consistently outperforms strong baselines, including continual fine-tuning, ERNIE 2.0, and CPT, in terms of backward transfer, forward transfer, F1 score, retention rate, and training efficiency. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining structured knowledge retrieval and instruction prompting to overcome domain shift challenges in continual learning scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) systems face a common dilemma: autoregressive (AR) models suffer from slow generation and lack duration controllability, while non-autoregressive (NAR) models lack temporal modeling and typically require complex designs. In this paper, we introduce a novel pseudo-autoregressive (PAR) codec language modeling approach that unifies AR and NAR modeling. Combining explicit temporal modeling from AR with parallel generation from NAR, PAR generates dynamic-length spans at fixed time steps. Building on PAR, we propose PALLE, a two-stage TTS system that leverages PAR for initial generation followed by NAR refinement. In the first stage, PAR progressively generates speech tokens along the time dimension, with each step predicting all positions in parallel but only retaining the left-most span. In the second stage, low-confidence tokens are iteratively refined in parallel, leveraging the global contextual information. Experiments demonstrate that PALLE, trained on LibriTTS, outperforms state-of-the-art systems trained on large-scale data, including F5-TTS, E2-TTS, and MaskGCT, on the LibriSpeech test-clean set in terms of speech quality, speaker similarity, and intelligibility, while achieving up to ten times faster inference speed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In today's rapidly evolving field of electronic design automation (EDA), the complexity of hardware designs is increasing, necessitating more sophisticated automation solutions. High-level synthesis (HLS), as a pivotal solution, automates hardware designs from high-level abstractions (e.g., C/C++). However, it faces significant challenges, particularly in design space exploration and optimization. While large language models (LLMs) have shown notable capabilities in code generation, their application to HLS has been limited due to the scarcity of (publicly) available HLS code datasets. Hence, research in this domain has primarily focused on techniques such as prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces SAGE-HLS, the first-of-its-kind fine-tuned LLM specifically for HLS code generation. Our method includes three key advancements: (i) We implement Verilog-to-C/C++ porting, converting verified and synthesizable Verilog codes into corresponding C, creating a dataset of 16.7K HLS codes; (ii) We implement a fine-tuning strategy, which is based on instruction prompting to code generation guided by abstract syntax tree (AST); (iii) We develop a semi-automated evaluation framework using VerilogEval to assess the functionality of the generated HLS code. Our experiments show that SAGE-HLS, fined-tuned on the QwenCoder (2.5) 7B model, achieves a near 100% success rate in code synthesizability and a 75% success rate in functional correctness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Process Reward Model (PRM) is widely used in the post-training of Large Language Model (LLM) because it can perform fine-grained evaluation of the reasoning steps of generated content. However, most PRMs lack long-term reasoning and deep thinking capabilities. On the other hand, although a few works have tried to introduce Chain-of-Thought capability into PRMs, the annotation cost of CoT-PRM data is too expensive to play a stable role in various tasks. To address the above challenges, we propose VRPRM, a process reward model via visual reasoning, and design an efficient two-stage training strategy. Experimental results show that using only 3.6K CoT-PRM SFT data and 50K non-CoT PRM RL training data, VRPRM can surpass the non-thinking PRM with a total data volume of 400K and achieved a relative performance improvement of up to 118\% over the base model in the BoN experiment. This result confirms that the proposed combined training strategy can achieve higher quality reasoning capabilities at a lower data annotation cost, thus providing a new paradigm for PRM training with more efficient data utilization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to address hallucination issues in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the integration of multiple retrieval sources, while potentially more informative, introduces new challenges that can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination problems. These challenges manifest primarily in two aspects: the sparse distribution of multi-source data that hinders the capture of logical relationships and the inherent inconsistencies among different sources that lead to information conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose MultiRAG, a novel framework designed to mitigate hallucination in multi-source retrieval-augmented generation through knowledge-guided approaches. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a knowledge construction module that employs multi-source line graphs to efficiently aggregate logical relationships across different knowledge sources, effectively addressing the sparse data distribution issue; and (2) a sophisticated retrieval module that implements a multi-level confidence calculation mechanism, performing both graph-level and node-level assessments to identify and eliminate unreliable information nodes, thereby reducing hallucinations caused by inter-source inconsistencies. Extensive experiments on four multi-domain query datasets and two multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that MultiRAG significantly enhances the reliability and efficiency of knowledge retrieval in complex multi-source scenarios. \textcolor{blue}{Our code is available in https://github.com/wuwenlong123/MultiRAG.

In this work, motivated by preliminary findings that middle-to-upper layers encode semantically and taskrelevant representations that are often more aligned with human judgments than the final layer, we propose LAGER, a lightweight and efficient framework for enhancing LLM-as-a-Judge alignment with human scoring, via internal representations. LAGER produces fine-grained judgment scores by aggregating cross-layer scoretoken logits and computing the expected score from a softmax-based distribution, with the LLM backbone kept frozen. LAGER fully leverages the complementary information across different layers, overcoming the limitations of relying solely on the final layer. We evaluate our method on the standard alignment benchmarks Flask, HelpSteer, and BIGGen using Spearman correlation, and find that LAGER achieves improvements of up to 7.5% over the best baseline across these benchmarks. Without reasoning steps, LAGER matches or outperforms reasoning-based methods. Experiments on downstream applications, such as data selection and emotional understanding, further show the effectiveness of our method.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic generation of step-by-step augmented reality (AR) instructions for a wide range of physical tasks. However, existing LLM-based AR guidance often lacks rich visual augmentations to effectively embed instructions into spatial context for a better user understanding. We present Guided Reality, a fully automated AR system that generates embedded and dynamic visual guidance based on step-by-step instructions. Our system integrates LLMs and vision models to: 1) generate multi-step instructions from user queries, 2) identify appropriate types of visual guidance, 3) extract spatial information about key interaction points in the real world, and 4) embed visual guidance in physical space to support task execution. Drawing from a corpus of user manuals, we define five categories of visual guidance and propose an identification strategy based on the current step. We evaluate the system through a user study (N=16), completing real-world tasks and exploring the system in the wild. Additionally, four instructors shared insights on how Guided Reality could be integrated into their training workflows.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive multilingual capabilities through pretraining on diverse corpora. Although these models show strong reasoning abilities, their performance varies significantly between languages due to the imbalanced distribution of training data. Existing approaches using sample-level translation for extensive multilingual pretraining and cross-lingual tuning face scalability challenges and often fail to capture nuanced reasoning processes across languages. In this paper, we introduce AdaMCOT (Adaptive Multilingual Chain-of-Thought), a framework that enhances multilingual factual reasoning by dynamically routing thought processes in intermediary "thinking languages" before generating target-language responses. AdaMCOT leverages a language-agnostic core and incorporates an adaptive, reward-based mechanism for selecting optimal reasoning pathways without requiring additional pretraining. Our comprehensive evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates substantial improvements in both factual reasoning quality and cross-lingual consistency, with particularly strong performance gains in low-resource language settings. An in-depth analysis of the model's hidden states and semantic space further elucidates the underlying mechanism of our method. The results suggest that adaptive reasoning paths can effectively bridge the performance gap between high and low-resource languages while maintaining cultural and linguistic nuances.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text-to-speech (TTS) has shown great progress in recent years. However, most existing TTS systems offer only coarse and rigid emotion control, typically via discrete emotion labels or a carefully crafted and detailed emotional text prompt, making fine-grained emotion manipulation either inaccessible or unstable. These models also require extensive, high-quality datasets for training. To address these limitations, we propose EmoSteer-TTS, a novel training-free approach, to achieve fine-grained speech emotion control (conversion, interpolation, erasure) by activation steering. We first empirically observe that modifying a subset of the internal activations within a flow matching-based TTS model can effectively alter the emotional tone of synthesized speech. Building on this insight, we then develop a training-free and efficient algorithm, including activation extraction, emotional token searching, and inference-time steering, which can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of pretrained models (e.g., F5-TTS, CosyVoice2, and E2-TTS). In addition, to derive effective steering vectors, we construct a curated emotional speech dataset with diverse speakers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EmoSteer-TTS enables fine-grained, interpretable, and continuous control over speech emotion, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that achieves training-free and continuous fine-grained emotion control in TTS.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Effectively adapting powerful pretrained foundation models to diverse tasks remains a key challenge in AI deployment. Current approaches primarily follow two paradigms:discrete optimization of text prompts through prompt engineering, or continuous adaptation via additional trainable parameters. Both exhibit limitations-discrete methods lack refinement precision while parameter-based techniques increase complexity and reduce interpretability. To address these constraints, we propose EmbedGrad, a novel framework that optimizes text prompt embeddings through gradient-based refinement. Our approach uniquely decouples training from deployment:during optimization,labeled examples guide precise embedding adjustments while preserving semantic meaning; during inference, only optimized embeddings integrate with user queries. This enables fine-grained calibration impossible in text space, such as enhancing the reasoning capability of prompts like please reason step by step. Comprehensive evaluations across mathematical reasoning, sentiment analysis, and causal judgment tasks demonstrate EmbedGrad's effectiveness:optimizing this reasoning prompt for Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B increased accuracy from 14.74\% to 58.96\% on mathematical problems. Consistent improvements were observed across model scales (0.5B-14B) and all tasks, with particularly significant gains for smaller models on complex problems like causal judgment. By bridging prompt engineering and parameter efficiency without architectural changes, our work establishes embedding refinement as a powerful new paradigm for task adaptation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is essential for reducing the computational overhead of large language models (LLMs). Low-rank family adapters are commonly used to control the parameter size efficiently while maintaining the generative power of LLMs. However, their limited expressiveness due to the rank constraint often restricts their performance on complex tasks. We propose Mixture of Kronecker Adapters (MoKA), a new generation of Kronecker adapters that addresses this limitation by modeling weight updates as a mixture of Kronecker products. Our proposed adapter leverages a gating mechanism that measures the importance of each Kronecker factor, enabling more expressive adaptation. Moreover, MoKA enables a rank flexibility that provides a better trade-off between parameter efficiency and accuracy. To ensure hardware efficiency, we reformulate Kronecker computations using standard matrix operations, allowing seamless deployment on GPU-optimized hardware. We conduct extensive experiments on instruction-tuning and commonsense reasoning tasks using low-bit quantized versions of LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA3-8B models. MoKA not only outperforms PEFT baselines, but also reduces the number of trainable parameters up to 27x, achieving state-of-the-art trade-offs between performance and parameter efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite the impressive performance of LLMs on English-based tasks, little is known about their capabilities in specific languages such as Filipino. In this work, we address this gap by introducing FilBench, a Filipino-centric benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs across a diverse set of tasks and capabilities in Filipino, Tagalog, and Cebuano. We carefully curate the tasks in FilBench to reflect the priorities and trends of NLP research in the Philippines such as Cultural Knowledge, Classical NLP, Reading Comprehension, and Generation. By evaluating 27 state-of-the-art LLMs on FilBench, we find that several LLMs suffer from reading comprehension and translation capabilities. Our results indicate that FilBench is challenging, with the best model, GPT-4o, achieving only a score of 72.23%. Moreover, we also find that models trained specifically for Southeast Asian languages tend to underperform on FilBench, with the highest-performing model, SEA-LION v3 70B, achieving only a score of 61.07%. Our work demonstrates the value of curating language-specific LLM benchmarks to aid in driving progress on Filipino NLP and increasing the inclusion of Philippine languages in LLM development.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present CLUMI+, a self-consistent, multiprobe methodology for reconstructing the mass distribution in and around galaxy clusters by combining gravitational lensing and dynamical observations. Building on the joint likelihood framework of K. Umetsu (2013), CLUMI+ integrates weak-lensing shear and magnification data with projected escape velocity measurements in the cluster infall region, yielding tighter constraints on the gravitational potential without relying on equilibrium assumptions. The mass distribution is modeled using a flexible, piecewise-defined convergence profile that characterizes the azimuthally averaged surface mass density within the lensing field, transitioning to a projected power-law form at larger radii where phase-space constraints complement lensing. Additional strong-lensing constraints are incorporated via central aperture-mass measurements, enabling full-scale mass reconstruction from the cluster core to the outskirts. We validate CLUMI+ using synthetic weak-lensing and phase-space data for a massive cluster from the IllustrisTNG simulations, demonstrating unbiased recovery of projected and three-dimensional mass profiles and achieving 10%--30% improvement in precision at large radii. As a case study, we apply CLUMI+ to A2261, combining Subaru and Hubble Space Telescope weak+strong lensing data with spectroscopic measurements from the Hectospec Cluster Survey. This analysis demonstrates the power of multiprobe, equilibrium-free modeling for robust cluster mass reconstruction.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) framework has become a widely used approach for multimodal representation learning, particularly in image-text retrieval and clustering. However, its efficacy is constrained by three key limitations: (1) text token truncation, (2) isolated image-text encoding, and (3) deficient compositionality due to bag-of-words behavior. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances in generalized vision-language understanding, their potential for learning transferable multimodal representations remains underexplored.In this work, we present UniME (Universal Multimodal Embedding), a novel two-stage framework that leverages MLLMs to learn discriminative representations for diverse downstream tasks. In the first stage, we perform textual discriminative knowledge distillation from a powerful LLM-based teacher model to enhance the embedding capability of the MLLM\'s language component. In the second stage, we introduce hard negative enhanced instruction tuning to further advance discriminative representation learning. Specifically, we initially mitigate false negative contamination and then sample multiple hard negatives per instance within each batch, forcing the model to focus on challenging samples. This approach not only improves discriminative power but also enhances instruction-following ability in downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and multiple retrieval tasks, including short and long caption retrieval and compositional retrieval. Results demonstrate that UniME achieves consistent performance improvement across all tasks, exhibiting superior discriminative and compositional capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Research on applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Large Language Models (LLMs) has mostly been focused on single-turn problems, such as mathematical reasoning or single-shot code generation. While these problems can be viewed as token-level multi-turn MDPs, this view corresponds to a degenerate case of multi-turn interaction where the environment provides no feedback. This contrasts with many real-world domains, such as software engineering (SWE), which require rich multi-turn interactions with a stateful environment that responds to each action with a non-trivial observation.   To bridge this gap, we demonstrate the successful application of RL to this general regime. Using a modified Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO) algorithm, we train an agent based on Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to solve real-world software engineering tasks. Our approach increases the agent's success rate on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark from a 20% rejection fine-tuned baseline to 39%, without relying on any teacher models. On SWE-rebench, our agent matches or outperforms leading open-weight models such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Qwen3-235B-A22B using an identical scaffolding, offering a viable path toward building more capable autonomous agents for complex real-world problems based on open models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to perform explicit multi-step reasoning such as chain-of-thought prompting. However, their intermediate steps often contain errors that can propagate leading to inaccurate final predictions. Additionally, LLMs still struggle with hallucinations and often fail to adhere to prescribed output formats, which is particularly problematic for tasks like generating mathematical expressions or source code. This work introduces EDCIM (Error Detection and Correction for Interpretable Mathematics), a method for detecting and correcting these errors in interpretable mathematics tasks, where the model must generate the exact functional form that explicitly solve the problem (expressed in natural language) rather than a black-box solution. EDCIM uses LLMs to generate a system of equations for a given problem, followed by a symbolic error-detection framework that identifies errors and provides targeted feedback for LLM-based correction. To optimize efficiency, EDCIM integrates lightweight, open-source LLMs with more powerful proprietary models, balancing cost and accuracy. This balance is controlled by a single hyperparameter, allowing users to control the trade-off based on their cost and accuracy requirements. Experimental results across different datasets show that EDCIM significantly reduces both computational and financial costs, while maintaining, and even improving, prediction accuracy when the balance is properly configured.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Product sustainability reports provide valuable insights into the environmental impacts of a product and are often distributed in PDF format. These reports often include a combination of tables and text, which complicates their analysis. The lack of standardization and the variability in reporting formats further exacerbate the difficulty of extracting and interpreting relevant information from large volumes of documents. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of answering questions related to carbon footprints within sustainability reports available in PDF format. Unlike previous approaches, our focus is on addressing the difficulties posed by the unstructured and inconsistent nature of text extracted from PDF parsing. To facilitate this analysis, we introduce CarbonPDF-QA, an open-source dataset containing question-answer pairs for 1735 product report documents, along with human-annotated answers. Our analysis shows that GPT-4o struggles to answer questions with data inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we propose CarbonPDF, an LLM-based technique specifically designed to answer carbon footprint questions on such datasets. We develop CarbonPDF by fine-tuning Llama 3 with our training data. Our results show that our technique outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques, including question-answering (QA) systems finetuned on table and text data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) plays a crucial role in various vision tasks such as person retrieval and identification. Most existing attribute-based retrieval methods operate under the closed-set assumption that all attribute classes are consistently available during both training and inference. However, this assumption limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where novel attributes may emerge. Moreover, predefined attributes in benchmark datasets are often generic and shared across individuals, making them less discriminative for retrieving the target person. To address these challenges, we propose the Open-Attribute Recognition for Person Retrieval (OAPR) task, which aims to retrieve individuals based on attribute cues, regardless of whether those attributes were seen during training. To support this task, we introduce a novel framework designed to learn generalizable body part representations that cover a broad range of attribute categories. Furthermore, we reconstruct four widely used datasets for open-attribute recognition. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate the necessity of the OAPR task and the effectiveness of our framework. The source code and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As enterprise codebases continue to grow in scale and complexity, the volume of lint errors far exceeds engineers' manual remediation capacity, leading to continuous accumulation of technical debt and hindered development efficiency. This paper presents BitsAI-Fix, an automated lint error remediation workflow based on Large Language Models (LLMs), designed to address this critical challenge in industrial-scale environments. BitsAI-Fix employs tree-sitter for context expansion and generates search-and-replace format patches through specially trained LLMs, followed by lint scan re-verification to output final remediation results. Additionally, our approach introduces an innovative progressive reinforcement learning (RL) training strategy that can automatically acquire verifiable training data during the project cold-start phase and continuously iterate the model by collecting online samples through feedback after system deployment. Furthermore, we designed a targeted rule-based reward mechanism that combines format rewards and correctness rewards while penalizing redundant modifications. We also propose a "code diff matching" methodology to continuously track online effectiveness. In production deployment at ByteDance, our solution has supported over 5,000 engineers, resolved more than 12,000 static analysis issues, achieved approximately 85% remediation accuracy, with around 1,000 weekly active adopters. This work demonstrates the practical feasibility of LLM-based code remediation solutions in enterprise environments and serves as a reference for automated code fix in large-scale industrial scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved impressive performance in text-to-image generation. However, their high computational cost and large parameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained scenarios. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce memory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from severe performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. We identify two key obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model weights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform quantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors; (2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated values, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in specific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these issues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate PTQ framework. We introduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that aligns well with the weight distribution and reduces quantization errors. We also propose an Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or outlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating the impact of both types of outliers. We evaluate LRQ-DiT on PixArt and FLUX under various bit-width settings, and validate the performance on COCO, MJHQ, and sDCI datasets. LRQ-DiT achieves low-bit quantization of DiT models while preserving image quality, outperforming existing PTQ baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As smart homes become increasingly prevalent, intelligent models are widely used for tasks such as anomaly detection and behavior prediction. These models are typically trained on static datasets, making them brittle to behavioral drift caused by seasonal changes, lifestyle shifts, or evolving routines. However, collecting new behavior data for retraining is often impractical due to its slow pace, high cost, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose SmartGen, an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior data to support continual adaptation of downstream smart home models. SmartGen consists of four key components. First, we design a Time and Semantic-aware Split module to divide long behavior sequences into manageable, semantically coherent subsequences under dual time-span constraints. Second, we propose Semantic-aware Sequence Compression to reduce input length while preserving representative semantics by clustering behavior mapping in latent space. Third, we introduce Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, which constructs a behavior relationship graph and encodes frequent transitions into prompts, guiding the LLM to generate data aligned with contextual changes while retaining core behavior patterns. Finally, we design a Two-stage Outlier Filter to identify and remove implausible or semantically inconsistent outputs, aiming to improve the factual coherence and behavioral validity of the generated sequences. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartGen significantly enhances model performance on anomaly detection and behavior prediction tasks under behavioral drift, with anomaly detection improving by 85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51% on average.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Various Deep Learning-based approaches with pre-trained language models have been proposed for automatically repairing software vulnerabilities. However, these approaches are limited to a specific programming language (C/C++). Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer language-agnostic capabilities and strong semantic understanding, exhibiting potential to overcome multilingual vulnerability limitations. Although some work has begun to explore LLMs' repair performance, their effectiveness is unsatisfactory. To address these limitations, we conducted a large-scale empirical study to investigate the performance of automated vulnerability repair approaches and state-of-the-art LLMs across seven programming languages. Results show GPT-4o, instruction-tuned with few-shot prompting, performs competitively against the leading approach, VulMaster. Additionally, the LLM-based approach shows superior performance in repairing unique vulnerabilities and is more likely to repair the most dangerous vulnerabilities. Instruction-tuned GPT-4o demonstrates strong generalization on vulnerabilities in previously unseen language, outperforming existing approaches. Analysis shows Go consistently achieves the highest effectiveness across all model types, while C/C++ performs the worst. Based on findings, we discuss the promise of LLM on multilingual vulnerability repair and the reasons behind LLM's failed cases. This work takes the first look at repair approaches and LLMs across multiple languages, highlighting the promising future of adopting LLMs for multilingual vulnerability repair.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant progress across multiple domains. However, these models still face the inherent challenge of integrating vision and language for collaborative inference, which often leads to "hallucinations", outputs that are not grounded in the corresponding images. Many efforts have been made to address these issues, but each comes with its own limitations, such as high computational cost or expensive dataset annotation. Recent research shows that LVLMs exhibit a long-term bias where hallucinations increase as the sequence length grows, yet the underlying cause remains poorly understood. Building on extensive research into attention mechanisms in LVLMs, we analyze the relationship between this long-term bias and visual attention. In our research, we identify a consistent phenomenon in current LVLMs: the model's attention to visual input diminishes as the generated sequence grows, which we hypothesize to be a key factor contributing to observed increasing hallucinations. Based on these insights, we propose Image attention-guided Key-value merging cOllaborative Decoding (IKOD), a collaborative decoding strategy generating more image-focused sequences. This method derives logits from shorter sequences with higher image attention through key-value merging and combines them with those from the original decoding, effectively mitigating attention degradation and suppressing hallucinations while not incurring too much inference cost. Extensive experiments on both hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate IKOD's superior effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and improving comprehensive capacities for LVLMs. Importantly, IKOD requires no additional training or external tools, making it a lightweight and efficient framework applicable to various models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Belief systems are often treated as globally consistent sets of propositions or as scalar-valued probability distributions. Such representations tend to obscure the internal structure of belief, conflate external credibility with internal coherence, and preclude the modeling of fragmented or contradictory epistemic states. This paper introduces a minimal formalism for belief systems as directed, weighted graphs. In this framework, nodes represent individual beliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction), and two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source trust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support). Unlike classical probabilistic models, our approach does not assume prior coherence or require belief updating. Unlike logical and argumentation-based frameworks, it supports fine-grained structural representation without committing to binary justification status or deductive closure. The model is purely static and deliberately excludes inference or revision procedures. Its aim is to provide a foundational substrate for analyzing the internal organization of belief systems, including coherence conditions, epistemic tensions, and representational limits. By distinguishing belief structure from belief strength, this formalism enables a richer classification of epistemic states than existing probabilistic, logical, or argumentation-based approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rapid growth in demand for AI-generated content (AIGC), edge AIGC service providers (ASPs) have become indispensable. However, designing incentive mechanisms that motivate ASPs to deliver high-quality AIGC services remains a challenge, especially in the presence of information asymmetry. In this paper, we address bonus design between a teleoperator and an edge ASP when the teleoperator cannot observe the ASP's private settings and chosen actions (diffusion steps). We formulate this as an online learning contract design problem and decompose it into two subproblems: ASP's settings inference and contract derivation. To tackle the NP-hard setting-inference subproblem with unknown variable sizes, we introduce a large language model (LLM)-empowered framework that iteratively refines a naive seed solver using the LLM's domain expertise. Upon obtaining the solution from the LLM-evolved solver, we directly address the contract derivation problem using convex optimization techniques and obtain a near-optimal contract. Simulation results on our Unity-based teleoperation platform show that our method boosts the teleoperator's utility by $5 \sim 40\%$ compared to benchmarks, while preserving positive incentives for the ASP. The code is available at https://github.com/Zijun0819/llm4contract.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Evaluating the mathematical capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical yet challenging frontier. Existing benchmarks fall short, particularly for proof-centric problems, as manual creation is unscalable and costly, leaving the true mathematical abilities of LLMs largely unassessed. To overcome these barriers, we propose Proof2Hybrid, the first fully automated framework that synthesizes high-quality, proof-centric benchmarks from natural language mathematical corpora. The key novelty of our solution is Proof2X, a roadmap of converting mathematical proofs into various kinds of questions that are easy to verify. Instructed by this roadmap, we propose a new type of hybrid-formatted questions, named ``$m$-out-of-$n$ multiple judge questions'', specifically designed to enable robust, automatic evaluation while being resilient to guessing and superficial pattern matching inherent in traditional formats. As a demonstration of our framework, we introduce AlgGeoTest, a benchmark for algebraic geometry--a frontier domain of modern mathematics--comprising 456 challenging items. Our extensive evaluations on state-of-the-art LLMs using AlgGeoTest reveal profound deficits in their comprehension of algebraic geometry, providing a more precise measure of their true mathematical capabilities. Our framework and benchmark pave the way for a new wave of in-depth research into the mathematical intelligence of AI systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The introduction of diffusion models has brought significant advances to the field of audio-driven talking head generation. However, the extremely slow inference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based talking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first real-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our approach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via a temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate generation. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed latent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to generate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video latent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully designed Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient talking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and accelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous noise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our framework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous motion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms state-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with significantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and speed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Traditional knowledge graph completion (KGC) methods rely solely on structural information, struggling with the inherent sparsity of knowledge graphs (KGs). By contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) encapsulate extensive world knowledge and exhibit powerful context modeling capabilities, making them promising for mitigating the limitations of traditional methods. However, direct fine-tuning of LLMs for KGC, though effective, imposes substantial computational and memory overheads, while utilizing non-fine-tuned LLMs is efficient but yields suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose a novel framework that synergizes the strengths of LLMs with robust knowledge representation to enable effective and efficient KGC. We extract the context-aware hidden states of knowledge triples from the intermediate layers of LLMs, thereby capturing rich semantic and relational nuances. These representations are then utilized to train a data-efficient classifier tailored specifically for KGC tasks. To bridge the semantic gaps between LLMs and KGs, we employ subgraph sampling on KGs to generate model-friendly entity descriptions. We further adopt sliced mutual information (SMI) as a principled metric to quantify the task-specific information encoded in these representations. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach. We achieve a 47\% relative improvement over previous methods based on non-fine-tuned LLMs and, to our knowledge, are the first to achieve classification performance comparable to fine-tuned LLMs while enhancing GPU memory efficiency by $188\times$ and accelerating training and inference by $26.11\times$.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rise of scaled-out LLMs and scaled-up SuperPods signals a new era in large-scale AI infrastructure. LLMs continue to scale out via MoE, as seen in recent models like DeepSeek, Kimi, and Qwen. In parallel, AI hardware is scaling up, with Huawei's CloudMatrix384 SuperPod offering hundreds of GB/s high-speed interconnects. Running large MoE models on SuperPod-scale hardware brings new challenges. It requires new execution models, scalable scheduling, efficient expert load balancing, and elimination of single points of failure. This paper presents xDeepServe, Huawei Cloud's LLM serving system designed for SuperPod-scale infrastructure. At its core is Transformerless, a disaggregated architecture that decomposes transformer models into modular units--attention, feedforward, and MoE--executed independently on NPUs connected via high-speed fabric. We implement this design in two forms: disaggregated prefill-decode and disaggregated MoE-attention. This fully disaggregated setup enables independent scaling of compute and memory without sacrificing performance. To support this architecture, we propose XCCL, a communication library that leverages CloudMatrix384's global shared memory to implement efficient point-to-point and all-to-all primitives. We also extend our serving engine FlowServe with system-level techniques, enabling scalable inference across hundreds of NPUs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Drug discovery frequently loses momentum when data, expertise, and tools are scattered, slowing design cycles. To shorten this loop we built a hierarchical, tool using agent framework that automates molecular optimisation. A Principal Researcher defines each objective, a Database agent retrieves target information, an AI Expert generates de novo scaffolds with a sequence to molecule deep learning model, a Medicinal Chemist edits them while invoking a docking tool, a Ranking agent scores the candidates, and a Scientific Critic polices the logic. Each tool call is summarised and stored causing the full reasoning path to remain inspectable. The agents communicate through concise provenance records that capture molecular lineage, to build auditable, molecule centered reasoning trajectories and reuse successful transformations via in context learning. Three cycle research loops were run against AKT1 protein using five large language models. After ranking the models by mean docking score, we ran 20 independent scale ups on the two top performers. We then compared the leading LLMs' binding affinity results across three configurations, LLM only, single agent, and multi agent. Our results reveal an architectural trade off, the multi agent setting excelled at focused binding optimization, improving average predicted binding affinity by 31%. In contrast, single agent runs generated molecules with superior drug like properties at the cost of less potent binding scores. Unguided LLM runs finished fastest, yet their lack of transparent tool signals left the validity of their reasoning paths unverified. These results show that test time scaling, focused feedback loops and provenance convert general purpose LLMs into auditable systems for molecular design, and suggest that extending the toolset to ADMET and selectivity predictors could push research workflows further along the discovery pipeline.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Flow-based generative models have recently achieved remarkable progress in image and video synthesis, with classifier-free guidance (CFG) becoming the standard tool for high-fidelity, controllable generation. However, despite their practical success, little is known about how guidance interacts with different stages of the sampling process-especially in the fast, low-step regimes typical of modern flow-based pipelines. In this work, we uncover and analyze a fundamental instability: the earliest reverse steps are acutely sensitive to the guidance scale, owing to a pronounced spike in the relative strength (RATIO) of conditional to unconditional predictions. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we show that this RATIO spike is intrinsic to the data distribution, independent of the model architecture, and causes exponential error amplification when paired with strong guidance. To address this, we propose a simple, theoretically grounded, RATIO-aware adaptive guidance schedule that automatically dampens the guidance scale at early steps based on the evolving RATIO, using a closed-form exponential decay. Our method is lightweight, requires no additional inference overhead, and is compatible with standard flow frameworks. Experiments across state-of-the-art image (SD3.5, Lumina) and video (WAN2.1) models demonstrate that our approach enables up to 3x faster sampling while maintaining or improving generation quality, robustness, and semantic alignment. Extensive ablation studies further confirm the generality and stability of our schedule across models, datasets, and hyperparameters. Our findings highlight the critical role of stepwise guidance adaptation in unlocking the full potential of fast flow-based generative models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Human cognition naturally engages with abstract and fluid concepts, whereas existing reasoning models often rely on generating discrete tokens, potentially constraining their expressive capabilities. Recent advancements aim to address this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft, abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space. This paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by examining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques. Contrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs predominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during subsequent decoding steps. This reliance hinders the exploration of different reasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding, obscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens. To tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce \emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential of Soft Thinking. Notably, the Gumbel-Softmax trick provides adequate randomness with controlled smoothness, resulting in superior performance across eight reasoning benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The high computational cost and slow inference time are major obstacles to deploying Video Diffusion Models (VDMs). To overcome this, we introduce a new Video Diffusion Model Compression approach using individual content and motion dynamics preserved pruning and consistency loss. First, we empirically observe that deeper VDM layers are crucial for maintaining the quality of \textbf{motion dynamics} (\textit{e.g.,} coherence of the entire video), while shallower layers are more focused on \textbf{individual content} (\textit{e.g.,} individual frames). Therefore, we prune redundant blocks from the shallower layers while preserving more of the deeper layers, resulting in a lightweight VDM variant called VDMini. Moreover, we propose an \textbf{Individual Content and Motion Dynamics (ICMD)} Consistency Loss to gain comparable generation performance as larger VDM to VDMini. In particular, we first use the Individual Content Distillation (ICD) Loss to preserve the consistency in the features of each generated frame between the teacher and student models. Next, we introduce a Multi-frame Content Adversarial (MCA) Loss to enhance the motion dynamics across the generated video as a whole. This method significantly accelerates inference time while maintaining high-quality video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our VDMini on two important video generation tasks, Text-to-Video (T2V) and Image-to-Video (I2V), where we respectively achieve an average 2.5 $\times$, 1.4 $\times$, and 1.25 $\times$ speed up for the I2V method SF-V, the T2V method T2V-Turbo-v2, and the T2V method HunyuanVideo, while maintaining the quality of the generated videos on several benchmarks including UCF101, VBench-T2V, and VBench-I2V.

The steady growth of studies and findings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to systematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents an approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG) generation to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of large language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts into semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from these sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain and ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate ontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during extraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming `quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing natural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original propositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity for generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated sentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context variable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new relationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge graph. This approach leads the way to provide medical practitioners with a centralised, updated in real-time, and sustainable knowledge source, and may be the foundation of similar gains in a wide variety of fields.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We adapt alignment techniques from reasoning LLMs to the task of generating engineering sketch constraints found in computer-aided design (CAD) models. Engineering sketches consist of geometric primitives (e.g. points, lines) connected by constraints (e.g. perpendicular, tangent) that define the relationships between them. For a design to be easily editable, the constraints must effectively capture design intent, ensuring the geometry updates predictably when parameters change. Although current approaches can generate CAD designs, an open challenge remains to align model outputs with design intent, we label this problem 'design alignment'. A critical first step towards aligning generative CAD models is to generate constraints which fully-constrain all geometric primitives, without over-constraining or distorting sketch geometry. Using alignment techniques to train an existing constraint generation model with feedback from a constraint solver, we are able to fully-constrain 93% of sketches compared to 34% when using a naive supervised fine-tuning (SFT) baseline and only 8.9% without SFT. Our approach can be applied to any existing constraint generation model and sets the stage for further research bridging alignment strategies between the language and design domains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification faces significant challenges due to data distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode configurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware discrepancies across domains. This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations. Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods, IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across 10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods by up to $35$\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce AI on the Pulse, a real-world-ready anomaly detection system that continuously monitors patients using a fusion of wearable sensors, ambient intelligence, and advanced AI models. Powered by UniTS, a state-of-the-art (SoTA) universal time-series model, our framework autonomously learns each patient's unique physiological and behavioral patterns, detecting subtle deviations that signal potential health risks. Unlike classification methods that require impractical, continuous labeling in real-world scenarios, our approach uses anomaly detection to provide real-time, personalized alerts for reactive home-care interventions. Our approach outperforms 12 SoTA anomaly detection methods, demonstrating robustness across both high-fidelity medical devices (ECG) and consumer wearables, with a ~ 22% improvement in F1 score. However, the true impact of AI on the Pulse lies in @HOME, where it has been successfully deployed for continuous, real-world patient monitoring. By operating with non-invasive, lightweight devices like smartwatches, our system proves that high-quality health monitoring is possible without clinical-grade equipment. Beyond detection, we enhance interpretability by integrating LLMs, translating anomaly scores into clinically meaningful insights for healthcare professionals.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Being able to use tools is a widely recognised indicator of intelligence across species. Humans, for instance, have demonstrated mastery of tool use for over two million years. The ability to use tools is invaluable as it extends an organism's reach and enhances its capacity to interact with objects and the environment. Being able to understand the geometric-mechanical relations between the tools-objects-environments allows certain species (e.g., apes and crows) to reach food in narrow constrained spaces. The same principles of physical augmentation and its associated non-prehensile manipulation capabilities also apply to robotic systems. For example, by instrumenting them with different types of end-effectors, robots can (in principle) dexterously interact (e.g., push and flip) with objects of various shapes and masses akin to its biological counterpart. However, developing this type of manipulation skill is still an open research problem. Furthermore, the complexity of planning tool-object manipulation tasks, particularly in coordinating the actions of dual-arm robots, presents significant challenges. To address these complexities, we propose integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in planning and executing these intricate manipulations, thereby enhancing the robot's ability to perform in diverse scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> X-ray medical report generation is one of the important applications of artificial intelligence in healthcare. With the support of large foundation models, the quality of medical report generation has significantly improved. However, challenges such as hallucination and weak disease diagnostic capability still persist. In this paper, we first construct a large-scale multi-modal medical knowledge graph (termed M3KG) based on the ground truth medical report using the GPT-4o. It contains 2477 entities, 3 kinds of relations, 37424 triples, and 6943 disease-aware vision tokens for the CheXpert Plus dataset. Then, we sample it to obtain multi-granularity semantic graphs and use an R-GCN encoder for feature extraction. For the input X-ray image, we adopt the Swin-Transformer to extract the vision features and interact with the knowledge using cross-attention. The vision tokens are fed into a Q-former and retrieved the disease-aware vision tokens using another cross-attention. Finally, we adopt the large language model to map the semantic knowledge graph, input X-ray image, and disease-aware vision tokens into language descriptions. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed knowledge graph and X-ray report generation framework. The source code of this paper will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Medical_Image_Analysis.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) significantly reduce computational complexity and memory usage in machine and deep learning by representing weights and activations with just one bit. However, most existing training algorithms for BNNs rely on quantization-aware floating-point Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), limiting the full exploitation of binary operations to the inference phase only. In this work, we propose, for the first time, a fully binary and gradient-free training algorithm for multi-layer BNNs, eliminating the need for back-propagated floating-point gradients. Specifically, the proposed algorithm relies on local binary error signals and binary weight updates, employing integer-valued hidden weights that serve as a synaptic metaplasticity mechanism, thereby enhancing its neurobiological plausibility. Our proposed solution enables the training of binary multi-layer perceptrons by using exclusively XNOR, Popcount, and increment/decrement operations. Experimental results on multi-class classification benchmarks show test accuracy improvements of up to +35.47% over the only existing fully binary single-layer state-of-the-art solution. Compared to full-precision SGD, our solution improves test accuracy by up to +35.30% under the same total memory demand, while also reducing computational cost by two to three orders of magnitude in terms of the total number of Boolean gates. The proposed algorithm is made available to the scientific community as a public repository.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Conversational LLMs have been widely adopted by domain users with limited programming experience to solve domain problems. However, these users often face misalignment between their intent and generated code, resulting in frustration and rounds of clarification. This work first investigates the cause of this misalignment, which dues to bidirectional ambiguity: both user intents and coding tasks are inherently nonlinear, yet must be expressed and interpreted through linear prompts and code sequences. To address this, we propose direct intent-task matching, a new human-LLM interaction paradigm that externalizes and enables direct manipulation of the LLM understanding, i.e., the coding tasks and their relationships inferred by the LLM prior to code generation. As a proof-of-concept, this paradigm is then implemented in NeuroSync, which employs a knowledge distillation pipeline to extract LLM understanding, user intents, and their mappings, and enhances the alignment by allowing users to intuitively inspect and edit them via visualizations. We evaluate the algorithmic components of NeuroSync via technical experiments, and assess its overall usability and effectiveness via a user study (N=12). The results show that it enhances intent-task alignment, lowers cognitive effort, and improves coding efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In real-world routing problems, users often propose conflicting or unreasonable requirements, which result in infeasible optimization models due to overly restrictive or contradictory constraints, leading to an empty feasible solution set. Existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods attempt to diagnose infeasible models, but modifying such models often involves multiple potential adjustments that these methods do not consider. To fill this gap, we introduce Multi-Objective Infeasibility Diagnosis (MOID), which combines LLM agents and multi-objective optimization within an automatic routing solver, to provide a set of representative actionable suggestions. Specifically, MOID employs multi-objective optimization to consider both path cost and constraint violation, generating a set of trade-off solutions, each encompassing varying degrees of model adjustments. To extract practical insights from these solutions, MOID utilizes LLM agents to generate a solution analysis function for the infeasible model. This function analyzes these distinct solutions to diagnose the original infeasible model, providing users with diverse diagnostic insights and suggestions. Finally, we compare MOID with several LLM-based methods on 50 types of infeasible routing problems. The results indicate that MOID automatically generates multiple diagnostic suggestions in a single run, providing more practical insights for restoring model feasibility and decision-making compared to existing methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Binary relations, such as equality, are basic mathematical concepts that appear, implicitly or explicitly, in most benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLM). A recent trend in the literature is benchmarking LLMs on out-of-context learning, where the data is not presented in the prompt, but only during the model's training. However, existing works mostly focus on higher-order tasks, making it hard to interpret success or failure. In this work, we study how well can LLMs reason out-of-context on binary relations by only learning the representations of newly introduced tokens. Our experiments focus on equality ($=$), inequality ($<$), and inclusion ($\subset$) and the properties they satisfy, such as reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity, and logical complexity (e.g., the number of reasoning "hops"). We show that LLMs achieve better than random accuracy, but are still far from perfect, even on relatively simple reasoning tasks involving binary relations. We analyse the learned representations and show that LLMs encode useful information directly, arranging the embeddings according to the task.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning and generation across domains, but still struggle with identifying and diagnosing complex errors. This stems mainly from training objectives that prioritize correct answers, limiting exposure to and learning from errors. While recent studies have begun to address this by introducing error signals, most rely on shallow, static errors, restricting improvement in deep diagnostic ability. To overcome this, we propose Hide and Seek Game (HSG), a dynamic adversarial framework for error generation and diagnosis, and evaluate it on mathematical problem-solving. HSG involves two adversarial roles: Sneaky, which "hides" by generating subtle, deceptive reasoning errors, and Diagnosis, which "seeks" to accurately detect them. Through adversarial co-evolution, both error stealth and diagnostic precision are enhanced. Experiments on several math reasoning tasks show that HSG significantly boosts error diagnosis, achieving 16.8\%--31.4\% higher accuracy than baselines like GPT-4o. We also release a challenging dataset of deceptive errors and diagnostic annotations as a benchmark for future research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an effective solution for adapting Vision Transformers (ViT) to distribution shifts without additional training data. However, existing TTA methods often incur substantial computational overhead, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained real-world scenarios. To reduce inference cost, plug-and-play token aggregation methods merge redundant tokens in ViTs to reduce total processed tokens. Albeit efficient, it suffers from significant performance degradation when directly integrated with existing TTA methods. We formalize this problem as Efficient Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), seeking to preserve the adaptation capability of TTA while reducing inference latency. In this paper, we first provide a theoretical analysis from a novel mutual information perspective, showing that token aggregation inherently leads to information loss, which cannot be fully mitigated by conventional norm-tuning-based TTA methods. Guided by this insight, we propose to \textbf{N}eutralize Token \textbf{A}ggregation \textbf{v}ia \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{A}ugmentation (\textbf{NAVIA}). Specifically, we directly augment the [CLS] token embedding and incorporate adaptive biases into the [CLS] token in shallow layers of ViTs. We theoretically demonstrate that these augmentations, when optimized via entropy minimization, recover the information lost due to token aggregation. Extensive experiments across various out-of-distribution benchmarks demonstrate that NAVIA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 2.5\%, while achieving an inference latency reduction of more than 20\%, effectively addressing the ETTA challenge.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating code from natural language (NL) descriptions. However, the plain textual descriptions are inherently ambiguous and often fail to capture complex requirements like intricate system behaviors, conditional logic, and architectural constraints; implicit data dependencies in service-oriented architectures are difficult to infer and handle correctly. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code generation framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal specifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified Modeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented architectures. This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating decision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural relationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously eliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data flow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI systematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual code synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained mathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with LLMs' excellent mathematical strengths. Additional static parsing and dependency pruning further reduce context complexity and cognitive load associated with intricate specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning accuracy and efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion models have revealed powerful potential in all-in-one image restoration (AiOIR), which is talented in generating abundant texture details. The existing AiOIR methods either retrain a diffusion model or fine-tune the pretrained diffusion model with extra conditional guidance. However, they often suffer from high inference costs and limited adaptability to diverse degradation types. In this paper, we propose an efficient AiOIR method, Diffusion Once and Done (DOD), which aims to achieve superior restoration performance with only one-step sampling of Stable Diffusion (SD) models. Specifically, multi-degradation feature modulation is first introduced to capture different degradation prompts with a pretrained diffusion model. Then, parameter-efficient conditional low-rank adaptation integrates the prompts to enable the fine-tuning of the SD model for adapting to different degradation types. Besides, a high-fidelity detail enhancement module is integrated into the decoder of SD to improve structural and textural details. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing diffusion-based restoration approaches in both visual quality and inference efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision large language models (VLLMs) are focusing primarily on handling complex and fine-grained visual information by incorporating advanced vision encoders and scaling up visual models. However, these approaches face high training and inference costs, as well as challenges in extracting visual details, effectively bridging across modalities. In this work, we propose a novel visual framework, MoCHA, to address these issues. Our framework integrates four vision backbones (i.e., CLIP, SigLIP, DINOv2 and ConvNeXt) to extract complementary visual features and is equipped with a sparse Mixture of Experts Connectors (MoECs) module to dynamically select experts tailored to different visual dimensions. To mitigate redundant or insufficient use of the visual information encoded by the MoECs module, we further design a Hierarchical Group Attention (HGA) with intra- and inter-group operations and an adaptive gating strategy for encoded visual features. We train MoCHA on two mainstream LLMs (e.g., Phi2-2.7B and Vicuna-7B) and evaluate their performance across various benchmarks. Notably, MoCHA outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight models on various tasks. For example, compared to CuMo (Mistral-7B), our MoCHA (Phi2-2.7B) presents outstanding abilities to mitigate hallucination by showing improvements of 3.25% in POPE and to follow visual instructions by raising 153 points on MME. Finally, ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MoECs and HGA in improving the overall performance of MoCHA.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The core challenge in automotive exterior design is balancing subjective aesthetics with objective aerodynamic performance while dramatically accelerating the development cycle. To address this, we propose a novel, LLM-driven multi-agent framework that automates the end-to-end workflow from ambiguous requirements to 3D concept model performance validation. The workflow is structured in two stages: conceptual generation and performance validation. In the first stage, agents collaborate to interpret fuzzy design requirements, generate concept sketches, and produce photorealistic renderings using diffusion models. In the second stage, the renderings are converted to 3D point clouds, where a Drag Prediction Agent, built upon a lightweight surrogate model, provides near-instantaneous predictions of the drag coefficient and pressure fields, replacing time-consuming CFD simulations. The primary contribution of this work is the seamless integration of creative generation with a rapid engineering validation loop within a unified, automated system, which provides a new paradigm for efficiently balancing creative exploration with engineering constraints in the earliest stages of design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> General logical reasoning, defined as the ability to reason deductively on domain-agnostic tasks, continues to be a challenge for large language models (LLMs). Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not interpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in neurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We first identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical reasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic reasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach comprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network, performs symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on domain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on domain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the following question: Which approach is more promising for developing general logical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class domain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses the integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the hybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each approach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising for developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is more interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of existing LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a generalizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design, model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reasoning large language models (RLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities through structured and multi-step reasoning. While prior research has primarily focused on improving their training and inference strategies, their potential for in-context learning (ICL) remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we propose Thinking with Nothinking Calibration (JointThinking), a new ICL paradigm that leverages the structured difference between two reasoning modes, i.e., Thinking and Nothinking, to improve reasoning accuracy. Specifically, our method prompts the model to generate two answers in parallel: one in Thinking mode and the other in Nothinking mode. A second round of Thinking is triggered only when the two initial responses are inconsistent, using a single prompt that incorporates the original question and both candidate answers. Since such disagreement occurs infrequently (e.g., only 6\% in GSM8K), our method performs just one round of reasoning in most cases, resulting in minimal latency overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that JointThinking significantly outperforms few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and majority voting with improved answer robustness. Moreover, It achieves comparable in-distribution performance to training-based SOTA method, while substantially outperforming on out-of-distribution tasks. We further conduct a systematic analysis of the calibration mechanism, showing that leveraging different reasoning modes consistently lowers the error rate and highlights the value of structural thinking diversity. Additionally, we observe that the performance gap between actual and ideal reasoning narrows as model size increases in the second round of thinking, indicating the strong scalability of our approach. Finally, we discuss current limitations and outline promising directions for future ICL research in RLLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Automatic assessment of cognitive impairment from spontaneous speech offers a promising, non-invasive avenue for early cognitive screening. However, current approaches often lack generalizability when deployed across different languages and clinical settings, limiting their practical utility. In this study, we propose CogBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the cross-lingual and cross-site generalizability of large language models (LLMs) for speech-based cognitive impairment assessment. Using a unified multimodal pipeline, we evaluate model performance on three speech datasets spanning English and Mandarin: ADReSSo, NCMMSC2021-AD, and a newly collected test set, CIR-E. Our results show that conventional deep learning models degrade substantially when transferred across domains. In contrast, LLMs equipped with chain-of-thought prompting demonstrate better adaptability, though their performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Furthermore, we explore lightweight fine-tuning of LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which significantly improves generalization in target domains. These findings offer a critical step toward building clinically useful and linguistically robust speech-based cognitive assessment tools.

  Models via Hessian Augmentation</h2>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective approach for compressing large models and accelerating their inference without retraining. While PTQ has been extensively studied in the context of large language models (LLMs), its applicability to vision-language models (VLMs) remains underexplored. In this paper, we identify a modality discrepancy (\emph{i.e.}, limited text tokens \emph{vs.} excessive and redundant vision tokens) of VLMs. However, existing Hessian-based LLM PTQ methods treat all tokens equally during quantization, resulting in severe performance drops when applied to VLMs. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel importance-aware PTQ framework tailored for VLMs, dubbed VLMQ. Specifically, to address vision token redundancy, VLMQ 1) optimizes an importance-aware objective that yields an enhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, while retaining compatibility with parallelized weight updates, and 2) ensures efficiency and effectiveness by computing these factors via a single lightweight block-wise backward pass, guided by a theoretical connection to token-level perturbations. Extensive evaluations on 8 benchmarks across 0.5B$\sim$32B VLMs demonstrate the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our VLMQ, particularly under low-bit settings. For example, it achieves a substantial \textbf{16.45\%} improvement on MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting excel at complex reasoning but generate verbose thought processes with considerable redundancy, leading to increased inference costs and reduced efficiency. We introduce a novel CoT compression framework based on step entropy, a metric that quantifies the informational contribution of individual reasoning steps to identify redundancy. Through theoretical analysis and extensive empirical validation on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we demonstrate that steps with low entropy are indeed highly redundant. Our experiments reveal that an astonishing 80\% of low-entropy intermediate steps can be pruned with minor degradation in the final answer accuracy across DeepSeek-R1-7B, 14B and Qwen3-8B. This finding sharply contrasts with random or high-entropy pruning, which severely impairs reasoning performance. Building on this, we propose a novel two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning. This approach enables LLMs to autonomously learn to generate compressed COTs during inference by strategically incorporating [SKIP] tokens. Our method significantly enhances LLM inference efficiency while rigorously preserving accuracy, offering profound implications for practical LLM deployment and a deeper understanding of reasoning structures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rise of LLMs such as ChatGPT and Claude fuels the need for AI agents capable of real-time task handling. However, migrating data-intensive, multi-modal edge workloads to cloud data centers, traditionally used for agent deployment, introduces significant latency. Deploying AI agents at the edge improves efficiency and reduces latency. However, edge environments present challenges due to limited and heterogeneous resources. Maintaining QoS for mobile users necessitates agent migration, which is complicated by the complexity of AI agents coordinating LLMs, task planning, memory, and external tools. This paper presents the first systematic deployment and management solution for LLM-based AI agents in dynamic edge environments. We propose a novel adaptive framework for AI agent placement and migration in edge intelligence systems. Our approach models resource constraints and latency/cost, leveraging ant colony algorithms and LLM-based optimization for efficient decision-making. It autonomously places agents to optimize resource utilization and QoS and enables lightweight agent migration by transferring only essential state. Implemented on a distributed system using AgentScope and validated across globally distributed edge servers, our solution significantly reduces deployment latency and migration costs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Existing cybersecurity playbooks are often written in heterogeneous, non-machine-readable formats, which limits their automation and interoperability across Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response platforms. This paper explores the suitability of Large Language Models, combined with Prompt Engineering, to automatically translate legacy incident response playbooks into the standardized, machine-readable CACAO format. We systematically examine various Prompt Engineering techniques and carefully design prompts aimed at maximizing syntactic accuracy and semantic fidelity for control flow preservation. Our modular transformation pipeline integrates a syntax checker to ensure syntactic correctness and features an iterative refinement mechanism that progressively reduces syntactic errors. We evaluate the proposed approach on a custom-generated dataset comprising diverse legacy playbooks paired with manually created CACAO references. The results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the accuracy of playbook transformation over baseline models, effectively captures complex workflow structures, and substantially reduces errors. It highlights the potential for practical deployment in automated cybersecurity playbook transformation tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet their inability to maintain persistent memory in long contexts limits their effectiveness as autonomous agents in long-term interactions. While existing memory systems have made progress, their reliance on arbitrary granularity for defining the basic memory unit and passive, rule-based mechanisms for knowledge extraction limits their capacity for genuine learning and evolution. To address these foundational limitations, we present Nemori, a novel self-organizing memory architecture inspired by human cognitive principles. Nemori's core innovation is twofold: First, its Two-Step Alignment Principle, inspired by Event Segmentation Theory, provides a principled, top-down method for autonomously organizing the raw conversational stream into semantically coherent episodes, solving the critical issue of memory granularity. Second, its Predict-Calibrate Principle, inspired by the Free-energy Principle, enables the agent to proactively learn from prediction gaps, moving beyond pre-defined heuristics to achieve adaptive knowledge evolution. This offers a viable path toward handling the long-term, dynamic workflows of autonomous agents. Extensive experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that Nemori significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art systems, with its advantage being particularly pronounced in longer contexts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Repository-level code comprehension and knowledge sharing remain core challenges in software engineering. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise by generating explanations of program structure and logic. However, these approaches still face limitations: First, relevant knowledge is distributed across multiple files within a repository, aka semantic fragmentation. Second, retrieval inefficiency and attention saturation degrade performance in RAG pipelines, where long, unaligned contexts overwhelm attention. Third, repository specific training data is scarce and often outdated. Finally, proprietary LLMs hinder industrial adoption due to privacy and deployment constraints. To address these issues, we propose Key-Augmented Neural Triggers (KANT), a novel approach that embeds knowledge anchors into both training and inference. Unlike prior methods, KANT enables internal access to repository specific knowledge, reducing fragmentation and grounding inference in localized context. Moreover, we synthesize specialized data directly from code. At inference, knowledge anchors replace verbose context, reducing token overhead and latency while supporting efficient, on premise deployment. We evaluate KANT via: a qualitative human evaluation of the synthesized dataset's intent coverage and quality across five dimensions; compare against SOTA baselines across five qualitative dimensions and inference speed; and replication across different LLMs to assess generalizability. Results show that the synthetic training data aligned with information-seeking needs. KANT achieved over 60% preference from human annotators and a LocalStack expert (preferring 79% of cases). Also, KANT reduced inference latency by up to 85% across all models. Overall, it is well-suited for scalable, low-latency, on-premise deployments, providing a strong foundation for code comprehension.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful capabilities in code generation, natural language understanding, and domain-specific reasoning. Their application to quantum software development remains limited, in part because of the lack of high-quality datasets both for LLM training and as dependable knowledge sources. To bridge this gap, we introduce PennyLang, an off-the-shelf, high-quality dataset of 3,347 PennyLane-specific quantum code samples with contextual descriptions, curated from textbooks, official documentation, and open-source repositories. Our contributions are threefold: (1) the creation and open-source release of PennyLang, a purpose-built dataset for quantum programming with PennyLane; (2) a framework for automated quantum code dataset construction that systematizes curation, annotation, and formatting to maximize downstream LLM usability; and (3) a baseline evaluation of the dataset across multiple open-source models, including ablation studies, all conducted within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. Using PennyLang with RAG substantially improves performance: for example, Qwen 7B's success rate rises from 8.7% without retrieval to 41.7% with full-context augmentation, and LLaMa 4 improves from 78.8% to 84.8%, while also reducing hallucinations and enhancing quantum code correctness. Moving beyond Qiskit-focused studies, we bring LLM-based tools and reproducible methods to PennyLane for advancing AI-assisted quantum development.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Knowledge conflicts commonly arise across diverse sources, and their prevalence has increased with the advent of LLMs. When dealing with conflicts between multiple contexts, also known as \emph{inter-context knowledge conflicts}, LLMs are often confused by lengthy and conflicting contexts. To address this challenge, we propose the Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR) framework, which enhances the ability of LLMs to resolve conflicting knowledge. The key idea of KCR is to train backbone LLMs to establish a correct reasoning process by rewarding them for selecting and adhering to the context with stronger logical consistency when presented with conflicting contexts. Specifically, we first extract reasoning paths, represented by either text or local knowledge graphs, from the conflicting long contexts. Subsequently, we employ Reinforcement Learning to encourage the model to learn the paradigm of reasoning process that follows correct reasoning paths rather than the incorrect counterparts. This enables the backbone models to genuinely acquire the capability to resolve inter-context knowledge conflicts within long contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the ability of various backbone models to resolve knowledge conflicts in long-context scenarios, yielding substantial performance gains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a promising research field for enhancing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) without extra training. However, most existing approaches, e.g., Best-of-N and Self-Consistency rely on a single agent interacting with a reward model (SA-SR), constrained by limited capabilities of a single test-time scaling (STTS) paradigm. On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that collective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent systems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first step towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the different interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three primary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent to multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model (MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive experiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance. Based on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively leverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced inference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent Collaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination of LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model collaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a curated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to select the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking (PRR) metric. Experiments across seven mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CTTS-MM consistently obtains superior performance. Code will be released at https://github.com/magent4aci/CTTS-MM.

Poorly designed prompts that fail even slightly to guide individual agents can lead to sub-optimal performance that may snowball within a system of agents, limiting their reliability and scalability. To address this important problem of inference-time prompt optimization, we introduce ProRefine, an innovative inference-time optimization method that uses an agentic loop of LLMs to generate and apply textual feedback. ProRefine dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to approach the performance of their larger counterparts. This highlights its potential for building more cost-effective and powerful hybrid AI systems, thereby democratizing access to high-performing AI.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Answer verification is crucial not only for evaluating large language models (LLMs) by matching their unstructured outputs against standard answers, but also serves as the reward model to guide LLM optimization. Most evaluation frameworks rely on regularized matching or employ general LLMs for answer verification, which demands extensive, repetitive customization for regex rules or evaluation prompts. Two fundamental limitations persist in current methodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically evaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent stage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the robustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across different domains. In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and robust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward. It demonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse reasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including multi-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively identifying abnormal/invalid responses. We introduce VerifierBench benchmark comprising model outputs collected from multiple data sources, augmented through manual analysis of metaerror patterns to enhance CompassVerifier. We anticipate that CompassVerifier and VerifierBench will facilitate answer verification, evaluation protocols, and reinforcement learning research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present Agent Lightning, a flexible and extensible framework that enables Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training of Large Language Models (LLMs) for any AI agent. Unlike existing methods that tightly couple RL training with agent or rely on sequence concatenation with masking, Agent Lightning achieves complete decoupling between agent execution and training, allowing seamless integration with existing agents developed via diverse ways (e.g., using frameworks like LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, AutoGen, and building from scratch) with almost ZERO code modifications. By formulating agent execution as Markov decision process, we define an unified data interface and propose a hierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, which contains a credit assignment module, allowing us to decompose trajectories generated by ANY agents into training transition. This enables RL to handle complex interaction logic, such as multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. For the system design, we introduce a Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture, and brings agent observability frameworks into agent runtime, providing a standardized agent finetuning interface. Experiments across text-to-SQL, retrieval-augmented generation, and math tool-use tasks demonstrate stable, continuous improvements, showcasing the framework's potential for real-world agent training and deployment.

Is this due to LLMs missing domain knowledge or insufficient prompt detail is given? To answer this, we introduce PartialOrderEval, which augments any code generation benchmark with a partial order of prompts from minimal to maximally detailed. Applying it to HumanEval and both serial and OpenMP subsets of ParEval, we measure how pass@1 scales with prompt specificity. Our experiments with Llama-3.x and Qwen2.5-Coder demonstrate varying degrees of prompt sensitivity across different tasks, and a qualitative analysis highlights explicit I/O specifications, edge-case handling, and stepwise breakdowns as the key drivers of prompt detail improvement.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The deployment of pre-trained perception models in novel environments often leads to performance degradation due to distributional shifts. Although recent artificial intelligence approaches for metacognition use logical rules to characterize and filter model errors, improving precision often comes at the cost of reduced recall. This paper addresses the hypothesis that leveraging multiple pre-trained models can mitigate this recall reduction. We formulate the challenge of identifying and managing conflicting predictions from various models as a consistency-based abduction problem, building on the idea of abductive learning (ABL) but applying it to test-time instead of training. The input predictions and the learned error detection rules derived from each model are encoded in a logic program. We then seek an abductive explanation--a subset of model predictions--that maximizes prediction coverage while ensuring the rate of logical inconsistencies (derived from domain constraints) remains below a specified threshold. We propose two algorithms for this knowledge representation task: an exact method based on Integer Programming (IP) and an efficient Heuristic Search (HS). Through extensive experiments on a simulated aerial imagery dataset featuring controlled, complex distributional shifts, we demonstrate that our abduction-based framework outperforms individual models and standard ensemble baselines, achieving, for instance, average relative improvements of approximately 13.6\% in F1-score and 16.6\% in accuracy across 15 diverse test datasets when compared to the best individual model. Our results validate the use of consistency-based abduction as an effective mechanism to robustly integrate knowledge from multiple imperfect models in challenging, novel scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Food delivery platforms face the challenge of helping users navigate vast catalogs of restaurants and dishes to find meals they truly enjoy. This paper presents RED, an automated recommendation system designed for iFood, Latin America's largest on-demand food delivery platform, to personalize the selection of curated food collections displayed to millions of users. Our approach employs a LightGBM classifier that scores collections based on three feature groups: collection characteristics, user-collection similarity, and contextual information. To address the cold-start problem of recommending newly created collections, we develop content-based representations using item embeddings and implement monotonicity constraints to improve generalization. We tackle data scarcity by bootstrapping from category carousel interactions and address visibility bias through unbiased sampling of impressions and purchases in production. The system demonstrates significant real-world impact through extensive A/B testing with 5-10% of iFood's user base. Online results of our A/B tests add up to 97% improvement in Card Conversion Rate and 1.4% increase in overall App Conversion Rate compared to popularity-based baselines. Notably, our offline accuracy metrics strongly correlate with online performance, enabling reliable impact prediction before deployment. To our knowledge, this is the first work to detail large-scale recommendation of curated food collections in a dynamic commercial environment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) struggles with domain-specific enterprise datasets, often isolated behind firewalls and rich in complex, specialized terminology unseen by LLMs during pre-training. Semantic variability across domains like medicine, networking, or law hampers RAG's context precision, while fine-tuning solutions are costly, slow, and lack generalization as new data emerges. Achieving zero-shot precision with retrievers without fine-tuning still remains a key challenge. We introduce 'MetaGen Blended RAG', a novel enterprise search approach that enhances semantic retrievers through a metadata generation pipeline and hybrid query indexes using dense and sparse vectors. By leveraging key concepts, topics, and acronyms, our method creates metadata-enriched semantic indexes and boosted hybrid queries, delivering robust, scalable performance without fine-tuning. On the biomedical PubMedQA dataset, MetaGen Blended RAG achieves 82% retrieval accuracy and 77% RAG accuracy, surpassing all prior zero-shot RAG benchmarks and even rivaling fine-tuned models on that dataset, while also excelling on datasets like SQuAD and NQ. This approach redefines enterprise search using a new approach to building semantic retrievers with unmatched generalization across specialized domains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generative models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), produce fluent outputs yet lack verifiable guarantees. We adapt Design by Contract (DbC) and type-theoretic principles to introduce a contract layer that mediates every LLM call. Contracts stipulate semantic and type requirements on inputs and outputs, coupled with probabilistic remediation to steer generation toward compliance. The layer exposes the dual view of LLMs as semantic parsers and probabilistic black-box components. Contract satisfaction is probabilistic and semantic validation is operationally defined through programmer-specified conditions on well-typed data structures. More broadly, this work postulates that any two agents satisfying the same contracts are \emph{functionally equivalent} with respect to those contracts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding a procedural activity requires modeling both how action steps transform the scene, and how evolving scene transformations can influence the sequence of action steps, even those that are accidental or erroneous. Existing work has studied procedure-aware video representations by modeling the temporal order of actions, but has not explicitly learned the state changes (scene transformations). In this work, we study procedure-aware video representation learning by incorporating state-change descriptions generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) as supervision signals for video encoders. Moreover, we generate state-change counterfactuals that simulate hypothesized failure outcomes, allowing models to learn by imagining unseen "What if" scenarios. This counterfactual reasoning facilitates the model's ability to understand the cause and effect of each step in an activity. We conduct extensive experiments on procedure-aware tasks, including temporal action segmentation, error detection, action phase classification, frame retrieval, multi-instance retrieval, and action recognition. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed state-change descriptions and their counterfactuals, and achieve significant improvements on multiple tasks.

The suite encompasses 14 designed planning and scheduling problems that progress from basic to highly complex, incorporating key aspects such as multi-agent coordination, inter-agent dependencies, and dynamic environmental disruptions. Each problem can be scaled along three dimensions: the number of parallel planning threads, the complexity of inter-dependencies, and the frequency of unexpected disruptions requiring Real-time adaptation. The benchmark includes 14 detailed problem specifications, 15 comparison methods including Random, LPT, SPT, STPT, MPSR, DRL-Liu, GP, GEP, LSO, SPT/TWKR, DRL-Chen, DRL-Zhang, 2+ evaluation metrics, and baseline implementations using 3+ LLMs including GPT-4o, Claude-3.7, DeepSeek-R1, and 4 contemporary frameworks including LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI, and Swarm, enabling rigorous testing of both single-agent and multi-agent planning capabilities. Through standardized evaluation criteria and scalable complexity, this benchmark aims to be opened to public, and drive progress in developing more adaptable, robust, and scalable AI planning systems for Real-world applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Computational scientific discovery increasingly relies on algorithms to process complex data and identify meaningful patterns - yet faces persistent challenges in gravitational-wave signal identification. While existing algorithmic approaches like matched filtering (MF) and deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved partial success, their limitations directly stem from fundamental limitations: MF's excessive computational demands arise from its reliance on predefined theoretical waveform templates, while DNNs' black-box architectures obscure decision logic and introduce hidden biases. We propose Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (Evo-MCTS), a framework that addresses these limitations through systematic algorithm space exploration guided by domain-aware physical constraints. Our approach combines tree-structured search with evolutionary optimization and large language model heuristics to create interpretable algorithmic solutions. Our Evo-MCTS framework demonstrates substantial improvements, achieving a 20.2\% improvement over state-of-the-art gravitational wave detection algorithms on the MLGWSC-1 benchmark dataset. High-performing algorithm variants consistently exceed thresholds. The framework generates human-interpretable algorithmic pathways that reveal distinct performance patterns. Beyond performance improvements, our framework discovers novel algorithmic combinations, thereby establishing a transferable methodology for automated algorithmic discovery across computational science domains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Morphology-aware policy learning is a means of enhancing policy sample efficiency by aggregating data from multiple agents. These types of policies have previously been shown to help generalize over dynamic, kinematic, and limb configuration variations between agent morphologies. Unfortunately, these policies still have sub-optimal zero-shot performance compared to end-to-end finetuning on morphologies at deployment. This limitation has ramifications in practical applications such as robotics because further data collection to perform end-to-end finetuning can be computationally expensive. In this work, we investigate combining morphology-aware pretraining with parameter efficient finetuning (PEFT) techniques to help reduce the learnable parameters necessary to specialize a morphology-aware policy to a target embodiment. We compare directly tuning sub-sets of model weights, input learnable adapters, and prefix tuning techniques for online finetuning. Our analysis reveals that PEFT techniques in conjunction with policy pre-training generally help reduce the number of samples to necessary to improve a policy compared to training models end-to-end from scratch. We further find that tuning as few as less than 1% of total parameters will improve policy performance compared the zero-shot performance of the base pretrained a policy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has significantly advanced the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it struggles to break through the inherent capability boundaries of the base LLM, due to its essentially on-policy strategy coupled with LLM's immense action space and sparse reward. Critically, RLVR can lead to the capability boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To address this problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel hybrid-policy optimization approach for LLMs that synergizes internal exploitation with external data to achieve stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base models. RL-PLUS integrates two core components, i.e., Multiple Importance Sampling to address distributional mismatch from external data, and Exploration-Based Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value, unexplored reasoning paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our approach. Compared with existing RLVR methods, RL-PLUS achieves 1) state-of-the-art performance on six math reasoning benchmarks; 2) superior performance on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks; 3) consistent and significant gains across diverse model families, with average relative improvements up to 69.2\%. Moreover, the analysis of Pass@k curves indicates that RL-PLUS effectively resolves the capability boundary collapse problem.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scientific knowledge is growing rapidly, making it difficult to track progress and high-level conceptual links across broad disciplines. While tools like citation networks and search engines help retrieve related papers, they lack the abstraction needed to capture the needed to represent the density and structure of activity across subfields.   We motivate SCIENCE HIERARCHOGRAPHY, the goal of organizing scientific literature into a high-quality hierarchical structure that spans multiple levels of abstraction -- from broad domains to specific studies. Such a representation can provide insights into which fields are well-explored and which are under-explored. To achieve this goal, we develop a hybrid approach that combines efficient embedding-based clustering with LLM-based prompting, striking a balance between scalability and semantic precision. Compared to LLM-heavy methods like iterative tree construction, our approach achieves superior quality-speed trade-offs. Our hierarchies capture different dimensions of research contributions, reflecting the interdisciplinary and multifaceted nature of modern science. We evaluate its utility by measuring how effectively an LLM-based agent can navigate the hierarchy to locate target papers. Results show that our method improves interpretability and offers an alternative pathway for exploring scientific literature beyond traditional search methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sellers at eBay are recommended keyphrases to bid on to enhance the performance of their advertising campaigns. The relevance of these keyphrases is crucial in avoiding the overcrowding of search systems with irrelevant items and maintaining a positive seller perception. It is essential that keyphrase recommendations align with both seller and Search judgments regarding auctions. Due to the difficulty in procuring negative human judgment at scale, employing LLM-as-a-judge to mimic seller judgment has been established as the norm in several studies. This study introduces a novel two-step LLM distillation process from a LLM-judge used to debias our Embedding Based Retrieval (EBR) model from the various biases that exist in click-data. We distill from an LLM teacher via a cross-encoder assistant into a bi-encoder student using a multi-task training approach, ultimately employing the student bi-encoder to retrieve relevant advertiser keyphrases. We show that integrating a knowledge distillation process from LLMs in a multi-task training setup enhances bi-encoder performance in retrieving relevant advertiser keyphrases at eBay.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) tend to attend heavily to the first token in the sequence -- creating a so-called attention sink. Many works have studied this phenomenon in detail, proposing various ways to either leverage or alleviate it. Attention sinks have been connected to quantisation difficulties, security issues, and streaming attention. Yet, while many works have provided conditions in which they occur or not, a critical question remains shallowly answered: Why do LLMs learn such patterns and how are they being used? In this work, we argue theoretically and empirically that this mechanism provides a method for LLMs to avoid over-mixing, connecting this to existing lines of work that study mathematically how information propagates in Transformers. We conduct experiments to validate our theoretical intuitions and show how choices such as context length, depth, and data packing influence the sink behaviour. We hope that this study provides a new practical perspective on why attention sinks are useful in LLMs, leading to a better understanding of the attention patterns that form during training.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the advancement of code generation capabilities in large language models (LLMs), their reliance on input premises has intensified. When users provide inputs containing faulty premises, the probability of code generation hallucinations rises significantly, exposing deficiencies in their self-scrutiny capabilities. This paper proposes Faulty Premises Bench (FPBench), the first code generation evaluation framework targeting faulty premises. By systematically constructing three categories of faulty premises and integrating multi-dimensional evaluation metrics, it conducts in-depth assessments of 15 representative LLMs. The key findings are as follows: (1) Most models exhibit poor reasoning abilities and suboptimal code generation performance under faulty premises, heavily relying on explicit prompts for error detection, with limited self-scrutiny capabilities; (2) Faulty premises trigger a point of diminishing returns in resource investment, leading to blindly increasing length fails to enhance quality; (3) The three types of faulty premises respectively activate distinct defect patterns in models, revealing a triple dissociation in the cognitive mechanisms of code generation models. This study not only highlights the urgent need for LLMs to proactively verify premises in code generation but also, through the proposed FPBench framework and multi-dimensional evaluation system, provides a theoretical foundation and practical pathway for developing reliable, human-centric code generation models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Unified Cognitive Consciousness Theory} (UCCT) casts them instead as vast unconscious pattern repositories: apparent reasoning arises only when external anchoring mechanisms, few shot prompts, retrieval-augmented context, fine-tuning, or multi-agent debate, activate task-relevant patterns. UCCT formalizes this process as Bayesian competition between statistical priors learned in pre-training and context-driven target patterns, yielding a single quantitative account that unifies existing adaptation techniques. We ground the theory in three principles: threshold crossing, modality universality, and density-distance predictive power, and validate them with (i) cross-domain demonstrations (text QA, image captioning, multi-agent debate) and (ii) two depth-oriented experiments: a controlled numeral-base study (bases 8, 9, 10) that isolates pattern-density effects, and a layer-wise trajectory analysis that reveals phase transitions inside a 7B-parameter model. Both experiments confirm UCCT's predictions of threshold behavior, asymmetric interference, and memory hysteresis. By showing that LLM ``intelligence'' is created through semantic anchoring rather than contained within the model, UCCT offers a principled foundation for interpretable diagnostics and practical guidance for prompt engineering, model selection, and alignment-centric system design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents Block, a distributed scheduling framework designed to optimize load balancing and auto-provisioning across instances in large language model serving frameworks by leveraging contextual information from incoming requests. Unlike popular model serving systems that rely on monolithic and heuristic task schedulers, Block operates as a fully distributed, stateless, and predictive scheduling system to achieve low overhead, reliability, and scalability. It leverages the deterministic and predictable characteristics of LLM inferences, such as host configurations, response lengths, and hardware performance, to make scheduling decisions based on accurately predicted metrics. Evaluation on a 12 GPUs cluster shows that Block significantly outperforms heuristic schedulers, boosting serving capacity by up to 16.7\% and reducing P99 tail latency by up to 49.5\%. These performance gains remain consistent across diverse models, workloads and configurations. Code and data are open-sourced.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generation-based fuzzing produces appropriate testing cases according to specifications of input grammars and semantic constraints to test systems and software. However, these specifications require significant manual efforts to construct. This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large Language Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based fuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over fuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels the synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance. Compared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of real-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2) synthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared ELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized by state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more coverage and triggers up to 174.0% more artificially injected bugs. We also used ELFuzz to conduct a real-world fuzzing campaign on the newest version of cvc5 for 14 days, and encouragingly, it found five 0-day bugs (three are exploitable). Moreover, we conducted an ablation study, which shows that the fuzzer space model, the key component of ELFuzz, contributes the most (up to 62.5%) to the effectiveness of ELFuzz. Further analysis of the fuzzers synthesized by ELFuzz confirms that they catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. The results present the promising potential of ELFuzz for more automated, efficient, and extensible input generation for fuzzing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex domains such as logical reasoning and experimental coding. Motivated by these advancements, numerous studies have explored the application of AI in the innovation process, particularly in the context of scientific research. These AI technologies primarily aim to develop systems that can autonomously conduct research processes across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Despite these significant strides, a comprehensive survey on AI for Research (AI4Research) remains absent, which hampers our understanding and impedes further development in this field. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive survey and offer a unified perspective on AI4Research. Specifically, the main contributions of our work are as follows: (1) Systematic taxonomy: We first introduce a systematic taxonomy to classify five mainstream tasks in AI4Research. (2) New frontiers: Then, we identify key research gaps and highlight promising future directions, focusing on the rigor and scalability of automated experiments, as well as the societal impact. (3) Abundant applications and resources: Finally, we compile a wealth of resources, including relevant multidisciplinary applications, data corpora, and tools. We hope our work will provide the research community with quick access to these resources and stimulate innovative breakthroughs in AI4Research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Existing LLM-based compiler fuzzers often produce syntactically or semantically invalid test programs, limiting their effectiveness in exercising compiler optimizations and backend components. We introduce ReFuzzer, a framework for refining LLM-generated test programs by systematically detecting and correcting compilation and runtime violations (e.g. division by zero or array out-of-bounds accesses). ReFuzzer employs a feedback loop with a local LLM to validate and filter erroneous programs before execution, improving fuzzing effectiveness beyond crash detection and enabling the generation of diverse yet valid test programs.   We evaluated ReFuzzer's effectiveness across black-, grey- and white-box fuzzing approaches targeting LLVM/Clang. ReFuzzer improved test programs' validity from 47.0-49.4% to 96.6-97.3%, with an average processing time of 2.9-3.5 s per test program on a dual-GPU machine. Further, refuzzing significantly increased code coverage in critical optimization and IR generation components. For example, vectorization coverage had an absolute improvement of 9.2%, 2.3%, and 7.1% in black-, grey-, and white-box fuzzing, enhancing testing effectiveness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Existing post-hoc model-agnostic methods generate external explanations for opaque models, primarily by locally attributing the model output to its input features. However, they often lack an explicit and systematic framework for quantifying the contribution of individual features. Building on the Taylor expansion framework introduced by Deng et al. (2024) to unify existing local attribution methods, we propose a rigorous set of postulates -- "precision", "federation", and "zero-discrepancy" -- to govern Taylor term-specific attribution. Guided by these postulates, we introduce TaylorPODA (Taylor expansion-derived imPortance-Order aDapted Attribution), which incorporates an additional "adaptation" property. This property enables alignment with task-specific goals, especially in post-hoc settings lacking ground-truth explanations. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that TaylorPODA achieves competitive results against baseline methods, providing principled and visualization-friendly explanations. This work enhances the trustworthy deployment of opaque models by offering explanations with stronger theoretical grounding.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurate crop yield forecasting is essential for global food security. However, current AI models systematically underperform when yields deviate from historical trends. This issue arises from key data challenges, including a major asymmetry between rich pretraining weather datasets and the limited data available for fine-tuning. We introduce VITA (Variational Inference Transformer for Asymmetric data), a variational pretraining framework that addresses this asymmetry. Instead of relying on input reconstruction, VITA uses detailed weather variables as proxy targets during pretraining and learns to predict rich atmospheric states through self-supervised feature masking. This allows the model to be fine-tuned using only basic weather statistics during deployment. Applied to 763 counties in the U.S. Corn Belt, VITA achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting corn and soybean yields across all evaluation scenarios. While it consistently delivers superior performance under normal conditions, its advantages are particularly pronounced during extreme weather years, with statistically significant improvements (paired t-test, $p \approx 0.01$). Importantly, VITA outperforms prior frameworks like GNN-RNN using less data, making it more practical for real-world use--particularly in data-scarce regions. This work highlights how domain-aware AI design can overcome data limitations and support resilient agricultural forecasting in a changing climate.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing adoption of web crawling opt-outs by copyright holders of online content raises critical questions about the impact of data compliance on large language model (LLM) performance. However, little is known about how these restrictions (and the resultant filtering of pretraining datasets) affect the capabilities of models trained using these corpora. In this work, we conceptualize this effect as the $\textit{data compliance gap}$ (DCG), which quantifies the performance difference between models trained on datasets that comply with web crawling opt-outs, and those that do not. We measure the data compliance gap in two settings: pretraining models from scratch and continual pretraining from existing compliant models (simulating a setting where copyrighted data could be integrated later in pretraining). Our experiments with 1.5B models show that, as of January 2025, compliance with web data opt-outs does not degrade general knowledge acquisition (close to 0\% DCG). However, in specialized domains such as biomedical research, excluding major publishers leads to performance declines. These findings suggest that while general-purpose LLMs can be trained to perform equally well using fully open data, performance in specialized domains may benefit from access to high-quality copyrighted sources later in training. Our study provides empirical insights into the long-debated trade-off between data compliance and downstream model performance, informing future discussions on AI training practices and policy decisions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Lifelogging refers to the process of passively collecting, storing, and analysing personal daily life data using wearable devices. This data can support applications in memory preservation and enhancement. For example, using an ask-and-answer strategy, question-answering (QA) on lifelog data opens an interactive and interesting way to explore memorable events and insights into daily life. However, research resources for QA on lifelog data are limited to small-sized or synthetic QA datasets. In this paper, we present a novel lifelog QA dataset called OpenLifelogQA, building upon an 18-month lifelog dataset. Our dataset focuses on an open-ended and practical QA with real-world application in daily lifelog usage. We construct 14,187 pairs of Q&A with diverse types and difficulty levels. A baseline experiment is reported for this dataset with competitive average performance of 89.7% BERT Score, 25.87% ROUGE-L and 3.9665 LLM Score from LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave 7B model. We release this Q&A dataset to the research community to support new research into lifelog technologies, such as enabling personal chat-based assistants for lifelog data to become a reality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from performance degradation when faced with domain shifts, primarily due to catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose KILO (Knowledge-Instructed Learning for Continual Adaptation), a novel continual learning framework that integrates dynamic knowledge graphs with instruction tuning. By leveraging retrieved domain-specific knowledge as guidance during training, KILO enhances both adaptability to new domains and retention of previously acquired knowledge. We pretrain our model on WikiText-103 and evaluate sequential adaptation across four diverse target domains: BioASQ, SciQ, TweetEval, and MIND. Our experiments demonstrate that KILO consistently outperforms strong baselines, including continual fine-tuning, ERNIE 2.0, and CPT, in terms of backward transfer, forward transfer, F1 score, retention rate, and training efficiency. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining structured knowledge retrieval and instruction prompting to overcome domain shift challenges in continual learning scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In today's rapidly evolving field of electronic design automation (EDA), the complexity of hardware designs is increasing, necessitating more sophisticated automation solutions. High-level synthesis (HLS), as a pivotal solution, automates hardware designs from high-level abstractions (e.g., C/C++). However, it faces significant challenges, particularly in design space exploration and optimization. While large language models (LLMs) have shown notable capabilities in code generation, their application to HLS has been limited due to the scarcity of (publicly) available HLS code datasets. Hence, research in this domain has primarily focused on techniques such as prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces SAGE-HLS, the first-of-its-kind fine-tuned LLM specifically for HLS code generation. Our method includes three key advancements: (i) We implement Verilog-to-C/C++ porting, converting verified and synthesizable Verilog codes into corresponding C, creating a dataset of 16.7K HLS codes; (ii) We implement a fine-tuning strategy, which is based on instruction prompting to code generation guided by abstract syntax tree (AST); (iii) We develop a semi-automated evaluation framework using VerilogEval to assess the functionality of the generated HLS code. Our experiments show that SAGE-HLS, fined-tuned on the QwenCoder (2.5) 7B model, achieves a near 100% success rate in code synthesizability and a 75% success rate in functional correctness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Process Reward Model (PRM) is widely used in the post-training of Large Language Model (LLM) because it can perform fine-grained evaluation of the reasoning steps of generated content. However, most PRMs lack long-term reasoning and deep thinking capabilities. On the other hand, although a few works have tried to introduce Chain-of-Thought capability into PRMs, the annotation cost of CoT-PRM data is too expensive to play a stable role in various tasks. To address the above challenges, we propose VRPRM, a process reward model via visual reasoning, and design an efficient two-stage training strategy. Experimental results show that using only 3.6K CoT-PRM SFT data and 50K non-CoT PRM RL training data, VRPRM can surpass the non-thinking PRM with a total data volume of 400K and achieved a relative performance improvement of up to 118\% over the base model in the BoN experiment. This result confirms that the proposed combined training strategy can achieve higher quality reasoning capabilities at a lower data annotation cost, thus providing a new paradigm for PRM training with more efficient data utilization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to address hallucination issues in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the integration of multiple retrieval sources, while potentially more informative, introduces new challenges that can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination problems. These challenges manifest primarily in two aspects: the sparse distribution of multi-source data that hinders the capture of logical relationships and the inherent inconsistencies among different sources that lead to information conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose MultiRAG, a novel framework designed to mitigate hallucination in multi-source retrieval-augmented generation through knowledge-guided approaches. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a knowledge construction module that employs multi-source line graphs to efficiently aggregate logical relationships across different knowledge sources, effectively addressing the sparse data distribution issue; and (2) a sophisticated retrieval module that implements a multi-level confidence calculation mechanism, performing both graph-level and node-level assessments to identify and eliminate unreliable information nodes, thereby reducing hallucinations caused by inter-source inconsistencies. Extensive experiments on four multi-domain query datasets and two multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that MultiRAG significantly enhances the reliability and efficiency of knowledge retrieval in complex multi-source scenarios. \textcolor{blue}{Our code is available in https://github.com/wuwenlong123/MultiRAG.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The growing scale of evaluation tasks has led to the widespread adoption of automated evaluation using large language models, a paradigm known as "LLMas-a-judge." However, improving its alignment with human preferences without complex prompts or fine-tuning remains challenging. In this work, motivated by preliminary findings that middle-to-upper layers encode semantically and taskrelevant representations that are often more aligned with human judgments than the final layer, we propose LAGER, a lightweight and efficient framework for enhancing LLM-as-a-Judge alignment with human scoring, via internal representations. LAGER produces fine-grained judgment scores by aggregating cross-layer scoretoken logits and computing the expected score from a softmax-based distribution, with the LLM backbone kept frozen. LAGER fully leverages the complementary information across different layers, overcoming the limitations of relying solely on the final layer. We evaluate our method on the standard alignment benchmarks Flask, HelpSteer, and BIGGen using Spearman correlation, and find that LAGER achieves improvements of up to 7.5% over the best baseline across these benchmarks. Without reasoning steps, LAGER matches or outperforms reasoning-based methods. Experiments on downstream applications, such as data selection and emotional understanding, further show the effectiveness of our method.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic generation of step-by-step augmented reality (AR) instructions for a wide range of physical tasks. However, existing LLM-based AR guidance often lacks rich visual augmentations to effectively embed instructions into spatial context for a better user understanding. We present Guided Reality, a fully automated AR system that generates embedded and dynamic visual guidance based on step-by-step instructions. Our system integrates LLMs and vision models to: 1) generate multi-step instructions from user queries, 2) identify appropriate types of visual guidance, 3) extract spatial information about key interaction points in the real world, and 4) embed visual guidance in physical space to support task execution. Drawing from a corpus of user manuals, we define five categories of visual guidance and propose an identification strategy based on the current step. We evaluate the system through a user study (N=16), completing real-world tasks and exploring the system in the wild. Additionally, four instructors shared insights on how Guided Reality could be integrated into their training workflows.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive multilingual capabilities through pretraining on diverse corpora. Although these models show strong reasoning abilities, their performance varies significantly between languages due to the imbalanced distribution of training data. Existing approaches using sample-level translation for extensive multilingual pretraining and cross-lingual tuning face scalability challenges and often fail to capture nuanced reasoning processes across languages. In this paper, we introduce AdaMCOT (Adaptive Multilingual Chain-of-Thought), a framework that enhances multilingual factual reasoning by dynamically routing thought processes in intermediary "thinking languages" before generating target-language responses. AdaMCOT leverages a language-agnostic core and incorporates an adaptive, reward-based mechanism for selecting optimal reasoning pathways without requiring additional pretraining. Our comprehensive evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates substantial improvements in both factual reasoning quality and cross-lingual consistency, with particularly strong performance gains in low-resource language settings. An in-depth analysis of the model's hidden states and semantic space further elucidates the underlying mechanism of our method. The results suggest that adaptive reasoning paths can effectively bridge the performance gap between high and low-resource languages while maintaining cultural and linguistic nuances.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Effectively adapting powerful pretrained foundation models to diverse tasks remains a key challenge in AI deployment. Current approaches primarily follow two paradigms:discrete optimization of text prompts through prompt engineering, or continuous adaptation via additional trainable parameters. Both exhibit limitations-discrete methods lack refinement precision while parameter-based techniques increase complexity and reduce interpretability. To address these constraints, we propose EmbedGrad, a novel framework that optimizes text prompt embeddings through gradient-based refinement. Our approach uniquely decouples training from deployment:during optimization,labeled examples guide precise embedding adjustments while preserving semantic meaning; during inference, only optimized embeddings integrate with user queries. This enables fine-grained calibration impossible in text space, such as enhancing the reasoning capability of prompts like please reason step by step. Comprehensive evaluations across mathematical reasoning, sentiment analysis, and causal judgment tasks demonstrate EmbedGrad's effectiveness:optimizing this reasoning prompt for Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B increased accuracy from 14.74\% to 58.96\% on mathematical problems. Consistent improvements were observed across model scales (0.5B-14B) and all tasks, with particularly significant gains for smaller models on complex problems like causal judgment. By bridging prompt engineering and parameter efficiency without architectural changes, our work establishes embedding refinement as a powerful new paradigm for task adaptation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is essential for reducing the computational overhead of large language models (LLMs). Low-rank family adapters are commonly used to control the parameter size efficiently while maintaining the generative power of LLMs. However, their limited expressiveness due to the rank constraint often restricts their performance on complex tasks. We propose Mixture of Kronecker Adapters (MoKA), a new generation of Kronecker adapters that addresses this limitation by modeling weight updates as a mixture of Kronecker products. Our proposed adapter leverages a gating mechanism that measures the importance of each Kronecker factor, enabling more expressive adaptation. Moreover, MoKA enables a rank flexibility that provides a better trade-off between parameter efficiency and accuracy. To ensure hardware efficiency, we reformulate Kronecker computations using standard matrix operations, allowing seamless deployment on GPU-optimized hardware. We conduct extensive experiments on instruction-tuning and commonsense reasoning tasks using low-bit quantized versions of LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA3-8B models. MoKA not only outperforms PEFT baselines, but also reduces the number of trainable parameters up to 27x, achieving state-of-the-art trade-offs between performance and parameter efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a distributed learning paradigm that enables collaborative training over large-scale subgraphs located on multiple local systems. However, most existing FGL approaches rely on synchronous communication, which leads to inefficiencies and is often impractical in real-world deployments. Meanwhile, current asynchronous federated learning (AFL) methods are primarily designed for conventional tasks such as image classification and natural language processing, without accounting for the unique topological properties of graph data. Directly applying these methods to graph learning can possibly result in semantic drift and representational inconsistency in the global model. To address these challenges, we propose FedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous federated framework that leverages both inter-client label distribution divergence and graph topological characteristics through a novel ClusterCast mechanism for efficient training. We evaluate FedSA-GCL on multiple real-world graph datasets using the Louvain and Metis split algorithms, and compare it against 9 baselines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong robustness and outstanding efficiency, outperforming the baselines by an average of 2.92% with the Louvain and by 3.4% with the Metis.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite the impressive performance of LLMs on English-based tasks, little is known about their capabilities in specific languages such as Filipino. In this work, we address this gap by introducing FilBench, a Filipino-centric benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs across a diverse set of tasks and capabilities in Filipino, Tagalog, and Cebuano. We carefully curate the tasks in FilBench to reflect the priorities and trends of NLP research in the Philippines such as Cultural Knowledge, Classical NLP, Reading Comprehension, and Generation. By evaluating 27 state-of-the-art LLMs on FilBench, we find that several LLMs suffer from reading comprehension and translation capabilities. Our results indicate that FilBench is challenging, with the best model, GPT-4o, achieving only a score of 72.23%. Moreover, we also find that models trained specifically for Southeast Asian languages tend to underperform on FilBench, with the highest-performing model, SEA-LION v3 70B, achieving only a score of 61.07%. Our work demonstrates the value of curating language-specific LLM benchmarks to aid in driving progress on Filipino NLP and increasing the inclusion of Philippine languages in LLM development.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) framework has become a widely used approach for multimodal representation learning, particularly in image-text retrieval and clustering. However, its efficacy is constrained by three key limitations: (1) text token truncation, (2) isolated image-text encoding, and (3) deficient compositionality due to bag-of-words behavior. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances in generalized vision-language understanding, their potential for learning transferable multimodal representations remains underexplored.In this work, we present UniME (Universal Multimodal Embedding), a novel two-stage framework that leverages MLLMs to learn discriminative representations for diverse downstream tasks. In the first stage, we perform textual discriminative knowledge distillation from a powerful LLM-based teacher model to enhance the embedding capability of the MLLM\'s language component. In the second stage, we introduce hard negative enhanced instruction tuning to further advance discriminative representation learning. Specifically, we initially mitigate false negative contamination and then sample multiple hard negatives per instance within each batch, forcing the model to focus on challenging samples. This approach not only improves discriminative power but also enhances instruction-following ability in downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and multiple retrieval tasks, including short and long caption retrieval and compositional retrieval. Results demonstrate that UniME achieves consistent performance improvement across all tasks, exhibiting superior discriminative and compositional capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cross-domain Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation (CD-FSMIS) is a potential solution for segmenting medical images with limited annotation using knowledge from other domains. The significant performance of current CD-FSMIS models relies on the heavily training procedure over other source medical domains, which degrades the universality and ease of model deployment. With the development of large visual models of natural images, we propose a training-free CD-FSMIS model that introduces the Multi-center Adaptive Uncertainty-aware Prompting (MAUP) strategy for adapting the foundation model Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is trained with natural images, into the CD-FSMIS task. To be specific, MAUP consists of three key innovations: (1) K-means clustering based multi-center prompts generation for comprehensive spatial coverage, (2) uncertainty-aware prompts selection that focuses on the challenging regions, and (3) adaptive prompt optimization that can dynamically adjust according to the target region complexity. With the pre-trained DINOv2 feature encoder, MAUP achieves precise segmentation results across three medical datasets without any additional training compared with several conventional CD-FSMIS models and training-free FSMIS model.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Research on applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Large Language Models (LLMs) has mostly been focused on single-turn problems, such as mathematical reasoning or single-shot code generation. While these problems can be viewed as token-level multi-turn MDPs, this view corresponds to a degenerate case of multi-turn interaction where the environment provides no feedback. This contrasts with many real-world domains, such as software engineering (SWE), which require rich multi-turn interactions with a stateful environment that responds to each action with a non-trivial observation.   To bridge this gap, we demonstrate the successful application of RL to this general regime. Using a modified Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO) algorithm, we train an agent based on Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to solve real-world software engineering tasks. Our approach increases the agent's success rate on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark from a 20% rejection fine-tuned baseline to 39%, without relying on any teacher models. On SWE-rebench, our agent matches or outperforms leading open-weight models such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Qwen3-235B-A22B using an identical scaffolding, offering a viable path toward building more capable autonomous agents for complex real-world problems based on open models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to perform explicit multi-step reasoning such as chain-of-thought prompting. However, their intermediate steps often contain errors that can propagate leading to inaccurate final predictions. Additionally, LLMs still struggle with hallucinations and often fail to adhere to prescribed output formats, which is particularly problematic for tasks like generating mathematical expressions or source code. This work introduces EDCIM (Error Detection and Correction for Interpretable Mathematics), a method for detecting and correcting these errors in interpretable mathematics tasks, where the model must generate the exact functional form that explicitly solve the problem (expressed in natural language) rather than a black-box solution. EDCIM uses LLMs to generate a system of equations for a given problem, followed by a symbolic error-detection framework that identifies errors and provides targeted feedback for LLM-based correction. To optimize efficiency, EDCIM integrates lightweight, open-source LLMs with more powerful proprietary models, balancing cost and accuracy. This balance is controlled by a single hyperparameter, allowing users to control the trade-off based on their cost and accuracy requirements. Experimental results across different datasets show that EDCIM significantly reduces both computational and financial costs, while maintaining, and even improving, prediction accuracy when the balance is properly configured.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Product sustainability reports provide valuable insights into the environmental impacts of a product and are often distributed in PDF format. These reports often include a combination of tables and text, which complicates their analysis. The lack of standardization and the variability in reporting formats further exacerbate the difficulty of extracting and interpreting relevant information from large volumes of documents. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of answering questions related to carbon footprints within sustainability reports available in PDF format. Unlike previous approaches, our focus is on addressing the difficulties posed by the unstructured and inconsistent nature of text extracted from PDF parsing. To facilitate this analysis, we introduce CarbonPDF-QA, an open-source dataset containing question-answer pairs for 1735 product report documents, along with human-annotated answers. Our analysis shows that GPT-4o struggles to answer questions with data inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we propose CarbonPDF, an LLM-based technique specifically designed to answer carbon footprint questions on such datasets. We develop CarbonPDF by fine-tuning Llama 3 with our training data. Our results show that our technique outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques, including question-answering (QA) systems finetuned on table and text data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As enterprise codebases continue to grow in scale and complexity, the volume of lint errors far exceeds engineers' manual remediation capacity, leading to continuous accumulation of technical debt and hindered development efficiency. This paper presents BitsAI-Fix, an automated lint error remediation workflow based on Large Language Models (LLMs), designed to address this critical challenge in industrial-scale environments. BitsAI-Fix employs tree-sitter for context expansion and generates search-and-replace format patches through specially trained LLMs, followed by lint scan re-verification to output final remediation results. Additionally, our approach introduces an innovative progressive reinforcement learning (RL) training strategy that can automatically acquire verifiable training data during the project cold-start phase and continuously iterate the model by collecting online samples through feedback after system deployment. Furthermore, we designed a targeted rule-based reward mechanism that combines format rewards and correctness rewards while penalizing redundant modifications. We also propose a "code diff matching" methodology to continuously track online effectiveness. In production deployment at ByteDance, our solution has supported over 5,000 engineers, resolved more than 12,000 static analysis issues, achieved approximately 85% remediation accuracy, with around 1,000 weekly active adopters. This work demonstrates the practical feasibility of LLM-based code remediation solutions in enterprise environments and serves as a reference for automated code fix in large-scale industrial scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As smart homes become increasingly prevalent, intelligent models are widely used for tasks such as anomaly detection and behavior prediction. These models are typically trained on static datasets, making them brittle to behavioral drift caused by seasonal changes, lifestyle shifts, or evolving routines. However, collecting new behavior data for retraining is often impractical due to its slow pace, high cost, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose SmartGen, an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior data to support continual adaptation of downstream smart home models. SmartGen consists of four key components. First, we design a Time and Semantic-aware Split module to divide long behavior sequences into manageable, semantically coherent subsequences under dual time-span constraints. Second, we propose Semantic-aware Sequence Compression to reduce input length while preserving representative semantics by clustering behavior mapping in latent space. Third, we introduce Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, which constructs a behavior relationship graph and encodes frequent transitions into prompts, guiding the LLM to generate data aligned with contextual changes while retaining core behavior patterns. Finally, we design a Two-stage Outlier Filter to identify and remove implausible or semantically inconsistent outputs, aiming to improve the factual coherence and behavioral validity of the generated sequences. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartGen significantly enhances model performance on anomaly detection and behavior prediction tasks under behavioral drift, with anomaly detection improving by 85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51% on average.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) gain prominence, ensuring their safe deployment has become critical. Recent studies have explored VLM robustness against jailbreak attacks-techniques that exploit model vulnerabilities to elicit harmful outputs. However, the limited availability of diverse multimodal data has constrained current approaches to rely heavily on adversarial or manually crafted images derived from harmful text datasets, which often lack effectiveness and diversity across different contexts. In this paper, we propose IDEATOR, a novel jailbreak method that autonomously generates malicious image-text pairs for black-box jailbreak attacks. IDEATOR is grounded in the insight that VLMs themselves could serve as powerful red team models for generating multimodal jailbreak prompts. Specifically, IDEATOR leverages a VLM to create targeted jailbreak texts and pairs them with jailbreak images generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate IDEATOR's high effectiveness and transferability, achieving a 94% attack success rate (ASR) in jailbreaking MiniGPT-4 with an average of only 5.34 queries, and high ASRs of 82%, 88%, and 75% when transferred to LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and Chameleon, respectively. Building on IDEATOR's strong transferability and automated process, we introduce the VLJailbreakBench, a safety benchmark comprising 3,654 multimodal jailbreak samples. Our benchmark results on 11 recently released VLMs reveal significant gaps in safety alignment. For instance, our challenge set achieves ASRs of 46.31% on GPT-4o and 19.65% on Claude-3.5-Sonnet, underscoring the urgent need for stronger defenses.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Various Deep Learning-based approaches with pre-trained language models have been proposed for automatically repairing software vulnerabilities. However, these approaches are limited to a specific programming language (C/C++). Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer language-agnostic capabilities and strong semantic understanding, exhibiting potential to overcome multilingual vulnerability limitations. Although some work has begun to explore LLMs' repair performance, their effectiveness is unsatisfactory. To address these limitations, we conducted a large-scale empirical study to investigate the performance of automated vulnerability repair approaches and state-of-the-art LLMs across seven programming languages. Results show GPT-4o, instruction-tuned with few-shot prompting, performs competitively against the leading approach, VulMaster. Additionally, the LLM-based approach shows superior performance in repairing unique vulnerabilities and is more likely to repair the most dangerous vulnerabilities. Instruction-tuned GPT-4o demonstrates strong generalization on vulnerabilities in previously unseen language, outperforming existing approaches. Analysis shows Go consistently achieves the highest effectiveness across all model types, while C/C++ performs the worst. Based on findings, we discuss the promise of LLM on multilingual vulnerability repair and the reasons behind LLM's failed cases. This work takes the first look at repair approaches and LLMs across multiple languages, highlighting the promising future of adopting LLMs for multilingual vulnerability repair.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rapid growth in demand for AI-generated content (AIGC), edge AIGC service providers (ASPs) have become indispensable. However, designing incentive mechanisms that motivate ASPs to deliver high-quality AIGC services remains a challenge, especially in the presence of information asymmetry. In this paper, we address bonus design between a teleoperator and an edge ASP when the teleoperator cannot observe the ASP's private settings and chosen actions (diffusion steps). We formulate this as an online learning contract design problem and decompose it into two subproblems: ASP's settings inference and contract derivation. To tackle the NP-hard setting-inference subproblem with unknown variable sizes, we introduce a large language model (LLM)-empowered framework that iteratively refines a naive seed solver using the LLM's domain expertise. Upon obtaining the solution from the LLM-evolved solver, we directly address the contract derivation problem using convex optimization techniques and obtain a near-optimal contract. Simulation results on our Unity-based teleoperation platform show that our method boosts the teleoperator's utility by $5 \sim 40\%$ compared to benchmarks, while preserving positive incentives for the ASP.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Evaluating the mathematical capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical yet challenging frontier. Existing benchmarks fall short, particularly for proof-centric problems, as manual creation is unscalable and costly, leaving the true mathematical abilities of LLMs largely unassessed. To overcome these barriers, we propose Proof2Hybrid, the first fully automated framework that synthesizes high-quality, proof-centric benchmarks from natural language mathematical corpora. The key novelty of our solution is Proof2X, a roadmap of converting mathematical proofs into various kinds of questions that are easy to verify. Instructed by this roadmap, we propose a new type of hybrid-formatted questions, named ``$m$-out-of-$n$ multiple judge questions'', specifically designed to enable robust, automatic evaluation while being resilient to guessing and superficial pattern matching inherent in traditional formats. As a demonstration of our framework, we introduce AlgGeoTest, a benchmark for algebraic geometry--a frontier domain of modern mathematics--comprising 456 challenging items. Our extensive evaluations on state-of-the-art LLMs using AlgGeoTest reveal profound deficits in their comprehension of algebraic geometry, providing a more precise measure of their true mathematical capabilities. Our framework and benchmark pave the way for a new wave of in-depth research into the mathematical intelligence of AI systems.

By contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) encapsulate extensive world knowledge and exhibit powerful context modeling capabilities, making them promising for mitigating the limitations of traditional methods. However, direct fine-tuning of LLMs for KGC, though effective, imposes substantial computational and memory overheads, while utilizing non-fine-tuned LLMs is efficient but yields suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose a novel framework that synergizes the strengths of LLMs with robust knowledge representation to enable effective and efficient KGC. We extract the context-aware hidden states of knowledge triples from the intermediate layers of LLMs, thereby capturing rich semantic and relational nuances. These representations are then utilized to train a data-efficient classifier tailored specifically for KGC tasks. To bridge the semantic gaps between LLMs and KGs, we employ subgraph sampling on KGs to generate model-friendly entity descriptions. We further adopt sliced mutual information (SMI) as a principled metric to quantify the task-specific information encoded in these representations. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach. We achieve a 47\% relative improvement over previous methods based on non-fine-tuned LLMs and, to our knowledge, are the first to achieve classification performance comparable to fine-tuned LLMs while enhancing GPU memory efficiency by $188\times$ and accelerating training and inference by $26.11\times$.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rise of scaled-out LLMs and scaled-up SuperPods signals a new era in large-scale AI infrastructure. LLMs continue to scale out via MoE, as seen in recent models like DeepSeek, Kimi, and Qwen. In parallel, AI hardware is scaling up, with Huawei's CloudMatrix384 SuperPod offering hundreds of GB/s high-speed interconnects. Running large MoE models on SuperPod-scale hardware brings new challenges. It requires new execution models, scalable scheduling, efficient expert load balancing, and elimination of single points of failure. This paper presents xDeepServe, Huawei Cloud's LLM serving system designed for SuperPod-scale infrastructure. At its core is Transformerless, a disaggregated architecture that decomposes transformer models into modular units--attention, feedforward, and MoE--executed independently on NPUs connected via high-speed fabric. We implement this design in two forms: disaggregated prefill-decode and disaggregated MoE-attention. This fully disaggregated setup enables independent scaling of compute and memory without sacrificing performance. To support this architecture, we propose XCCL, a communication library that leverages CloudMatrix384's global shared memory to implement efficient point-to-point and all-to-all primitives. We also extend our serving engine FlowServe with system-level techniques, enabling scalable inference across hundreds of NPUs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Drug discovery frequently loses momentum when data, expertise, and tools are scattered, slowing design cycles. To shorten this loop we built a hierarchical, tool using agent framework that automates molecular optimisation. A Principal Researcher defines each objective, a Database agent retrieves target information, an AI Expert generates de novo scaffolds with a sequence to molecule deep learning model, a Medicinal Chemist edits them while invoking a docking tool, a Ranking agent scores the candidates, and a Scientific Critic polices the logic. Each tool call is summarised and stored causing the full reasoning path to remain inspectable. The agents communicate through concise provenance records that capture molecular lineage, to build auditable, molecule centered reasoning trajectories and reuse successful transformations via in context learning. Three cycle research loops were run against AKT1 protein using five large language models. After ranking the models by mean docking score, we ran 20 independent scale ups on the two top performers. We then compared the leading LLMs' binding affinity results across three configurations, LLM only, single agent, and multi agent. Our results reveal an architectural trade off, the multi agent setting excelled at focused binding optimization, improving average predicted binding affinity by 31%. In contrast, single agent runs generated molecules with superior drug like properties at the cost of less potent binding scores. Unguided LLM runs finished fastest, yet their lack of transparent tool signals left the validity of their reasoning paths unverified. These results show that test time scaling, focused feedback loops and provenance convert general purpose LLMs into auditable systems for molecular design, and suggest that extending the toolset to ADMET and selectivity predictors could push research workflows further along the discovery pipeline.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Human cognition naturally engages with abstract and fluid concepts, whereas existing reasoning models often rely on generating discrete tokens, potentially constraining their expressive capabilities. Recent advancements aim to address this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft, abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space. This paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by examining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques. Contrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs predominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during subsequent decoding steps. This reliance hinders the exploration of different reasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding, obscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens. To tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce \emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential of Soft Thinking. Notably, the Gumbel-Softmax trick provides adequate randomness with controlled smoothness, resulting in superior performance across eight reasoning benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid expansion of publicly-available medical data presents a challenge for clinicians and researchers alike, increasing the gap between the volume of scientific literature and its applications. The steady growth of studies and findings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to systematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents an approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG) generation to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of large language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts into semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from these sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain and ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate ontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during extraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming `quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing natural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original propositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity for generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated sentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context variable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new relationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge graph. This approach leads the way to provide medical practitioners with a centralised, updated in real-time, and sustainable knowledge source, and may be the foundation of similar gains in a wide variety of fields.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We adapt alignment techniques from reasoning LLMs to the task of generating engineering sketch constraints found in computer-aided design (CAD) models. Engineering sketches consist of geometric primitives (e.g. points, lines) connected by constraints (e.g. perpendicular, tangent) that define the relationships between them. For a design to be easily editable, the constraints must effectively capture design intent, ensuring the geometry updates predictably when parameters change. Although current approaches can generate CAD designs, an open challenge remains to align model outputs with design intent, we label this problem 'design alignment'. A critical first step towards aligning generative CAD models is to generate constraints which fully-constrain all geometric primitives, without over-constraining or distorting sketch geometry. Using alignment techniques to train an existing constraint generation model with feedback from a constraint solver, we are able to fully-constrain 93% of sketches compared to 34% when using a naive supervised fine-tuning (SFT) baseline and only 8.9% without SFT. Our approach can be applied to any existing constraint generation model and sets the stage for further research bridging alignment strategies between the language and design domains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce AI on the Pulse, a real-world-ready anomaly detection system that continuously monitors patients using a fusion of wearable sensors, ambient intelligence, and advanced AI models. Powered by UniTS, a state-of-the-art (SoTA) universal time-series model, our framework autonomously learns each patient's unique physiological and behavioral patterns, detecting subtle deviations that signal potential health risks. Unlike classification methods that require impractical, continuous labeling in real-world scenarios, our approach uses anomaly detection to provide real-time, personalized alerts for reactive home-care interventions. Our approach outperforms 12 SoTA anomaly detection methods, demonstrating robustness across both high-fidelity medical devices (ECG) and consumer wearables, with a ~ 22% improvement in F1 score. However, the true impact of AI on the Pulse lies in @HOME, where it has been successfully deployed for continuous, real-world patient monitoring. By operating with non-invasive, lightweight devices like smartwatches, our system proves that high-quality health monitoring is possible without clinical-grade equipment. Beyond detection, we enhance interpretability by integrating LLMs, translating anomaly scores into clinically meaningful insights for healthcare professionals.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Being able to use tools is a widely recognised indicator of intelligence across species. Humans, for instance, have demonstrated mastery of tool use for over two million years. The ability to use tools is invaluable as it extends an organism's reach and enhances its capacity to interact with objects and the environment. Being able to understand the geometric-mechanical relations between the tools-objects-environments allows certain species (e.g., apes and crows) to reach food in narrow constrained spaces. The same principles of physical augmentation and its associated non-prehensile manipulation capabilities also apply to robotic systems. For example, by instrumenting them with different types of end-effectors, robots can (in principle) dexterously interact (e.g., push and flip) with objects of various shapes and masses akin to its biological counterpart. However, developing this type of manipulation skill is still an open research problem. Furthermore, the complexity of planning tool-object manipulation tasks, particularly in coordinating the actions of dual-arm robots, presents significant challenges. To address these complexities, we propose integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in planning and executing these intricate manipulations, thereby enhancing the robot's ability to perform in diverse scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Explainability and its emerging counterpart contestability have become important normative and design principles for trustworthy AI as they enable users and subjects to understand and challenge AI decisions. However, realizing these principles is difficult, as they assume different meanings in technical, legal, and organizational dimensions of AI regulation. To resolve this conceptual polysemy, in this paper, we present the findings of an interview study with 14 experts to examine the intersection and implementation of explainability and contestability, and their understanding in different research communities. We outline differentiations between descriptive and normative explainability, judicial and non-judicial channels of contestation, and individual and collective contestation action. We further describe the main points of friction in the realization of both principles, including the alignment between top-down and bottom-up regulation, the assignment of responsibility, and the need for interdisciplinary collaboration. Lastly, we formulate three recommendations for AI policy to implement both principles through a Regulation by Design perspective. We believe our contributions can inform policy-making and regulation of these core principles and enable more effective and equitable design, development, and deployment of trustworthy public AI systems.

With the support of large foundation models, the quality of medical report generation has significantly improved.

It contains 2477 entities, 3 kinds of relations, 37424 triples, and 6943 disease-aware vision tokens for the CheXpert Plus dataset. Then, we sample it to obtain multi-granularity semantic graphs and use an R-GCN encoder for feature extraction. For the input X-ray image, we adopt the Swin-Transformer to extract the vision features and interact with the knowledge using cross-attention. The vision tokens are fed into a Q-former and retrieved the disease-aware vision tokens using another cross-attention. Finally, we adopt the large language model to map the semantic knowledge graph, input X-ray image, and disease-aware vision tokens into language descriptions. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed knowledge graph and X-ray report generation framework. The source code of this paper will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Medical_Image_Analysis.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Conversational LLMs have been widely adopted by domain users with limited programming experience to solve domain problems. However, these users often face misalignment between their intent and generated code, resulting in frustration and rounds of clarification. This work first investigates the cause of this misalignment, which dues to bidirectional ambiguity: both user intents and coding tasks are inherently nonlinear, yet must be expressed and interpreted through linear prompts and code sequences. To address this, we propose direct intent-task matching, a new human-LLM interaction paradigm that externalizes and enables direct manipulation of the LLM understanding, i.e., the coding tasks and their relationships inferred by the LLM prior to code generation. As a proof-of-concept, this paradigm is then implemented in NeuroSync, which employs a knowledge distillation pipeline to extract LLM understanding, user intents, and their mappings, and enhances the alignment by allowing users to intuitively inspect and edit them via visualizations. We evaluate the algorithmic components of NeuroSync via technical experiments, and assess its overall usability and effectiveness via a user study (N=12). The results show that it enhances intent-task alignment, lowers cognitive effort, and improves coding efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In real-world routing problems, users often propose conflicting or unreasonable requirements, which result in infeasible optimization models due to overly restrictive or contradictory constraints, leading to an empty feasible solution set. Existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods attempt to diagnose infeasible models, but modifying such models often involves multiple potential adjustments that these methods do not consider. To fill this gap, we introduce Multi-Objective Infeasibility Diagnosis (MOID), which combines LLM agents and multi-objective optimization within an automatic routing solver, to provide a set of representative actionable suggestions. Specifically, MOID employs multi-objective optimization to consider both path cost and constraint violation, generating a set of trade-off solutions, each encompassing varying degrees of model adjustments. To extract practical insights from these solutions, MOID utilizes LLM agents to generate a solution analysis function for the infeasible model. This function analyzes these distinct solutions to diagnose the original infeasible model, providing users with diverse diagnostic insights and suggestions. Finally, we compare MOID with several LLM-based methods on 50 types of infeasible routing problems. The results indicate that MOID automatically generates multiple diagnostic suggestions in a single run, providing more practical insights for restoring model feasibility and decision-making compared to existing methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Binary relations, such as equality, are basic mathematical concepts that appear, implicitly or explicitly, in most benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLM). A recent trend in the literature is benchmarking LLMs on out-of-context learning, where the data is not presented in the prompt, but only during the model's training. However, existing works mostly focus on higher-order tasks, making it hard to interpret success or failure. In this work, we study how well can LLMs reason out-of-context on binary relations by only learning the representations of newly introduced tokens. Our experiments focus on equality ($=$), inequality ($<$), and inclusion ($\subset$) and the properties they satisfy, such as reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity, and logical complexity (e.g., the number of reasoning "hops"). We show that LLMs achieve better than random accuracy, but are still far from perfect, even on relatively simple reasoning tasks involving binary relations. We analyse the learned representations and show that LLMs encode useful information directly, arranging the embeddings according to the task.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning and generation across domains, but still struggle with identifying and diagnosing complex errors. This stems mainly from training objectives that prioritize correct answers, limiting exposure to and learning from errors. While recent studies have begun to address this by introducing error signals, most rely on shallow, static errors, restricting improvement in deep diagnostic ability. To overcome this, we propose Hide and Seek Game (HSG), a dynamic adversarial framework for error generation and diagnosis, and evaluate it on mathematical problem-solving. HSG involves two adversarial roles: Sneaky, which "hides" by generating subtle, deceptive reasoning errors, and Diagnosis, which "seeks" to accurately detect them. Through adversarial co-evolution, both error stealth and diagnostic precision are enhanced. Experiments on several math reasoning tasks show that HSG significantly boosts error diagnosis, achieving 16.8\%--31.4\% higher accuracy than baselines like GPT-4o. We also release a challenging dataset of deceptive errors and diagnostic annotations as a benchmark for future research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating code from natural language (NL) descriptions. However, the plain textual descriptions are inherently ambiguous and often fail to capture complex requirements like intricate system behaviors, conditional logic, and architectural constraints; implicit data dependencies in service-oriented architectures are difficult to infer and handle correctly. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code generation framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal specifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified Modeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented architectures. This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating decision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural relationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously eliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data flow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI systematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual code synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained mathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with LLMs' excellent mathematical strengths. Additional static parsing and dependency pruning further reduce context complexity and cognitive load associated with intricate specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning accuracy and efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision large language models (VLLMs) are focusing primarily on handling complex and fine-grained visual information by incorporating advanced vision encoders and scaling up visual models. However, these approaches face high training and inference costs, as well as challenges in extracting visual details, effectively bridging across modalities. In this work, we propose a novel visual framework, MoCHA, to address these issues. Our framework integrates four vision backbones (i.e., CLIP, SigLIP, DINOv2 and ConvNeXt) to extract complementary visual features and is equipped with a sparse Mixture of Experts Connectors (MoECs) module to dynamically select experts tailored to different visual dimensions. To mitigate redundant or insufficient use of the visual information encoded by the MoECs module, we further design a Hierarchical Group Attention (HGA) with intra- and inter-group operations and an adaptive gating strategy for encoded visual features. We train MoCHA on two mainstream LLMs (e.g., Phi2-2.7B and Vicuna-7B) and evaluate their performance across various benchmarks. Notably, MoCHA outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight models on various tasks. For example, compared to CuMo (Mistral-7B), our MoCHA (Phi2-2.7B) presents outstanding abilities to mitigate hallucination by showing improvements of 3.25% in POPE and to follow visual instructions by raising 153 points on MME. Finally, ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MoECs and HGA in improving the overall performance of MoCHA.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The core challenge in automotive exterior design is balancing subjective aesthetics with objective aerodynamic performance while dramatically accelerating the development cycle. To address this, we propose a novel, LLM-driven multi-agent framework that automates the end-to-end workflow from ambiguous requirements to 3D concept model performance validation. The workflow is structured in two stages: conceptual generation and performance validation. In the first stage, agents collaborate to interpret fuzzy design requirements, generate concept sketches, and produce photorealistic renderings using diffusion models. In the second stage, the renderings are converted to 3D point clouds, where a Drag Prediction Agent, built upon a lightweight surrogate model, provides near-instantaneous predictions of the drag coefficient and pressure fields, replacing time-consuming CFD simulations. The primary contribution of this work is the seamless integration of creative generation with a rapid engineering validation loop within a unified, automated system, which provides a new paradigm for efficiently balancing creative exploration with engineering constraints in the earliest stages of design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> General logical reasoning, defined as the ability to reason deductively on domain-agnostic tasks, continues to be a challenge for large language models (LLMs). Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not interpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in neurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We first identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical reasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic reasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach comprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network, performs symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on domain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on domain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the following question: Which approach is more promising for developing general logical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class domain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses the integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the hybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each approach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising for developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is more interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of existing LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a generalizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design, model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.

However, current approaches often lack generalizability when deployed across different languages and clinical settings, limiting their practical utility. In this study, we propose CogBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the cross-lingual and cross-site generalizability of large language models (LLMs) for speech-based cognitive impairment assessment. Using a unified multimodal pipeline, we evaluate model performance on three speech datasets spanning English and Mandarin: ADReSSo, NCMMSC2021-AD, and a newly collected test set, CIR-E. Our results show that conventional deep learning models degrade substantially when transferred across domains. In contrast, LLMs equipped with chain-of-thought prompting demonstrate better adaptability, though their performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Furthermore, we explore lightweight fine-tuning of LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which significantly improves generalization in target domains. These findings offer a critical step toward building clinically useful and linguistically robust speech-based cognitive assessment tools.

  Models via Hessian Augmentation</h2>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective approach for compressing large models and accelerating their inference without retraining. While PTQ has been extensively studied in the context of large language models (LLMs), its applicability to vision-language models (VLMs) remains underexplored. In this paper, we identify a modality discrepancy (\emph{i.e.}, limited text tokens \emph{vs.} excessive and redundant vision tokens) of VLMs. However, existing Hessian-based LLM PTQ methods treat all tokens equally during quantization, resulting in severe performance drops when applied to VLMs. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel importance-aware PTQ framework tailored for VLMs, dubbed VLMQ. Specifically, to address vision token redundancy, VLMQ 1) optimizes an importance-aware objective that yields an enhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, while retaining compatibility with parallelized weight updates, and 2) ensures efficiency and effectiveness by computing these factors via a single lightweight block-wise backward pass, guided by a theoretical connection to token-level perturbations. Extensive evaluations on 8 benchmarks across 0.5B$\sim$32B VLMs demonstrate the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our VLMQ, particularly under low-bit settings. For example, it achieves a substantial \textbf{16.45\%} improvement on MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting excel at complex reasoning but generate verbose thought processes with considerable redundancy, leading to increased inference costs and reduced efficiency. We introduce a novel CoT compression framework based on step entropy, a metric that quantifies the informational contribution of individual reasoning steps to identify redundancy. Through theoretical analysis and extensive empirical validation on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we demonstrate that steps with low entropy are indeed highly redundant. Our experiments reveal that an astonishing 80\% of low-entropy intermediate steps can be pruned with minor degradation in the final answer accuracy across DeepSeek-R1-7B, 14B and Qwen3-8B. This finding sharply contrasts with random or high-entropy pruning, which severely impairs reasoning performance. Building on this, we propose a novel two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning. This approach enables LLMs to autonomously learn to generate compressed COTs during inference by strategically incorporating [SKIP] tokens. Our method significantly enhances LLM inference efficiency while rigorously preserving accuracy, offering profound implications for practical LLM deployment and a deeper understanding of reasoning structures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rise of LLMs such as ChatGPT and Claude fuels the need for AI agents capable of real-time task handling. However, migrating data-intensive, multi-modal edge workloads to cloud data centers, traditionally used for agent deployment, introduces significant latency. Deploying AI agents at the edge improves efficiency and reduces latency. However, edge environments present challenges due to limited and heterogeneous resources. Maintaining QoS for mobile users necessitates agent migration, which is complicated by the complexity of AI agents coordinating LLMs, task planning, memory, and external tools. This paper presents the first systematic deployment and management solution for LLM-based AI agents in dynamic edge environments. We propose a novel adaptive framework for AI agent placement and migration in edge intelligence systems. Our approach models resource constraints and latency/cost, leveraging ant colony algorithms and LLM-based optimization for efficient decision-making. It autonomously places agents to optimize resource utilization and QoS and enables lightweight agent migration by transferring only essential state. Implemented on a distributed system using AgentScope and validated across globally distributed edge servers, our solution significantly reduces deployment latency and migration costs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Existing cybersecurity playbooks are often written in heterogeneous, non-machine-readable formats, which limits their automation and interoperability across Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response platforms. This paper explores the suitability of Large Language Models, combined with Prompt Engineering, to automatically translate legacy incident response playbooks into the standardized, machine-readable CACAO format. We systematically examine various Prompt Engineering techniques and carefully design prompts aimed at maximizing syntactic accuracy and semantic fidelity for control flow preservation. Our modular transformation pipeline integrates a syntax checker to ensure syntactic correctness and features an iterative refinement mechanism that progressively reduces syntactic errors. We evaluate the proposed approach on a custom-generated dataset comprising diverse legacy playbooks paired with manually created CACAO references. The results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the accuracy of playbook transformation over baseline models, effectively captures complex workflow structures, and substantially reduces errors. It highlights the potential for practical deployment in automated cybersecurity playbook transformation tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet their inability to maintain persistent memory in long contexts limits their effectiveness as autonomous agents in long-term interactions. While existing memory systems have made progress, their reliance on arbitrary granularity for defining the basic memory unit and passive, rule-based mechanisms for knowledge extraction limits their capacity for genuine learning and evolution. To address these foundational limitations, we present Nemori, a novel self-organizing memory architecture inspired by human cognitive principles. Nemori's core innovation is twofold: First, its Two-Step Alignment Principle, inspired by Event Segmentation Theory, provides a principled, top-down method for autonomously organizing the raw conversational stream into semantically coherent episodes, solving the critical issue of memory granularity. Second, its Predict-Calibrate Principle, inspired by the Free-energy Principle, enables the agent to proactively learn from prediction gaps, moving beyond pre-defined heuristics to achieve adaptive knowledge evolution. This offers a viable path toward handling the long-term, dynamic workflows of autonomous agents. Extensive experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that Nemori significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art systems, with its advantage being particularly pronounced in longer contexts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Repository-level code comprehension and knowledge sharing remain core challenges in software engineering. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise by generating explanations of program structure and logic. However, these approaches still face limitations: First, relevant knowledge is distributed across multiple files within a repository, aka semantic fragmentation. Second, retrieval inefficiency and attention saturation degrade performance in RAG pipelines, where long, unaligned contexts overwhelm attention. Third, repository specific training data is scarce and often outdated. Finally, proprietary LLMs hinder industrial adoption due to privacy and deployment constraints. To address these issues, we propose Key-Augmented Neural Triggers (KANT), a novel approach that embeds knowledge anchors into both training and inference. Unlike prior methods, KANT enables internal access to repository specific knowledge, reducing fragmentation and grounding inference in localized context. Moreover, we synthesize specialized data directly from code. At inference, knowledge anchors replace verbose context, reducing token overhead and latency while supporting efficient, on premise deployment. We evaluate KANT via: a qualitative human evaluation of the synthesized dataset's intent coverage and quality across five dimensions; compare against SOTA baselines across five qualitative dimensions and inference speed; and replication across different LLMs to assess generalizability. Results show that the synthetic training data aligned with information-seeking needs. KANT achieved over 60% preference from human annotators and a LocalStack expert (preferring 79% of cases). Also, KANT reduced inference latency by up to 85% across all models. Overall, it is well-suited for scalable, low-latency, on-premise deployments, providing a strong foundation for code comprehension.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful capabilities in code generation, natural language understanding, and domain-specific reasoning. Their application to quantum software development remains limited, in part because of the lack of high-quality datasets both for LLM training and as dependable knowledge sources. To bridge this gap, we introduce PennyLang, an off-the-shelf, high-quality dataset of 3,347 PennyLane-specific quantum code samples with contextual descriptions, curated from textbooks, official documentation, and open-source repositories. Our contributions are threefold: (1) the creation and open-source release of PennyLang, a purpose-built dataset for quantum programming with PennyLane; (2) a framework for automated quantum code dataset construction that systematizes curation, annotation, and formatting to maximize downstream LLM usability; and (3) a baseline evaluation of the dataset across multiple open-source models, including ablation studies, all conducted within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. Using PennyLang with RAG substantially improves performance: for example, Qwen 7B's success rate rises from 8.7% without retrieval to 41.7% with full-context augmentation, and LLaMa 4 improves from 78.8% to 84.8%, while also reducing hallucinations and enhancing quantum code correctness. Moving beyond Qiskit-focused studies, we bring LLM-based tools and reproducible methods to PennyLane for advancing AI-assisted quantum development.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Knowledge conflicts commonly arise across diverse sources, and their prevalence has increased with the advent of LLMs. When dealing with conflicts between multiple contexts, also known as \emph{inter-context knowledge conflicts}, LLMs are often confused by lengthy and conflicting contexts. To address this challenge, we propose the Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR) framework, which enhances the ability of LLMs to resolve conflicting knowledge. The key idea of KCR is to train backbone LLMs to establish a correct reasoning process by rewarding them for selecting and adhering to the context with stronger logical consistency when presented with conflicting contexts. Specifically, we first extract reasoning paths, represented by either text or local knowledge graphs, from the conflicting long contexts. Subsequently, we employ Reinforcement Learning to encourage the model to learn the paradigm of reasoning process that follows correct reasoning paths rather than the incorrect counterparts. This enables the backbone models to genuinely acquire the capability to resolve inter-context knowledge conflicts within long contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the ability of various backbone models to resolve knowledge conflicts in long-context scenarios, yielding substantial performance gains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Predictive Business Process Monitoring (PBPM) aims to forecast future outcomes of ongoing business processes. However, existing methods often lack flexibility to handle real-world challenges such as simultaneous events, class imbalance, and multi-level attributes. While prior work has explored static encoding schemes and fixed LSTM architectures, they struggle to support adaptive representations and generalize across heterogeneous datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a suite of dynamic LSTM HyperModels that integrate two-level hierarchical encoding for event and sequence attributes, character-based decomposition of event labels, and novel pseudo-embedding techniques for durations and attribute correlations. We further introduce specialized LSTM variants for simultaneous event modeling, leveraging multidimensional embeddings and time-difference flag augmentation. Experimental validation on four public and real-world datasets demonstrates up to 100% accuracy on balanced datasets and F1 scores exceeding 86\% on imbalanced ones. Our approach advances PBPM by offering modular and interpretable models better suited for deployment in complex settings. Beyond PBPM, it contributes to the broader AI community by improving temporal outcome prediction, supporting data heterogeneity, and promoting explainable process intelligence frameworks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a promising research field for enhancing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) without extra training. However, most existing approaches, e.g., Best-of-N and Self-Consistency rely on a single agent interacting with a reward model (SA-SR), constrained by limited capabilities of a single test-time scaling (STTS) paradigm. On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that collective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent systems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first step towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the different interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three primary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent to multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model (MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive experiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance. Based on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively leverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced inference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent Collaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination of LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model collaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a curated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to select the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking (PRR) metric. Experiments across seven mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CTTS-MM consistently obtains superior performance. Code will be released at https://github.com/magent4aci/CTTS-MM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Domain-independent heuristics have long been a cornerstone of AI planning, offering general solutions applicable across a wide range of tasks without requiring domain-specific engineering. However, the advent of large language models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to generate heuristics tailored to specific planning problems, potentially challenging the necessity of domain independence as a strict design principle. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to automatically derive planning heuristics from task descriptions represented as successor generators and goal tests written in general purpose programming language. We investigate the trade-offs between domain-specific LLM-generated heuristics and traditional domain-independent methods in terms of computational efficiency and explainability. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can create heuristics that achieve state-of-the-art performance on some standard IPC domains, as well as their ability to solve problems that lack an adequate Planning Domain Definition Language ({\sc pddl}) representation. We discuss whether these results signify a paradigm shift and how they can complement existing approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) for code optimization have enabled industrial platforms to automate software performance engineering at unprecedented scale and speed. Yet, organizations in regulated industries face strict constraints on which LLMs they can use - many cannot utilize commercial models due to data privacy regulations and compliance requirements, creating a significant challenge for achieving high-quality code optimization while maintaining cost-effectiveness. We address this by implementing a Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) approach that directly synthesizes code from multiple specialized LLMs, comparing it against TurinTech AI's vanilla Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based ensemble system and individual LLM optimizers using real-world industrial codebases. Our key contributions include: (1) First MoA application to industrial code optimization using real-world codebases; (2) Empirical evidence that MoA excels with open-source models, achieving 14.3% to 22.2% cost savings and 28.6% to 32.2% faster optimization times for regulated environments; (3) Deployment guidelines demonstrating GA's advantage with commercial models while both ensembles outperform individual LLMs; and (4) Real-world validation across 50 code snippets and seven LLM combinations, generating over 8,700 variants, addresses gaps in industrial LLM ensemble evaluation. This provides actionable guidance for organizations balancing regulatory compliance with optimization performance in production environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPTs) are foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) for text generation. However, individual LLMs often produce inconsistent outputs and exhibit biases, limiting their representation of diverse language patterns. The closed-source nature of many powerful LLMs further restricts industry applications due to data privacy concerns. Inspired by successes in text generation, LLM ensemble techniques are now increasingly explored for code generation. This article reviews these emerging ensemble approaches to enhance understanding, encourage further research, and promote practical implementation in both text and code generation. We categorize LLM ensembles into seven main methods - weight merging, knowledge fusion, mixture-of-experts, reward ensemble, output ensemble, routing, and cascading - analyzing capabilities of those approaches. Our findings highlight key benefits such as improved diversity representation, enhanced output quality, and greater application flexibility. These insights aid model selection for real-world tasks and crucially, lay groundwork for extending ensemble strategies to multimodal LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce Skywork UniPic, a 1.5 billion-parameter autoregressive model that unifies image understanding, text-to-image generation, and image editing within a single architecture-eliminating the need for task-specific adapters or inter-module connectors-and demonstrate that compact multimodal systems can achieve state-of-the-art performance on commodity hardware. Skywork UniPic achieves a GenEval score of 0.86, surpassing most existing unified models; sets a new DPG-Bench complex-generation record of 85.5; attains 5.83 on GEditBench-EN and 3.49 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing; and generates 1024 x 1024 images with under 15 GB of GPU memory (e.g., RTX 4090). (1) a decoupled encoding strategy that leverages a masked autoregressive encoder for synthesis and a SigLIP2 encoder for understanding, all feeding a shared autoregressive decoder; (2) a progressive, resolution-aware training schedule scaling from 256 x 256 to 1024 x 1024 while dynamically unfreezing parameters to balance capacity and stability; and (3) meticulously curated, 100 million-scale datasets augmented with task-specific reward models to refine generation and editing objectives. By demonstrating that high-fidelity multimodal integration need not incur prohibitive resource demands, Skywork UniPic establishes a practical paradigm for deployable, high-fidelity multimodal AI.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Object detection has achieved remarkable accuracy through deep learning, yet these improvements often come with increased computational cost, limiting deployment on resource-constrained devices. Knowledge Distillation (KD) provides an effective solution by enabling compact student models to learn from larger teacher models. However, adapting KD to object detection poses unique challenges due to its dual objectives-classification and localization-as well as foreground-background imbalance and multi-scale feature representation. This review introduces a novel architecture-centric taxonomy for KD methods, distinguishing between CNN-based detectors (covering backbone-level, neck-level, head-level, and RPN/RoI-level distillation) and Transformer-based detectors (including query-level, feature-level, and logit-level distillation). We further evaluate representative methods using the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets with mAP@0.5 as performance metric, providing a comparative analysis of their effectiveness. The proposed taxonomy and analysis aim to clarify the evolving landscape of KD in object detection, highlight current challenges, and guide future research toward efficient and scalable detection systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in automating data analysis tasks, yet open-source models face significant limitations in these kinds of reasoning-intensive scenarios. In this work, we investigate strategies to enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate model behavior across three core dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance. We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology, demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical reasoning capabilities.

To lower the entry barrier and improve design efficiency, we present an agent for CAD conceptual design powered by large language models (LLMs). The agent accepts both abstract textual descriptions and freehand sketches as input, engaging in interactive dialogue with users to refine and clarify design requirements through comprehensive requirement analysis. Built upon a novel Context-Independent Imperative Paradigm (CIP), the agent generates high-quality CAD modeling code. During the generation process, the agent incorporates iterative visual feedback to improve model quality. Generated design cases are stored in a structured knowledge base, enabling continuous improvement of the agent's code generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in CAD code generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> GUI prototyping is a fundamental component in the development of modern interactive systems, which are now ubiquitous across diverse application domains. GUI prototypes play a critical role in requirements elicitation by enabling stakeholders to visualize, assess, and refine system concepts collaboratively. Moreover, prototypes serve as effective tools for early testing, iterative evaluation, and validation of design ideas with both end users and development teams. Despite these advantages, the process of constructing GUI prototypes remains resource-intensive and time-consuming, frequently demanding substantial effort and expertise. Recent research has sought to alleviate this burden through NL-based GUI retrieval approaches, which typically rely on embedding-based retrieval or tailored ranking models for specific GUI repositories. However, these methods often suffer from limited retrieval performance and struggle to generalize across arbitrary GUI datasets. In this work, we present GUI-ReRank, a novel framework that integrates rapid embedding-based constrained retrieval models with highly effective MLLM-based reranking techniques. GUI-ReRank further introduces a fully customizable GUI repository annotation and embedding pipeline, enabling users to effortlessly make their own GUI repositories searchable, which allows for rapid discovery of relevant GUIs for inspiration or seamless integration into customized LLM-based RAG workflows. We evaluated our approach on an established NL-based GUI retrieval benchmark, demonstrating that GUI-ReRank significantly outperforms SOTA tailored LTR models in both retrieval accuracy and generalizability. Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive cost and efficiency analysis of employing MLLMs for reranking, providing valuable insights regarding the trade-offs between retrieval effectiveness and computational resources.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Social platforms have revolutionized information sharing, but also accelerated the dissemination of harmful and policy-violating content. To ensure safety and compliance at scale, moderation systems must go beyond efficiency and offer accuracy and interpretability. However, current approaches largely rely on noisy, label-driven learning, lacking alignment with moderation rules and producing opaque decisions that hinder human review. Therefore, we propose Hierarchical Guard (Hi-Guard), a multimodal moderation framework that introduces a new policy-aligned decision paradigm. The term "Hierarchical" reflects two key aspects of our system design: (1) a hierarchical moderation pipeline, where a lightweight binary model first filters safe content and a stronger model handles fine-grained risk classification; and (2) a hierarchical taxonomy in the second stage, where the model performs path-based classification over a hierarchical taxonomy ranging from coarse to fine-grained levels. To ensure alignment with evolving moderation policies, Hi-Guard directly incorporates rule definitions into the model prompt. To further enhance structured prediction and reasoning, we introduce a multi-level soft-margin reward and optimize with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), penalizing semantically adjacent misclassifications and improving explanation quality. Extensive experiments and real-world deployment demonstrate that Hi-Guard achieves superior classification accuracy, generalization, and interpretability, paving the way toward scalable, transparent, and trustworthy content safety systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Estimating the difficulty of exam questions is essential for developing good exams, but professors are not always good at this task. We compare various Large Language Model-based methods with three professors in their ability to estimate what percentage of students will give correct answers on True/False exam questions in the areas of Neural Networks and Machine Learning. Our results show that the professors have limited ability to distinguish between easy and difficult questions and that they are outperformed by directly asking Gemini 2.5 to solve this task. Yet, we obtained even better results using uncertainties of the LLMs solving the questions in a supervised learning setting, using only 42 training samples. We conclude that supervised learning using LLM uncertainty can help professors better estimate the difficulty of exam questions, improving the quality of assessment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension, we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used across different applications, concerns about their potential to amplify gender biases in various tasks are rising. Prior research has often probed gender bias using explicit gender cues as counterfactual, or studied them in sentence completion and short question answering tasks. These formats might overlook more implicit forms of bias embedded in generative behavior of longer content. In this work, we investigate gender bias in LLMs using gender stereotypes studied in psychology (e.g., aggressiveness or gossiping) in an open-ended task of narrative generation. We introduce a novel dataset called StereoBias-Stories containing short stories either unconditioned or conditioned on (one, two, or six) random attributes from 25 psychological stereotypes and three task-related story endings. We analyze how the gender contribution in the overall story changes in response to these attributes and present three key findings: (1) While models, on average, are highly biased towards male in unconditioned prompts, conditioning on attributes independent from gender stereotypes mitigates this bias. (2) Combining multiple attributes associated with the same gender stereotype intensifies model behavior, with male ones amplifying bias and female ones alleviating it. (3) Model biases align with psychological ground-truth used for categorization, and alignment strength increases with model size. Together, these insights highlight the importance of psychology-grounded evaluation of LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks but suffer from immense computational and memory demands, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address this challenge, we propose NoWag: (Normalized Weight and Activation Guided Compression), a unified framework for zero-shot shape preserving compression algorithms. We compressed Llama-2 7B/13B/70B and Llama-3 8/70BB models, using two popular forms of shape-preserving compression, vector quantization NoWag-VQ (NoWag for Vector Quantization), and unstructured/semi-structured pruning NoWag-P (NoWag for Pruning). We found that NoWag-VQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art zero shot VQ, and that NoWag-P performs competitively against state-of-the-art methods. These results suggest commonalities between these compression paradigms that could inspire future work. Our code is available at https://github.com/LawrenceRLiu/NoWag

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cloud-based offloading helps address energy consumption and performance challenges in executing resource-intensive vehicle algorithms. Utilizing 5G, with its low latency and high bandwidth, enables seamless vehicle-to-cloud integration. Currently, only non-standalone 5G is publicly available, and real-world applications remain underexplored compared to theoretical studies. This paper evaluates 5G non-standalone networks for cloud execution of vehicle functions, focusing on latency, Round Trip Time, and packet delivery. Tests used two AI-based algorithms -- emotion recognition and object recognition -- along an 8.8 km route in Baden-W\"urttemberg, Germany, encompassing urban, rural, and forested areas. Two platforms were analyzed: a cloudlet in Frankfurt and a cloud in Mannheim, employing various deployment strategies like conventional applications and containerized and container-orchestrated setups. Key findings highlight an average signal quality of 84 %, with no connectivity interruptions despite minor drops in built-up areas. Packet analysis revealed a Packet Error Rate below 0.1 % for both algorithms. Transfer times varied significantly depending on the geographical location and the backend servers' network connections, while processing times were mainly influenced by the computation hardware in use. Additionally, cloud offloading seems only be a suitable option, when a round trip time of more than 150 ms is possible.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work presents a new spiking neural network (SNN)-based approach for user equipment-base station (UE-BS) association in non-terrestrial networks (NTNs). With the introduction of UAV's in wireless networks, the system architecture becomes heterogeneous, resulting in the need for dynamic and efficient management to avoid congestion and sustain overall performance. The presented framework compares two SNN-based optimization strategies. Specifically, a top-down centralized approach with complete network visibility and a bottom-up distributed approach for individual network nodes. The SNN is based on leak integrate-and-fire neurons with temporal components, which can perform fast and efficient event-driven inference. Realistic ray-tracing simulations are conducted, which showcase that the bottom-up model attains over 90\% accuracy, while the top-down model maintains 80-100\% accuracy. Both approaches reveal a trade-off between individually optimal solutions and UE-BS association feasibility, thus revealing the effectiveness of both approaches depending on deployment scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While large language models (LLMs) are generally considered proficient in generating language, how similar their language usage is to that of humans remains understudied. In this paper, we test whether models exhibit linguistic convergence, a core pragmatic element of human language communication, asking: do models adapt, or converge, to the linguistic patterns of their user? To answer this, we systematically compare model completions of exisiting dialogues to the original human responses across sixteen language models, three dialogue corpora, and a variety of stylometric features. We find that models strongly converge to the conversation's style, often significantly overfitting relative to the human baseline. While convergence patterns are often feature-specific, we observe consistent shifts in convergence across modeling settings, with instruction-tuned and larger models converging less than their pretrained counterparts. Given the differences between human and model convergence patterns, we hypothesize that the underlying mechanisms for these behaviors are very different.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in educational settings. These applications expand beyond English, though current LLMs remain primarily English-centric. In this work, we ascertain if their use in education settings in non-English languages is warranted. We evaluated the performance of popular LLMs on four educational tasks: identifying student misconceptions, providing targeted feedback, interactive tutoring, and grading translations in eight languages (Mandarin, Hindi, Arabic, German, Farsi, Telugu, Ukrainian, Czech) in addition to English. We find that the performance on these tasks somewhat corresponds to the amount of language represented in training data, with lower-resource languages having poorer task performance. Although the models perform reasonably well in most languages, the frequent performance drop from English is significant. Thus, we recommend that practitioners first verify that the LLM works well in the target language for their educational task before deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Spaced repetition systems are fundamental to efficient learning and memory retention, but existing algorithms often struggle with semantic interference and personalized adaptation. We present LECTOR (\textbf{L}LM-\textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{C}oncept-based \textbf{T}est-\textbf{O}riented \textbf{R}epetition), a novel adaptive scheduling algorithm specifically designed for test-oriented learning scenarios, particularly language examinations where success rate is paramount. LECTOR leverages large language models for semantic analysis while incorporating personalized learning profiles, addressing the critical challenge of semantic confusion in vocabulary learning by utilizing LLM-powered semantic similarity assessment and integrating it with established spaced repetition principles. Our comprehensive evaluation against six baseline algorithms (SSP-MMC, SM2, HLR, FSRS, ANKI, THRESHOLD) across 100 simulated learners over 100 days demonstrates significant improvements: LECTOR achieves a 90.2\% success rate compared to 88.4\% for the best baseline (SSP-MMC), representing a 2.0\% relative improvement. The algorithm shows particular strength in handling semantically similar concepts, reducing confusion-induced errors while maintaining computational efficiency. Our results establish LECTOR as a promising direction for intelligent tutoring systems and adaptive learning platforms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated significant interest in their capacity to simulate human-like behaviors, yet most studies rely on fictional personas rather than actual human data. We address this limitation by evaluating LLMs' ability to predict individual economic decision-making using Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) pricing experiments with real 522 human personas. Our study systematically compares three state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs using detailed persona information from 522 Korean participants in cultural consumption scenarios. We investigate whether LLMs can accurately replicate individual human choices and how persona injection methods affect prediction performance. Results reveal that while LLMs struggle with precise individual-level predictions, they demonstrate reasonable group-level behavioral tendencies. Also, we found that commonly adopted prompting techniques are not much better than naive prompting methods; reconstruction of personal narrative nor retrieval augmented generation have no significant gain against simple prompting method. We believe that these findings can provide the first comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' capabilities on simulating economic behavior using real human data, offering empirical guidance for persona-based simulation in computational social science.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Llama have shown remarkable capabilities in a variety of software engineering tasks. Despite the advancements, their practical deployment faces challenges, including high financial costs, long response time, and varying performance, especially when handling a large number of queries (jobs). Existing optimization strategies for deploying LLMs for diverse tasks focus on static scheduling, which requires extensive training data for performance prediction, increasing the computational costs and limiting the applicability and flexibility. In this paper, we propose the SmartLLMs Scheduler (SLS), a dynamic and cost-effective scheduling solution. The key idea is to learn LLMs' performance on diverse tasks and incorporate their real-time feedback to update strategies periodically. Specifically, SLS incorporates three key components, including an Adaptive Cache Manager, a Performance-Cost Optimized Scheduler, and a Dynamic Update Manager. The Cache Manager stores the outputs of previously processed queries and employs an adaptive strategy to reduce redundant computations and minimize response times. For queries not found in the cache, the Scheduler dynamically allocates them to the most suitable LLM based on the predicted performance and cost from models that take both query-specific and LLM-specific features as input. The Update Manager continuously refines the cache and scheduling strategies based on real-time feedback from the assigned queries to enhance decision-making and adapt to evolving task characteristics. To evaluate the effectiveness of SLS, we conduct extensive experiments on two LLM-based software engineering tasks, including log parsing and code generation. The results show that SLS significantly outperforms the baseline methods, achieving an average performance improvement of 198.82% and an average processing time reduction of 63.28%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Prior clinical psychology research shows that Western individuals with depression tend to report psychological symptoms, while Eastern individuals report somatic ones. We test whether Large Language Models (LLMs), which are increasingly used in mental health, reproduce these cultural patterns by prompting them with Western or Eastern personas. Results show that LLMs largely fail to replicate the patterns when prompted in English, though prompting in major Eastern languages (i.e., Chinese, Japanese, and Hindi) improves alignment in several configurations. Our analysis pinpoints two key reasons for this failure: the models' low sensitivity to cultural personas and a strong, culturally invariant symptom hierarchy that overrides cultural cues. These findings reveal that while prompt language is important, current general-purpose LLMs lack the robust, culture-aware capabilities essential for safe and effective mental health applications.
