                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Previous measurements of neutron energy using fast plastic scintillators while operating the Fusion Z Pinch Experiment (FuZE) constrained the energy of any yield-producing deuteron beams to less than $4.65 keV$. FuZE has since been operated at increasingly higher input power, resulting in increased plasma current and larger fusion neutron yields. A detailed experimental study of the neutron energy isotropy in these regimes applies more stringent limits to possible contributions from beam-target fusion. The FuZE device operated at $-25~kV$ charge voltage has resulted in average plasma currents of $370~kA$ and D-D fusion neutron yields of $4\times10^7$ neutrons per discharge. Measurements of the neutron energy isotropy under these operating conditions demonstrates the energy of deuteron beams is less than $7.4 \pm 5.6^\mathrm{(stat)} \pm 3.7^\mathrm{(syst)}~keV$. Characterization of the detector response has reduced the number of free parameters in the fit of the neutron energy distribution, improving the confidence in the forward-fit method. Gamma backgrounds have been measured and the impact of these contributions on the isotropy results have been studied. Additionally, a time dependent measurement of the isotropy has been resolved for the first time, indicating increases to possible deuteron beam energies at late times. This suggests the possible growth of $m$=0 instabilities at the end of the main radiation event but confirms that the majority of the neutron production exhibits isotropy consistent with thermonuclear origin.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a process where a large language model (LLM) retrieves useful information from a database and then generates the responses. It is becoming popular in enterprise settings for daily business operations. For example, Copilot for Microsoft 365 has accumulated millions of businesses. However, the security implications of adopting such RAG-based systems are unclear.   In this paper, we introduce ConfusedPilot, a class of security vulnerabilities of RAG systems that confuse Copilot and cause integrity and confidentiality violations in its responses. First, we investigate a vulnerability that embeds malicious text in the modified prompt in RAG, corrupting the responses generated by the LLM. Second, we demonstrate a vulnerability that leaks secret data, which leverages the caching mechanism during retrieval. Third, we investigate how both vulnerabilities can be exploited to propagate misinformation within the enterprise and ultimately impact its operations, such as sales and manufacturing. We also discuss the root cause of these attacks by investigating the architecture of a RAG-based system. This study highlights the security vulnerabilities in today's RAG-based systems and proposes design guidelines to secure future RAG-based systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have ignited an innovative surge of AI applications, marking a new era of exciting possibilities equipped with extended context windows. However, hosting these models is cost-prohibitive mainly due to the extensive memory consumption of KV Cache involving long-context modeling. Despite several works proposing to evict unnecessary tokens from the KV Cache, most of them rely on the biased local statistics of accumulated attention scores and report performance using unconvincing metric like perplexity on inadequate short-text evaluation. In this paper, we propose NACL, a general framework for long-context KV cache eviction that achieves more optimal and efficient eviction in a single operation during the encoding phase. Due to NACL's efficiency, we combine more accurate attention score statistics in PROXY TOKENS EVICTION with the diversified random eviction strategy of RANDOM EVICTION, aiming to alleviate the issue of attention bias and enhance the robustness in maintaining pivotal tokens for long-context modeling tasks. Notably, our method significantly improves the performance on short- and long-text tasks by 80% and 76% respectively, reducing KV Cache by up to 50% with over 95% performance maintenance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in edge computing~(EC) have pushed cloud-based data caching services to edge, however, such emerging edge storage comes with numerous challenging and unique security issues. One of them is the problem of edge data integrity verification (EDIV) which coordinates multiple participants (e.g., data owners and edge nodes) to inspect whether data cached on edge is authentic. To date, various solutions have been proposed to address the EDIV problem, while there is no systematic review. Thus, we offer a comprehensive survey for the first time, aiming to show current research status, open problems, and potentially promising insights for readers to further investigate this under-explored field. Specifically, we begin by stating the significance of the EDIV problem, the integrity verification difference between data cached on cloud and edge, and three typical system models with corresponding inspection processes. To thoroughly assess prior research efforts, we synthesize a universal criteria framework that an effective verification approach should satisfy. On top of it, a schematic development timeline is developed to reveal the research advance on EDIV in a sequential manner, followed by a detailed review of the existing EDIV solutions. Finally, we highlight intriguing research challenges and possible directions for future work, along with a discussion on how forthcoming technology, e.g., machine learning and context-aware security, can augment security in EC. Given our findings, some major observations are: there is a noticeable trend to equip EDIV solutions with various functions and diversify study scenarios; completing EDIV within two types of participants (i.e., data owner and edge nodes) is garnering escalating interest among researchers; although the majority of existing methods rely on cryptography, emerging technology is being explored to handle the EDIV problem.

  Bottlenecks in LLM Inference</h2>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In large-language models, memory constraints in the key-value cache (KVC) pose a challenge during inference, especially with long prompts. In this work, we observed that compressing KV values is more effective than compressing the model regarding accuracy and job completion time (JCT). However, quantizing KV values and dropping less-important tokens incur significant runtime computational time overhead, delaying JCT. These methods also cannot reduce computation time or high network communication time overhead in sequence-parallelism (SP) frameworks for long prompts. To tackle these issues, based on our insightful observations from experimental analysis, we propose ZeroC, a Zero-delay QKV Compression system that eliminates time overhead and even reduces computation and communication time of the model operations. ZeroC innovatively embeds compression and decompression operations within model operations and adaptively determines compression ratios at a hybrid layer-token level. Further, it enables a communication-efficient SP inference framework. Trace-driven experiments demonstrate that ZeroC achieves up to 80% lower average JCT, 35% lower average perplexity, and 2.8x higher throughput with the same latency compared to state-of-the-art compression methods. ZeroC also reduces the average JCT of current LLM serving systems by up to 91% with the constraint of 0.1 perplexity increase. We open-sourced the code.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Diffusion models, widely used for image generation, face significant challenges related to their broad applicability due to prolonged inference times and high memory demands. Efficient Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is crucial to address these issues. However, unlike traditional models, diffusion models critically rely on the time-step for the multi-round denoising. Typically, each time-step is encoded into a hypersensitive temporal feature by several modules. Despite this, existing PTQ methods do not optimize these modules individually. Instead, they employ unsuitable reconstruction objectives and complex calibration methods, leading to significant disturbances in the temporal feature and denoising trajectory, as well as reduced compression efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel quantization framework that includes three strategies: 1) TIB-based Maintenance: Based on our innovative Temporal Information Block (TIB) definition, Temporal Information-aware Reconstruction (TIAR) and Finite Set Calibration (FSC) are developed to efficiently align original temporal features. 2) Cache-based Maintenance: Instead of indirect and complex optimization for the related modules, pre-computing and caching quantized counterparts of temporal features are developed to minimize errors. 3) Disturbance-aware Selection: Employ temporal feature errors to guide a fine-grained selection between the two maintenance strategies for further disturbance reduction. This framework preserves most of the temporal information and ensures high-quality end-to-end generation. Extensive testing on various datasets, diffusion models and hardware confirms our superior performance and acceleration..

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The concept of ownership in high level languages can aid both the programmer and the compiler to reason about the validity of memory operations. Previously, ownership semantics has been used successfully in high level automatic program verification to model a reference to data by a first order logic (FOL) representation of data instead of maintaining an address map. However, ownership semantics is not used in low level program verification. We have identified two challenges. First, ownership information is lost when a program is compiled to a low level intermediate representation (e.g., in LLVM IR). Second, pointers in low level programs point to bytes using an address map (e.g., in unsafe Rust) and thus the verification condition (VC) cannot always replace a pointer by its FOL abstraction. To remedy the situation, we develop ownership semantics for an LLVM like low level intermediate representation. Using these semantics, the VC can opportunistically model some memory accesses by a direct access of a pointer cache that stores byte representation of data. This scheme reduces instances where an address map must be maintained, especially for mostly safe programs that follow ownership semantics. For unsafe functionality, memory accesses are modelled by operations on an address map and we provide mechanisms to keep the address map and pointer cache in sync. We implement these semantics in SEABMC, a bit precise bounded model checker for LLVM. For evaluation, the source programs are assumed to be written in C. Since C does not have ownership built in, suitable macros are added that introduce and preserve ownership during translation to LLVM like IR for verification. This approach is evaluated on mature open source C code. For both handcrafted benchmarks and practical programs, we observe a speedup of $1.3x--5x$ during SMT solving.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims to identify and classify entities in text into predefined categories. However, when applied to Arabic data, NER encounters unique challenges stemming from the language's rich morphological inflections, absence of capitalization cues, and spelling variants, where a single word can comprise multiple morphemes. In this paper, we introduce Arabic KNN-NER, our submission to the Wojood NER Shared Task 2024 (ArabicNLP 2024). We have participated in the shared sub-task 1 Flat NER. In this shared sub-task, we tackle fine-grained flat-entity recognition for Arabic text, where we identify a single main entity and possibly zero or multiple sub-entities for each word. Arabic KNN-NER augments the probability distribution of a fine-tuned model with another label probability distribution derived from performing a KNN search over the cached training data. Our submission achieved 91% on the test set on the WojoodFine dataset, placing Arabic KNN-NER on top of the leaderboard for the shared task.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper explores the potential of cryogenic computing and superconducting electronics as promising alternatives to traditional semiconductor devices. As semiconductor devices face challenges such as increased leakage currents and reduced performance at higher temperatures, these novel technologies offer high performance and low power computation. Cryogenic computing operates at ultra-low temperatures near 77 K, leading to lower leakage currents and improved electron mobility. On the other hand, superconducting electronics, operating near 0 K, allow electrons to flow without resistance, offering the potential for ultra-low-power, high-speed computation. This study presents a comprehensive performance modeling and analysis of these technologies and provides insights into their potential benefits and limitations. We implement models of in-order and out-of-order cores operating at high clock frequencies associated with superconducting electronics and cryogenic computing in gem5. We evaluate the performance of these components using workloads representative of real-world applications like NPB, SPEC CPU2006, and GAPBS. Our results show the potential speedups achievable by these components and the limitations posed by cache bandwidth. This work provides valuable insights into the performance implications and design trade-offs associated with cryogenic and superconducting technologies, laying the foundation for future research in this field using gem5.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The emergence of intelligence in large language models (LLMs) has inspired investigations into their integration into automata learning. This paper introduces the probabilistic Minimally Adequate Teacher (pMAT) formulation, which leverages a probabilistic oracle that could give persistent errors randomly during answering the membership queries for deterministic finite automata (DFA) learning. Given the tendency of LLMs to produce hallucinatory content, we have developed techniques to improve answer accuracy and ensure the correctness of the learned automata. We propose the $\mathtt{Discrimination}$ prompt as well as the $\mathtt{Verification}$ prompt and explore their advantages over common prompts. Additionally, we compare DFA learning performance between the TTT algorithm and common active learning algorithms. To address the exponential number of persistent errors, we implement a dynamic query cache refinement algorithm that identifies and corrects conflicting queries by combining the active and passive learning algorithms. The empirical results demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our approach, providing a theoretical foundation for automata learning with LLMs in the loop.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Towards a compatible utilization of NVM, NVM-specialized kernel file systems and NVM-based disk file system accelerators have been proposed. However, these studies only focus on one or several characteristics of NVM, while failing to exploit its best practice by putting NVM in the proper position of the whole storage stack. In this paper, we present NVPC, a transparent acceleration to existing kernel file systems with an NVM-enhanced page cache. The acceleration lies in two aspects, respectively matching the desperate needs of existing disk file systems: sync writes and cache-missed operations. Besides, the fast DRAM page cache is preserved for cache-hit operations. For sync writes, a high-performance log-based sync absorbing area is provided to redirect data destination from the slow disk to the fast NVM. Meanwhile, the byte-addressable feature of NVM is used to prevent write amplification. For cache-missed operations, NVPC makes use of the idle space on NVM to extend the DRAM page cache, so that more and larger workloads can fit into the cache. NVPC is entirely implemented as a page cache, thus can provide efficient speed-up to disk file systems with full transparency to users and full compatibility to lower file systems.   In Filebench macro-benchmarks, NVPC achieves at most 3.55x, 2.84x, and 2.64x faster than NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS. In RocksDB workloads with working set larger than DRAM, NVPC achieves 1.12x, 2.59x, and 2.11x faster than NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS. Meanwhile, NVPC gains positive revenue from NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS in 62.5% of the tested cases in our read/write/sync mixed evaluation, demonstrating that NVPC is more balanced and adaptive to complex real-world workloads. Experimental results also show that NVPC is the only method that accelerates Ext-4 in particular cases for up to 15.19x, with no slow-down to any other use cases.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Electron-beam-induced conversion of materials in a transmission electron microscope uses the high power density of a localized electron beam of acceleration voltages above 100 kV as an energy source to transform matter at the sub-micron scale. Here, the e-beam-induced transformation of precursor microparticles employing a low-energy e-beam with an acceleration voltage of 30 kV in a scanning electron microscope is developed to increase the versatility and efficiency of the technique. Under these conditions, the technique can be classified between e-beam lithography, where the e-beam is used to mill holes in or grow some different material onto a substrate, and e-beam welding, where matter can be welded together when overcoming the melting phase. Modifying gold microparticles on an amorphous SiOx substrate reveals the dominant role of inelastic electron-matter interaction and subsequent localized heating for the observed melting and vaporization of the precursor microparticles under the electron beam. Monte-Carlo scattering simulations and thermodynamic modeling further support the findings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With large language models (LLMs) widely deployed in long content generation recently, there has emerged an increasing demand for efficient long-sequence inference support. However, key-value (KV) cache, which is stored to avoid re-computation, has emerged as a critical bottleneck by growing linearly in size with the sequence length. Due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, the entire KV cache will be loaded for every generated token, resulting in low utilization of computational cores and high latency. While various compression methods for KV cache have been proposed to alleviate this issue, they suffer from degradation in generation quality. We introduce TriForce, a hierarchical speculative decoding system that is scalable for long sequence generation. This approach leverages the original model weights and dynamic sparse KV cache via retrieval as a draft model, which serves as an intermediate layer in the hierarchy and is further speculated by a smaller model to reduce its drafting latency. TriForce not only facilitates impressive speedups for Llama2-7B-128K, achieving up to 2.31$\times$ on an A100 GPU but also showcases scalability in handling even longer contexts. For the offloading setting on two RTX 4090 GPUs, TriForce achieves 0.108s/token$\unicode{x2014}$only half as slow as the auto-regressive baseline on an A100, which attains 7.78$\times$ on our optimized offloading system. Additionally, TriForce performs 4.86$\times$ than DeepSpeed-Zero-Inference on a single RTX 4090 GPU. TriForce's robustness is highlighted by its consistently outstanding performance across various temperatures. The code is available at https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/TriForce.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models (LLMs) evolve, the increase in model depth and parameter number leads to substantial redundancy. To enhance the efficiency of the attention mechanism, previous works primarily compress the KV cache or group attention heads, while largely overlooking redundancy between layers. Our comprehensive analyses across various LLMs show that highly similar attention patterns persist within most layers. It's intuitive to save the computation by sharing attention weights across layers. However, further analysis reveals two challenges: (1) Directly sharing the weight matrix without carefully rearranging the attention heads proves to be ineffective; (2) Shallow layers are vulnerable to small deviations in attention weights. Driven by these insights, we introduce LiSA, a lightweight substitute for self-attention in well-trained LLMs. LiSA employs tiny feed-forward networks to align attention heads between adjacent layers and low-rank matrices to approximate differences in layer-wise attention weights. Evaluations encompassing 13 typical benchmarks demonstrate that LiSA maintains high response quality in terms of accuracy and perplexity while reducing redundant attention calculations within 53-84% of the total layers. Our implementations of LiSA achieve a 6X compression of Q and K, with maximum throughput improvements of 19.5% for LLaMA3-8B and 32.3% for LLaMA2-7B.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Many spectral CT applications require accurate material decomposition. Existing material decomposition algorithms are often susceptible to significant noise magnification or, in the case of one-step model-based approaches, hampered by slow convergence rates and large computational requirements. In this work, we proposed a novel framework - spectral diffusion posterior sampling (spectral DPS) - for one-step reconstruction and multi-material decomposition, which combines sophisticated prior information captured by one-time unsupervised learning and an arbitrary analytic physical system model. Spectral DPS is built upon a general DPS framework for nonlinear inverse problems. Several strategies developed in previous work, including jumpstart sampling, Jacobian approximation, and multi-step likelihood updates are applied facilitate stable and accurate decompositions. The effectiveness of spectral DPS was evaluated on a simulated dual-layer and a kV-switching spectral system as well as on a physical cone-beam CT (CBCT) test bench. In simulation studies, spectral DPS improved PSNR by 27.49% to 71.93% over baseline DPS and by 26.53% to 57.30% over MBMD, depending on the the region of interest. In physical phantom study, spectral DPS achieved a <1% error in estimating the mean density in a homogeneous region. Compared with baseline DPS, spectral DPS effectively avoided generating false structures in the homogeneous phantom and reduced the variability around edges. Both simulation and physical phantom studies demonstrated the superior performance of spectral DPS for stable and accurate material decomposition.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To index the increasing volume of data, modern data indexes are typically stored on SSDs and cached in DRAM. However, searching such an index has resulted in significant I/O traffic due to limited access locality and inefficient cache utilization. At the heart of index searching is the operation of filtering through vast data spans to isolate a small, relevant subset, which involves basic equality tests rather than the complex arithmetic provided by modern CPUs. This paper introduces the Search-in-Memory (SiM) chip, which demonstrates the feasibility of performing data filtering directly within a NAND flash memory chip, transmitting only relevant search results rather than complete pages. Instead of adding complex circuits, we propose repurposing existing circuitry for efficient and accurate bitwise parallel matching. We demonstrate how different data structures can use our flexible SIMD command interface to offload index searches. This strategy not only frees up the CPU for more computationally demanding tasks, but it also optimizes DRAM usage for write buffering, significantly lowering energy consumption associated with I/O transmission between the CPU and DRAM. Extensive testing across a wide range of workloads reveals up to a 9X speedup in write-heavy workloads and up to 45% energy savings due to reduced read and write I/O. Furthermore, we achieve significant reductions in median and tail read latencies of up to 89% and 85% respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> One key to enabling high-performance serverless computing is to mitigate cold-starts. Current solutions utilize a warm pool to keep function alive: a warm-start can be analogous to a CPU cache-hit. However, modern cache has multiple hierarchies and the last-level cache is shared among cores, whereas the warm pool is limited to a single tenant for security concerns. Also, the warm pool keep-alive policy can be further optimized using cache replacement algorithms. In this paper, we borrow practical optimizations from caching, and design FaasCamp, a caching-aided multi-tenant serverless computing framework. FaasCamp extends the single-tier warm pool into multi-tiers, with a reclaim pool introduced enabling secure function instance sharing among tenants. Also, FaasCamp leverages machine learning to approximate the optimal cache replacement policy to improve the warm rate. We have implemented a prototype and conducted extensive experiments under multiple scenarios. The results show that FaasCamp can outperform existing platforms with minimal overhead.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Do transformers "think ahead" during inference at a given position? It is known transformers prepare information in the hidden states of the forward pass at time step $t$ that is then used in future forward passes $t+\tau$. We posit two explanations for this phenomenon: pre-caching, in which off-diagonal gradient terms present during training result in the model computing features at $t$ irrelevant to the present inference task but useful for the future, and breadcrumbs, in which features most relevant to time step $t$ are already the same as those that would most benefit inference at time $t+\tau$. We test these hypotheses by training language models without propagating gradients to past timesteps, a scheme we formalize as myopic training. In a constructed synthetic data setting, we find clear evidence for pre-caching. In the autoregressive language modeling setting, our experiments are more suggestive of the breadcrumbs hypothesis, though pre-caching increases with model scale.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multi-turn dialogues are a key interaction method between humans and Large Language Models (LLMs), as conversations extend over multiple rounds, keeping LLMs' high generation quality and low latency is a challenge. Mainstream LLMs can be grouped into two categories based on masking strategy: causal LLM and prefix LLM. Several works have demonstrated that prefix LLMs tend to outperform causal ones in scenarios that heavily depend on historical context such as multi-turn dialogues or in-context learning, thanks to their bidirectional attention on prefix sequences. However, prefix LLMs have an inherent inefficient training problem in multi-turn dialogue datasets. In addition, the attention mechanism of prefix LLM makes it unable to reuse Key-Value Cache (KV Cache) across dialogue rounds to reduce generation latency. In this paper, we propose a novel masking scheme called Intermittent Semi-working Mask (ISM) to address these problems. Specifically, we apply alternate bidirectional and unidirectional attention on queries and answers in the dialogue history. In this way, ISM is able to maintain the high quality of prefix LLM and low generation latency of causal LLM, simultaneously. Extensive experiments illustrate that our ISM achieves significant performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents MoE-Infinity, an offloading-efficient serving system for sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) models. To optimize offloading, MoE-Infinity achieves novel request-level tracing for expert activation, capturing MoE's sparse execution patterns such as selective activation, group activation, and skewed reuse. Leveraging the request-level trace, MoE-Infinity performs effective expert prefetching and expert caching, achieving high efficiency in transferring model parameters from host memory to GPU memory. Experimental results demonstrate that MoE-Infinity achieves low latency comparable to expensive full-GPU deployments, which require up to 4X more GPU resources than MoE-Infinity. Compared to offloading-supporting LLM serving systems such as DeepSpeed-Inference, Llama.cpp, Mixtral Offloading, and BrainStorm, MoE-Infinity exhibits superior latency performance, providing 2-20X improvements when serving various MoE models for a large collection of LLM tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Self-attention is an essential component of large language models (LLM) but a significant source of inference latency for long sequences. In multi-tenant LLM serving scenarios, the compute and memory operation cost of self-attention can be optimized by using the probability that multiple LLM requests have shared system prompts in prefixes. In this paper, we introduce ChunkAttention, a prefix-aware self-attention module that can detect matching prompt prefixes across multiple requests and share their key/value tensors in memory at runtime to improve the memory utilization of KV cache. This is achieved by breaking monolithic key/value tensors into smaller chunks and structuring them into the auxiliary prefix tree. Consequently, on top of the prefix-tree based KV cache, we design an efficient self-attention kernel, where a two-phase partition algorithm is implemented to improve the data locality during self-attention computation in the presence of shared system prompts. Experiments show that ChunkAttention can speed up the self-attention kernel by 3.2-4.8$\times$ compared to the state-of-the-art implementation, with the length of the system prompt ranging from 1024 to 4096.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph neural network training is mainly categorized into mini-batch and full-batch training methods. The mini-batch training method samples subgraphs from the original graph in each iteration. This sampling operation introduces extra computation overhead and reduces the training accuracy. Meanwhile, the full-batch training method calculates the features and corresponding gradients of all vertices in each iteration, and therefore has higher convergence accuracy. However, in the distributed cluster, frequent remote accesses of vertex features and gradients lead to huge communication overhead, thus restricting the overall training efficiency.   In this paper, we introduce the cached-based distributed full-batch graph neural network training framework (CDFGNN). We propose the adaptive cache mechanism to reduce the remote vertex access by caching the historical features and gradients of neighbor vertices. Besides, we further optimize the communication overhead by quantifying the messages and designing the graph partition algorithm for the hierarchical communication architecture. Experiments show that the adaptive cache mechanism reduces remote vertex accesses by 63.14% on average. Combined with communication quantization and hierarchical GP algorithm, CDFGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art distributed full-batch training frameworks by 30.39% in our experiments. Our results indicate that CDFGNN has great potential in accelerating distributed full-batch GNN training tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present StarCache, a new in-network caching architecture that can cache variable-length items to balance a wide range of key-value workloads. Unlike existing works, StarCache does not cache hot items in the switch memory. Instead, we make hot items revisit the switch data plane continuously by exploiting packet recirculation. Our approach keeps cached key-value pairs in the switch data plane while freeing them from item size limitations caused by hardware constraints. We implement a StarCache prototype on an Intel Tofino switch. Our experimental results show that StarCache can balance highly skewed workloads with various key and value sizes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent large language model applications, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation and chatbots, have led to an increased need to process longer input contexts. However, this requirement is hampered by inherent limitations. Architecturally, models are constrained by a context window defined during training. Additionally, processing extensive texts requires substantial GPU memory. We propose a novel approach, Finch, to compress the input context by leveraging the pre-trained model weights of the self-attention. Given a prompt and a long text, Finch iteratively identifies the most relevant Key (K) and Value (V) pairs over chunks of the text conditioned on the prompt. Only such pairs are stored in the KV cache, which, within the space constrained by the context window, ultimately contains a compressed version of the long text. Our proposal enables models to consume large inputs even with high compression (up to 93x) while preserving semantic integrity without the need for fine-tuning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, large language models (LLM) based on transformers are facing memory bottleneck issues due to KV cache, especially in long sequence handling. Previous researches proposed KV cache compression techniques that identify insignificant tokens based on Accumulative Attention Scores and removes their items from KV cache, noting that only few tokens play an important role in attention operations. However, we have observed that the existing Accumulative Attention Score is not suitable for the transformer decoder structure. In the decoder model, the number of times the Attention Score accumulates varies depending on the order of token appearance due to the effect of masking, causing an uneven comparison between tokens. To solve this, we propose Accumulative Attention Score with Forgetting Factor (A2SF) technique, which introduces a Forgetting Factor in the Attention Score accumulation process. A2SF applies a penalty to the past Attention Score generated from old tokens by repeatedly multiplying the Forgetting Factor to the Attention Score over time. Therefore, older tokens receive a larger penalty, providing fairness among different ages of tokens. Through the fair comparison among tokens, we can more effectively select important tokens. We have verified the accuracy improvement through A2SF in the OPT and LLaMA models and A2SF improves the accuracy of LLaMA 2 by up to 7.8% and 5.1% on 1-shot and 0-shot.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The possibility of electric field control of magnetocaloric effect through quasi-isostatic compression as a result of the converse piezoelectric effect was demonstrated on cylindrical type magnetoelectric composite MnAs/PZT. It was shown that an electric voltage of 100 V corresponding to an electric field of E ~0.3 kV/mm applied to the walls of the piezoelectric component PZT of the MnAs/PZT composite contributes to an increase in the maximum adiabatic temperature change by 0.2 K in the temperature range of the magnetostructural phase transition of MnAs ~317 K at magnetic field change of 1.8 T. Calculations using the finite element method have shown that an electric field voltage of 100 V is capable of creating a quasi-isostatic mechanical stress in the region inside a cylindrical PZT tube of ~3 MPa. Moreover, in the region of weak pressures up to 10 MPa, the contribution to the MCE from piezo compression linearly depends on the electrical voltage that can be used for control the MCE

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> KV-Cache compression methods generally sample a KV-Cache of effectual tokens or quantize it into lower bits. However, these methods cannot exploit the redundancy of the hidden dimension of KV tensors. This paper investigates a unique hidden dimension approach called Palu, a novel KV-Cache compression framework that utilizes low-rank projection. Palu decomposes the linear layers into low-rank matrices, caches the smaller intermediate states, and reconstructs the full keys and values on the fly. To improve accuracy, compression rate, and efficiency, Palu further encompasses (1) a medium-grained low-rank decomposition scheme, (2) an efficient rank search algorithm, (3) a low-rank-aware quantization algorithm, and (4) matrix fusion with optimized GPU kernels. Our extensive experiments with popular LLMs show that Palu can compress KV-Cache by more than 91.25% while maintaining a significantly better accuracy (up to 1.19 lower perplexity) than state-of-the-art KV-Cache quantization methods at a similar or even higher memory usage. When compressing KV-Cache for 50%, Palu delivers up to 1.61x end-to-end speedup for the attention module. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/shadowpa0327/Palu.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, achieving unprecedented performance across a variety of applications by leveraging increased model sizes and sequence lengths. However, the associated rise in computational and memory costs poses significant challenges, particularly in managing long sequences due to the quadratic complexity of the transformer attention mechanism. This paper focuses on the long-context scenario, addressing the inefficiencies in KV cache memory consumption during inference. Unlike existing approaches that optimize the memory based on the sequence lengths, we uncover that the channel dimension of the KV cache exhibits significant redundancy, characterized by unbalanced magnitude distribution and low-rank structure in attention weights. Based on these observations, we propose ThinK, a novel query-dependent KV cache pruning method designed to minimize attention weight loss while selectively pruning the least significant channels. Our approach not only maintains or enhances model accuracy but also achieves a reduction in memory costs by over 20% compared with vanilla KV cache eviction methods. Extensive evaluations on the LLaMA3 and Mistral models across various long-sequence datasets confirm the efficacy of ThinK, setting a new precedent for efficient LLM deployment without compromising performance. We also outline the potential of extending our method to value cache pruning, demonstrating ThinK's versatility and broad applicability in reducing both memory and computational overheads.

The performance of sparse kernels varies greatly depending on the structure of the input matrix, making it difficult to gain a comprehensive understanding of sparse computation and its relationship to inputs, algorithms, and target machine architecture. Despite extensive research on certain sparse kernels, such as Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV), the overall family of sparse algorithms has yet to be investigated as a whole. This paper introduces SpChar, a workload characterization methodology for general sparse computation. SpChar employs tree-based models to identify the most relevant hardware and input characteristics, starting from hardware and input-related metrics gathered from Performance Monitoring Counters (PMCs) and matrices. Our analysis enables the creation of a characterization loop that facilitates the optimization of sparse computation by mapping the impact of architectural features to inputs and algorithmic choices. We apply SpChar to more than 600 matrices from the SuiteSparse Matrix collection and three state-of-the-art Arm CPUs to determine the critical hardware and software characteristics that affect sparse computation. In our analysis, we determine that the biggest limiting factors for high-performance sparse computation are (1) the latency of the memory system, (2) the pipeline flush overhead resulting from branch misprediction, and (3) the poor reuse of cached elements. Additionally, we propose software and hardware optimizations that designers can implement to create a platform suitable for sparse computation. We then investigate these optimizations using the gem5 simulator to achieve a significant speedup of up to 2.63x compared to a CPU where the optimizations are not applied.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Applications with irregular data structures, data-dependent control flows and fine-grained data transfers (e.g., real-world graph computations) perform poorly on cache-based systems. We propose the UpDown accelerator that supports fine-grained execution with novel architecture mechanisms - lightweight threading, event-driven scheduling, efficient ultra-short threads, and split-transaction DRAM access with software-controlled synchronization. These hardware primitives support software programmable events, enabling high performance on diverse data structures and algorithms. UpDown also supports scalable performance; hardware replication enables programs to scale up performance. Evaluation results show UpDown's flexibility and scalability enable it to outperform CPUs on graph mining and analytics computations by up to 116-195x geomean speedup and more than 4x speedup over prior accelerators. We show that UpDown generates high memory parallelism (~4.6x over CPU) required for memory intensive graph computations. We present measurements that attribute the performance of UpDown (23x architectural advantage) to its individual architectural mechanisms. Finally, we also analyze the area and power cost of UpDown's mechanisms for software programmability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in large-scale vision-language models have achieved impressive performance in various zero-shot image classification tasks. While prior studies have demonstrated significant improvements by introducing few-shot labelled target samples, they still require labelling of target samples, which greatly degrades their scalability and generalizability while handling various visual recognition tasks. We design NtUA, a Noise-tolerant Unsupervised Adapter that allows the learning of effective target models with few unlabelled target samples. NtUA works as a key-value cache that formulates visual features and predicted pseudo-labels of the few unlabelled target samples as key-value pairs. It consists of two complementary designs. The first is adaptive cache formation that combats pseudo-label noises by weighting the key-value pairs according to their prediction confidence. The second is knowledge-guided cache refinement, which refines pair values (i.e., pseudo-labels) and cache weights by leveraging knowledge distillation from large-scale vision language models. Extensive experiments show that NtUA achieves superior performance consistently across multiple widely adopted benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving collaborative approach for training models in wireless networks, with channel estimation emerging as a promising application. Despite extensive studies on FL-empowered channel estimation, the security concerns associated with FL require meticulous attention. In a scenario where small base stations (SBSs) serve as local models trained on cached data, and a macro base station (MBS) functions as the global model setting, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability of FL, launching attacks with various adversarial attacks or deployment tactics. In this paper, we analyze such vulnerabilities, corresponding solutions were brought forth, and validated through simulation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Software caches are an intrinsic component of almost every computer system. Consequently, caching algorithms, particularly eviction policies, are the topic of many papers. Almost all these prior papers evaluate the caching algorithm based on its hit ratio, namely the fraction of requests that are found in the cache, as opposed to disk. The hit ratio is viewed as a proxy for traditional performance metrics like system throughput or response time. Intuitively it makes sense that higher hit ratio should lead to higher throughput (and lower response time), since more requests are found in the cache (low access time) as opposed to the disk (high access time).   This paper challenges this intuition. We show that increasing the hit ratio can actually hurt the throughput (and response time) for many caching algorithms. Our investigation follows a three-pronged approach involving (i) queueing modeling and analysis, (ii) implementation and measurement, and (iii) simulation to validate the accuracy of the queueing model. We also show that the phenomenon of throughput decreasing at higher hit ratios is likely to be more pronounced in future systems, where the trend is towards faster disks and higher numbers of cores per CPU.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) based on cache coherency is crucial for high-end embedded systems like automotive applications. RISC-V is gaining traction, and open-source hardware (OSH) platforms offer solutions to issues such as IP costs and vendor dependency. Existing multi-core cache-coherent RISC-V platforms are complex and not efficient for small embedded core clusters. We propose an open-source SystemVerilog implementation of a lightweight snoop-based cache-coherent cluster of Linux-capable CVA6 cores. Our design uses the MOESI protocol via the Arm's AMBA ACE protocol. Evaluated with Splash-3 benchmarks, our solution shows up to 32.87% faster performance in a dual-core setup and an average improvement of 15.8% over OpenPiton. Synthesized using GF 22nm FDSOI technology, the Cache Coherency Unit occupies only 1.6% of the system area.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In-memory computing promises to overcome the von Neumann bottleneck in computer systems by performing computations directly within the memory. Previous research has suggested using Spin-Transfer Torque RAM (STT-RAM) for in-memory computing due to its non-volatility, low leakage power, high density, endurance, and commercial viability. This paper explores hierarchical in-memory computing, where different levels of the memory hierarchy are augmented with processing elements to optimize workload execution. The paper investigates processing in memory (PiM) using non-volatile STT-RAM and processing in cache (PiC) using volatile STT-RAM with relaxed retention, which helps mitigate STT-RAM's write latency and energy overheads. We analyze tradeoffs and overheads associated with data movement for PiC versus write overheads for PiM using STT-RAMs for various workloads. We examine workload characteristics, such as computational intensity and CPU-dependent workloads with limited instruction-level parallelism, and their impact on PiC/PiM tradeoffs. Using these workloads, we evaluate computing in STT-RAM versus SRAM at different cache hierarchy levels and explore the potential of heterogeneous STT-RAM cache architectures with various retention times for PiC and CPU-based computing. Our experiments reveal significant advantages of STT-RAM-based PiC over PiM for specific workloads. Finally, we describe open research problems in hierarchical in-memory computing architectures to further enhance this paradigm.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Processing-in-cache (PiC) and Processing-in-memory (PiM) architectures, especially those utilizing bit-line computing, offer promising solutions to mitigate data movement bottlenecks within the memory hierarchy. While previous studies have explored the integration of compute units within individual memory levels, the complexity and potential overheads associated with these designs have often limited their capabilities. This paper introduces a novel PiC/PiM architecture, Concurrent Hierarchical In-Memory Processing (CHIME), which strategically incorporates heterogeneous compute units across multiple levels of the memory hierarchy. This design targets the efficient execution of diverse, domain-specific workloads by placing computations closest to the data where it optimizes performance, energy consumption, data movement costs, and area. CHIME employs STT-RAM due to its various advantages in PiC/PiM computing, such as high density, low leakage, and better resiliency to data corruption from activating multiple word lines. We demonstrate that CHIME enhances concurrency and improves compute unit utilization at each level of the memory hierarchy. We present strategies for exploring the design space, grouping, and placing the compute units across the memory hierarchy. Experiments reveal that, compared to the state-of-the-art bit-line computing approaches, CHIME achieves significant speedup and energy savings of 57.95% and 78.23% for various domain-specific workloads, while reducing the overheads associated with single-level compute designs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Relaxed retention (or volatile) spin-transfer torque RAM (STT-RAM) has been widely studied as a way to reduce STT-RAM's write energy and latency overheads. Given a relaxed retention time STT-RAM level one (L1) cache, we analyze the impacts of dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) -- a common optimization in modern processors -- on STT-RAM L1 cache design. Our analysis reveals that, apart from the fact that different applications may require different retention times, the clock frequency, which is typically ignored in most STT-RAM studies, may also significantly impact applications' retention time needs. Based on our findings, we propose an asymmetric-retention core (ARC) design for multicore architectures. ARC features retention time heterogeneity to specialize STT-RAM retention times to applications' needs. We also propose a runtime prediction model to determine the best core on which to run an application, based on the applications' characteristics, their retention time requirements, and available DVFS settings. Results reveal that the proposed approach can reduce the average cache energy by 20.19% and overall processor energy by 7.66%, compared to a homogeneous STT-RAM cache design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Prior studies have shown that the retention time of the non-volatile spin-transfer torque RAM (STT-RAM) can be relaxed in order to reduce STT-RAM's write energy and latency. However, since different applications may require different retention times, STT-RAM retention times must be critically explored to satisfy various applications' needs. This process can be challenging due to exploration overhead, and exacerbated by the fact that STT-RAM caches are emerging and are not readily available for design time exploration. This paper explores using known and easily obtainable statistics (e.g., SRAM statistics) to predict the appropriate STT-RAM retention times, in order to minimize exploration overhead. We propose an STT-RAM Cache Retention Time (SCART) model, which utilizes machine learning to enable design time or runtime prediction of right-provisioned STT-RAM retention times for latency or energy optimization. Experimental results show that, on average, SCART can reduce the latency and energy by 20.34% and 29.12%, respectively, compared to a homogeneous retention time while reducing the exploration overheads by 52.58% compared to prior work.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs), epitomized by ChatGPT' s release in late 2022, have revolutionized various industries with their advanced language comprehension. However, their efficiency is challenged by the Transformer architecture' s struggle with handling long texts. KV-Cache has emerged as a pivotal solution to this issue, converting the time complexity of token generation from quadratic to linear, albeit with increased GPU memory overhead proportional to conversation length. With the development of the LLM community and academia, various KV-Cache compression methods have been proposed. In this review, we dissect the various properties of KV-Cache and elaborate on various methods currently used to optimize the KV-Cache space usage of LLMs. These methods span the pre-training phase, deployment phase, and inference phase, and we summarize the commonalities and differences among these methods. Additionally, we list some metrics for evaluating the long-text capabilities of large language models, from both efficiency and capability perspectives. Our review thus sheds light on the evolving landscape of LLM optimization, offering insights into future advancements in this dynamic field.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this short paper, we characterize symmetric locality. In designing algorithms, compilers, and systems, data movement is a common bottleneck in high-performance computation, in which we improve cache and memory performance. We study a special type of data reuse in the form of repeated traversals, or re-traversals, which are based on the symmetric group. The cyclic and sawtooth traces are previously known results in symmetric locality, and in this work, we would like to generalize this result for any re-traversal. Then, we also provide an abstract framework for applications in compiler design and machine learning models to improve the memory performance of certain programs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Colocating high-priority, latency-sensitive (LS) and low-priority, best-effort (BE) DNN inference services reduces the total cost of ownership (TCO) of GPU clusters. Limited by bottlenecks such as VRAM channel conflicts and PCIe bus contentions, existing GPU sharing solutions are unable to avoid resource conflicts among concurrently executing tasks, failing to achieve both low latency for LS tasks and high throughput for BE tasks. To bridge this gap, this paper presents Missile, a general GPU sharing solution for multi-tenant DNN inference on NVIDIA GPUs. Missile approximates fine-grained GPU hardware resource isolation between multiple LS and BE DNN tasks at software level. Through comprehensive reverse engineering, Missile first reveals a general VRAM channel hash mapping architecture of NVIDIA GPUs and eliminates VRAM channel conflicts using software-level cache coloring. It also isolates the PCIe bus and fairly allocates PCIe bandwidth using completely fair scheduler. We evaluate 12 mainstream DNNs with synthetic and real-world workloads on four GPUs. The results show that compared to the state-of-the-art GPU sharing solutions, Missile reduces tail latency for LS services by up to ~50%, achieves up to 6.1x BE job throughput, and allocates PCIe bus bandwidth to tenants on-demand for optimal performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper investigates the role of CLIP image embeddings within the Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) framework, focusing on their impact on video generation quality and computational efficiency. Our findings indicate that CLIP embeddings, while crucial for aesthetic quality, do not significantly contribute towards the subject and background consistency of video outputs. Moreover, the computationally expensive cross-attention mechanism can be effectively replaced by a simpler linear layer. This layer is computed only once at the first diffusion inference step, and its output is then cached and reused throughout the inference process, thereby enhancing efficiency while maintaining high-quality outputs. Building on these insights, we introduce the VCUT, a training-free approach optimized for efficiency within the SVD architecture. VCUT eliminates temporal cross-attention and replaces spatial cross-attention with a one-time computed linear layer, significantly reducing computational load. The implementation of VCUT leads to a reduction of up to 322T Multiple-Accumulate Operations (MACs) per video and a decrease in model parameters by up to 50M, achieving a 20% reduction in latency compared to the baseline. Our approach demonstrates that conditioning during the Semantic Binding stage is sufficient, eliminating the need for continuous computation across all inference steps and setting a new standard for efficient video generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cloud key-value (KV) stores provide businesses with a cost-effective and adaptive alternative to traditional on-premise data management solutions. KV stores frequently consist of heterogeneous clusters, characterized by varying hardware specifications of the deployment nodes, with each node potentially running a distinct version of the KV store software. This heterogeneity is accompanied by the diverse metadata that they need to manage. In this study, we introduce MetaHive, a cache-optimized approach to managing metadata in heterogeneous KV store clusters. MetaHive disaggregates the original data from its associated metadata to promote independence between them, while maintaining their interconnection during usage. This makes the metadata opaque from the downstream processes and the other KV stores in the cluster. MetaHive also ensures that the KV and metadata entries are stored in the vicinity of each other in memory and storage. This allows MetaHive to optimally utilize the caching mechanism without extra storage read overhead for metadata retrieval. We deploy MetaHive to ensure data integrity in RocksDB and demonstrate its rapid data validation with minimal effect on performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the field of instruction-following large vision-language models (LVLMs), the efficient deployment of these models faces challenges, notably due to the high memory demands of their key-value (KV) caches. Conventional cache management strategies for LLMs focus on cache eviction, which often fails to address the specific needs of multimodal instruction-following models. Recognizing this gap, in this paper, we introduce Elastic Cache, a novel approach that benefits from applying distinct acceleration methods for instruction encoding and output generation stages. We investigate the metrics of importance in different stages and propose an importance-driven cache merging strategy to prune redundancy caches. Instead of discarding less important caches, our strategy identifies important key/value vectors as anchor points. Surrounding less important caches are then merged with these anchors, enhancing the preservation of contextual information in the KV caches while yielding an arbitrary acceleration ratio. For instruction encoding, we utilize the frequency to evaluate the importance of caches. Regarding output generation, we prioritize tokens based on their distance with an offset, by which both the initial and most recent tokens are retained. Results on a range of LVLMs demonstrate that Elastic Cache not only boosts efficiency but also notably outperforms existing pruning methods in language generation across various tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficiently serving large language models (LLMs) requires batching of many requests to reduce the cost per request. Yet, with larger batch sizes and longer context lengths, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores attention keys and values to avoid re-computations, significantly increases memory demands and becomes the new bottleneck in speed and memory usage. Additionally, the loading of the KV cache causes the computational core to be idle, which limits the inference speed. A straightforward and effective solution to reduce KV cache size is quantization, which decreases the total bytes taken by KV cache. However, there is a lack of in-depth studies that explore the element distribution of KV cache to understand the hardness and limitation of KV cache quantization. To fill the gap, we conducted a comprehensive study on the element distribution in KV cache of popular LLMs. Our findings indicate that the key cache should be quantized per-channel, i.e., group elements along the channel dimension and quantize them together. In contrast, the value cache should be quantized per-token. From this analysis, we developed a tuning-free 2bit KV cache quantization algorithm named KIVI. With hardware-friendly implementation, KIVI can enable Llama, Falcon, and Mistral models to maintain almost the same quality while using $\mathbf{2.6\times}$ less peak memory (including model weight). This reduction in memory usage enables up to $\mathbf{4\times}$ larger batch size, bringing $\mathbf{2.35\times \sim 3.47\times}$ throughput on real LLM inference workload.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Building efficient inference framework has gained increasing interests for research community. Early-exit models, a variant of LLMs, improves the inference efficiency of LLMs by skipping rest layers and directly generate output tokens when they are confident enough. However, there is no work of LLM inference framework that takes early-exit models into consideration. This is non-trivial as prior art on LLM inference cannot be directly applied to early-exit models. In this work, we solves two key challenges in building efficient inference framework for early-exit models: (1) batch inference at iteration-level granularity; and (2) KV cache management. For the former, we propose to process the batch until all sequences surpass the early-exit confidence threshold. For the latter, we propose to fill the KV cache of rest layers before the iteration terminates. Our evaluation shows that, compared with the original vLLM operating at full layers, our solution achieves up to 1.25x speed up.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Existing LLM training and inference frameworks struggle in boosting efficiency with sparsity while maintaining the integrity of context and model architecture. Inspired by the sharding concept in database and the fact that attention parallelizes over heads on accelerators, we propose Sparsely-Sharded (S2) Attention, an attention algorithm that allocates heterogeneous context partitions for different attention heads to divide and conquer. S2-Attention enforces each attention head to only attend to a partition of contexts following a strided sparsity pattern, while the full context is preserved as the union of all the shards. As attention heads are processed in separate thread blocks, the context reduction for each head can thus produce end-to-end speed-up and memory reduction. At inference, LLMs trained with S2-Attention can then take the KV cache reduction as free meals with guaranteed model quality preserve. In experiments, we show S2-Attentioncan provide as much as (1) 25.3X wall-clock attention speed-up over FlashAttention-2, resulting in 6X reduction in end-to-end training time and 10X inference latency, (2) on-par model training quality compared to default attention, (3)perfect needle retrieval accuracy over 32K context window. On top of the algorithm, we build DKernel, an LLM training and inference kernel library that allows users to customize sparsity patterns for their own models. We open-sourced DKerneland make it compatible with Megatron, Pytorch, and vLLM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this work, a distributed server system composed of multiple servers that holds some coded files and multiple users that are interested in retrieving the linear functions of the files is investigated, where the servers are robust, blind and adversarial in the sense that any $J$ servers can together recover all files, while any $I$ colluding servers cannot obtain any information about the files, and at most $A$ servers maliciously provides erroneous information. In addition, the file library must be secure from a wiretapper who obtains all the signals, and the demands of any subset of users must kept private from the other users and servers, even if they collude. A coding scheme is proposed by incorporating the ideas of Shamir's secret sharing and key superposition into the framework of Placement Delivery Array (PDA), originally proposed to characterize the single-server coded caching system without any security or privacy constraints. It is shown that PDAs associated to Maddah-Ali and Niesen's coded caching scheme results in an achievable memory-storage-communication region, such that the storage size and communication load were optimal to within a multiplicative gap, except for the small memory regime when the number of files was smaller than the number of users.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are often tested in simulation to estimate the probability they will violate safety specifications. Two common issues arise when using existing techniques to produce this estimation: If violations occur rarely, simple Monte-Carlo sampling techniques can fail to produce efficient estimates; if simulation horizons are too long, importance sampling techniques (which learn proposal distributions from past simulations) can fail to converge. This paper addresses both issues by interleaving rare-event sampling techniques with online specification monitoring algorithms. We use adaptive multi-level splitting to decompose simulations into partial trajectories, then calculate the distance of those partial trajectories to failure by leveraging robustness metrics from Signal Temporal Logic (STL). By caching those partial robustness metric values, we can efficiently re-use computations across multiple sampling stages. Our experiments on an interstate lane-change scenario show our method is viable for testing simulated AV-pipelines, efficiently estimating failure probabilities for STL specifications based on real traffic rules. We produce better estimates than Monte-Carlo and importance sampling in fewer simulations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Rich textual and topological information of textual graphs need to be modeled in real-world applications such as webpages, e-commerce, and academic articles. Practitioners have been long following the path of adopting a shallow text encoder and a subsequent graph neural network (GNN) to solve this problem. In light of recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), it is apparent that integrating LLMs for enhanced textual encoding can substantially improve the performance of textual graphs. Nevertheless, the efficiency of these methods poses a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose ENGINE, a parameter- and memory-efficient fine-tuning method for textual graphs with an LLM encoder. The key insight is to combine the LLMs and GNNs through a tunable side structure, which significantly reduces the training complexity without impairing the joint model's capacity. Extensive experiments on textual graphs demonstrate our method's effectiveness by achieving the best model performance, meanwhile having the lowest training cost compared to previous methods. Moreover, we introduce two variants with caching and dynamic early exit to further enhance training and inference speed. Specifically, caching accelerates ENGINE's training by 12x, and dynamic early exit achieves up to 5x faster inference with a negligible performance drop (at maximum 1.17% relevant drop across 7 datasets).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformers have emerged as the backbone of large language models (LLMs). However, generation remains inefficient due to the need to store in memory a cache of key-value representations for past tokens, whose size scales linearly with the input sequence length and batch size. As a solution, we propose Dynamic Memory Compression (DMC), a method for online key-value cache compression at inference time. Most importantly, the model learns to apply different compression ratios in different heads and layers. We retrofit pre-trained LLMs such as Llama 2 (7B, 13B and 70B) into DMC Transformers, achieving up to 7x throughput increase during auto-regressive inference on an NVIDIA H100 GPU. DMC is applied via continued pre-training on a negligible percentage of the original data without adding any extra parameters. DMC preserves the original downstream performance with up to 4x cache compression, outperforming up-trained grouped-query attention (GQA) and key-value eviction policies (H$_2$O, TOVA). GQA and DMC can be even combined to obtain compounded gains. Hence, DMC can serve as a drop-in replacement for KV caching in existing LLMs to fit longer contexts and larger batches within any given memory budget.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Web caches play a crucial role in web performance and scalability. However, detecting cached responses is challenging when web servers do not reliably communicate the cache status through standardized headers. This paper presents a novel methodology for cache detection using timing analysis. Our approach eliminates the dependency on cache status headers, making it applicable to any web server. The methodology relies on sending paired requests using HTTP multiplexing functionality and makes heavy use of cache-busting to control the origin of the responses. By measuring the time it takes to receive responses from paired requests, we can determine if a response is cached or not. In each pair, one request is cache-busted to force retrieval from the origin server, while the other request is not and might be served from the cache, if present. A faster response time for the non-cache-busted request compared to the cache-busted one suggests the first one is coming from the cache. We implemented this approach in a tool and achieved an estimated accuracy of 89.6% compared to state-of-the-art methods based on cache status headers. Leveraging our cache detection approach, we conducted a large-scale experiment on the Tranco Top 50k websites. We identified a significant presence of hidden caches (5.8%) that do not advertise themselves through headers. Additionally, we employed our methodology to detect Web Cache Deception (WCD) vulnerabilities in these hidden caches. We discovered that 1.020 of them are susceptible to WCD vulnerabilities, potentially leaking sensitive data. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our timing analysis methodology for cache discovery and highlight the importance of a tool that does not rely on cache-communicated cache status headers.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> CXL (Compute Express Link) is an emerging open industry-standard interconnect between processing and memory devices that is expected to revolutionize the way systems are designed in the near future. It enables cache-coherent shared memory pools in a disaggregated fashion at unprecedented scales, allowing algorithms to interact with a variety of storage devices using simple loads and stores in a cacheline granularity. Alongside with unleashing unique opportunities for a wide range of applications, CXL introduces new challenges of data management and crash consistency. Alas, CXL lacks an adequate programming model, which makes reasoning about the correctness and expected behaviors of algorithms and systems on top of it nearly impossible.   In this work, we present CXL0, the first programming model for concurrent programs running on top of CXL. We propose a high-level abstraction for CXL memory accesses and formally define operational semantics on top of that abstraction. We provide a set of general transformations that adapt concurrent algorithms to the new disruptive technology. Using these transformations, every linearizable algorithm can be easily transformed into its provably correct version in the face of a full-system or sub-system crash. We believe that this work will serve as the stepping stone for systems design and modelling on top of CXL, and support the development of future models as software and hardware evolve.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are not only resource-intensive to train but even more costly to deploy in production. Therefore, recent work has attempted to prune blocks of LLMs based on cheap proxies for estimating block importance, effectively removing 10% of blocks in well-trained LLaMa-2 and Mistral 7b models without any significant degradation of downstream metrics. In this paper, we explore different block importance metrics by considering adaptive metrics such as Shapley value in addition to static ones explored in prior work. We show that adaptive metrics exhibit a trade-off in performance between tasks i.e., improvement on one task may degrade performance on the other due to differences in the computed block influences. Furthermore, we extend this analysis from a complete block to individual self-attention and feed-forward layers, highlighting the propensity of the self-attention layers to be more amendable to pruning, even allowing removal of upto 33% of the self-attention layers without incurring any performance degradation on MMLU for Mistral 7b (significant reduction in costly maintenance of KV-cache). Finally, we look at simple performance recovery techniques to emulate the pruned layers by training lightweight additive bias or low-rank linear adapters. Performance recovery using emulated updates avoids performance degradation for the initial blocks (up to 5% absolute improvement on MMLU), which is either competitive or superior to the learning-based technique.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Integrating coded caching (CC) into multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications may significantly enhance the achievable degrees of freedom (DoF) of the wireless networks. In this paper, we consider a cache-aided MIMO configuration with a CC gain $t$, where a server with $L$ Tx antennas communicates with $K$ users, each with $G$ Rx antennas. In the proposed content-aware MIMO strategy, we carefully adjust the number of users $\Omega$ and the number of parallel streams decoded by each user $\beta$ served in each transmission to maximize the DoF. As a result, we achieve a DoF of ${\max_{\beta, \Omega }}{\Omega \beta}$, where ${\beta \le \mathrm{min}\big(G,\frac{L \binom{\Omega-1}{t}}{1 + (\Omega - t-1)\binom{\Omega-1}{t}}\big)}$. To prove the achievability of the proposed DoF bound, we provide a novel transmission strategy based on the simultaneous unicasting of multiple data streams. In this strategy, the missing data packets are scheduled such that the number of parallel streams per transmission is maximized while the decodability of all useful terms by each target user is guaranteed. Numerical simulations validate the findings, confirming the enhanced DoF and improved performance of the proposed design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across various domains, processing millions of daily requests. This surge in demand poses significant challenges in optimizing throughput and latency while keeping costs manageable. The Key-Value (KV) cache, a standard method for retaining previous computations, makes LLM inference highly bounded by memory. While batching strategies can enhance performance, they frequently lead to significant memory fragmentation. Even though cutting-edge systems like vLLM mitigate KV cache fragmentation using paged Attention mechanisms, they still suffer from inefficient memory and computational operations due to the tightly coupled page management and computation kernels.   This study introduces the vTensor, an innovative tensor structure for LLM inference based on GPU virtual memory management (VMM). vTensor addresses existing limitations by decoupling computation from memory defragmentation and offering dynamic extensibility. Our framework employs a CPU-GPU heterogeneous approach, ensuring efficient, fragmentation-free memory management while accommodating various computation kernels across different LLM architectures. Experimental results indicate that vTensor achieves an average speedup of 1.86x across different models, with up to 2.42x in multi-turn chat scenarios. Additionally, vTensor provides average speedups of 2.12x and 3.15x in kernel evaluation, reaching up to 3.92x and 3.27x compared to SGLang Triton prefix-prefilling kernels and vLLM paged Attention kernel, respectively. Furthermore, it frees approximately 71.25% (57GB) of memory on the NVIDIA A100 GPU compared to vLLM, enabling more memory-intensive workloads.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LSM-based key-value (KV) stores are an important component in modern data infrastructures. However, they suffer from high tail latency, in the order of several seconds, making them less attractive for user-facing applications. In this paper, we introduce the notion of compaction chains and we analyse how they affect tail latency. Then, we show that modern designs reduce tail latency, by trading I/O amplification or require large amounts of memory. Based on our analysis, we present vLSM, a new KV store design that improves tail latency significantly without compromising on memory or I/O amplification. vLSM reduces (a) compaction chain width by using small SSTs and eliminating the tiering compaction required in L0 by modern systems and (b) compaction chain length by using a larger than typical growth factor between L1 and L2 and introducing overlap-aware SSTs in L1. We implement vLSM in RocksDB and evaluate it using db_bench and YCSB. Our evaluation highlights the underlying trade-off among memory requirements, I/O amplification, and tail latency, as well as the advantage of vLSM over current approaches. vLSM improves P99 tail latency by up to 4.8x for writes and by up to 12.5x for reads, reduces cumulative write stalls by up to 60% while also slightly improves I/O amplification at the same memory budget.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The coalgebraic $\mu$-calculus provides a generic semantic framework for fixpoint logics over systems whose branching type goes beyond the standard relational setup, e.g. probabilistic, weighted, or game-based. Previous work on the coalgebraic $\mu$-calculus includes an exponential-time upper bound on satisfiability checking, which however relies on the availability of tableau rules for the next-step modalities that are sufficiently well-behaved in a formally defined sense; in particular, rule matches need to be representable by polynomial-sized codes, and the sequent duals of the rules need to absorb cut. While such rule sets have been identified for some important cases, they are not known to exist in all cases of interest, in particular ones involving either integer weights as in the graded $\mu$-calculus, or real-valued weights in combination with non-linear arithmetic. In the present work, we prove the same upper complexity bound under more general assumptions, specifically regarding the complexity of the (much simpler) satisfiability problem for the underlying one-step logic, roughly described as the nesting-free next-step fragment of the logic. The bound is realized by a generic global caching algorithm that supports on-the-fly satisfiability checking. Notably, our approach directly accommodates unguarded formulae, and thus avoids use of the guardedness transformation. Example applications include new exponential-time upper bounds for satisfiability checking in an extension of the graded $\mu$-calculus with polynomial inequalities (including positive Presburger arithmetic), as well as an extension of the (two-valued) probabilistic $\mu$-calculus with polynomial inequalities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Bicameral Cache is a cache organization proposal for a vector architecture that segregates data according to their access type, distinguishing scalar from vector references. Its aim is to avoid both types of references from interfering in each other's data locality, with a special focus on prioritizing the performance on vector references. The proposed system incorporates an additional, non-polluting prefetching mechanism to help populate the long vector cache lines in advance to increase the hit rate by further exploiting the spatial locality on vector data. Its evaluation was conducted on the Cavatools simulator, comparing the performance to a standard conventional cache, over different typical vector benchmarks for several vector lengths. The results proved the proposed cache speeds up performance on stride-1 vector benchmarks, while hardly impacting non-stride-1's. In addition, the prefetching feature consistently provided an additional value.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based large language models have achieved remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks. However, they often struggle with seemingly easy tasks like arithmetic despite their vast capabilities. This stark disparity raise human's concerns about their safe and ethical use, hinder their widespread adoption.In this paper, we focus on a typical arithmetic task, integer multiplication, to explore and explain the imperfection of transformers in this domain. We provide comprehensive analysis of a vanilla transformer trained to perform n-digit integer multiplication. Our observations indicate that the model decomposes multiplication task into multiple parallel subtasks, sequentially optimizing each subtask for each digit to complete the final multiplication. Based on observation and analysis, we infer the reasons of transformers deficiencies in multiplication tasks lies in their difficulty in calculating successive carryovers and caching intermediate results, and confirmed this inference through experiments. Guided by these findings, we propose improvements to enhance transformers performance on multiplication tasks. These enhancements are validated through rigorous testing and mathematical modeling, not only enhance transformer's interpretability, but also improve its performance, e.g., we achieve over 99.9% accuracy on 5-digit integer multiplication with a tiny transformer, outperform LLMs GPT-4. Our method contributes to the broader fields of model understanding and interpretability, paving the way for analyzing more complex tasks and Transformer models. This work underscores the importance of explainable AI, helping to build trust in large language models and promoting their adoption in critical applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The memory and computational demands of Key-Value (KV) cache present significant challenges for deploying long-context language models. Previous approaches attempt to mitigate this issue by selectively dropping tokens, which irreversibly erases critical information that might be needed for future queries. In this paper, we propose a novel compression technique for KV cache that preserves all token information. Our investigation reveals that: i) Most attention heads primarily focus on the local context; ii) Only a few heads, denoted as retrieval heads, can essentially pay attention to all input tokens. These key observations motivate us to use separate caching strategy for attention heads. Therefore, we propose RazorAttention, a training-free KV cache compression algorithm, which maintains a full cache for these crucial retrieval heads and discards the remote tokens in non-retrieval heads. Furthermore, we introduce a novel mechanism involving a "compensation token" to further recover the information in the dropped tokens. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of large language models (LLMs) demonstrate that RazorAttention achieves a reduction in KV cache size by over 70% without noticeable impacts on performance. Additionally, RazorAttention is compatible with FlashAttention, rendering it an efficient and plug-and-play solution that enhances LLM inference efficiency without overhead or retraining of the original model.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used today in recommendation systems, fraud detection, and node/link classification tasks. Real world GNNs continue to scale in size and require a large memory footprint for storing graphs and embeddings that often exceed the memory capacities of the target GPUs used for training. To address limited memory capacities, traditional GNN training approaches use graph partitioning and sharding techniques to scale up across multiple GPUs within a node and/or scale out across multiple nodes. However, this approach suffers from the high computational costs of graph partitioning algorithms and inefficient communication across GPUs.   To address these overheads, we propose Large-scale Storage-based Multi-GPU GNN framework (LSM-GNN), a storagebased approach to train GNN models that utilizes a novel communication layer enabling GPU software caches to function as a system-wide shared cache with low overheads.LSM-GNN incorporates a hybrid eviction policy that intelligently manages cache space by using both static and dynamic node information to significantly enhance cache performance. Furthermore, we introduce the Preemptive Victim-buffer Prefetcher (PVP), a mechanism for prefetching node feature data from a Victim Buffer located in CPU pinned-memory to further reduce the pressure on the storage devices. Experimental results show that despite the lower compute capabilities and memory capacities, LSM-GNN in a single node with two GPUs offers superior performance over two-node-four-GPU Dist-DGL baseline and provides up to 3.75x speed up on end-to-end epoch time while running large-scale GNN training

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The maximum supported context length is a critical bottleneck limiting the practical application of the Large Language Model (LLM). Although existing length extrapolation methods can extend the context of LLMs to millions of tokens, these methods all have an explicit upper bound. In this work, we propose LongCache, a training-free approach that enables LLM to support an infinite context with finite context scope, through full-context cache selection and training-free integration. This effectively frees LLMs from the length extrapolation issue. We validate LongCache on the LongBench and L-Eval and demonstrate its performance is on par with traditional full-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, we have applied LongCache on mainstream LLMs, including LLaMA3 and Mistral-v0.3, enabling them to support context lengths of at least 400K in Needle-In-A-Haystack tests. We will improve the efficiency of LongCache by GPU-aware optimization soon.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models have excelled in various fields but encounter efficiency limitations due to the substantial Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-sequence inference. Recent efforts try to evict non-critical cache elements during runtime, thereby reducing cache size within given memory budgets while preserving generation quality. Our reexamination of foundational principles reveals that prevailing methods aim to minimize an upper bound of eviction loss, quantified as the L1 distance between the pre- and post-eviction outputs of multi-head self-attention mechanisms. Moreover, our analysis indicates that the common practices of uniformly assigning budgets across different attention heads during cache eviction hinder their budget utilization, negatively impacting generation quality. In light of these findings, we propose a simple yet effective adaptive budget allocation algorithm. This algorithm not only optimizes the loss upper bound in theory but also reduces the eviction loss in practice by aligning with the intrinsic patterns of self-attention mechanisms. Integrating this algorithm into two advanced methods, we develop Ada-SnapKV and Ada-Pyramid. Extensive evaluations on 16 datasets and the Needle-in-a-Haystack test confirm that they both significantly boost performance across various tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Split learning (SL) aims to protect user data privacy by distributing deep models between client-server and keeping private data locally. In SL training with multiple clients, the local model weights are shared among the clients for local model update. This paper first reveals data privacy leakage exacerbated from local weight sharing among the clients in SL through model inversion attacks. Then, to reduce the data privacy leakage issue, we propose and analyze privacy-enhanced SL (P-SL) (or SL without local weight sharing). We further propose parallelized P-SL to expedite the training process by duplicating multiple server-side model instances without compromising accuracy. Finally, we explore P-SL with late participating clients and devise a server-side cache-based training method to address the forgetting phenomenon in SL when late clients join. Experimental results demonstrate that P-SL helps reduce up to 50% of client-side data leakage, which essentially achieves a better privacy-accuracy trade-off than the current trend by using differential privacy mechanisms. Moreover, P-SL and its cache-based version achieve comparable accuracy to baseline SL under various data distributions, while cost less computation and communication. Additionally, caching-based training in P-SL mitigates the negative effect of forgetting, stabilizes the learning, and enables practical and low-complexity training in a dynamic environment with late-arriving clients.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> How to efficiently serve Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a pressing issue because of their huge computational cost in their autoregressive generation process. To mitigate computational costs, LLMs often employ the KV Cache technique to improve the generation speed. While improving the computational efficiency, the storage requirements of the KV cache are substantial, particularly in long-context scenarios, leading to significant memory consumption. Existing KV cache eviction methods often degrade the performance of LLMs in long-context scenarios due to the information loss introduced by eviction. In this paper, we propose a novel KV cache merging approach, called KVMerger, to achieve adaptive KV cache compression for long-context tasks without significant performance degradation under constrained memory budgets. Our approach is inspired by the intriguing observation that key states exhibit high similarity at the token level within a single sequence. To facilitate merging, we develop an effective yet straightforward merging set identification algorithm to identify suitable KV states for merging. Our merging set identification algorithm stimulates the second observation that KV cache sparsity, from similarity perspective, is independent of the dataset and remains persistent at the model level. Subsequently, we propose a Gaussian kernel weighted merging algorithm to selectively merge all states within each merging set. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of KVMerger for long-context tasks under constrained memory budgets, applying it to models including Llama2-7B-chat and Llama2-13B-chat. Using the LongBench and ZeroScroll benchmarks, we compare our method with other KV cache compression techniques, including H2O and CaM, showing that our method achieves superior performance across tasks with both 50% and 35% KV cache budgets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful tool for compressing large-scale volume data. This opens up new possibilities for in situ visualization. However, the efficient application of INRs to distributed data remains an underexplored area. In this work, we develop a distributed volumetric neural representation and optimize it for in situ visualization. Our technique eliminates data exchanges between processes, achieving state-of-the-art compression speed, quality and ratios. Our technique also enables the implementation of an efficient strategy for caching large-scale simulation data in high temporal frequencies, further facilitating the use of reactive in situ visualization in a wider range of scientific problems. We integrate this system with the Ascent infrastructure and evaluate its performance and usability using real-world simulations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models (LLMs) take on complex tasks, their inputs are supplemented with longer contexts that incorporate domain knowledge. Yet using long contexts is challenging, as nothing can be generated until the whole context is processed by the LLM. While the context-processing delay can be reduced by reusing the KV cache of a context across different inputs, fetching the KV cache, which contains large tensors, over the network can cause high extra network delays.   CacheGen is a fast context-loading module for LLM systems. First, CacheGen uses a custom tensor encoder, leveraging KV cache's distributional properties to encode a KV cache into more compact bitstream representations with negligible decoding overhead, to save bandwidth usage. Second, CacheGen adapts the compression level of different parts of a KV cache to cope with changes in available bandwidth, in order to maintain low context-loading delay and high generation quality. % When available bandwidth drops, CacheGen may raise the compression level for a part of the context or recompute its KV cache on the fly. We test CacheGen on popular LLMs and datasets. Compared to the recent systems that reuse the KV cache, CacheGen reduces the KV cache size by 3.5-4.3x and the total delay in fetching and processing contexts by 3.2-3.7x with negligible impact on the LLM response quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurately retrieving relevant bid keywords for user queries is critical in Sponsored Search but remains challenging, particularly for short, ambiguous queries. Existing dense and generative retrieval models often fail to capture nuanced user intent in these cases. To address this, we propose an approach to enhance query understanding by augmenting queries with rich contextual signals derived from web search results and large language models, stored in an online cache. Specifically, we use web search titles and snippets to ground queries in real-world information and utilize GPT-4 to generate query rewrites and explanations that clarify user intent. These signals are efficiently integrated through a Fusion-in-Decoder based Unity architecture, enabling both dense and generative retrieval with serving costs on par with traditional context-free models. To address scenarios where context is unavailable in the cache, we introduce context glancing, a curriculum learning strategy that improves model robustness and performance even without contextual signals during inference. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that our context-aware approach substantially outperforms context-free models. Furthermore, online A/B testing on a prominent search engine across 160+ countries shows significant improvements in user engagement and revenue.

The need for many applications to support long input sequences and process them in large batches typically causes token-generation to be bottlenecked by data transfer. For this reason, we introduce SparQ Attention, a technique for increasing the inference throughput of LLMs by utilising memory bandwidth more efficiently within the attention layers, through selective fetching of the cached history. Our proposed technique can be applied directly to off-the-shelf LLMs during inference, without requiring any modification to the pre-training setup or additional fine-tuning. We show that SparQ Attention brings up to 8x savings in attention data transfers without substantial drops in accuracy, by evaluating Llama 2 and 3, Mistral, Gemma and Pythia models on a wide range of downstream tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The inference of transformer-based large language models consists of two sequential stages: 1) a prefilling stage to compute the KV cache of prompts and generate the first token, and 2) a decoding stage to generate subsequent tokens. For long prompts, the KV cache must be computed for all tokens during the prefilling stage, which can significantly increase the time needed to generate the first token. Consequently, the prefilling stage may become a bottleneck in the generation process. An open question remains whether all prompt tokens are essential for generating the first token. To answer this, we introduce a novel method, LazyLLM, that selectively computes the KV for tokens important for the next token prediction in both the prefilling and decoding stages. Contrary to static pruning approaches that prune the prompt at once, LazyLLM allows language models to dynamically select different subsets of tokens from the context in different generation steps, even though they might be pruned in previous steps. Extensive experiments on standard datasets across various tasks demonstrate that LazyLLM is a generic method that can be seamlessly integrated with existing language models to significantly accelerate the generation without fine-tuning. For instance, in the multi-document question-answering task, LazyLLM accelerates the prefilling stage of the LLama 2 7B model by 2.34x while maintaining accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep learning kernels exhibit predictable memory accesses and compute patterns, making GPUs' parallel architecture well-suited for their execution. Software and runtime systems for GPUs are optimized to better utilize the stream multiprocessors, on-chip cache, and off-chip high-bandwidth memory. As deep learning models and GPUs evolve, access to newer GPUs is often limited, raising questions about the performance of new model architectures on existing GPUs, existing models on new GPUs, and new model architectures on new GPUs. To address these questions, we introduce NeuSight, a framework to predict the performance of various deep learning models, for both training and inference, on unseen GPUs without requiring actual execution. The framework leverages both GPU hardware behavior and software library optimizations to estimate end-to-end performance. Previous work uses regression models that capture linear trends or multilayer perceptrons to predict the overall latency of deep learning kernels on GPUs. These approaches suffer from higher error percentages when forecasting performance on unseen models and new GPUs. Instead, NeuSight decomposes the prediction problem into smaller problems, bounding the prediction through fundamental performance laws. NeuSight decomposes a single deep learning kernel prediction into smaller working sets called tiles, which are executed independently on the GPU. Tile-granularity predictions are determined using a machine learning approach and aggregated to estimate end-to-end latency. NeuSight outperforms prior work across various deep learning workloads and the latest GPUs. It reduces the percentage error from 198% and 19.7% to 3.8% in predicting the latency of GPT3 model for training and inference on H100, compared to state-of-the-art prior works, where both GPT3 and H100 were not used to train the framework.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Serving LLMs requires substantial memory due to the storage requirements of Key-Value (KV) embeddings in the KV cache, which grows with sequence length. An effective approach to compress KV cache is quantization. However, traditional quantization methods face significant memory overhead due to the need to store quantization constants (at least a zero point and a scale) in full precision per data block. Depending on the block size, this overhead can add 1 or 2 bits per quantized number. We introduce QJL, a new quantization approach that consists of a Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) transform followed by sign-bit quantization. In contrast to existing methods, QJL eliminates memory overheads by removing the need for storing quantization constants. We propose an asymmetric estimator for the inner product of two vectors and demonstrate that applying QJL to one vector and a standard JL transform without quantization to the other provides an unbiased estimator with minimal distortion. We have developed an efficient implementation of the QJL sketch and its corresponding inner product estimator, incorporating a lightweight CUDA kernel for optimized computation. When applied across various LLMs and NLP tasks to quantize the KV cache to only 3 bits, QJL demonstrates a more than fivefold reduction in KV cache memory usage without compromising accuracy, all while achieving faster runtime.

However, contradicting common intuitions, recent activities demonstrate that this threat is real even in microcontroller SoCs without such features. In this paper, we describe SoC-wide timing side channels previously neglected by security analysis and present a new formal method to close this gap. In a case study on the RISC-V Pulpissimo SoC, our method detected a vulnerability to a previously unknown attack variant that allows an attacker to obtain information about a victim's memory access behavior. After implementing a conservative fix, we were able to verify that the SoC is now secure w.r.t. the considered class of timing side channels.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> An efficient data structure is fundamental to meeting the growing demands in dynamic graph processing. However, the dual requirements for graph computation efficiency (with contiguous structures) and graph update efficiency (with linked list-like structures) present a conflict in the design principles of graph structures. After experimental studies of existing state-of-the-art dynamic graph structures, we observe that the overhead of cache misses accounts for a major portion of the graph computation time. This paper presents GastCoCo, a system with graph storage and coroutine-based prefetch co-design. By employing software prefetching via stackless coroutines and introducing a prefetch-friendly data structure CBList, GastCoCo significantly alleviates the performance degradation caused by cache misses. Our results show that GastCoCo outperforms state-of-the-art graph storage systems by 1.3x - 180x in graph updates and 1.4x - 41.1x in graph computation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We explore the role of attention mechanism during inference in text-conditional diffusion models. Empirical observations suggest that cross-attention outputs converge to a fixed point after several inference steps. The convergence time naturally divides the entire inference process into two phases: an initial phase for planning text-oriented visual semantics, which are then translated into images in a subsequent fidelity-improving phase. Cross-attention is essential in the initial phase but almost irrelevant thereafter. However, self-attention initially plays a minor role but becomes crucial in the second phase. These findings yield a simple and training-free method known as temporally gating the attention (TGATE), which efficiently generates images by caching and reusing attention outputs at scheduled time steps. Experimental results show when widely applied to various existing text-conditional diffusion models, TGATE accelerates these models by 10%-50%. The code of TGATE is available at https://github.com/HaozheLiu-ST/T-GATE.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated Learning (FL) as a promising distributed machine learning paradigm has been widely adopted in Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) applications. However, the efficiency and inference capability of FL is seriously limited due to the presence of stragglers and data imbalance across massive AIoT devices, respectively. To address the above challenges, we present a novel asynchronous FL approach named CaBaFL, which includes a hierarchical Cache-based aggregation mechanism and a feature Balance-guided device selection strategy. CaBaFL maintains multiple intermediate models simultaneously for local training. The hierarchical cache-based aggregation mechanism enables each intermediate model to be trained on multiple devices to align the training time and mitigate the straggler issue. In specific, each intermediate model is stored in a low-level cache for local training and when it is trained by sufficient local devices, it will be stored in a high-level cache for aggregation. To address the problem of imbalanced data, the feature balance-guided device selection strategy in CaBaFL adopts the activation distribution as a metric, which enables each intermediate model to be trained across devices with totally balanced data distributions before aggregation. Experimental results show that compared with the state-of-the-art FL methods, CaBaFL achieves up to 9.26X training acceleration and 19.71\% accuracy improvements.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While Compute Express Link (CXL) enables support for cache-coherent shared memory among multiple nodes, it also introduces new types of failures--processes can fail before data does, or data might fail before a process does. The lack of a failure model for CXL-based shared memory makes it challenging to understand and mitigate these failures.   To solve these challenges, in this paper, we describe a model categorizing and handling the CXL-based shared memory's failures: data and process failures. Data failures in CXL-based shared memory render data inaccessible or inconsistent for a currently running application. We argue that such failures are unlike data failures in distributed storage systems and require CXL-specific handling. To address this, we look into traditional data failure mitigation techniques like erasure coding and replication and propose new solutions to better handle data failures in CXL-based shared memory systems. Next, we look into process failures and compare the failures and potential solutions with PMEM's failure model and programming solutions. We argue that although PMEM shares some of CXL's characteristics, it does not fully address CXL's volatile nature and low access latencies. Finally, taking inspiration from PMEM programming solutions, we propose techniques to handle these new failures.   Thus, this paper is the first work to define the CXL-based shared memory failure model and propose tailored solutions that address challenges specific to CXL-based systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce GoldFinch, a hybrid Linear Attention/Transformer sequence model that uses a new technique to efficiently generate a highly compressed and reusable KV-Cache in linear time and space with respect to sequence length. GoldFinch stacks our new GOLD transformer on top of an enhanced version of the Finch (RWKV-6) architecture. We train up to 1.5B parameter class models of the Finch, Llama, and GoldFinch architectures, and find dramatically improved modeling performance relative to both Finch and Llama. Our cache size savings increase linearly with model layer count, ranging from 756-2550 times smaller than the traditional transformer cache for common sizes, enabling inference of extremely large context lengths even on limited hardware. Although autoregressive generation has O(n) time complexity per token because of attention, pre-fill computation of the entire initial cache state for a submitted context costs only O(1) time per token due to the use of a recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate this cache. We release our trained weights and training code under the Apache 2.0 license for community use.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accessing the low-energy non-equilibrium dynamics of materials and their polaritons with simultaneous high spatial and temporal resolution has been a bold frontier of electron microscopy in recent years. One of the main challenges lies in the ability to retrieve extremely weak signals while simultaneously disentangling amplitude and phase information. Here, we present Free-Electron Ramsey Imaging (FERI), a microscopy approach based on light-induced electron modulation that enables coherent amplification of optical near-fields in electron imaging. We provide simultaneous time-, space-, and phase-resolved measurements of a micro-drum made from a hexagonal boron nitride membrane visualizing the sub-cycle dynamics of 2D polariton wavepackets therein. The phase-resolved measurements reveals vortex-anti-vortex singularities on the polariton wavefronts, together with an intriguing phenomenon of a traveling wave mimicking the amplitude profile of a standing wave. Our experiments show a 20-fold coherent amplification of the near-field signal compared to conventional electron near-field imaging, resolving peak field intensities in the order of ~W/cm2, corresponding to field amplitudes of a few kV/m. As a result, our work paves the way for spatio-temporal electron microscopy of biological specimens and quantum materials, exciting yet delicate samples that are currently difficult to investigate.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid growth of the automotive industry has exacerbated the conflict between the complex traffic environment, increasing communication demands, and limited resources. Given the imperative to mitigate traffic and network congestion, analyzing the performance of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) mesh networks is of great practical significance. Most studies focus solely on individual performance metrics and influencing factors, and the adopted simulation tools, such as OPNET, cannot achieve the dynamic link generation of IoV mesh networks. To address these problems, a network performance analysis model based on actual switches is proposed. First, a typical IoV mesh network architecture is constructed and abstracted into a mathematical model that describes how the link and topology changes over time. Then, the task generation model and the task forwarding model based on actual switches are proposed to obtain the real traffic distribution of the network. Finally, a scientific network performance indicator system is constructed. Simulation results demonstrate that, with rising task traffic and decreasing node caching capacity, the packet loss rate increases, and the task arrival rate decreases in the network. The proposed model can effectively evaluate the network performance across various traffic states and provide valuable insights for network construction and enhancement.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Integrating epitaxial BaTiO$_3$ (BTO) with Si is essential for leveraging its ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and nonlinear optical properties in microelectronics. Recently, heterogeneous integration approaches that involve growth of BTO on ideal substrates followed by transfer to a desired substrate show promise of achieving excellent device-quality films. However, beyond simple demonstrations of the existence of ferroelectricity, robust devices with high endurance were not yet demonstrated on Si using the latter approach. Here, using a novel two-step approach to synthesize epitaxial BTO using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on water soluble Sr3Al2O7 (SAO) (on SrTiO$_3$ (STO) substrates), we demonstrate successful integration of high-quality BTO capacitors on Si, with Pr of 7 uC/cm2, Ec 150 kV/cm, ferroelectric and electromechanical endurance of greater than $10^6$ cycles. We further address the challenge of cracking and disintegration of thicker films by first transferring a large area (5 mm x 5 mm) of the templated layer of BTO (~30 nm thick) on the desired substrate, followed by the growth of high-quality BTO on this substrate, as revealed by HRXRD and HRSTEM measurements. These templated Si substrates offer a versatile platform for integrating any epitaxial complex oxides with diverse functionalities onto any inorganic substrate.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Llama have revolutionized natural language processing and search engine dynamics. However, these models incur exceptionally high computational costs. For instance, GPT-3 consists of 175 billion parameters, where inference demands billions of floating-point operations. Caching is a natural solution to reduce LLM inference costs on repeated queries, which constitute about 31% of the total queries. However, existing caching methods are incapable of finding semantic similarities among LLM queries nor do they operate on contextual queries, leading to unacceptable false hit-and-miss rates. This paper introduces MeanCache, a user-centric semantic cache for LLM-based services that identifies semantically similar queries to determine cache hit or miss. Using MeanCache, the response to a user's semantically similar query can be retrieved from a local cache rather than re-querying the LLM, thus reducing costs, service provider load, and environmental impact. MeanCache leverages Federated Learning (FL) to collaboratively train a query similarity model without violating user privacy. By placing a local cache in each user's device and using FL, MeanCache reduces the latency and costs and enhances model performance, resulting in lower false hit rates. MeanCache also encodes context chains for every cached query, offering a simple yet highly effective mechanism to discern contextual query responses from standalone. Our experiments benchmarked against the state-of-the-art caching method, reveal that MeanCache attains an approximately 17% higher F-score and a 20% increase in precision during semantic cache hit-and-miss decisions while performing even better on contextual queries. It also reduces the storage requirement by 83% and accelerates semantic cache hit-and-miss decisions by 11%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sparse tensor decomposition and completion are common in numerous applications, ranging from machine learning to computational quantum chemistry. Typically, the main bottleneck in optimization of these models are contractions of a single large sparse tensor with a network of several dense matrices or tensors (SpTTN). Prior works on high-performance tensor decomposition and completion have focused on performance and scalability optimizations for specific SpTTN kernels. We present algorithms and a runtime system for identifying and executing the most efficient loop nest for any SpTTN kernel. We consider both enumeration of such loop nests for autotuning and efficient algorithms for finding the lowest cost loop-nest for simpler metrics, such as buffer size or cache miss models. Our runtime system identifies the best choice of loop nest without user guidance, and also provides a distributed-memory parallelization of SpTTN kernels. We evaluate our framework using both real-world and synthetic tensors. Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms available generalized state-of-the-art libraries and matches the performance of specialized codes.

However, the utilization of deep neural networks brings heavy time and computational complexity, and high demands of high-performance hardware, which is challenging to apply to the general uses of coding scene. To address this limitation, inspired by explorations in image restoration, we propose an efficient and practical in-loop filtering scheme by adopting the Look-up Table (LUT). We train the DNN of in-loop filtering within a fixed filtering reference range, and cache the output values of the DNN into a LUT via traversing all possible inputs. At testing time in the coding process, the filtered pixel is generated by locating input pixels (to-be-filtered pixel with reference pixels) and interpolating cached filtered pixel values. To further enable the large filtering reference range with the limited storage cost of LUT, we introduce the enhanced indexing mechanism in the filtering process, and clipping/finetuning mechanism in the training. The proposed method is implemented into the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) reference software, VTM-11.0. Experimental results show that the ultrafast, very fast, and fast mode of the proposed method achieves on average 0.13%/0.34%/0.51%, and 0.10%/0.27%/0.39% BD-rate reduction, under the all intra (AI) and random access (RA) configurations. Especially, our method has friendly time and computational complexity, only 101%/102%-104%/108% time increase with 0.13-0.93 kMACs/pixel, and only 164-1148 KB storage cost for a single model. Our solution may shed light on the journey of practical neural network-based coding tool evolution.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficient cloud computing relies on in-process isolation to optimize performance by running workloads within a single process. Without heavy-weight process isolation, memory safety errors pose a significant security threat by allowing an adversary to extract or corrupt the private data of other co-located tenants. Existing in-process isolation mechanisms are not suitable for modern cloud requirements, e.g., MPK's 16 protection domains are insufficient to isolate thousands of cloud workers per process. Consequently, cloud service providers have a strong need for lightweight in-process isolation on commodity x86 machines.   This paper presents TME-Box, a novel isolation technique that enables fine-grained and scalable sandboxing on commodity x86 CPUs. By repurposing Intel TME-MK, which is intended for the encryption of virtual machines, TME-Box offers lightweight and efficient in-process isolation. TME-Box enforces that sandboxes use their designated encryption keys for memory interactions through compiler instrumentation. This cryptographic isolation enables fine-grained access control, from single cache lines to full pages, and supports flexible data relocation. In addition, the design of TME-Box allows the efficient isolation of up to 32K concurrent sandboxes. We present a performance-optimized TME-Box prototype, utilizing x86 segment-based addressing, that showcases geomean performance overheads of 5.2 % for data isolation and 9.7 % for code and data isolation, evaluated with the SPEC CPU2017 benchmark suite.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we propose Conceptual Codebook Learning (CoCoLe), a novel fine-tuning method for vision-language models (VLMs) to address the challenge of improving the generalization capability of VLMs while fine-tuning them on downstream tasks in a few-shot setting. We recognize that visual concepts, such as textures, shapes, and colors are naturally transferable across domains and play a crucial role in generalization tasks. Motivated by this interesting finding, we learn a conceptual codebook consisting of visual concepts as keys and conceptual prompts as values, which serves as a link between the image encoder's outputs and the text encoder's inputs. Specifically, for a given image, we leverage the codebook to identify the most relevant conceptual prompts associated with the class embeddings to perform the classification. Additionally, we incorporate a handcrafted concept cache as a regularization to alleviate the overfitting issues in low-shot scenarios. We observe that this conceptual codebook learning method is able to achieve enhanced alignment between visual and linguistic modalities. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our CoCoLe method remarkably outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods across various evaluation settings, including base-to-new generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization tasks. Detailed ablation studies further confirm the efficacy of each component in CoCoLe.

The average on-resistance was ~75 ohm. mm (~21 miliohm. cm^2) for LGD = 20 microns. Breakdown voltage reached >3 kV (tool limit) before passivation however it reduced to ~2 kV after SiN surface passivation and field plates. The apparent high breakdown voltage prior to passivation can possibly be attributed to the field plate effect of the charged trap states of the surface. The breakdown voltage and RON demonstrated a strong linear correlation in a scattered plot with ~50 measured transistors. In pulsed IV measurements with 100 microsecond pulse width and 40 V of off-state bias (tool limit), the dynamic RON increased by ~5% compared to DC RON and current collapse was <10%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this research, the effect of utilizing a micro plasma actuator on controlling the flow through a two-dimensional cylinder is investigated using an advanced electrostatic model. Within this model, by solving two elliptic equations, the potential distribution and plasma distribution in the solution domain are determined, leading to the generation of a volumetric force. This force is added to the momentum equations as a source term. The Reynolds number of the flow is set at 20,000, and the plasma actuator operates in a steady manner. Due to the high Reynolds number, the flow is turbulent, and its time-dependent nature is modeled as unsteady. Plasma actuators are symmetrically mounted at 45 and 90 degrees with respect to the free stream, both above and below the cylinder surfaces. The influence of the actuator placement angle on the flow quality downstream of the cylinder is examined. The results indicate an enhancement of flow quality by 8% to 15% downstream of the cylinder. Moreover, improvements of 40% to 55% in the variation of the lift coefficient and 75% to 90% in the drag coefficient are reported. The findings reveal superior performance of the actuator positioned at 90 degrees compared to the 45-degree orientation. This can be attributed to the proximity of the 90-degree actuator position to the point of boundary layer separation initiation. Furthermore, using the actuator positioned at 90 degrees and applying three different voltages of 10, 13, and 16 kV, the impact of flow control on the first cylinder in a tandem arrangement on the downstream flow of the second cylinder is examined. The results demonstrate an enhancement in downstream flow quality of 20% to 26%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The efficiency of large language models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, particularly in contexts where computational resources are limited. Traditional attention mechanisms in these models, while powerful, require significant computational and memory resources due to the necessity of recalculating and storing attention weights across different layers. This paper introduces a novel Shared Attention (SA) mechanism, designed to enhance the efficiency of LLMs by directly sharing computed attention weights across multiple layers. Unlike previous methods that focus on sharing intermediate Key-Value (KV) caches, our approach utilizes the isotropic tendencies of attention distributions observed in advanced LLMs post-pretraining to reduce both the computational flops and the size of the KV cache required during inference. We empirically demonstrate that implementing SA across various LLMs results in minimal accuracy loss on standard benchmarks. Our findings suggest that SA not only conserves computational resources but also maintains robust model performance, thereby facilitating the deployment of more efficient LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficient management of GPU memory is essential for high throughput LLM inference. Prior systems used to reserve KV-cache memory ahead-of-time that resulted in wasted capacity due to internal fragmentation. Inspired by demand paging, vLLM proposed PagedAttention to enable dynamic memory allocation for KV-cache. This approach eliminates fragmentation and improves serving throughout. However, to be able to allocate physical memory dynamically, PagedAttention changes the layout of KV-cache from contiguous virtual memory to non-contiguous virtual memory. As a consequence, one needs to rewrite the attention kernels to support paging, and implement a memory manager in the serving framework. This results in both performance and programming overheads, as well as portability challenges in adopting state-of-the-art attention kernels.   In this paper, we propose vAttention, a new approach for dynamic KV-cache memory management. In contrast to PagedAttention, vAttention stores KV-cache in contiguous virtual memory and leverages OS support for on-demand allocation of physical memory. vAttention thus enables one to use state-of-the art attention kernels out-of-the-box by adding support for dynamic allocation of physical memory without having to re-write their code. We implement vAttention in the vLLM serving stack to show that it also helps improve decode throughput by up to 1.99x over vLLM, and the end-to-end serving throughput by up to 1.22x and 1.29x, compared to using the state-of-the-art PagedAttention based kernels of FlashAttention and FlashInfer.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This study introduces bifurcated attention, a method designed to enhance language model inference in shared-context batch decoding scenarios. Our approach addresses the challenge of redundant memory IO costs, a critical factor contributing to latency in high batch sizes and extended context lengths. Bifurcated attention achieves this by strategically dividing the attention mechanism during incremental decoding into two separate GEMM operations: one focusing on the KV cache from prefill, and another on the decoding process itself. While maintaining the computational load (FLOPs) of standard attention mechanisms, bifurcated attention ensures precise computation with significantly reduced memory IO. Our empirical results show over 2.1$\times$ speedup when sampling 16 output sequences and more than 6.2$\times$ speedup when sampling 32 sequences at context lengths exceeding 8k tokens on a 7B model that uses multi-head attention. The efficiency gains from bifurcated attention translate into lower latency, making it particularly suitable for real-time applications. For instance, it enables massively parallel answer generation without substantially increasing latency, thus enhancing performance when integrated with post-processing techniques such as re-ranking.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models have shown remarkable efficacy in generating streaming data such as text and audio, thanks to their temporally uni-directional attention mechanism, which models correlations between the current token and previous tokens. However, video streaming remains much less explored, despite a growing need for live video processing. State-of-the-art video diffusion models leverage bi-directional temporal attention to model the correlations between the current frame and all the surrounding (i.e. including future) frames, which hinders them from processing streaming videos. To address this problem, we present Live2Diff, the first attempt at designing a video diffusion model with uni-directional temporal attention, specifically targeting live streaming video translation. Compared to previous works, our approach ensures temporal consistency and smoothness by correlating the current frame with its predecessors and a few initial warmup frames, without any future frames. Additionally, we use a highly efficient denoising scheme featuring a KV-cache mechanism and pipelining, to facilitate streaming video translation at interactive framerates. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attention mechanism and pipeline, outperforming previous methods in terms of temporal smoothness and/or efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Memory management across discrete CPU and GPU physical memory is traditionally achieved through explicit GPU allocations and data copy or unified virtual memory. The Grace Hopper Superchip, for the first time, supports an integrated CPU-GPU system page table, hardware-level addressing of system allocated memory, and cache-coherent NVLink-C2C interconnect, bringing an alternative solution for enabling a Unified Memory system. In this work, we provide the first in-depth study of the system memory management on the Grace Hopper Superchip, in both in-memory and memory oversubscription scenarios. We provide a suite of six representative applications, including the Qiskit quantum computing simulator, using system memory and managed memory. Using our memory utilization profiler and hardware counters, we quantify and characterize the impact of the integrated CPU-GPU system page table on GPU applications. Our study focuses on first-touch policy, page table entry initialization, page sizes, and page migration. We identify practical optimization strategies for different access patterns. Our results show that as a new solution for unified memory, the system-allocated memory can benefit most use cases with minimal porting efforts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In generating large quantities of DNA data, high-throughput sequencing technologies require advanced bioinformatics infrastructures for efficient data analysis. k-mer counting, the process of quantifying the frequency of fixed-length k DNA subsequences, is a fundamental step in various bioinformatics pipelines, including genome assembly and protein prediction. Due to the growing volume of data, the scaling of the counting process is critical. In the literature, distributed memory software uses hash tables, which exhibit poor cache friendliness and consume excessive memory. They often also lack support for flexible parallelism, which makes integration into existing bioinformatics pipelines difficult. In this work, we propose HySortK, a highly efficient sorting-based distributed memory k-mer counter. HySortK reduces the communication volume through a carefully designed communication scheme and domain-specific optimization strategies. Furthermore, we introduce an abstract task layer for flexible hybrid parallelism to address load imbalances in different scenarios. HySortK achieves a 2-10x speedup compared to the GPU baseline on 4 and 8 nodes. Compared to state-of-the-art CPU software, HySortK achieves up to 2x speedup while reducing peak memory usage by 30% on 16 nodes. Finally, we integrated HySortK into an existing genome assembly pipeline and achieved up to 1.8x speedup, proving its flexibility and practicality in real-world scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The coupling of weather, sea-ice, ocean, and wave forecasting systems has been a long-standing research focus to improve Arctic forecasting system and their realism and is also a priority of international initiatives such as the WMO research project PCAPS. The goal of the Svalbard Marginal Ice Zone 2024 Campaign was to observe and better understand the complex interplay between atmosphere, waves, and sea-ice in the winter Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) in order to advance the predictive skill of coupled Arctic forecasting systems. The main objective has been to set up a network of observations with a spatial distribution that allows for a representative comparison between in situ observations and gridded model data. The observed variables include air and surface temperature, sea-ice drift, and wave energy spectra. With the support of the Norwegian Coast Guard, we participated in the research cruise with KV Svalbard from 4. April - 21.April 2024. In total 34 buoys were deployed in the Marginal Ice Zone north of the Svalbard Archipelago. The first part of the report describes the instruments and their calibration (Section 2), and the second part briefly describes the weather, sea ice, and wave conditions during the campaign.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, finding applications across various domains. However, their reliance on massive internet-sourced datasets for training brings notable privacy issues, which are exacerbated in critical domains (e.g., healthcare). Moreover, certain application-specific scenarios may require fine-tuning these models on private data. This survey critically examines the privacy threats associated with LLMs, emphasizing the potential for these models to memorize and inadvertently reveal sensitive information. We explore current threats by reviewing privacy attacks on LLMs and propose comprehensive solutions for integrating privacy mechanisms throughout the entire learning pipeline. These solutions range from anonymizing training datasets to implementing differential privacy during training or inference and machine unlearning after training. Our comprehensive review of existing literature highlights ongoing challenges, available tools, and future directions for preserving privacy in LLMs. This work aims to guide the development of more secure and trustworthy AI systems by providing a thorough understanding of privacy preservation methods and their effectiveness in mitigating risks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The remarkable multimodal capabilities and interactive experience of GPT-4o underscore their necessity in practical applications, yet open-source models rarely excel in both areas. In this paper, we introduce VITA, the first-ever open-source Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adept at simultaneous processing and analysis of Video, Image, Text, and Audio modalities, and meanwhile has an advanced multimodal interactive experience. Starting from Mixtral 8x7B as a language foundation, we expand its Chinese vocabulary followed by bilingual instruction tuning. We further endow the language model with visual and audio capabilities through two-stage multi-task learning of multimodal alignment and instruction tuning. VITA demonstrates robust foundational capabilities of multilingual, vision, and audio understanding, as evidenced by its strong performance across a range of both unimodal and multimodal benchmarks. Beyond foundational capabilities, we have made considerable progress in enhancing the natural multimodal human-computer interaction experience. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to exploit non-awakening interaction and audio interrupt in MLLM. VITA is the first step for the open-source community to explore the seamless integration of multimodal understanding and interaction. While there is still lots of work to be done on VITA to get close to close-source counterparts, we hope that its role as a pioneer can serve as a cornerstone for subsequent research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance in solving exam-like math word problems. However, the degree to which these numerical reasoning skills are effective in real-world scenarios, particularly in expert domains, is still largely unexplored. This paper introduces DocMath-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the numerical reasoning capabilities of LLMs in the context of understanding and analyzing specialized documents containing both text and tables. We conduct an extensive evaluation of 48 LLMs with Chain-of-Thought and Program-of-Thought prompting methods, aiming to comprehensively assess the capabilities and limitations of existing LLMs in DocMath-Eval. We found that even the current best-performing system (i.e., GPT-4o) still significantly lags behind human experts in solving complex numerical reasoning problems grounded in long contexts. We believe that DocMath-Eval can serve as a valuable benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capabilities in solving challenging numerical reasoning problems within expert domains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs), including OpenAI's GPT-series, have made significant advancements in recent years. Known for their expertise across diverse subject areas and quick adaptability to user-provided prompts, LLMs hold unique potential as Personalized Learning (PL) tools. Despite this potential, their application in K-12 education remains largely unexplored. This paper presents one of the first randomized controlled trials (n = 23) to evaluate the effectiveness of GPT-4 in personalizing educational science texts for middle school students. In this study, GPT-4 was used to profile student learning preferences based on choices made during a training session. For the experimental group, GPT-4 was used to rewrite science texts to align with the student's predicted profile while, for students in the control group, texts were rewritten to contradict their learning preferences. The results of a Mann-Whitney U test showed that students significantly preferred (at the .10 level) the rewritten texts when they were aligned with their profile (p = .059). These findings suggest that GPT-4 can effectively interpret and tailor educational content to diverse learner preferences, marking a significant advancement in PL technology. The limitations of this study and ethical considerations for using artificial intelligence in education are also discussed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Language model continual learning (CL) has recently garnered significant interest due to its potential to adapt large language models (LLMs) to dynamic real-world environments without re-training. A key challenge in this field is catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired knowledge when learning new tasks. Existing methods commonly employ multiple parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) blocks to acquire task-specific knowledge for each task, but these approaches lack efficiency and overlook the potential for knowledge transfer through task interaction. In this paper, we present a novel CL framework for language models called Task Skill Localization and Consolidation (TaSL), which enhances knowledge transfer without relying on memory replay. TaSL first divides the model into `skill units' based on parameter dependencies, enabling more granular control. It then employs a novel group-wise skill localization technique to identify the importance distribution of skill units for a new task. By comparing this importance distribution with those from previous tasks, we implement a fine-grained skill consolidation strategy that retains task-specific knowledge, thereby preventing forgetting, and updates task-shared knowledge, which facilitates bi-directional knowledge transfer. As a result, TaSL achieves a superior balance between retaining previous knowledge and excelling in new tasks. TaSL also shows strong generalizability, suitable for general models and customizable for PEFT methods like LoRA. Additionally, it demonstrates notable extensibility, allowing integration with memory replay to further enhance performance. Extensive experiments on two CL benchmarks, with varying model sizes (from 220M to 7B), demonstrate the effectiveness of TaSL and its variants across different settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the recent development of generative models, Text-to-3D generations have also seen significant growth, opening a door for creating video-game 3D assets from a more general public. Nonetheless, people without any professional 3D editing experience would find it hard to achieve precise control over the 3D generation, especially if there are multiple objects in the prompt, as using text to control often leads to missing objects and imprecise locations. In this paper, we present LucidDreaming as an effective pipeline capable of spatial and numerical control over 3D generation from only textual prompt commands or 3D bounding boxes. Specifically, our research demonstrates that Large Language Models (LLMs) possess 3D spatial awareness and can effectively translate textual 3D information into precise 3D bounding boxes. We leverage LLMs to get individual object information and their 3D bounding boxes as the initial step of our process. Then with the bounding boxes, We further propose clipped ray sampling and object-centric density blob bias to generate 3D objects aligning with the bounding boxes. We show that our method exhibits remarkable adaptability across a spectrum of mainstream Score Distillation Sampling-based 3D generation frameworks and our pipeline can even used to insert objects into an existing NeRF scene. Moreover, we also provide a dataset of prompts with 3D bounding boxes, benchmarking 3D spatial controllability. With extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that LucidDreaming achieves superior results in object placement precision and generation fidelity compared to current approaches, while maintaining flexibility and ease of use for non-expert users.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Utilizing large language models (LLMs) to rank a set of items has become a common approach in recommendation and retrieval systems. Typically, these systems focus on ordering a substantial number of documents in a monotonic order based on a given query. However, real-world scenarios often present a different challenge: ranking a comparatively smaller set of items, but according to a variety of diverse and occasionally conflicting conditions. In this paper, we define and explore the task of multi-conditional ranking by introducing MCRank, a benchmark tailored for assessing multi-conditional ranking across various item types and conditions. Our analysis of LLMs using MCRank indicates a significant decrease in performance as the number and complexity of items and conditions grow. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel decomposed reasoning method, consisting of EXtracting and Sorting the conditions, and then Iteratively Ranking the items (EXSIR). Our extensive experiments show that this decomposed reasoning method enhances LLMs' performance significantly, achieving up to a 12% improvement over existing LLMs. We also provide a detailed analysis of LLMs performance across various condition categories, and examine the effectiveness of decomposition step. Furthermore, we compare our method with existing approaches such as Chain-of-Thought and existing ranking models, demonstrating the superiority of our approach and complexity of MCR task. We released our dataset and code.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper develops a general methodology to conduct statistical inference for observations indexed by multiple sets of entities. We propose a novel multiway empirical likelihood statistic that converges to a chi-square distribution under the non-degenerate case, where corresponding Hoeffding type decomposition is dominated by linear terms. Our methodology is related to the notion of jackknife empirical likelihood but the leave-out pseudo values are constructed by leaving columns or rows. We further develop a modified version of our multiway empirical likelihood statistic, which converges to a chi-square distribution regardless of the degeneracy, and discover its desirable higher-order property compared to the t-ratio by the conventional Eicker-White type variance estimator. The proposed methodology is illustrated by several important statistical problems, such as bipartite network, generalized estimating equations, and three-way observations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficient automatic segmentation of multi-level (i.e. main and branch) pulmonary arteries (PA) in CTPA images plays a significant role in clinical applications. However, most existing methods concentrate only on main PA or branch PA segmentation separately and ignore segmentation efficiency. Besides, there is no public large-scale dataset focused on PA segmentation, which makes it highly challenging to compare the different methods. To benchmark multi-level PA segmentation algorithms, we organized the first \textbf{P}ulmonary \textbf{AR}tery \textbf{SE}gmentation (PARSE) challenge. On the one hand, we focus on both the main PA and the branch PA segmentation. On the other hand, for better clinical application, we assign the same score weight to segmentation efficiency (mainly running time and GPU memory consumption during inference) while ensuring PA segmentation accuracy. We present a summary of the top algorithms and offer some suggestions for efficient and accurate multi-level PA automatic segmentation. We provide the PARSE challenge as open-access for the community to benchmark future algorithm developments at \url{https://parse2022.grand-challenge.org/Parse2022/}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Bayesian deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) outperform ordinary GPs as surrogate models of complex computer experiments when response surface dynamics are non-stationary, which is especially prevalent in aerospace simulations. Yet DGP surrogates have not been deployed for the canonical downstream task in that setting: reliability analysis through contour location (CL). In that context, we are motivated by a simulation of an RAE-2822 transonic airfoil which demarcates efficient and inefficient flight conditions. Level sets separating passable versus failable operating conditions are best learned through strategic sequential designs. There are two limitations to modern CL methodology which hinder DGP integration in this setting. First, derivative-based optimization underlying acquisition functions is thwarted by sampling-based Bayesian (i.e., MCMC) inference, which is essential for DGP posterior integration. Second, canonical acquisition criteria, such as entropy, are famously myopic to the extent that optimization may even be undesirable. Here we tackle both of these limitations at once, proposing a hybrid criterion that explores along the Pareto front of entropy and (predictive) uncertainty, requiring evaluation only at strategically located "triangulation" candidates. We showcase DGP CL performance in several synthetic benchmark exercises and on the RAE-2822 airfoil.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Thermal point clouds integrate thermal radiation and laser point clouds effectively. However, the semantic information for the interpretation of building thermal point clouds can hardly be precisely inferred. Transferring the semantics encapsulated in 3D building models at LoD3 has a potential to fill this gap. In this work, we propose a workflow enriching thermal point clouds with the geo-position and semantics of LoD3 building models, which utilizes features of both modalities: The proposed method can automatically co-register the point clouds from different sources and enrich the thermal point cloud in facade-detailed semantics. The enriched thermal point cloud supports thermal analysis and can facilitate the development of currently scarce deep learning models operating directly on thermal point clouds.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text clustering is an important method for organising the increasing volume of digital content, aiding in the structuring and discovery of hidden patterns in uncategorised data. The effectiveness of text clustering largely depends on the selection of textual embeddings and clustering algorithms. This study argues that recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have the potential to enhance this task. The research investigates how different textual embeddings, particularly those utilised in LLMs, and various clustering algorithms influence the clustering of text datasets. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the impact of embeddings on clustering results, the role of dimensionality reduction through summarisation, and the adjustment of model size. The findings indicate that LLM embeddings are superior at capturing subtleties in structured language. OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model yields better results in three out of five clustering metrics across most tested datasets. Most LLM embeddings show improvements in cluster purity and provide a more informative silhouette score, reflecting a refined structural understanding of text data compared to traditional methods. Among the more lightweight models, BERT demonstrates leading performance. Additionally, it was observed that increasing model dimensionality and employing summarisation techniques do not consistently enhance clustering efficiency, suggesting that these strategies require careful consideration for practical application. These results highlight a complex balance between the need for refined text representation and computational feasibility in text clustering applications. This study extends traditional text clustering frameworks by integrating embeddings from LLMs, offering improved methodologies and suggesting new avenues for future research in various types of textual analysis.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The LHS 6343 system consists of a resolved M-dwarf binary with an evolved, negligibly irradiated brown dwarf, LHS 6343 C, orbiting the primary star. Such brown dwarf eclipsing binaries present rare and unique opportunities to calibrate sub-stellar evolutionary and atmosphere models since mass, radius, temperature and luminosity can be directly measured. We update this brown dwarf's mass (62.6+/-2.2 MJup) and radius (0.788+/-0.043 RJup) using empirical stellar relations and a Gaia DR3 distance. We use Hubble Space Telescope/WFC3 observations of an LHS 6343 C secondary eclipse to obtain a NIR emission spectrum, which matches to a spectral type of T1.5+/-1. We combine this spectrum with existing Kepler and Spitzer/IRAC secondary eclipse photometry to perform atmospheric characterization using the ATMO-2020, Sonora-Bobcat and BT-Settl model grids. ATMO-2020 models with strong non-equilibrium chemistry yield the best fit to observations across all modelled bandpasses while predicting physical parameters consistent with Gaia-dependant analogs. BT-Settl predicts values slightly more consistent with such analogs but offers a significantly poorer fit to the WFC3 spectrum. Finally, we obtain a semi-empirical measurement of LHS 6343 C's apparent luminosity by integrating its observed and modelled spectral energy distribution. Applying knowledge of the system's distance yields a bolometric luminosity of log(Lbol/Lsun) = -4.77+/-0.03 and, applying the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the known radius, an effective temperature of 1303+/-29 K. We also use the ATMO-2020 and Sonora-Bobcat evolutionary model grids to infer an age for LHS 6343 C of 2.86 +0.40-0.33 Gyr and 3.11 +0.50-0.38 Gyr respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces EasyInv, an easy yet novel approach that significantly advances the field of DDIM Inversion by addressing the inherent inefficiencies and performance limitations of traditional iterative optimization methods. At the core of our EasyInv is a refined strategy for approximating inversion noise, which is pivotal for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the inversion process. By prioritizing the initial latent state, which encapsulates rich information about the original images, EasyInv steers clear of the iterative refinement of noise items. Instead, we introduce a methodical aggregation of the latent state from the preceding time step with the current state, effectively increasing the influence of the initial latent state and mitigating the impact of noise. We illustrate that EasyInv is capable of delivering results that are either on par with or exceed those of the conventional DDIM Inversion approach, especially under conditions where the model's precision is limited or computational resources are scarce. Concurrently, our EasyInv offers an approximate threefold enhancement regarding inference efficiency over off-the-shelf iterative optimization techniques.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Existing malicious code detection techniques can aid the manual review process by predicting which packages are likely to be malicious. However, these techniques often suffer from high misclassification rates. Therefore, malicious code detection techniques could be enhanced by adopting advanced, more automated approaches to achieve high accuracy and a low misclassification rate. The goal of this study is to assist security analysts in detecting malicious packages through the empirical study of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect malicious code in the npm ecosystem. We present SecurityAI, a malicious code review workflow to detect malicious code using ChatGPT. We leverage a benchmark dataset of 5,115 npm packages, of which 2,180 packages have malicious code. We conducted a baseline comparison of GPT-3 and GPT- 4 models with the state-of-the-art CodeQL static analysis tool, using 39 custom CodeQL rules developed in prior research to detect malicious Javascript code. We compare the effectiveness of static analysis as a pre-screener with SecurityAI workflow, measuring the number of files that need to be analyzed and the associated costs. Additionally, we performed a qualitative study to understand the types of malicious packages detected or missed by our workflow. Our baseline comparison demonstrates a 16% and 9% improvement over static analysis in precision and F1 scores, respectively. We attained precision and F1 scores of 91% and 94% for GPT-3, and 99% & 97% for GPT-4, respectively, with GPT-3 offering a cost-effective balance. Pre-screening files with a static analyzer reduces the number of files requiring LLM analysis by 77.9% and decreases costs by 60.9% for GPT-3 and 76.1% for GPT-4. Our qualitative analysis identified data theft, hidden backdoors, and suspicious domain connection categories as the top detected malicious packages.

In the edge learning context, however, these approaches will compromise sparsity properties that are often present in the original matrices found at the edge server. In this study, we consider the challenge of augmenting such approaches to preserve input sparsity when distributing the task across edge devices, thereby retaining the associated computational efficiency enhancements. First, we find a lower bound on the weight of coding, i.e., the number of submatrices to be combined to obtain coded submatrices, to provide the resilience to the maximum possible number of straggler devices (for given number of devices and their storage constraints). Next we propose distributed matrix computation schemes which meet the exact lower bound on the weight of the coding. Numerical experiments conducted in Amazon Web Services (AWS) validate our assertions regarding straggler mitigation and computation speed for sparse matrices.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Event relations are crucial for narrative understanding and reasoning. Governed by nuanced logic, event relation extraction (ERE) is a challenging task that demands thorough semantic understanding and rigorous logical reasoning. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth investigation to systematically explore the capability of LLMs in understanding and applying event relation logic. More in detail, we first investigate the deficiencies of LLMs in logical reasoning across different tasks. Our study reveals that LLMs are not logically consistent reasoners, which results in their suboptimal performance on tasks that need rigorous reasoning. To address this, we explore three different approaches to endow LLMs with event relation logic, and thus enable them to generate more coherent answers across various scenarios. Based on our approach, we also contribute a synthesized dataset (LLM-ERL) involving high-order reasoning for evaluation and fine-tuning. Extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses on different tasks also validate the effectiveness of our approaches and provide insights for solving practical tasks with LLMs in future work.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cyber-attack attribution is an important process that allows experts to put in place attacker-oriented countermeasures and legal actions. The analysts mainly perform attribution manually, given the complex nature of this task. AI and, more specifically, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be leveraged to support cybersecurity analysts during the attribution process. However powerful these techniques are, they need to deal with the lack of datasets in the attack attribution domain. In this work, we will fill this gap and will provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first dataset on cyber-attack attribution. We designed our dataset with the primary goal of extracting attack attribution information from cybersecurity texts, utilizing named entity recognition (NER) methodologies from the field of NLP. Unlike other cybersecurity NER datasets, ours offers a rich set of annotations with contextual details, including some that span phrases and sentences. We conducted extensive experiments and applied NLP techniques to demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness for attack attribution. These experiments highlight the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) capabilities to improve the NER tasks in cybersecurity datasets for cyber-attack attribution.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Run-by-run variability in parallel programs caused by floating-point non-associativity (FPNA) has been known to significantly affect reproducibility in iterative algorithms, due to accumulating errors. Non-reproducibility negatively affects efficiency and effectiveness of correctness testing for stochastic programs. Recently, the sensitivity of deep learning (DL) training and inference pipelines to FPNA have been found to be extreme, and can prevent certification for commercial applications, accurate assessment of robustness and sensitivity, and bug detection. New approaches in scientific computing applications have coupled DL models with high-performance computing (HPC) simulations, leading to an aggravation of debugging and testing challenges. Here we perform an investigation of the statistical properties of FPNA within modern parallel programming models, analyze performance and productivity impacts of replacing atomic operations with deterministic alternatives on GPUs, and examine the recently-added deterministic options within the PyTorch framework within the context of GPU deployment, uncovering and quantifying the impacts of input parameters triggering run-by-run variability and reporting on the reliability and completeness of the documentation. Finally, we evaluate the strategy of exploiting automatic determinism provided by deterministic hardware, using the Groq LPU$^{TM}$ accelerator for inference portions of the DL pipeline. We demonstrate the benefits that this strategy can provide within reproducibility and correctness efforts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Constraining the equation of state (EOS) of strongly interacting, dense matter is the focus of intense experimental, observational, and theoretical effort. Chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) can describe the EOS between the typical densities of nuclei and those in the outer cores of neutron stars while perturbative QCD (pQCD) can be applied to properties of deconfined quark matter, both with quantified theoretical uncertainties. However, describing the complete range of densities between nuclear saturation and an almost-free quark gas with a single EOS that has well-quantified uncertainties is a challenging problem. In this work, we argue that Bayesian multi-model inference from $\chi$EFT and pQCD can help bridge the gap between the two theories. We develop a correlated Bayesian model mixing approach that uses a Gaussian Process (GP) to assimilate different information into a single QCD EOS for symmetric nuclear matter. In the present implementation, this mixed EOS is informed solely by those of $\chi$EFT and pQCD, together with the associated truncation errors. The GP is trained on the pressure as a function of number density in the low-density and high-density regions where $\chi$EFT and pQCD are, respectively, valid. We impose priors on the GP kernel hyperparameters to suppress unphysical correlations between these regimes. This results in smooth $\chi$EFT-to-pQCD curves for both the pressure and the speed of sound. We show that using uncorrelated pointwise mixing requires uncontrolled extrapolation of at least one of $\chi$EFT or pQCD into regions where the perturbative series breaks down and leads to an acausal EOS. We also discuss future extensions and applications to neutron star matter guided by recent EOS constraints from nuclear theory, nuclear experiment, and multi-messenger astronomy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a framework enabling large language models (LLMs) to enhance their accuracy and reduce hallucinations by integrating external knowledge bases. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid RAG system enhanced through a comprehensive suite of optimizations that significantly improve retrieval quality, augment reasoning capabilities, and refine numerical computation ability. We refined the text chunks and tables in web pages, added attribute predictors to reduce hallucinations, conducted LLM Knowledge Extractor and Knowledge Graph Extractor, and finally built a reasoning strategy with all the references. We evaluated our system on the CRAG dataset through the Meta CRAG KDD Cup 2024 Competition. Both the local and online evaluations demonstrate that our system significantly enhances complex reasoning capabilities. In local evaluations, we have significantly improved accuracy and reduced error rates compared to the baseline model, achieving a notable increase in scores. In the meanwhile, we have attained outstanding results in online assessments, demonstrating the performance and generalization capabilities of the proposed system.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we propose a novel family of descriptors of chemical graphs, named cycle-configuration (CC), that can be used in the standard "two-layered (2L) model" of mol-infer, a molecular inference framework based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP) and machine learning (ML). Proposed descriptors capture the notion of ortho/meta/para patterns that appear in aromatic rings, which has been impossible in the framework so far. Computational experiments show that, when the new descriptors are supplied, we can construct prediction functions of similar or better performance for all of the 27 tested chemical properties. We also provide an MILP formulation that asks for a chemical graph with desired properties under the 2L model with CC descriptors (2L+CC model). We show that a chemical graph with up to 50 non-hydrogen vertices can be inferred in a practical time.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Machine learning models can leak private information about their training data, but the standard methods to measure this risk, based on membership inference attacks (MIAs), have a major limitation. They only check if a given data point \textit{exactly} matches a training point, neglecting the potential of similar or partially overlapping data revealing the same private information. To address this issue, we introduce the class of range membership inference attacks (RaMIAs), testing if the model was trained on any data in a specified range (defined based on the semantics of privacy). We formulate the RaMIAs game and design a principled statistical test for its complex hypotheses. We show that RaMIAs can capture privacy loss more accurately and comprehensively than MIAs on various types of data, such as tabular, image, and language. RaMIA paves the way for a more comprehensive and meaningful privacy auditing of machine learning algorithms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The task of multi-hop link prediction within knowledge graphs (KGs) stands as a challenge in the field of knowledge graph analysis, as it requires the model to reason through and understand all intermediate connections before making a prediction. In this paper, we introduce the Knowledge Graph Large Language Model (KG-LLM), a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for knowledge graph tasks. We first convert structured knowledge graph data into natural language and then use these natural language prompts to fine-tune LLMs to enhance multi-hop link prediction in KGs. By converting the KG to natural language prompts, our framework is designed to learn the latent representations of entities and their interrelations. To show the efficacy of the KG-LLM Framework, we fine-tune three leading LLMs within this framework, including Flan-T5, LLaMa2 and Gemma. Further, we explore the framework's potential to provide LLMs with zero-shot capabilities for handling previously unseen prompts. Experimental results show that KG-LLM significantly improves the models' generalization capabilities, leading to more accurate predictions in unfamiliar scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Software libraries play a critical role in the functionality, efficiency, and maintainability of software systems. As developers increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline their coding processes, the effectiveness of these models in recommending appropriate libraries becomes crucial yet remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we assess the effectiveness of ChatGPT as a software librarian and identify areas for improvement. We conducted an empirical study using GPT-3.5 Turbo to generate Python code for 10,000 Stack Overflow questions. Our findings show that ChatGPT uses third-party libraries nearly 10% more often than human developers, favoring widely adopted and well-established options. However, 14.2% of the recommended libraries had restrictive copyleft licenses, which were not explicitly communicated by ChatGPT. Additionally, 6.5% of the libraries did not work out of the box, leading to potential developer confusion and wasted time. While ChatGPT can be an effective software librarian, it should be improved by providing more explicit information on maintainability metrics and licensing. We recommend that developers implement rigorous dependency management practices and double-check library licenses before integrating LLM-generated code into their projects.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the dynamic field of artificial intelligence (AI), the development and application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for text analysis are of significant academic interest. Despite the promising capabilities of various LLMs in conducting qualitative analysis, their use in the humanities and social sciences has not been thoroughly examined. This article contributes to the emerging literature on LLMs in qualitative analysis by documenting an experimental study involving GPT-4. The study focuses on performing thematic analysis (TA) using a YouTube dataset derived from an EU-funded project, which was previously analyzed by other researchers. This dataset is about the representation of Roma migrants in Sweden during 2016, a period marked by the aftermath of the 2015 refugee crisis and preceding the Swedish national elections in 2017. Our study seeks to understand the potential of combining human intelligence with AI's scalability and efficiency, examining the advantages and limitations of employing LLMs in qualitative research within the humanities and social sciences. Additionally, we discuss future directions for applying LLMs in these fields.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As basketball's popularity surges, fans often find themselves confused and overwhelmed by the rapid game pace and complexity. Basketball tactics, involving a complex series of actions, require substantial knowledge to be fully understood. This complexity leads to a need for additional information and explanation, which can distract fans from the game. To tackle these challenges, we present Sportify, a Visual Question Answering system that integrates narratives and embedded visualization for demystifying basketball tactical questions, aiding fans in understanding various game aspects. We propose three novel action visualizations (i.e., Pass, Cut, and Screen) to demonstrate critical action sequences. To explain the reasoning and logic behind players' actions, we leverage a large-language model (LLM) to generate narratives. We adopt a storytelling approach for complex scenarios from both first and third-person perspectives, integrating action visualizations. We evaluated Sportify with basketball fans to investigate its impact on understanding of tactics, and how different personal perspectives of narratives impact the understanding of complex tactic with action visualizations. Our evaluation with basketball fans demonstrates Sportify's capability to deepen tactical insights and amplify the viewing experience. Furthermore, third-person narration assists people in getting in-depth game explanations while first-person narration enhances fans' game engagement

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose a physics-constrained convolutional neural network (PC-CNN) to solve two types of inverse problems in partial differential equations (PDEs), which are nonlinear and vary both in space and time. In the first inverse problem, we are given data that is offset by spatially varying systematic error (i.e., the bias, also known as the epistemic uncertainty). The task is to uncover the true state, which is the solution of the PDE, from the biased data. In the second inverse problem, we are given sparse information on the solution of a PDE. The task is to reconstruct the solution in space with high-resolution. First, we present the PC-CNN, which constrains the PDE with a time-windowing scheme to handle sequential data. Second, we analyse the performance of the PC-CNN for uncovering solutions from biased data. We analyse both linear and nonlinear convection-diffusion equations, and the Navier-Stokes equations, which govern the spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics of turbulent flows. We find that the PC-CNN correctly recovers the true solution for a variety of biases, which are parameterised as non-convex functions. Third, we analyse the performance of the PC-CNN for reconstructing solutions from sparse information for the turbulent flow. We reconstruct the spatiotemporal chaotic solution on a high-resolution grid from only < 1\% of the information contained in it. For both tasks, we further analyse the Navier-Stokes solutions. We find that the inferred solutions have a physical spectral energy content, whereas traditional methods, such as interpolation, do not. This work opens opportunities for solving inverse problems with partial differential equations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While there is an immense literature on Bayesian methods for clustering, the multiview case has received little attention. This problem focuses on obtaining distinct but statistically dependent clusterings in a common set of entities for different data types. For example, clustering patients into subgroups with subgroup membership varying according to the domain of the patient variables. A challenge is how to model the across-view dependence between the partitions of patients into subgroups. The complexities of the partition space make standard methods to model dependence, such as correlation, infeasible. In this article, we propose CLustering with Independence Centering (CLIC), a clustering prior that uses a single parameter to explicitly model dependence between clusterings across views. CLIC is induced by the product centered Dirichlet process (PCDP), a novel hierarchical prior that bridges between independent and equivalent partitions. We show appealing theoretic properties, provide a finite approximation and prove its accuracy, present a marginal Gibbs sampler for posterior computation, and derive closed form expressions for the marginal and joint partition distributions for the CLIC model. On synthetic data and in an application to epidemiology, CLIC accurately characterizes view-specific partitions while providing inference on the dependence level.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Translating users' natural language queries (NL) into SQL queries (i.e., NL2SQL) can significantly reduce barriers to accessing relational databases and support various commercial applications. The performance of NL2SQL has been greatly enhanced with the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of NL2SQL techniques powered by LLMs, covering its entire lifecycle from the following four aspects: (1) Model: NL2SQL translation techniques that tackle not only NL ambiguity and under-specification, but also properly map NL with database schema and instances; (2) Data: From the collection of training data, data synthesis due to training data scarcity, to NL2SQL benchmarks; (3) Evaluation: Evaluating NL2SQL methods from multiple angles using different metrics and granularities; and (4) Error Analysis: analyzing NL2SQL errors to find the root cause and guiding NL2SQL models to evolve. Moreover, we provide a rule of thumb for developing NL2SQL solutions. Finally, we discuss the research challenges and open problems of NL2SQL in the LLMs era.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> 3D perception ability is crucial for generalizable robotic manipulation. While recent foundation models have made significant strides in perception and decision-making with RGB-based input, their lack of 3D perception limits their effectiveness in fine-grained robotic manipulation tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Depth Information Injection ($\bold{DI}^{\bold{2}}$) framework that leverages the RGB-Depth modality for policy fine-tuning, while relying solely on RGB images for robust and efficient deployment. Concretely, we introduce the Depth Completion Module (DCM) to extract the spatial prior knowledge related to depth information and generate virtual depth information from RGB inputs to aid policy deployment. Further, we propose the Depth-Aware Codebook (DAC) to eliminate noise and reduce the cumulative error from the depth prediction. In the inference phase, this framework employs RGB inputs and accurately predicted depth data to generate the manipulation action. We conduct experiments on simulated LIBERO environments and real-world scenarios, and the experiment results prove that our method could effectively enhance the pre-trained RGB-based policy with 3D perception ability for robotic manipulation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The spatial linear mixed model (SLMM) consists of fixed and spatial random effects that can be confounded. Restricted spatial regression (RSR) models restrict the spatial random effects to be in the orthogonal column space of the covariates, which "deconfounds" the SLMM. Recent articles have shown that the RSR generally performs worse than the SLMM under a certain interpretation of the RSR. We show that every additive model can be reparameterized as a deconfounded model leading to what we call the linear reparameterization of additive models (LRAM). Under this reparameterization the coefficients of the covariates (referred to as deconfounded regression effects) are different from the (confounded) regression effects in the SLMM. It is shown that under the LRAM interpretation, existing deconfounded spatial models produce estimated deconfounded regression effects, spatial prediction, and spatial prediction variances equivalent to that of SLMM in Bayesian contexts. Furthermore, a general RSR (GRSR) and the SLMM produce identical inferences on confounded regression effects. While our results are in complete agreement with recent criticisms, our new results under the LRAM interpretation provide clarifications that lead to different and sometimes contrary conclusions. Additionally, we discuss the inferential and computational benefits to deconfounding, which we illustrate via a simulation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mosaic crystals, with their high integrated reflectivities, are widely-employed in spectrometers used to diagnose high energy density systems. X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) has emerged as a powerful diagnostic tool of these systems, providing in principle direct access to important properties such as the temperature via detailed balance. However, the measured XRTS spectrum is broadened by the spectrometer instrument function (IF), and without careful consideration of the IF one risks misdiagnosing system conditions. Here, we consider in detail the IF of 40 $\mu$m and 100 $\mu$m mosaic HAPG crystals, and how the broadening varies across the spectrometer in an energy range of 6.7-8.6 keV. Notably, we find a strong asymmetry in the shape of the IF towards higher energies. As an example, we consider the effect of the asymmetry in the IF on the temperature inferred via XRTS for simulated 80 eV CH plasmas, and find that the temperature can be overestimated if an approximate symmetric IF is used. We therefore expect a detailed consideration of the full IF will have an important impact on system properties inferred via XRTS in both forward modelling and model-free approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Much work on the cultural awareness of large language models (LLMs) focuses on the models' sensitivity to geo-cultural diversity. However, in addition to cross-cultural differences, there also exists common ground across cultures. For instance, a bridal veil in the United States plays a similar cultural-relevant role as a honggaitou in China. In this study, we introduce a benchmark dataset CUNIT for evaluating decoder-only LLMs in understanding the cultural unity of concepts. Specifically, CUNIT consists of 1,425 evaluation examples building upon 285 traditional cultural-specific concepts across 10 countries. Based on a systematic manual annotation of cultural-relevant features per concept, we calculate the cultural association between any pair of cross-cultural concepts. Built upon this dataset, we design a contrastive matching task to evaluate the LLMs' capability to identify highly associated cross-cultural concept pairs. We evaluate 3 strong LLMs, using 3 popular prompting strategies, under the settings of either giving all extracted concept features or no features at all on CUNIT Interestingly, we find that cultural associations across countries regarding clothing concepts largely differ from food. Our analysis shows that LLMs are still limited to capturing cross-cultural associations between concepts compared to humans. Moreover, geo-cultural proximity shows a weak influence on model performance in capturing cross-cultural associations.

Meanwhile, experiments conducted on Covost2 Zh2en testset suggest that our model outperforms other open source Speech LLMs. A BLEU score of 25.2 can be obtained. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows. First, this paper presents a training strategy for encoders and LLMs on speech related tasks (including ASR and AST) using a small size of pseudo labeled data without any extra manual annotation and selection. Second, we release our ASR and AST models and plan to open-source our training code and strategy in the near future. Moreover, a model trained on 8wh scale training data is planned to be released later on.

  Reflexive Prompting for Large-Language-Models</h2>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have generated significant attention since their inception, finding applications across various academic and industrial domains. However, these models often suffer from the "hallucination problem", where outputs, though grammatically and logically coherent, lack factual accuracy or are entirely fabricated. A particularly troubling issue discovered and widely discussed recently is the numerical comparison error where multiple LLMs incorrectly infer that "9.11$>$9.9". We discovered that the order in which LLMs generate answers and reasoning impacts their consistency. Specifically, results vary significantly when an LLM generates an answer first and then provides the reasoning versus generating the reasoning process first and then the conclusion. Inspired by this, we propose a new benchmark method for assessing LLM consistency: comparing responses generated through these two different approaches. This benchmark effectively identifies instances where LLMs fabricate answers and subsequently generate justifications. Furthermore, we introduce a novel and straightforward prompt strategy designed to mitigate this issue. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy improves performance across various LLMs compared to direct questioning. This work not only sheds light on a critical flaw in LLMs but also offers a practical solution to enhance their reliability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Planning in textual environments have been shown to be a long-standing challenge even for current models. A recent, promising line of work uses LLMs to generate a formal representation of the environment that can be solved by a symbolic planner. However, existing methods rely on a fully-observed environment where all entity states are initially known, so a one-off representation can be constructed, leading to a complete plan. In contrast, we tackle partially-observed environments where there is initially no sufficient information to plan for the end-goal. We propose PDDLEGO that iteratively construct a planning representation that can lead to a partial plan for a given sub-goal. By accomplishing the sub-goal, more information is acquired to augment the representation, eventually achieving the end-goal. We show that plans produced by few-shot PDDLEGO are 43% more efficient than generating plans end-to-end on the Coin Collector simulation, with strong performance (98%) on the more complex Cooking World simulation where end-to-end LLMs fail to generate coherent plans (4%).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The concept of signatures and expected signatures is vital in data science, especially for sequential data analysis. The signature transform, a Cartan type development, translates paths into high-dimensional feature vectors, capturing their intrinsic characteristics. Under natural conditions, the expectation of the signature determines the law of the signature, providing a statistical summary of the data distribution. This property facilitates robust modeling and inference in machine learning and stochastic processes. Building on previous work by the present authors [Unified signature cumulants and generalized Magnus expansions, FoM Sigma '22] we here revisit the actual computation of expected signatures, in a general semimartingale setting. Several new formulae are given. A log-transform of (expected) signatures leads to log-signatures (signature cumulants), offering a significant reduction in complexity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, the text-to-3D task has developed rapidly due to the appearance of the SDS method. However, the SDS method always generates 3D objects with poor quality due to the over-smooth issue. This issue is attributed to two factors: 1) the DDPM single-step inference produces poor guidance gradients; 2) the randomness from the input noises and timesteps averages the details of the 3D contents. In this paper, to address the issue, we propose DreamLCM which incorporates the Latent Consistency Model (LCM). DreamLCM leverages the powerful image generation capabilities inherent in LCM, enabling generating consistent and high-quality guidance, i.e., predicted noises or images. Powered by the improved guidance, the proposed method can provide accurate and detailed gradients to optimize the target 3D models. In addition, we propose two strategies to enhance the generation quality further. Firstly, we propose a guidance calibration strategy, utilizing Euler Solver to calibrate the guidance distribution to accelerate 3D models to converge. Secondly, we propose a dual timestep strategy, increasing the consistency of guidance and optimizing 3D models from geometry to appearance in DreamLCM. Experiments show that DreamLCM achieves state-of-the-art results in both generation quality and training efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/1YimingZhong/DreamLCM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurate patient selection is critical in radiotherapy (RT) to prevent ineffective treatments. Traditional survival prediction models, relying on structured data, often lack precision. This study explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to structure unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data, thereby improving survival prediction accuracy through comprehensive clinical information integration. Data from 34,276 patients treated with RT at Yonsei Cancer Center between 2013 and 2023 were analyzed, encompassing both structured and unstructured data. An open-source LLM was used to structure the unstructured EHR data via single-shot learning, with its performance compared against a domain-specific medical LLM and a smaller variant. Survival prediction models were developed using statistical, machine learning, and deep learning approaches, incorporating both structured and LLM-structured data. Clinical experts evaluated the accuracy of the LLM-structured data. The open-source LLM achieved 87.5% accuracy in structuring unstructured EHR data without additional training, significantly outperforming the domain-specific medical LLM, which reached only 35.8% accuracy. Larger LLMs were more effective, particularly in extracting clinically relevant features like general condition and disease extent, which closely correlated with patient survival. Incorporating LLM-structured clinical features into survival prediction models significantly improved accuracy, with the C-index of deep learning models increasing from 0.737 to 0.820. These models also became more interpretable by emphasizing clinically significant factors. This study shows that general-domain LLMs, even without specific medical training, can effectively structure large-scale unstructured EHR data, substantially enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of clinical predictive models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diacritization plays a pivotal role in improving readability and disambiguating the meaning of Arabic texts. Efforts have so far focused on marking every eligible character (Full Diacritization). Comparatively overlooked, Partial Diacritzation (PD) is the selection of a subset of characters to be marked to aid comprehension where needed. Research has indicated that excessive diacritic marks can hinder skilled readers -- reducing reading speed and accuracy. We conduct a behavioral experiment and show that partially marked text is often easier to read than fully marked text, and sometimes easier than plain text. In this light, we introduce Context-Contrastive Partial Diacritization (CCPD) -- a novel approach to PD which integrates seamlessly with existing Arabic diacritization systems. CCPD processes each word twice, once with context and once without, and diacritizes only the characters with disparities between the two inferences. Further, we introduce novel indicators for measuring partial diacritization quality, essential for establishing this as a machine learning task. Lastly, we introduce TD2, a Transformer-variant of an established model which offers a markedly different performance profile on our proposed indicators compared to all other known systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurately determining cell type composition in disease-relevant tissues is crucial for identifying disease targets. Most existing spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies cannot achieve single-cell resolution, making it challenging to accurately determine cell types. To address this issue, various deconvolution methods have been developed. Most of these methods use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the same tissue as a reference to infer cell types in ST data spots. However, they often overlook the differences between scRNA-seq and ST data. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Masked Adversarial Neural Network (MACD). MACD employs adversarial learning to align real ST data with simulated ST data generated from scRNA-seq data. By mapping them into a unified latent space, it can minimize the differences between the two types of data. Additionally, MACD uses masking techniques to effectively learn the features of real ST data and mitigate noise. We evaluated MACD on 32 simulated datasets and 2 real datasets, demonstrating its accuracy in performing cell type deconvolution. All code and public datasets used in this paper are available at https://github.com/wenwenmin/MACD and https://zenodo.org/records/12804822.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Domain specific digital twins, representing a digital replica of various segments of the smart grid, are foreseen as able to model, simulate, and control the respective segments. At the same time, knowledge-based digital twins, coupled with AI, may also empower humans to understand aspects of the system through natural language interaction in view of planning and policy making. This paper is the first to assess and report on the potential of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) question answers related to household electrical energy measurement aspects leveraging a knowledge-based energy digital twin. Relying on the recently published electricity consumption knowledge graph that actually represents a knowledge-based digital twin, we study the capabilities of ChatGPT, Gemini and Llama in answering electricity related questions. Furthermore, we compare the answers with the ones generated through a RAG techniques that leverages an existing electricity knowledge-based digital twin. Our findings illustrate that the RAG approach not only reduces the incidence of incorrect information typically generated by LLMs but also significantly improves the quality of the output by grounding responses in verifiable data. This paper details our methodology, presents a comparative analysis of responses with and without RAG, and discusses the implications of our findings for future applications of AI in specialized sectors like energy data analysis.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper we argue that a jailbroken GenAI model can cause substantial harm to GenAI-powered applications and facilitate PromptWare, a new type of attack that flips the GenAI model's behavior from serving an application to attacking it. PromptWare exploits user inputs to jailbreak a GenAI model to force/perform malicious activity within the context of a GenAI-powered application. First, we introduce a naive implementation of PromptWare that behaves as malware that targets Plan & Execute architectures (a.k.a., ReAct, function calling). We show that attackers could force a desired execution flow by creating a user input that produces desired outputs given that the logic of the GenAI-powered application is known to attackers. We demonstrate the application of a DoS attack that triggers the execution of a GenAI-powered assistant to enter an infinite loop that wastes money and computational resources on redundant API calls to a GenAI engine, preventing the application from providing service to a user. Next, we introduce a more sophisticated implementation of PromptWare that we name Advanced PromptWare Threat (APwT) that targets GenAI-powered applications whose logic is unknown to attackers. We show that attackers could create user input that exploits the GenAI engine's advanced AI capabilities to launch a kill chain in inference time consisting of six steps intended to escalate privileges, analyze the application's context, identify valuable assets, reason possible malicious activities, decide on one of them, and execute it. We demonstrate the application of APwT against a GenAI-powered e-commerce chatbot and show that it can trigger the modification of SQL tables, potentially leading to unauthorized discounts on the items sold to the user.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reconstructing the evolutionary history relating a collection of molecular sequences is the main subject of modern Bayesian phylogenetic inference. However, the commonly used Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be inefficient due to the complicated space of phylogenetic trees, especially when the number of sequences is large. An alternative approach is variational Bayesian phylogenetic inference (VBPI) which transforms the inference problem into an optimization problem. While effective, the default diagonal lognormal approximation for the branch lengths of the tree used in VBPI is often insufficient to capture the complexity of the exact posterior. In this work, we propose a more flexible family of branch length variational posteriors based on semi-implicit hierarchical distributions using graph neural networks. We show that this semi-implicit construction emits straightforward permutation equivariant distributions, and therefore can handle the non-Euclidean branch length space across different tree topologies with ease. To deal with the intractable marginal probability of semi-implicit variational distributions, we develop several alternative lower bounds for stochastic optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method over baseline methods on benchmark data examples, in terms of both marginal likelihood estimation and branch length posterior approximation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Probabilistic denoising diffusion models (DDMs) have set a new standard for 2D image generation. Extending DDMs for 3D content creation is an active field of research. Here, we propose TetraDiffusion, a diffusion model that operates on a tetrahedral partitioning of 3D space to enable efficient, high-resolution 3D shape generation. Our model introduces operators for convolution and transpose convolution that act directly on the tetrahedral partition, and seamlessly includes additional attributes such as color. Remarkably, TetraDiffusion enables rapid sampling of detailed 3D objects in nearly real-time with unprecedented resolution. It's also adaptable for generating 3D shapes conditioned on 2D images. Compared to existing 3D mesh diffusion techniques, our method is up to 200 times faster in inference speed, works on standard consumer hardware, and delivers superior results.

(2021), allows optimizing over the initial distribution of AIS. In this paper, we show that, in the limit of many transitions, DAIS minimizes the symmetrized Kullback-Leibler divergence between the initial and target distribution. Thus, DAIS can be seen as a form of variational inference (VI) as its initial distribution is a parametric fit to an intractable target distribution. We empirically evaluate the usefulness of the initial distribution as a variational distribution on synthetic and real-world data, observing that it often provides more accurate uncertainty estimates than VI (optimizing the reverse KL divergence), importance weighted VI, and Markovian score climbing (optimizing the forward KL divergence).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Exame Nacional do Ensino M\'edio (ENEM) is a pivotal test for Brazilian students, required for admission to a significant number of universities in Brazil. The test consists of four objective high-school level tests on Math, Humanities, Natural Sciences and Languages, and one writing essay. Students' answers to the test and to the accompanying socioeconomic status questionnaire are made public every year (albeit anonymized) due to transparency policies from the Brazilian Government. In the context of large language models (LLMs), these data lend themselves nicely to comparing different groups of humans with AI, as we can have access to human and machine answer distributions. We leverage these characteristics of the ENEM dataset and compare GPT-3.5 and 4, and MariTalk, a model trained using Portuguese data, to humans, aiming to ascertain how their answers relate to real societal groups and what that may reveal about the model biases. We divide the human groups by using socioeconomic status (SES), and compare their answer distribution with LLMs for each question and for the essay. We find no significant biases when comparing LLM performance to humans on the multiple-choice Brazilian Portuguese tests, as the distance between model and human answers is mostly determined by the human accuracy. A similar conclusion is found by looking at the generated text as, when analyzing the essays, we observe that human and LLM essays differ in a few key factors, one being the choice of words where model essays were easily separable from human ones. The texts also differ syntactically, with LLM generated essays exhibiting, on average, smaller sentences and less thought units, among other differences. These results suggest that, for Brazilian Portuguese in the ENEM context, LLM outputs represent no group of humans, being significantly different from the answers from Brazilian students across all tests.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The extensive need for computational resources poses a significant obstacle to deploying large-scale Deep Neural Networks (DNN) on devices with constrained resources. At the same time, studies have demonstrated that a significant number of these DNN parameters are redundant and extraneous. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for learning structured sparse neural networks, aimed at bridging the DNN hardware deployment challenges. We develop a novel regularization technique, termed Weighted Group Sparse Envelope Function (WGSEF), generalizing the Sparse Envelop Function (SEF), to select (or nullify) neuron groups, thereby reducing redundancy and enhancing computational efficiency. The method speeds up inference time and aims to reduce memory demand and power consumption, thanks to its adaptability which lets any hardware specify group definitions, such as filters, channels, filter shapes, layer depths, a single parameter (unstructured), etc. The properties of the WGSEF enable the pre-definition of a desired sparsity level to be achieved at the training convergence. In the case of redundant parameters, this approach maintains negligible network accuracy degradation or can even lead to improvements in accuracy. Our method efficiently computes the WGSEF regularizer and its proximal operator, in a worst-case linear complexity relative to the number of group variables. Employing a proximal-gradient-based optimization technique, to train the model, it tackles the non-convex minimization problem incorporating the neural network loss and the WGSEF. Finally, we experiment and illustrate the efficiency of our proposed method in terms of the compression ratio, accuracy, and inference latency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The use of large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly widespread among software developers. However, privacy and computational requirements are problematic with commercial solutions and the use of LLMs. In this work, we focus on using LLMs with around 160 million parameters that are suitable for local execution and augmentation with retrieval from local projects. We train two models based on the transformer architecture, the generative model GPT-2 and the retrieval-adapted RETRO model, on open-source Python files, and empirically evaluate and compare them, confirming the benefits of vector embedding based retrieval. Further, we improve our models' performance with In-context retrieval-augmented generation, which retrieves code snippets based on the Jaccard similarity of tokens. We evaluate In-context retrieval-augmented generation on larger models and conclude that, despite its simplicity, the approach is more suitable than using the RETRO architecture. We highlight the key role of proper tokenization in achieving the full potential of LLMs in code completion.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique commonly used to equip models with out of distribution knowledge. This process involves collecting, indexing, retrieving, and providing information to an LLM for generating responses. Despite its growing popularity due to its flexibility and low cost, the security implications of RAG have not been extensively studied. The data for such systems are often collected from public sources, providing an attacker a gateway for indirect prompt injections to manipulate the responses of the model. In this paper, we investigate the security of RAG systems against end-to-end indirect prompt manipulations. First, we review existing RAG framework pipelines, deriving a prototypical architecture and identifying critical parameters. We then examine prior works searching for techniques that attackers can use to perform indirect prompt manipulations. Finally, we implemented Rag 'n Roll, a framework to determine the effectiveness of attacks against end-to-end RAG applications. Our results show that existing attacks are mostly optimized to boost the ranking of malicious documents during the retrieval phase. However, a higher rank does not immediately translate into a reliable attack. Most attacks, against various configurations, settle around a 40% success rate, which could rise to 60% when considering ambiguous answers as successful attacks (those that include the expected benign one as well). Additionally, when using unoptimized documents, attackers deploying two of them (or more) for a target query can achieve similar results as those using optimized ones. Finally, exploration of the configuration space of a RAG showed limited impact in thwarting the attacks, where the most successful combination severely undermines functionality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Guitar tablatures enrich the structure of traditional music notation by assigning each note to a string and fret of a guitar in a particular tuning, indicating precisely where to play the note on the instrument. The problem of generating tablature from a symbolic music representation involves inferring this string and fret assignment per note across an entire composition or performance. On the guitar, multiple string-fret assignments are possible for most pitches, which leads to a large combinatorial space that prevents exhaustive search approaches. Most modern methods use constraint-based dynamic programming to minimize some cost function (e.g.\ hand position movement). In this work, we introduce a novel deep learning solution to symbolic guitar tablature estimation. We train an encoder-decoder Transformer model in a masked language modeling paradigm to assign notes to strings. The model is first pre-trained on DadaGP, a dataset of over 25K tablatures, and then fine-tuned on a curated set of professionally transcribed guitar performances. Given the subjective nature of assessing tablature quality, we conduct a user study amongst guitarists, wherein we ask participants to rate the playability of multiple versions of tablature for the same four-bar excerpt. The results indicate our system significantly outperforms competing algorithms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Preplanetary nebulae (PPNe) are formed from mass-ejecting late-stage AGB stars. Much of the light from the star gets scattered or absorbed by dust particles, giving rise to the observed reflection nebula seen at visible and near-IR wavelengths. Precursors to planetary nebulae (PNe), PPNe generally have not yet undergone any ionization by UV radiation from the still-buried stellar core. Bipolar PPNe are a common form of observed PPNe. This study lays the groundwork for future dynamical studies by reconstructing the dust density distribution of a particularly symmetric bipolar PPN, M1-92 (Minkowski's Footprint, IRAS 19343$+$2926). For this purpose, we develop an efficient single-scattering radiative transfer model with corrections for double-scattering. Using a V-band image from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we infer the dust density profile and orientation of M1-92. These results indicate that M1-92's slowly expanding equatorial torus exhibits an outer radial cutoff in its density, which implicates the influence of a binary companion during the formation of the nebula.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As the open community of large language models (LLMs) matures, multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have promised an elegant bridge between vision and language. However, current research is inherently constrained by challenges such as the need for high-quality instruction pairs and the loss of visual information in image-to-text training objectives. To this end, we propose a Visual Token Complement framework (VTC) that helps MLLMs regain the missing visual features and thus improve response accuracy. Specifically, our VTC integrates text-to-image generation as a guide to identifying the text-irrelevant features, and a visual selector is then developed to generate complementary visual tokens to enrich the original visual input. Moreover, an iterative strategy is further designed to extract more visual information by iteratively using the visual selector without any additional training. Notably, the training pipeline requires no additional image-text pairs, resulting in a desired instruction tuning-free property. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of our VTC.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The problem of estimating the constant parameters of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation from observed data has received attention from researchers in physics, applied mathematics and statistics. This is motivated by the various physical applications of the equation and, also, because it often serves as a test model for the study of space-time pattern formation. Remarkably, most existing inference techniques rely on statistical tools, which are computationally very costly yet do not exploit the dynamical features of the system. In this paper we introduce a simple, online parameter estimation method that relies on the synchronization properties of the KS equation. In particular, we describe a master-slave setup where the slave model is driven by observations from the master system. The slave dynamics are data-driven and designed to continuously adapt the model parameters until identical synchronization with the master system is achieved. We provide a simple analysis that supports the proposed approach and also present and discuss the results of an extensive set of computer simulations. Our numerical study shows that the proposed method is computationally fast and also robust to initialization errors, observational noise and variations in the spatial resolution of the numerical scheme used to integrate the KS equation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) can be prone to hallucinations - generating unreliable outputs that are unfaithful to their inputs, external facts or internally inconsistent. In this work, we address several challenges for post-hoc hallucination detection in production settings. Our pipeline for hallucination detection entails: first, producing a confidence score representing the likelihood that a generated answer is a hallucination; second, calibrating the score conditional on attributes of the inputs and candidate response; finally, performing detection by thresholding the calibrated score. We benchmark a variety of state-of-the-art scoring methods on different datasets, encompassing question answering, fact checking, and summarization tasks. We employ diverse LLMs to ensure a comprehensive assessment of performance. We show that calibrating individual scoring methods is critical for ensuring risk-aware downstream decision making. Based on findings that no individual score performs best in all situations, we propose a multi-scoring framework, which combines different scores and achieves top performance across all datasets. We further introduce cost-effective multi-scoring, which can match or even outperform more expensive detection methods, while significantly reducing computational overhead.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The uncertainties in photometric redshifts and stellar masses from imaging surveys affect galaxy sample selection, their abundance measurements, as well as the measured weak lensing signals. We develop a framework to assess the systematic effects arising from the use of redshifts and stellar masses derived from photometric data, and explore their impact on the inferred galaxy-dark matter connection. We use galaxy catalogues from the UniverseMachine (UM) galaxy formation model to create Pz-mock galaxy samples that approximately follow the redshift errors in the Subaru HSC survey. We focus on galaxy stellar-mass thresholds ranging from $\log\left[M_*/(h^{-2}M_\odot)\right]$ from $8.6$ to $11.2$ in steps of 0.2 dex within two redshift bins $0.30-0.55$ and $0.55-0.80$. A comparison of the Pz-mock samples to true galaxy samples in UM shows a relatively mild sample contamination for thresholds with $\log\left[M_{*,\rm limit}/(h^{-2}M_\odot)\right]<10.6$, while an increasing contamination towards the more massive end. We show how such contamination affects the measured abundance and the lensing signal. A joint HOD modelling of the observables from the Pz-mock compared to the truth in the UM informs the systematic biases on the average halo masses of central galaxies in the HSC survey. Even with a reasonably conservative choice of photo-$z$ errors in Pz-mock, we show that the inferred halo masses deduced from the HSC galaxies for low-mass thresholds will have a systematic bias smaller than 0.05 dex. Beyond $\log\left[M_{*,\rm limit}/(h^{-2}M_\odot)\right]=10.6$, the inferred halo masses show an increasing systematic bias with stellar mass, reaching values of order $0.2$ dex, larger than the statistical error.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Debugging is a vital aspect of software development, yet the debugging capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain largely unexplored. This paper first introduces DEBUGEVAL, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the debugging capabilities of LLMs. DEBUGEVAL collects data from existing high-quality datasets and designs four different tasks to evaluate the debugging effectiveness, including BUG Localization, BUG Identification, Code Review, and Code Repair. Additionally, to enhance the code debugging ability of LLMs, this paper proposes a CoMmunicative Agent BaSed DaTa REfinement FRamework (MASTER), which generates the refined code debugging data for supervised finetuning. Specifically, MASTER employs the Code Quizzer to generate refined data according to the defined tasks of DEBUGEVAL. Then the Code Learner acts as a critic and reserves the generated problems that it can not solve. Finally, the Code Teacher provides a detailed Chain-of-Thought based solution to deal with the generated problem. We collect the synthesized data and finetune the Code Learner to enhance the debugging ability and conduct the NeuDebugger model. Our experiments evaluate various LLMs and NeuDebugger in the zero-shot setting on DEBUGEVAL. Experimental results demonstrate that these 7B-scale LLMs have weaker debugging capabilities, even these code-oriented LLMs. On the contrary, these larger models (over 70B) show convincing debugging ability. Our further analyses illustrate that MASTER is an effective method to enhance the code debugging ability by synthesizing data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Algorithms for mutual interference mitigation and object parameter estimation are a key enabler for automotive applications of frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar. In this paper, we introduce a signal separation method to detect and estimate radar object parameters while jointly estimating and successively canceling the interference signal. The underlying signal model poses a challenge, since both the coherent radar echo and the non-coherent interference influenced by individual multipath propagation channels must be considered. Under certain assumptions, the model is described as a superposition of multipath channels weighted by parametric interference chirp envelopes. Inspired by sparse Bayesian learning (SBL), we employ an augmented probabilistic model that uses a hierarchical Gamma-Gaussian prior model for each multipath channel. Based on this, an iterative inference algorithm is derived using the variational expectation-maximization (EM) methodology. The algorithm is statistically evaluated in terms of object parameter estimation accuracy and robustness, indicating that it is fundamentally capable of achieving the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) with respect to the accuracy of object estimates and it closely follows the radar performance achieved when no interference is present.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While fusing the capacities and advantages of various large language models (LLMs) offers a pathway to construct more powerful and versatile models, a fundamental challenge is to properly select advantageous model during the training. Existing fusion methods primarily focus on the training mode that uses cross entropy on ground truth in a teacher-forcing setup to measure a model's advantage, which may provide limited insight towards model advantage. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that enhances the fusion process by incorporating both the training and inference modes. Our method evaluates model advantage not only through cross entropy during training but also by considering inference outputs, providing a more comprehensive assessment. To combine the two modes effectively, we introduce ProFuser to progressively transition from inference mode to training mode. To validate ProFuser's effectiveness, we fused three models, including vicuna-7b-v1.5, Llama-2-7b-chat, and mpt-7b-8k-chat, and demonstrated the improved performance in knowledge, reasoning, and safety compared to baseline methods.

In this work, we uncover culture perceptions of three SOTA models on 110 countries and regions on 8 culture-related topics through culture-conditioned generations, and extract symbols from these generations that are associated to each culture by the LLM. We discover that culture-conditioned generation consist of linguistic "markers" that distinguish marginalized cultures apart from default cultures. We also discover that LLMs have an uneven degree of diversity in the culture symbols, and that cultures from different geographic regions have different presence in LLMs' culture-agnostic generation. Our findings promote further research in studying the knowledge and fairness of global culture perception in LLMs. Code and Data can be found here: https://github.com/huihanlhh/Culture-Gen/

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we conduct an empirical analysis of how large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, interpret constitutional principles in complex decision-making scenarios. We examine rulings from the Italian Constitutional Court on bioethics issues that involve trade-offs between competing values and compare model-generated legal arguments on these issues to those presented by the State, the Court, and the applicants. Our results indicate that GPT-4 consistently aligns more closely with progressive interpretations of the Constitution, often overlooking competing values and mirroring the applicants' views rather than the more conservative perspectives of the State or the Court's moderate positions. Our experiments reveal a distinct tendency of GPT-4 to favor progressive legal interpretations, underscoring the influence of underlying data biases. We thus underscore the importance of testing alignment in real-world scenarios and considering the implications of deploying LLMs in decision-making processes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have been found to memorize and recite some of the textual sequences from their training set verbatim, raising broad concerns about privacy and copyright issues when using LLMs. This Textual Sequence Memorization (TSM) phenomenon leads to a high demand to regulate LLM output to prevent it from generating certain memorized text to meet user requirements. However, our empirical study reveals that existing methods for TSM erasure fail to forget massive memorized samples without substantially jeopardizing the model utility. To achieve a better trade-off between the effectiveness of TSM erasure and model utility in LLMs, our paper proposes a new framework based on Entropy Maximization with Selective Optimization (EMSO), where the updated weights are chosen with a novel contrastive gradient metric without any participation of additional model or data. Our analysis shows that training with the entropy maximization loss has a more stable optimization process and better keeps model utility than existing methods. The contrastive gradient metric localizes the most influential weight for TSM erasure by taking both the gradient magnitude and direction into consideration. Extensive experiments across three model scales demonstrate that our method excels in handling large-scale forgetting requests while preserving model ability in language generation and reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the domain of cloud-based deep learning, the imperative for external computational resources coexists with acute privacy concerns, particularly identity leakage. To address this challenge, we introduce XNN and XNN-d, pioneering methodologies that infuse neural network features with randomized perturbations, striking a harmonious balance between utility and privacy. XNN, designed for the training phase, ingeniously blends random permutation with matrix multiplication techniques to obfuscate feature maps, effectively shielding private data from potential breaches without compromising training integrity. Concurrently, XNN-d, devised for the inference phase, employs adversarial training to integrate generative adversarial noise. This technique effectively counters black-box access attacks aimed at identity extraction, while a distilled face recognition network adeptly processes the perturbed features, ensuring accurate identification. Our evaluation demonstrates XNN's effectiveness, significantly outperforming existing methods in reducing identity leakage while maintaining a high model accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Methods used to infer nuclear parameters from neutron count statistics fall into two categories depending on whether they use moments or count number probabilities. As probabilities are in general more difficult to calculate, we are interested here in the reconstruction of distributions from their first moments. For this, we explore two approaches. The first one relies on a generalization of the 2-forked branching correlation (quadratic) approximation used in the PMZBB and Poisson radical distributions, the second one is based on the expansion of the distribution on a basis of Meixner discrete orthogonal polynomials.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs), now used daily by millions, can encode societal biases, exposing their users to representational harms. A large body of scholarship on LLM bias exists but it predominantly adopts a Western-centric frame and attends comparatively less to bias levels and potential harms in the Global South. In this paper, we quantify stereotypical bias in popular LLMs according to an Indian-centric frame through Indian-BhED, a first of its kind dataset, containing stereotypical and anti-stereotypical examples in the context of caste and religious stereotypes in India. We find that the majority of LLMs tested have a strong propensity to output stereotypes in the Indian context, especially when compared to axes of bias traditionally studied in the Western context, such as gender and race. Notably, we find that GPT-2, GPT-2 Large, and GPT 3.5 have a particularly high propensity for preferring stereotypical outputs as a percent of all sentences for the axes of caste (63-79%) and religion (69-72%). We finally investigate potential causes for such harmful behaviour in LLMs, and posit intervention techniques to reduce both stereotypical and anti-stereotypical biases. The findings of this work highlight the need for including more diverse voices when researching fairness in AI and evaluating LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The determination of the full population of Resident Space Objects (RSOs) in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is a key issue in the field of space situational awareness that will only increase in importance in the coming years. We endeavour to describe a novel method of inferring the population of RSOs as a function of orbital height and inclination for a range of magnitudes. The method described uses observations of an orbit of known height and inclination to detect RSOs on neighbouring orbits. These neighbouring orbit targets move slowly relative to our tracked orbit, and are thus detectable down to faint magnitudes. We conduct simulations to show that, by observing multiple passes of a known orbit, we can infer the population of RSOs within a defined region of orbital parameter space. Observing a range of orbits from different orbital sites will allow for the inference of a population of LEO RSOs as a function of their orbital parameters and object magnitude.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the past year, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in tasks such as visual question answering, visual understanding and reasoning. However, the extensive model size and high training and inference costs have hindered the widespread application of MLLMs in academia and industry. Thus, studying efficient and lightweight MLLMs has enormous potential, especially in edge computing scenarios. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and systematic review of the current state of efficient MLLMs. Specifically, we summarize the timeline of representative efficient MLLMs, research state of efficient structures and strategies, and the applications. Finally, we discuss the limitations of current efficient MLLM research and promising future directions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Extraction and interpretation of intricate information from unstructured text data arising in financial applications, such as earnings call transcripts, present substantial challenges to large language models (LLMs) even using the current best practices to use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) (referred to as VectorRAG techniques which utilize vector databases for information retrieval) due to challenges such as domain specific terminology and complex formats of the documents. We introduce a novel approach based on a combination, called HybridRAG, of the Knowledge Graphs (KGs) based RAG techniques (called GraphRAG) and VectorRAG techniques to enhance question-answer (Q&A) systems for information extraction from financial documents that is shown to be capable of generating accurate and contextually relevant answers. Using experiments on a set of financial earning call transcripts documents which come in the form of Q&A format, and hence provide a natural set of pairs of ground-truth Q&As, we show that HybridRAG which retrieves context from both vector database and KG outperforms both traditional VectorRAG and GraphRAG individually when evaluated at both the retrieval and generation stages in terms of retrieval accuracy and answer generation. The proposed technique has applications beyond the financial domain

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present a physics-inspired method for inferring dynamic rankings in directed temporal networks - networks in which each directed and timestamped edge reflects the outcome and timing of a pairwise interaction. The inferred ranking of each node is real-valued and varies in time as each new edge, encoding an outcome like a win or loss, raises or lowers the node's estimated strength or prestige, as is often observed in real scenarios including sequences of games, tournaments, or interactions in animal hierarchies. Our method works by solving a linear system of equations and requires only one parameter to be tuned. As a result, the corresponding algorithm is scalable and efficient. We test our method by evaluating its ability to predict interactions (edges' existence) and their outcomes (edges' directions) in a variety of applications, including both synthetic and real data. Our analysis shows that in many cases our method's performance is better than existing methods for predicting dynamic rankings and interaction outcomes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> 3D reconstruction has been widely used in autonomous navigation fields of mobile robotics. However, the former research can only provide the basic geometry structure without the capability of open-world scene understanding, limiting advanced tasks like human interaction and visual navigation. Moreover, traditional 3D scene understanding approaches rely on expensive labeled 3D datasets to train a model for a single task with supervision. Thus, geometric reconstruction with zero-shot scene understanding i.e. Open vocabulary 3D Understanding and Reconstruction, is crucial for the future development of mobile robots. In this paper, we propose OpenOcc, a novel framework unifying the 3D scene reconstruction and open vocabulary understanding with neural radiance fields. We model the geometric structure of the scene with occupancy representation and distill the pre-trained open vocabulary model into a 3D language field via volume rendering for zero-shot inference. Furthermore, a novel semantic-aware confidence propagation (SCP) method has been proposed to relieve the issue of language field representation degeneracy caused by inconsistent measurements in distilled features. Experimental results show that our approach achieves competitive performance in 3D scene understanding tasks, especially for small and long-tail objects.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this work, we delve into the EEG classification task in the domain of visual brain decoding via two frameworks, involving two different learning paradigms. Considering the spatio-temporal nature of EEG data, one of our frameworks is based on a CNN-BiLSTM model. The other involves a CNN-Transformer architecture which inherently involves the more versatile attention based learning paradigm. In both cases, a special 1D-CNN feature extraction module is used to generate the initial embeddings with 1D convolutions in the time and the EEG channel domains. Considering the EEG signals are noisy, non stationary and the discriminative features are even less clear (than in semantically structured data such as text or image), we also follow a window-based classification followed by majority voting during inference, to yield labels at a signal level. To illustrate how brain patterns correlate with different image classes, we visualize t-SNE plots of the BiLSTM embeddings alongside brain activation maps for the top 10 classes. These visualizations provide insightful revelations into the distinct neural signatures associated with each visual category, showcasing the BiLSTM's capability to capture and represent the discriminative brain activity linked to visual stimuli. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on the updated EEG-Imagenet dataset with positive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The future sixth-generation (6G) of wireless networks is expected to surpass its predecessors by offering ubiquitous coverage through integrated air-ground facility deployments in both communication and computing domains. In this network, aerial facilities, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), conduct artificial intelligence (AI) computations based on multi-modal data to support diverse applications including surveillance and environment construction. However, these multi-domain inference and content generation tasks require large AI models, demanding powerful computing capabilities, thus posing significant challenges for UAVs. To tackle this problem, we propose an integrated edge-cloud model evolution framework, where UAVs serve as edge nodes for data collection and edge model computation. Through wireless channels, UAVs collaborate with ground cloud servers, providing cloud model computation and model updating for edge UAVs. With limited wireless communication bandwidth, the proposed framework faces the challenge of information exchange scheduling between the edge UAVs and the cloud server. To tackle this, we present joint task allocation, transmission resource allocation, transmission data quantization design, and edge model update design to enhance the inference accuracy of the integrated air-ground edge-cloud model evolution framework by mean average precision (mAP) maximization. A closed-form lower bound on the mAP of the proposed framework is derived, and the solution to the mAP maximization problem is optimized accordingly. Simulations, based on results from vision-based classification experiments, consistently demonstrate that the mAP of the proposed framework outperforms both a centralized cloud model framework and a distributed edge model framework across various communication bandwidths and data sizes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Time-series anomaly detection plays an important role in engineering processes, like development, manufacturing and other operations involving dynamic systems. These processes can greatly benefit from advances in the field, as state-of-the-art approaches may aid in cases involving, for example, highly dimensional data. To provide the reader with understanding of the terminology, this survey introduces a novel taxonomy where a distinction between online and offline, and training and inference is made. Additionally, it presents the most popular data sets and evaluation metrics used in the literature, as well as a detailed analysis. Furthermore, this survey provides an extensive overview of the state-of-the-art model-based online semi- and unsupervised anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time-series data, categorising them into different model families and other properties. The biggest research challenge revolves around benchmarking, as currently there is no reliable way to compare different approaches against one another. This problem is two-fold: on the one hand, public data sets suffers from at least one fundamental flaw, while on the other hand, there is a lack of intuitive and representative evaluation metrics in the field. Moreover, the way most publications choose a detection threshold disregards real-world conditions, which hinders the application in the real world. To allow for tangible advances in the field, these issues must be addressed in future work.

In this paper, we develop MT-Ladder, a novel model-agnostic and cost-effective tool to refine the performance of general LLMs for MT. MT-Ladder is trained on pseudo-refinement triplets which can be easily obtained from existing LLMs without additional human cost. During training, we propose a hierarchical fine-tuning strategy with an easy-to-hard schema, improving MT-Ladder's refining performance progressively. The trained MT-Ladder can be seamlessly integrated with any general-purpose LLMs to boost their translation performance. By utilizing Gemma-2B/7B as the backbone, MT-Ladder-2B can elevate raw translations to the level of top-tier open-source models (e.g., refining BigTranslate-13B with +6.91 BLEU and +3.52 COMET for XX-En), and MT-Ladder-7B can further enhance model performance to be on par with the state-of-the-art GPT-4. Extensive ablation and analysis corroborate the effectiveness of MT-Ladder in diverse settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/fzp0424/Ladder

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly contributed to the progress of the Text-to-SQL task. A common requirement in many of these works is the post-correction of SQL queries. However, the majority of this process entails analyzing error cases to develop prompts with rules that eliminate model bias. And there is an absence of execution verification for SQL queries. In addition, the prevalent techniques primarily depend on GPT-4 and few-shot prompts, resulting in expensive costs. To investigate the effective methods for SQL refinement in a cost-efficient manner, we introduce Semantic-Enhanced Text-to-SQL with Adaptive Refinement (SEA-SQL), which includes Adaptive Bias Elimination and Dynamic Execution Adjustment, aims to improve performance while minimizing resource expenditure with zero-shot prompts. Specifically, SEA-SQL employs a semantic-enhanced schema to augment database information and optimize SQL queries. During the SQL query generation, a fine-tuned adaptive bias eliminator is applied to mitigate inherent biases caused by the LLM. The dynamic execution adjustment is utilized to guarantee the executability of the bias eliminated SQL query. We conduct experiments on the Spider and BIRD datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework. The results demonstrate that SEA-SQL achieves state-of-the-art performance in the GPT3.5 scenario with 9%-58% of the generation cost. Furthermore, SEA-SQL is comparable to GPT-4 with only 0.9%-5.3% of the generation cost.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Spatio-temporal trajectories are crucial in various data mining tasks. It is important to develop a versatile trajectory learning method that performs different tasks with high accuracy. This involves effectively extracting two core aspects of information--movement patterns and travel purposes--from trajectories. However, this is challenging due to limitations in model capacity and the quality and scale of trajectory datasets. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have shown great success in versatility by training on large-scale, high-quality datasets. Given the similarities between trajectories and sentences, there's potential to leverage LLMs to develop an effective trajectory learning method. However, standard LLMs are not designed to handle the unique spatio-temporal features of trajectories and cannot extract movement patterns and travel purposes.   To address these challenges, we propose a model called TrajCogn that effectively utilizes LLMs to model trajectories. TrajCogn leverages the strengths of LLMs to create a versatile trajectory learning approach while addressing the limitations of standard LLMs. First, TrajCogn incorporates a novel trajectory semantic embedder that enables LLMs to process spatio-temporal features and extract movement patterns and travel purposes. Second, TrajCogn introduces a new trajectory prompt that integrates these patterns and purposes into LLMs, allowing the model to adapt to various tasks. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and two representative tasks demonstrate that TrajCogn successfully achieves its design goals.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We consider linear non-Gaussian structural equation models that involve latent confounding. In this setting, the causal structure is identifiable, but, in general, it is not possible to identify the specific causal effects. Instead, a finite number of different causal effects result in the same observational distribution. Most existing algorithms for identifying these causal effects use overcomplete independent component analysis (ICA), which often suffers from convergence to local optima. Furthermore, the number of latent variables must be known a priori. To address these issues, we propose an algorithm that operates recursively rather than using overcomplete ICA. The algorithm first infers a source, estimates the effect of the source and its latent parents on their descendants, and then eliminates their influence from the data. For both source identification and effect size estimation, we use rank conditions on matrices formed from higher-order cumulants. We prove asymptotic correctness under the mild assumption that locally, the number of latent variables never exceeds the number of observed variables. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to overcomplete ICA even though it does not know the number of latents in advance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in mathematical and commonsense reasoning tasks using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting techniques. But can they perform emotional reasoning by concatenating `Let's think step-by-step' to the input prompt? In this paper we investigate this question along with introducing a novel approach to zero-shot emotion detection and emotional reasoning using LLMs. Existing state of the art zero-shot approaches rely on textual entailment models to choose the most appropriate emotion label for an input text. We argue that this strongly restricts the model to a fixed set of labels which may not be suitable or sufficient for many applications where emotion analysis is required. Instead, we propose framing the problem of emotion analysis as a generative question-answering (QA) task. Our approach uses a two step methodology of generating relevant context or background knowledge to answer the emotion detection question step-by-step. Our paper is the first work on using a generative approach to jointly address the tasks of emotion detection and emotional reasoning for texts. We evaluate our approach on two popular emotion detection datasets and also release the fine-grained emotion labels and explanations for further training and fine-tuning of emotional reasoning systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented success in the field of natural language processing. However, the black-box nature of their internal mechanisms has brought many concerns about their trustworthiness and interpretability. Recent research has discovered a class of abnormal tokens in the model's vocabulary space and named them "glitch tokens". Those tokens, once included in the input, may induce the model to produce incorrect, irrelevant, or even harmful results, drastically undermining the reliability and practicality of LLMs.   In this work, we aim to enhance the understanding of glitch tokens and propose techniques for their detection and mitigation. We first reveal the characteristic features induced by glitch tokens on LLMs, which are evidenced by significant deviations in the distributions of attention patterns and dynamic information from intermediate model layers. Based on the insights, we develop GlitchProber, a tool for efficient glitch token detection and mitigation. GlitchProber utilizes small-scale sampling, principal component analysis for accelerated feature extraction, and a simple classifier for efficient vocabulary screening. Taking one step further, GlitchProber rectifies abnormal model intermediate layer values to mitigate the destructive effects of glitch tokens. Evaluated on five mainstream open-source LLMs, GlitchProber demonstrates higher efficiency, precision, and recall compared to existing approaches, with an average F1 score of 0.86 and an average repair rate of 50.06%. GlitchProber unveils a novel path to address the challenges posed by glitch tokens and inspires future research toward more robust and interpretable LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Task-oriented communications are an important element in future intelligent IoT systems. Existing IoT systems, however, are limited in their capacity to handle complex tasks, particularly in their interactions with humans to accomplish these tasks. In this paper, we present LLMind, an LLM-based task-oriented AI agent framework that enables effective collaboration among IoT devices, with humans communicating high-level verbal instructions, to perform complex tasks. Inspired by the functional specialization theory of the brain, our framework integrates an LLM with domain-specific AI modules, enhancing its capabilities. Complex tasks, which may involve collaborations of multiple domain-specific AI modules and IoT devices, are executed through a control script generated by the LLM using a Language-Code transformation approach, which first converts language descriptions to an intermediate finite-state machine (FSM) before final precise transformation to code. Furthermore, the framework incorporates a novel experience accumulation mechanism to enhance response speed and effectiveness, allowing the framework to evolve and become progressively sophisticated through continuing user and machine interactions.

To measure the success of our method, we study RSA+C3 in the collaborative referential game of Codenames Duet and show that our method successfully improves collaboration between simulated players of different cultures. Our contributions are threefold: (1) creating Codenames players using contrastive learning of an embedding space and LLM prompting that are aligned with human patterns of play, (2) studying culturally induced differences in common ground reflected in our trained models, and (3) demonstrating that our method RSA+C3 can ease cross-cultural communication in gameplay by inferring sociocultural context from interaction.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As human-machine interaction continues to evolve, the capacity for environmental perception is becoming increasingly crucial. Integrating the two most common types of sensory data, images, and point clouds, can enhance detection accuracy. Currently, there is no existing model capable of detecting an object's position in both point clouds and images while also determining their corresponding relationship. This information is invaluable for human-machine interactions, offering new possibilities for their enhancement. In light of this, this paper introduces an end-to-end Consistency Object Detection (COD) algorithm framework that requires only a single forward inference to simultaneously obtain an object's position in both point clouds and images and establish their correlation. Furthermore, to assess the accuracy of the object correlation between point clouds and images, this paper proposes a new evaluation metric, Consistency Precision (CP). To verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework, an extensive set of experiments has been conducted on the KITTI and DAIR-V2X datasets. The study also explored how the proposed consistency detection method performs on images when the calibration parameters between images and point clouds are disturbed, compared to existing post-processing methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits excellent detection performance and robustness, achieving end-to-end consistency detection. The source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/xifen523/COD.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automated code generation but typically excel only in simpler tasks such as generating standalone code units. Real-world software development, however, often involves complex code repositories (named repo) with complex dependencies and extensive documentation. To fill this gap, our research pivots towards evaluating LLMs in a more realistic setting -- real-world repo-level code generation. We introduce CodeAgentBench, a manually curated benchmark for repo-level code generation. This benchmark comprises five high-quality Python projects, encompassing a total of 101 samples. We assess nine leading LLMs on repo-level tasks and observe a decline in their performance. To tackle this, we present CodeAgent, a novel LLM-based agent framework that employs external tools for effective repo-level code generation. CodeAgent integrates five programming tools, enabling interaction with software artifacts for information retrieval, code symbol navigation, and code testing. We implement four agent strategies to optimize these tools' usage. Our experiments on CodeAgentBench show that CodeAgent enhances LLM performance significantly, with improvements ranging from 18.1\% to 250\%. Further tests on the HumanEval benchmark confirm CodeAgent's adaptability and efficacy across various code generation tasks. Notably, CodeAgent outperforms commercial products like Github Copilot, showcasing superior accuracy and efficiency. These results demonstrate CodeAgent's robust capabilities in code generation, highlighting its potential for real-world repo-level coding challenges.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Addressing the limitation of context length in large language models for code-related tasks is the primary focus of this paper. Existing LLMs are constrained by their pre-trained context lengths, leading to performance issues in handling long complex code sequences. Inspired by how human programmers navigate code, we introduce Hierarchical Rotary Position Embedding (HiRoPE), a novel approach that enhances the traditional rotary position embedding into a hierarchical format based on the hierarchical structure of source code. HiRoPE offers easy integration into existing LLMs without extra training costs. Our method is extensively evaluated with various LLMs, demonstrating stable performance in tasks such as language modeling and long code completion. We also introduce a new long code understanding task with real-world code projects, in hopes of promoting further development in this code-related field. Theoretically and experimentally, we find that HiRoPE also addresses the out-of-distribution issue in position encoding. Our HiRoPE significantly expands the context length capabilities of LLMs, enabling inference at lengths exponentially greater than the training length.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In-context learning (ICL) greatly improves the performance of large language models (LLMs) on various down-stream tasks, where the improvement highly depends on the quality of demonstrations. In this work, we introduce syntactic knowledge to select better in-context examples for machine translation (MT). We propose a new strategy, namely Syntax-augmented COverage-based In-context example selection (SCOI), leveraging the deep syntactic structure beyond conventional word matching. Specifically, we measure the set-level syntactic coverage by computing the coverage of polynomial terms with the help of a simplified tree-to-polynomial algorithm, and lexical coverage using word overlap. Furthermore, we devise an alternate selection approach to combine both coverage measures, taking advantage of syntactic and lexical information. We conduct experiments with two multi-lingual LLMs on six translation directions. Empirical results show that our proposed SCOI obtains the highest average COMET score among all learning-free methods, indicating that combining syntactic and lexical coverage successfully helps to select better in-context examples for MT.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a process where a large language model (LLM) retrieves useful information from a database and then generates the responses. It is becoming popular in enterprise settings for daily business operations. For example, Copilot for Microsoft 365 has accumulated millions of businesses. However, the security implications of adopting such RAG-based systems are unclear.   In this paper, we introduce ConfusedPilot, a class of security vulnerabilities of RAG systems that confuse Copilot and cause integrity and confidentiality violations in its responses. First, we investigate a vulnerability that embeds malicious text in the modified prompt in RAG, corrupting the responses generated by the LLM. Second, we demonstrate a vulnerability that leaks secret data, which leverages the caching mechanism during retrieval. Third, we investigate how both vulnerabilities can be exploited to propagate misinformation within the enterprise and ultimately impact its operations, such as sales and manufacturing. We also discuss the root cause of these attacks by investigating the architecture of a RAG-based system. This study highlights the security vulnerabilities in today's RAG-based systems and proposes design guidelines to secure future RAG-based systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This study utilizes the advanced capabilities of the GPT-4 multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) to explore its potential in iris recognition - a field less common and more specialized than face recognition. By focusing on this niche yet crucial area, we investigate how well AI tools like ChatGPT can understand and analyze iris images. Through a series of meticulously designed experiments employing a zero-shot learning approach, the capabilities of ChatGPT-4 was assessed across various challenging conditions including diverse datasets, presentation attacks, occlusions such as glasses, and other real-world variations. The findings convey ChatGPT-4's remarkable adaptability and precision, revealing its proficiency in identifying distinctive iris features, while also detecting subtle effects like makeup on iris recognition. A comparative analysis with Gemini Advanced - Google's AI model - highlighted ChatGPT-4's better performance and user experience in complex iris analysis tasks. This research not only validates the use of LLMs for specialized biometric applications but also emphasizes the importance of nuanced query framing and interaction design in extracting significant insights from biometric data. Our findings suggest a promising path for future research and the development of more adaptable, efficient, robust and interactive biometric security solutions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This research examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in predicting time series, with a specific focus on the LLMTIME model. Despite the established effectiveness of LLMs in tasks such as text generation, language translation, and sentiment analysis, this study highlights the key challenges that large language models encounter in the context of time series prediction. We assess the performance of LLMTIME across multiple datasets and introduce classical almost periodic functions as time series to gauge its effectiveness. The empirical results indicate that while large language models can perform well in zero-shot forecasting for certain datasets, their predictive accuracy diminishes notably when confronted with diverse time series data and traditional signals. The primary finding of this study is that the predictive capacity of LLMTIME, similar to other LLMs, significantly deteriorates when dealing with time series data that contain both periodic and trend components, as well as when the signal comprises complex frequency components.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce a nested family of Bayesian nonparametric models for network and interaction data with a hierarchical granularity structure that naturally arises through finer and coarser population labelings. In the case of network data, the structure is easily visualized by merging and shattering vertices, while respecting the edge structure. We further develop Bayesian inference procedures for the model family, and apply them to synthetic and real data. The family provides a connection of practical and theoretical interest between the Hollywood model of Crane and Dempsey, and the generalized-gamma graphex model of Caron and Fox. A key ingredient for the construction of the family is fragmentation and coagulation duality for integer partitions, and for this we develop novel duality relations that generalize those of Pitman and Dong, Goldschmidt and Martin. The duality is also crucially used in our inferential procedures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Instruction-tuning is a widely adopted finetuning method that enables large language models (LLMs) to generate output that more closely resembles human responses. However, no studies have shown that instruction-tuning actually teaches LLMs to process language in a similar manner as humans. We investigate the effect of instruction-tuning on aligning LLM and human language processing mechanisms in two ways: (1) brain alignment, the similarity of LLM internal representations to neural activity in the human language system, and (2) behavioral alignment, the similarity of LLM and human behavior on a reading task. We assess 25 vanilla and instruction-tuned LLMs on three datasets involving humans reading naturalistic stories and sentences, and find that instruction-tuning generally enhances brain alignment (~6%), but has no similar effect on behavioral alignment. To identify factors underlying this improvement in brain alignment, we compute correlations between brain alignment and various LLM properties, such as model size, problem-solving, and world knowledge understanding. Notably, we find a strong positive correlation between brain alignment and model size (r = 0.95), as well as performance on tasks requiring world knowledge (r = 0.81). Our results demonstrate that instruction-tuning LLMs improves both world knowledge representations and brain alignment, suggesting that the mechanisms that encode world knowledge in LLMs also improve representational alignment to the human brain.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Segment Anything Model (SAM) has attracted widespread attention for its superior interactive segmentation capabilities with visual prompts while lacking further exploration of text prompts. In this paper, we empirically investigate what text prompt encoders (e.g., CLIP or LLM) are good for adapting SAM for referring expression segmentation and introduce the Early Vision-language Fusion-based SAM (EVF-SAM). EVF-SAM is a simple yet effective referring segmentation method which exploits multimodal prompts (i.e., image and text) and comprises a pre-trained vision-language model to generate referring prompts and a SAM model for segmentation. Surprisingly, we observe that: (1) multimodal prompts and (2) vision-language models with early fusion (e.g., BEIT-3) are beneficial for prompting SAM for accurate referring segmentation. Our experiments show that the proposed EVF-SAM based on BEIT-3 can obtain state-of-the-art performance on RefCOCO/+/g for referring expression segmentation and demonstrate the superiority of prompting SAM with early vision-language fusion. In addition, the proposed EVF-SAM with 1.32B parameters achieves remarkably higher performance while reducing nearly 82% of parameters compared to previous SAM methods based on large multimodal models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern deep neural networks, particularly recent large language models, come with massive model sizes that require significant computational and storage resources. To enable the deployment of modern models on resource-constrained environments and accelerate inference time, researchers have increasingly explored pruning techniques as a popular research direction in neural network compression. However, there is a dearth of up-to-date comprehensive review papers on pruning. To address this issue, in this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing research works on deep neural network pruning in a taxonomy of 1) universal/specific speedup, 2) when to prune, 3) how to prune, and 4) fusion of pruning and other compression techniques. We then provide a thorough comparative analysis of eight pairs of contrast settings for pruning and explore emerging topics, including pruning for large language models, large multimodal models, post-training pruning, and different supervision levels for pruning to shed light on the commonalities and differences of existing methods and lay the foundation for further method development. To facilitate future research, we build a curated collection of datasets, networks, and evaluations on different applications. Finally, we provide valuable recommendations on selecting pruning methods and prospect several promising research directions. We build a repository at https://github.com/hrcheng1066/awesome-pruning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this work, we report our efforts to advance the standard operation procedure of developing Large Language Models (LLMs) or LLMs-based systems or services in industry. We introduce the concept of Large Language Model Development Lifecycle (LDLC) and then highlight the importance of consistency test in ensuring the delivery quality. The principled solution of consistency test, however, is usually overlooked by industrial practitioners and not urgent in academia, and current practical solutions are insufficiently rigours and labor-intensive. We thus propose a simple yet effective consistency test protocol, named SimCT. SimCT is mainly to proactively check the consistency across different development stages of "bare metal" LLMs or associated services without accessing the model artifacts, in an attempt to expedite the delivery by reducing the back-and-forth alignment communications among multiple teams involved in different development stages.   Specifically, SimCT encompasses response-wise and model-wise tests. We implement the protocol with LightGBM and Student's t-test for two components respectively, and perform extensive experiments to substantiate the effectiveness of SimCT and the involved components.

In this article, we explore the transformative potential of GAI in next-generation Wi-Fi networks, exploiting its advanced capabilities to address key challenges and improve overall network performance. We begin by reviewing the development of major Wi-Fi generations and illustrating the challenges that future Wi-Fi networks may encounter. We then introduce typical GAI models and detail their potential capabilities in Wi-Fi network optimization, performance enhancement, and other applications. Furthermore, we present a case study wherein we propose a retrieval-augmented LLM (RA-LLM)-enabled Wi-Fi design framework that aids in problem formulation, which is subsequently solved using a generative diffusion model (GDM)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to optimize various network parameters. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in high-density deployment scenarios. Finally, we provide some potential future research directions for GAI-assisted Wi-Fi networks.

  Clinical-Grade Lumen Segmentation in Intravascular Ultrasound</h2>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Precisely estimating lumen boundaries in intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is needed for sizing interventional stents to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Unfortunately, current segmentation networks like the UNet lack the precision needed for clinical adoption in IVUS workflows. This arises due to the difficulty of automatically learning accurate lumen contour from limited training data while accounting for the radial geometry of IVUS imaging. We propose the Geo-UNet framework to address these issues via a design informed by the geometry of the lumen contour segmentation task. We first convert the input data and segmentation targets from Cartesian to polar coordinates. Starting from a convUNet feature extractor, we propose a two-task setup, one for conventional pixel-wise labeling and the other for single boundary lumen-contour localization. We directly combine the two predictions by passing the predicted lumen contour through a new activation (named CDFeLU) to filter out spurious pixel-wise predictions. Our unified loss function carefully balances area-based, distance-based, and contour-based penalties to provide near clinical-grade generalization in unseen patient data. We also introduce a lightweight, inference-time technique to enhance segmentation smoothness. The efficacy of our framework on a venous IVUS dataset is shown against state-of-the-art models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Motivated by the emergent reasoning capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) and its potential to improve the comprehensibility of autonomous driving systems, this paper introduces a closed-loop autonomous driving controller called VLM-MPC, which combines a VLM for high-level decision-making and a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) for low-level vehicle control. The proposed VLM-MPC system is structurally divided into two asynchronous components: an upper-level VLM and a lower-level MPC. The upper layer VLM generates driving parameters for lower-level control based on front camera images, ego vehicle state, traffic environment conditions, and reference memory. The lower-level MPC controls the vehicle in real-time using these parameters, considering engine lag and providing state feedback to the entire system. Experiments based on the nuScenes dataset validated the effectiveness of the proposed VLM-MPC system across various scenarios (e.g., night, rain, intersections). Results showed that the VLM-MPC system consistently outperformed baseline models in terms of safety and driving comfort. By comparing behaviors under different weather conditions and scenarios, we demonstrated the VLM's ability to understand the environment and make reasonable inferences.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose using natural language outlines as a novel modality and interaction surface for providing AI assistance to developers throughout the software development process. An NL outline for a code function comprises multiple statements written in concise prose, which partition the code and summarize its main ideas in the style of literate programming. Crucially, we find that modern LLMs can generate accurate and high-quality NL outlines in practice. Moreover, NL outlines enable a bidirectional sync between code and NL, allowing changes in one to be automatically reflected in the other. We discuss many use cases for NL outlines: they can accelerate understanding and navigation of code and diffs, simplify code maintenance, augment code search, steer code generation, and more. We then propose and compare multiple LLM prompting techniques for generating outlines and ask professional developers to judge outline quality. Finally, we present two case studies applying NL outlines toward code review and the difficult task of malware detection.
