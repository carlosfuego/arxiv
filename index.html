                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The principal component of conventional database query optimizers is a cost model that is used to estimate expected performance of query plans. The accuracy of the cost model has direct impact on the optimality of execution plans selected by the optimizer and thus, on the resulting query latency. Several common parameters of cost models in modern DBMS are related to the performance of CPU and I/O and are typically set by a database administrator upon system tuning. However these performance characteristics are not stable and therefore, a single point estimation may not suffice for all DB load regimes. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Cost Model (ACM) which dynamically optimizes CPU- and I/O-related plan cost parameters at DB runtime. By continuously monitoring query execution statistics and the state of DB buffer cache ACM adjusts cost parameters without the need for manual intervention from a database administrator. This allows for responding to changes in the workload and system performance ensuring more optimal query execution plans. We describe the main ideas in the implementation of ACM and report on a preliminary experimental evaluation showing 20\% end-to-end latency improvement on TPC-H benchmark.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Fault ride-through capability studies of MMC-HVDC connected wind power plants have focused primarily on the DC link and onshore AC grid faults. Offshore AC faults, mainly asymmetrical faults have not gained much attention in the literature despite being included in the future development at national levels in the ENTSO-E HVDC code. The proposed work gives an event-triggered control to stabilize the system once the offshore AC fault has occurred, identified, and isolated. Different types of control actions such as proportional-integral (PI) controller and super-twisted sliding mode control (STSMC) are used to smoothly transition the post-fault system to a new steady state operating point by suppressing the negative sequence control. Initially, the effect of a negative sequence current control scheme on the transient behavior of the power system with a PI controller is discussed in this paper. Further, a non-linear control strategy (STSMC) is proposed which gives quicker convergence of the system post-fault in comparison to PI control action. These post-fault control operations are only triggered in the presence of a fault in the system, i.e., they are event-triggered. The validity of the proposed strategy is demonstrated by simulation on a $\pm$525 kV, three-terminal meshed MMC-HVDC system model in Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce Block-Attention, an attention mechanism designed to address the increased inference latency and cost in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios. Unlike existing works that encodes the whole context, its main idea lies in dividing the retrieved documents into blocks, where each block calculates key-value (KV) states independently except for the final block. In RAG scenarios, by defining each passage as a block, Block-Attention enables us to pre-compute the KV states for all passages and cache them in memory, significantly reducing the latency and the computation cost during inference. The implementation involves block segmentation, positional encoding calculation, and fine-tuning the LLM to adapt to the Block-Attention mechanism. Experiments on four RAG benchmarks demonstrate that after block fine-tuning, the Block Attention model can achieve performance comparable to (68.4\% vs 67.9\% on Llama3) or even better (62.8\% vs 59.6\% on Mistral) than self-attention models. Notably, Block-Attention reduces the TTFT (the time to first token) and FLOPs (floating point operations) to a very low level. It only takes 45 ms to output the first token for an input sequence with a total length of 32K. Compared with the self-attention model, the time consumption and corresponding FLOPs are reduced by 98.7\% and 99.8\%, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Model quantization has become a crucial technique to address the issues of large memory consumption and long inference times associated with LLMs. Mixed-precision quantization, which distinguishes between important and unimportant parameters, stands out among numerous quantization schemes as it achieves a balance between precision and compression rate. However, existing approaches can only identify important parameters through qualitative analysis and manual experiments without quantitatively analyzing how their importance is determined. We propose a new criterion, so-called 'precision alignment', to build a quantitative framework to holistically evaluate the importance of parameters in mixed-precision quantization. Our observations on floating point addition under various real-world scenarios suggest that two addends should have identical precision, otherwise the information in the higher-precision number will be wasted. Such an observation offers an essential principle to determine the precision of each parameter in matrix multiplication operation. As the first step towards applying the above discovery to large model inference, we develop a dynamic KV-Cache quantization technique to effectively reduce memory access latency. Different from existing quantization approaches that focus on memory saving, this work directly aims to accelerate LLM inference through quantifying floating numbers. The proposed technique attains a 25% saving of memory access and delivers up to 1.3x speedup in the computation of attention in the decoding phase of LLM, with almost no loss of precision.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Memory disaggregation is an emerging data center architecture that improves resource utilization and scalability. Replication is key to ensure the fault tolerance of applications, but replicating shared data in disaggregated memory is hard. We propose SWARM (Swift WAit-free Replication in disaggregated Memory), the first replication scheme for in-disaggregated-memory shared objects to provide (1) single-roundtrip reads and writes in the common case, (2) strong consistency (linearizability), and (3) strong liveness (wait-freedom). SWARM makes two independent contributions. The first is Safe-Guess, a novel wait-free replication protocol with single-roundtrip operations. The second is In-n-Out, a novel technique to provide conditional atomic update and atomic retrieval of large buffers in disaggregated memory in one roundtrip. Using SWARM, we build SWARM-KV, a low-latency, strongly consistent and highly available disaggregated key-value store. We evaluate SWARM-KV and find that it has marginal latency overhead compared to an unreplicated key-value store, and that it offers much lower latency and better availability than FUSEE, a state-of-the-art replicated disaggregated key-value store.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As the United Kingdom wind fleet increases in size, wind lulls and slews will increasingly challenge the stability of its electricity system. The paper describes the use of models based on real time records and including solar slews, to investigate the most extreme wind variations likely to be encountered in future, enabling strategies to be devised to mitigate them. Wind lulls are surprisingly frequent, occasionally lasting a week or more, and are always likely to be beyond the capabilities of stored or imported electrical energy to mitigate them. The models indicate that there will be a continuing need for gas powered generation to mitigate wind lulls. Currently, Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGTs) provide most of the dispatchable generation. However, CCGTs are not sufficiently fast acting to cope with the wind and solar slews anticipated in future. The paper suggests that a range of already proven fast-acting sources of dispatchable generation, including Open Cycle Gas Turbines (OCGTs), Internal Combustion Gas-Fired Reciprocating engines (ICGRs) and stored electrical energy systems, should be capable of coping with the largest wind and solar slews likely to be encountered up to the year 2035. Examples are given of the recent introduction of these fast-acting sources of generation which, it is suggested, will progressively replace CCGTs as the wind and solar fleets increase in size. Moreover, we see the pattern of recent investments, summarised in the paper, as a good indication of likely future investments, with OCGT investments mainly serving the 440 kV grid, and ICGRs and stored electrical energy more local networks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Bicameral Cache is a cache organization proposal for a vector architecture that segregates data according to their access type, distinguishing scalar from vector references. Its aim is to avoid both types of references from interfering in each other's data locality, with a special focus on prioritizing the performance on vector references. The proposed system incorporates an additional, non-polluting prefetching mechanism to help populate the long vector cache lines in advance to increase the hit rate by further exploiting the spatial locality on vector data. Its evaluation was conducted on the Cavatools simulator, comparing the performance to a standard conventional cache, over different typical vector benchmarks for several vector lengths. The results proved the proposed cache speeds up performance on stride-1 vector benchmarks, while hardly impacting non-stride-1's. In addition, the prefetching feature consistently provided an additional value.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have limitations in handling tasks that require real-time access to external APIs. While several benchmarks like ToolBench and APIGen have been developed to assess LLMs' API-use capabilities, they often suffer from issues such as lack of generalizability, limited multi-step reasoning coverage, and instability due to real-time API fluctuations. In this paper, we introduce SEAL, an end-to-end testbed designed to evaluate LLMs in real-world API usage. SEAL standardizes existing benchmarks, integrates an agent system for testing API retrieval and planning, and addresses the instability of real-time APIs by introducing a GPT-4-powered API simulator with caching for deterministic evaluations. Our testbed provides a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that covers API retrieval, API calls, and final responses, offering a reliable framework for structured performance comparison in diverse real-world scenarios. SEAL is publicly available, with ongoing updates for new benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) across various applications has led to a significant shift in the design of deep learning serving systems. Deploying LLMs, particularly in multi-tenant environments, poses substantial challenges due to their high computational and memory demands. We introduce BlockLLM, a serving system that leverages component sharing among fine-tuned LLM models to provide an efficient and flexible solution for LLM workloads. BlockLLM partitions models into finer-grained blocks, enabling the reuse of model components and independent provisioning to improve computation efficiency. BlockLLM comprises an offline block zoo for storing blocks and an online system to serve requests through chains of blocks. It offers multi-fold flexibilities: (1) Adaptive assembly of blocks on-the-fly through equivalence evaluation among blocks in the zoo; (2) Per-block batch size configuration and best-effort KV cache coordination at the individual block level; (3) Speculative execution and locality-aware block placement to reduce communication costs from dynamic block resource allocation. Our evaluation shows that BlockLLM reduces memory and storage footprints and improves computational efficiency, outperforming existing serving approach in 95%ile latency and GPU utilization by 33.5% and 20.1%, respectively, with minimal impact on accuracy

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In real-world software engineering tasks, solving a problem often requires understanding and modifying multiple functions, classes, and files across a large codebase. Therefore, on the repository level, it is crucial to extract the relevant information to achieve accurate code completion effectively. Existing code completion tools have achieved some success, but they struggle to optimize the retrieval and generation process dynamically. In this paper, we propose RepoGenReflex, a generic, dynamic, effective framework to address this challenge. By leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhanced with Verbal Reinforcement Learning (VRL), it can dynamically choose the optimal results for repository-level code completion. RepoGenReflex uses Reflector to give directional feedback to the next loop. RepoGenReflex chooses the optimal results stored in the Experience cache based on the RAG-VRL loop. To validate the framework's generalization ability, we propose a new benchmark RepoGenEval, which consists of the latest, high-quality real-world repositories in line completion scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that RepoGenReflex achieves significant improvements after optimizing the Reflector component, resulting in enhanced accuracy and relevance of code completions. Additionally, RepoGenReflex consistently demonstrates superior performance and effectiveness across standard code completion tasks, highlighting the robustness and adaptability of our framework.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in serving as the foundation for AI assistants. One emerging application of LLMs, navigating through websites and interacting with UI elements across various web pages, remains somewhat underexplored. We introduce Steward, a novel LLM-powered web automation tool designed to serve as a cost-effective, scalable, end-to-end solution for automating web interactions. Traditional browser automation frameworks like Selenium, Puppeteer, and Playwright are not scalable for extensive web interaction tasks, such as studying recommendation algorithms on platforms like YouTube and Twitter. These frameworks require manual coding of interactions, limiting their utility in large-scale or dynamic contexts. Steward addresses these limitations by integrating LLM capabilities with browser automation, allowing for natural language-driven interaction with websites. Steward operates by receiving natural language instructions and reactively planning and executing a sequence of actions on websites, looping until completion, making it a practical tool for developers and researchers to use. It achieves high efficiency, completing actions in 8.52 to 10.14 seconds at a cost of $0.028 per action or an average of $0.18 per task, which is further reduced to 4.8 seconds and $0.022 through a caching mechanism. It runs tasks on real websites with a 40% completion success rate. We discuss various design and implementation challenges, including state representation, action sequence selection, system responsiveness, detecting task completion, and caching implementation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Long-sequence generative large-language model (LLM) applications have become increasingly popular. In this paper, through trace-based experiments, we found that the existing method for long sequences results in a high Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) due to sequential chunk processing, long Time-Between-Tokens (TBT) from batching long-sequence prefills and decodes, and low throughput due to constrained key-value cache (KVC) for long sequences. To address these issues, we propose two Sequence-Parallelism (SP) architectures for both tensor parallelism (TP) and non-TP. However, SP introduces two challenges: 1) network communication and computation become performance bottlenecks; 2) the latter two issues above are mitigated but not resolved, and SP's resultant KV value distribution across GPUs still requires communication for decode, increasing TBT. Hence, we propose a Communication-efficient Sparse Attention (CSA) and communication-computation-communication three-phase pipelining. We also propose SP-based decode that processes decode separately from prefill, distributes KV values of a request across different GPUs, and novelly moves Query (Q) values instead of KV values to reduce communication overhead. These methods constitute a communication-efficient Sequence-Parallelism based LLM Serving System (SPS2). Our trace-driven evaluation demonstrates that SPS2 improves the average TTFT, TBT, and response time by up to 7.5x, 1.92x, and 9.8x and improves the prefill and decode throughput by 8.2x and 5.2x while maintaining the accuracy compared to Sarathi-Serve. We distributed our source code.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The size of the key-value (KV) cache plays a critical role in determining both the maximum context length and the number of concurrent requests supported during inference in modern language models. The KV cache size grows proportionally with the number of attention heads and the tokens processed, leading to increased memory consumption and slower inference for long inputs. In this work, we explore the use of MixAttention, a model architecture modification closely related to a blog published by Character.AI. MixAttention combines sliding window attention, where only a small subset of recent tokens is stored in the KV cache, with KV cache sharing across layers. Our experiments demonstrate that MixAttention significantly reduces memory usage and improves inference speed without sacrificing model performance in both short and long-context tasks. We also explore various configurations of this architecture, identifying those that maintain quality across evaluation metrics while optimizing resource efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) applications in JavaScript environment have become increasingly popular. As the infrastructure for DL applications, JavaScript DL frameworks play a crucial role in the development and deployment. It is essential to ensure the quality of JavaScript DL frameworks. However, the bottleneck of limited computational resources in the JavaScript environment brings new challenges to framework testing. Specifically, JavaScript DL frameworks are equipped with various optimization mechanisms (e.g., cache reuse, inference acceleration) to overcome the bottleneck of limited computational resources. These optimization mechanisms are overlooked by existing methods, resulting in many bugs in JavaScript DL frameworks being missed. To address the above challenges, we propose a mutation-based JavaScript DL framework testing method named DLJSFuzzer. DLJSFuzzer designs 13 tensor mutation rules targeting the cache reuse mechanism to generate test input tensors. Besides, DLJSFuzzer designs eight model mutation rules targeting the inference acceleration mechanism to generate test input models. To evaluate the effectiveness of DLJSFuzzer, we conduct experiments on the most widely-used JavaScript DL framework, TensorFlow.js. The experimental results show that DLJSFuzzer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and efficiency. DLJSFuzzer successfully detects 21 unique crashes and 126 unique NaN & Inconsistency bugs. All detected crashes have been reported to the open-source community, with 12 of them already confirmed by developers. Additionally, DLJSFuzzer has improved by over 47% in model generation efficiency and over 91% in bug detection efficiency compared to all baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) integrates computer vision and natural language processing techniques, offering substantial application potential. However, these models demand extensive resources during inference. Adaptive attention techniques can dynamically reduce computational redundancy and thus improve efficiency. Although current adaptive attention methods significantly reduce the memory requirements of Transformer-based language models, they are not tailored for LVLMs. We observe that LVLMs generate responses from both remote image tokens and local text tokens, and different modalities have different attention patterns. This observation inspires us to manage the attention for each modality separately. Specifically, for visual input, we store the cache of potentially useful information but only compute the most critical parts. For language input, we care more about local information. Based on our observation and analysis of vision-language attention patterns, we develop A-VL, a plug-and-play adaptive attention tailored for LVLM inference. Extensive evaluations on three vision-language tasks and five datasets show the effectiveness of our designs. Our approach A-VL outperforms existing adaptive attention methods in reducing memory usage and computational load without compromising performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models have achieved notable success across various domains, yet efficient inference is still limited by the quadratic computation complexity of the attention mechanism. The inference consists of prefilling and decoding phases. Although several attempts have been made to accelerate decoding, the inefficiency of the prefilling phase, especially for long-context tasks, remains a challenge. In this paper, we observe a locality in query criticality during the prefilling phase of long-context processing: adjacent query tokens tend to focus on similar subsets of the past Key-Value (KV) cache. Based on this observation, we propose CritiPrefill, a criticality-based segment-wise prefilling method. This method partitions the input sequence's queries and KV cache into segments and blocks, utilizing a segment-wise algorithm to estimate the query criticality. By pruning non-critical computations between query segments and cache blocks in the self-attention mechanism, the prefilling process can be significantly accelerated. Extensive evaluations on multiple long-context datasets show up to 2.7x speedup on Llama3-8B and 3.0x speedup on Yi-9B for 128K context length on a single A100 GPU, with minimal quality degradation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, 3D SSDs are widely adopted in PCs, data centers, and cloud storage systems. To increase capacity, high bit-density cells, such as Triple-Level Cell (TLC), are utilized within 3D SSDs. However, due to the inferior performance of TLC, a portion of TLCs is configured to operate as Single-Level Cell (SLC) to provide high performance, with host data initially directed to the SLCs. In SLC/TLC hybrid 3D SSDs, a portion of the TLC space is designated as an SLC cache to achieve high SSD performance by writing host data at the SLC speed. Given the limited size of the SLC cache, block reclamation is necessary to free up the SLC cache during idle periods. However, our preliminary studies indicate that the SLC cache can lead to a performance cliff if filled rapidly and cause significant write amplification when data migration occurs during idle times.   In this work, we propose leveraging a reprogram operation to address these challenges. Specifically, when the SLC cache is full or during idle periods, a reprogram operation is performed to switch used SLC pages to TLC pages in place (termed In-place Switch, IPS). Subsequently, other free TLC space is allocated as the new SLC cache. IPS can continuously provide sufficient SLC cache within SSDs, significantly improving write performance and reducing write amplification. Experimental results demonstrate that IPS can reduce write latency and write amplification by up to 0.75 times and 0.53 times, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art SLC cache technologies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Coded caching in a wireless device-to-device (D2D) network was first studied by Ji \textit{et al.} in [4] (referred to as the JCM scheme). In a D2D network, a central server first places the data in the user cache memories and all the user's demands are served by inter-user coded multicast transmissions. Low subpacketization level D2D coded caching schemes are desirable for practical implementations. Wang \textit{et al.} in [7] proposed an array called D2D placement delivery array (DPDA) which characterizes the placement phase and the delivery phase in a D2D network. A lower bound on the transmission load of a DPDA is derived and only the JCM scheme achieves this lower bound, but requires a subpacketization level that grows exponentially with the number of users. Low subpacketization level D2D schemes can be obtained by constructing appropriate DPDAs. In this paper, we propose two new classes of DPDA constructions that give low subpacketization level D2D schemes using cross resolvable designs. The first class of constructed DPDA achieves the known lower bound on the transmission load of DPDA while requiring a subpacketization level lesser than that of the JCM scheme. We propose another lower bound on the transmission load of a DPDA and show that the second class of constructed DPDA achieves this lower bound.

Here, we report the development of such a nanosensor capable of detecting electric fields with a submillisecond response time at the single particle level. We achieve this by using ferroelectric nanocrystals doped with rare earth ions producing upconversion (UC). When such a nanocrystal experiences a variation of surrounding electric potential, its surface charge density changes, inducing electric polarization modifications that vary, via converse piezoelectric effect, the crystal field around the ions. The latter variation is finally converted into UC spectral changes, enabling optical detection of electric potential. To develop such a sensor, we synthesized erbium and ytterbium-doped barium titanate crystals of size $\approx160$~nm. We observed distinct changes in the UC spectrum when individual nanocrystals were subjected to an external field via a conductive AFM tip, with a response time of 100~$\mu$s. Furthermore, our sensor exhibits a remarkable sensitivity of 4.8~kV/cm/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$, enabling time-resolved detection of fast changing electric field of amplitude comparable to that generated during a neuron action potential.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to process long-context tasks. However, the large memory overhead of the key-value (KV) cache poses significant challenges in long-context scenarios. Existing training-free KV cache compression methods typically focus on quantization and token pruning, which have compression limits, and excessive sparsity can lead to severe performance degradation. Other methods design new architectures with less KV overhead but require significant training overhead. To address the above two drawbacks, we further explore the redundancy in the channel dimension and apply an architecture-level design with minor training costs. Therefore, we introduce CSKV, a training-efficient Channel Shrinking technique for KV cache compression: (1) We first analyze the singular value distribution of the KV cache, revealing significant redundancy and compression potential along the channel dimension. Based on this observation, we propose using low-rank decomposition for key and value layers and storing the low-dimension features. (2) To preserve model performance, we introduce a bi-branch KV cache, including a window-based full-precision KV cache and a low-precision compressed KV cache. (3) To reduce the training costs, we minimize the layer-wise reconstruction loss for the compressed KV cache instead of retraining the entire LLMs. Extensive experiments show that CSKV can reduce the memory overhead of the KV cache by 80% while maintaining the model's long-context capability. Moreover, we show that our method can be seamlessly combined with quantization to further reduce the memory overhead, achieving a compression ratio of up to 95%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is often hindered by the extensive memory requirements of the Key-Value (KV) cache, especially as context lengths increase. Existing approaches to reduce the KV cache size involve either fine-tuning the model to learn a compression strategy or leveraging attention scores to reduce the sequence length. We analyse the attention distributions in decoder-only Transformers-based models and observe that attention allocation patterns stay consistent across most layers. Surprisingly, we find a clear correlation between the $L_2$ and the attention scores over cached KV pairs, where a low $L_2$ of a key embedding usually leads to a high attention score during decoding. This finding indicates that the influence of a KV pair is potentially determined by the key embedding itself before being queried. Based on this observation, we compress the KV cache based on the $L_2$ of key embeddings. Our experimental results show that this simple strategy can reduce the KV cache size by 50% on language modelling and needle-in-a-haystack tasks and 90% on passkey retrieval tasks without losing accuracy. Moreover, without relying on the attention scores, this approach remains compatible with FlashAttention, enabling broader applicability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Most datacenter transport protocols traditionally depend on in-order packet delivery, a legacy design choice that prioritizes simplicity. However, technological advancements, such as RDMA, now enable the relaxation of this requirement, allowing for more efficient utilization of modern datacenter topologies like FatTree and Dragonfly. With the growing prevalence of AI/ML workloads, the demand for improved link utilization has intensified, creating challenges for single-path load balancers due to problems like ECMP collisions. In this paper, we present ARCANE, a novel, adaptive per-packet traffic load-balancing algorithm designed to work seamlessly with existing congestion control mechanisms. ARCANE dynamically routes packets to bypass congested areas and network failures, all while maintaining a lightweight footprint with minimal state requirements. Our evaluation shows that ARCANE delivers significant performance gains over traditional load-balancing methods, including packet spraying and other advanced solutions, substantially enhancing both performance and link utilization in modern datacenter networks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a process where a large language model (LLM) retrieves useful information from a database and then generates the responses. It is becoming popular in enterprise settings for daily business operations. For example, Copilot for Microsoft 365 has accumulated millions of businesses. However, the security implications of adopting such RAG-based systems are unclear.   In this paper, we introduce ConfusedPilot, a class of security vulnerabilities of RAG systems that confuse Copilot and cause integrity and confidentiality violations in its responses. First, we investigate a vulnerability that embeds malicious text in the modified prompt in RAG, corrupting the responses generated by the LLM. Second, we demonstrate a vulnerability that leaks secret data, which leverages the caching mechanism during retrieval. Third, we investigate how both vulnerabilities can be exploited to propagate misinformation within the enterprise and ultimately impact its operations, such as sales and manufacturing. We also discuss the root cause of these attacks by investigating the architecture of a RAG-based system. This study highlights the security vulnerabilities in today's RAG-based systems and proposes design guidelines to secure future RAG-based systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern recommender systems are built upon computation-intensive infrastructure, and it is challenging to perform real-time computation for each request, especially in peak periods, due to the limited computational resources. Recommending by user-wise result caches is widely used when the system cannot afford a real-time recommendation. However, it is challenging to allocate real-time and cached recommendations to maximize the users' overall engagement. This paper shows two key challenges to cache allocation, i.e., the value-strategy dependency and the streaming allocation. Then, we propose a reinforcement prediction-allocation framework (RPAF) to address these issues. RPAF is a reinforcement-learning-based two-stage framework containing prediction and allocation stages. The prediction stage estimates the values of the cache choices considering the value-strategy dependency, and the allocation stage determines the cache choices for each individual request while satisfying the global budget constraint. We show that the challenge of training RPAF includes globality and the strictness of budget constraints, and a relaxed local allocator (RLA) is proposed to address this issue. Moreover, a PoolRank algorithm is used in the allocation stage to deal with the streaming allocation problem. Experiments show that RPAF significantly improves users' engagement under computational budget constraints.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present 3DGS-LM, a new method that accelerates the reconstruction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by replacing its ADAM optimizer with a tailored Levenberg-Marquardt (LM). Existing methods reduce the optimization time by decreasing the number of Gaussians or by improving the implementation of the differentiable rasterizer. However, they still rely on the ADAM optimizer to fit Gaussian parameters of a scene in thousands of iterations, which can take up to an hour. To this end, we change the optimizer to LM that runs in conjunction with the 3DGS differentiable rasterizer. For efficient GPU parallization, we propose a caching data structure for intermediate gradients that allows us to efficiently calculate Jacobian-vector products in custom CUDA kernels. In every LM iteration, we calculate update directions from multiple image subsets using these kernels and combine them in a weighted mean. Overall, our method is 30% faster than the original 3DGS while obtaining the same reconstruction quality. Our optimization is also agnostic to other methods that acclerate 3DGS, thus enabling even faster speedups compared to vanilla 3DGS.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Speculative sampling is a promising approach to accelerate the decoding stage for Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent advancements that leverage target LLM's contextual information, such as hidden states and KV cache, have shown significant practical improvements. However, these approaches suffer from inconsistent context between training and decoding. We also observe another discrepancy between the training and decoding objectives in existing speculative sampling methods. In this work, we propose a solution named HArmonized Speculative Sampling (HASS) that learns harmonized representations to address these issues. HASS accelerates the decoding stage without adding inference overhead through harmonized objective distillation and harmonized context alignment. Experiments on four LLaMA models demonstrate that HASS achieves 2.81x-4.05x wall-clock time speedup ratio averaging across three datasets, surpassing EAGLE-2 by 8%-20%.

We introduce a caching policy based on the Follow-The-Perturbed-Leader principle and show that for any time horizon T and any request sequence, it achieves a sub-linear regret of \mathcal{O}(\sqrt(T) ) with respect to an oracle that knows the request sequence beforehand. Our study marks the first examination of adversarial regret in the coded caching setup. Furthermore, we also address the issue of switching cost by establishing an upper bound on the expected number of cache updates made by our algorithm under unrestricted switching and also provide an upper bound on the regret under restricted switching when cache updates can only happen in a pre-specified subset of timeslots.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents a novel approach for trajectory anomaly detection using an autoregressive causal-attention model, termed LM-TAD. This method leverages the similarities between language statements and trajectories, both of which consist of ordered elements requiring coherence through external rules and contextual variations. By treating trajectories as sequences of tokens, our model learns the probability distributions over trajectories, enabling the identification of anomalous locations with high precision. We incorporate user-specific tokens to account for individual behavior patterns, enhancing anomaly detection tailored to user context. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LM-TAD on both synthetic and real-world datasets. In particular, the model outperforms existing methods on the Pattern of Life (PoL) dataset by detecting user-contextual anomalies and achieves competitive results on the Porto taxi dataset, highlighting its adaptability and robustness. Additionally, we introduce the use of perplexity and surprisal rate metrics for detecting outliers and pinpointing specific anomalous locations within trajectories. The LM-TAD framework supports various trajectory representations, including GPS coordinates, staypoints, and activity types, proving its versatility in handling diverse trajectory data. Moreover, our approach is well-suited for online trajectory anomaly detection, significantly reducing computational latency by caching key-value states of the attention mechanism, thereby avoiding repeated computations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Autonomous navigation in ice-covered waters poses significant challenges due to the frequent lack of viable collision-free trajectories. When complete obstacle avoidance is infeasible, it becomes imperative for the navigation strategy to minimize collisions. Additionally, the dynamic nature of ice, which moves in response to ship maneuvers, complicates the path planning process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning model to estimate the coarse dynamics of ice movements triggered by ship actions through occupancy estimation. To ensure real-time applicability, we propose a novel approach that caches intermediate prediction results and seamlessly integrates the predictive model into a graph search planner. We evaluate the proposed planner both in simulation and in a physical testbed against existing approaches and show that our planner significantly reduces collisions with ice when compared to the state-of-the-art.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Oblivious RAM (ORAM) is a well-researched primitive to hide the memory access pattern of a RAM computation; it has a variety of applications in trusted computing, outsourced storage, and multiparty computation. In this paper, we study the so-called offline ORAM in which the sequence of memory access locations to be hidden is known in advance. Apart from their theoretical significance, offline ORAMs can be used to construct efficient oblivious algorithms.   We obtain the first optimal offline ORAM with perfect security from oblivious priority queues via time-forward processing. For this, we present a simple construction of an oblivious priority queue with perfect security. Our construction achieves an asymptotically optimal (amortized) runtime of $\Theta(\log N)$ per operation for a capacity of $N$ elements and is of independent interest.   Building on our construction, we additionally present efficient external-memory instantiations of our oblivious, perfectly-secure construction: For the cache-aware setting, we match the optimal I/O complexity of $\Theta(\frac{1}{B} \log \frac{N}{M})$ per operation (amortized), and for the cache-oblivious setting we achieve a near-optimal I/O complexity of $O(\frac{1}{B} \log \frac{N}{M} \log\log_M N)$ per operation (amortized).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly important. However, due to the quadratic time complexity of attention computation, scaling LLMs to longer contexts incurs extremely slow inference latency and high GPU memory consumption for caching key-value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free approach to both accelerate attention computation and reduce GPU memory consumption. By leveraging the dynamic sparsity of attention mechanism, RetrievalAttention proposes to use approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) indexes for KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most relevant ones with vector search during generation. Unfortunately, we observe that the off-the-shelf ANNS indexes are often ineffective for such retrieval tasks due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors in attention mechanism. RetrievalAttention addresses the OOD challenge by designing an attention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt to the distribution of query vectors. Our evaluation shows that RetrievalAttention only needs to access 1--3% of data while maintaining high model accuracy. This leads to significant reduction in the inference cost of long-context LLMs with much lower GPU memory footprint. In particular, RetrievalAttention only needs a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB) for serving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating one token in 0.188 seconds.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The largest direct dark matter search experiments to date employ dual-phase time projection chambers (TPCs) with liquid noble gas targets. These detect both the primary photons generated by particle interactions in the liquid target, as well as proportional secondary scintillation light created by the ionization electrons in a strong electric field in the gas phase between the liquid-gas interface and the anode. In this work, we describe the detection of charge signals in a small-scale single-phase liquid-xenon-only TPC, that features the well-established TPC geometry with light readout above and below a cylindrical target. In the single-phase TPC, the proportional scintillation light (S2) is generated in liquid xenon in close proximity to 10 {\mu}m diameter anode wires. The detector was characterized and the proportional scintillation process was studied using the 32.1 keV and 9.4 keV signals from 83mKr decays. A charge gain factor g2 of up to (1.9 $\pm$ 0.3) PE/electron was reached at an anode voltage 4.4 kV higher than the gate electrode 5 mm below it, corresponding to (29 $\pm$ 6) photons emitted per ionization electron. The duration of S2 signals is dominated by electron diffusion and approaches the xenon de-excitation timescale for very short electron drift times. The electron drift velocity and the longitudinal diffusion constant were measured at a drift field of 470 V/cm. The results agree with the literature and demonstrate that a single-phase TPC can be operated successfully.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we introduce a new post-training compression paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate their wider adoption. We delve into LLM weight low-rank factorization, and find that the challenges of this task stem from the outlier phenomenon in the LLM activations and the sensitivity difference among various kinds of layers. To address these issues, we propose a training-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition (ASVD). Specifically, ASVD manages activation outliers by scaling the weight matrix based on the activation distribution, thereby enhancing decomposition accuracy. Additionally, we propose an efficient iterative calibration process to optimize layer-specific decomposition by addressing the varying sensitivity of different LLM layers. ASVD can compress a network by 10-20%, without compromising the performance of LLMs. Based on the success of the low-rank decomposition of projection matrices in the self-attention module, we further introduce ASVD to compress the KV cache. By reducing the channel dimension of KV activations, memory requirements for KV cache can be largely reduced. Thanks to the 50-75% reduction in the rank of the KV projection matrices, ASVD can further achieve 50% KV cache reductions without performance drop in a training-free manner.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Network slicing in 5G and the future 6G networks will enable the creation of multiple virtualized networks on a shared physical infrastructure. This innovative approach enables the provision of tailored networks to accommodate specific business types or industry users, thus delivering more customized and efficient services. However, the shared memory and cache in network slicing introduce security vulnerabilities that have yet to be fully addressed. In this paper, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based side-channel cache attack framework specifically designed for network slicing environments. Unlike traditional cache attack methods, our framework leverages reinforcement learning to dynamically identify and exploit cache locations storing sensitive information, such as authentication keys and user registration data. We assume that one slice network is compromised and demonstrate how the attacker can induce another shared slice to send registration requests, thereby estimating the cache locations of critical data. By formulating the cache timing channel attack as a reinforcement learning-driven guessing game between the attack slice and the victim slice, our model efficiently explores possible actions to pinpoint memory blocks containing sensitive information. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach, achieving a success rate of approximately 95\% to 98\% in accurately identifying the storage locations of sensitive data. This high level of accuracy underscores the potential risks in shared network slicing environments and highlights the need for robust security measures to safeguard against such advanced side-channel attacks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Phosphorene, a puckered two-dimensional allotrope of phosphorus, has sparked considerable interest in recent years due to its potential especially for optoelectronic applications with its layer-number-dependant direct band gap and strongly bound excitons. However, detailed experimental characterization of its intrinsic defects as well as its defect creation characteristics under electron irradiation are scarce. Here, we report on the creation and stability of a variety of defect configurations under 60 kV electron irradiation in mono- and bilayer phosphorene including the first experimental reports of stable adatom-vacancy-complexes. Displacement cross section measurements in bilayer phosphorene yield a value of 7.7 +- 1.4 barn with an estimated lifetime of adatom-vacancy-complexes of 19.9 +- 0.7 s, while some are stable for up to 68 s under continuous electron irradiation. Surprisingly, ab initio-based simulations indicate that the complexes should readily recombine, even in structures strained by up to 3 %. The presented results will help to improve the understanding of the wide variety of defects in phosphorene, their creation, and their stability, which may enable new pathways for defect engineered phosphorene devices.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The bottleneck associated with the key-value(KV) cache presents a significant challenge during the inference processes of large language models. While depth pruning accelerates inference, it requires extensive recovery training, which can take up to two weeks. On the other hand, width pruning retains much of the performance but offers slight speed gains. To tackle these challenges, we propose KVPruner to improve model efficiency while maintaining performance. Our method uses global perplexity-based analysis to determine the importance ratio for each block and provides multiple strategies to prune non-essential KV channels within blocks. Compared to the original model, KVPruner reduces runtime memory usage by 50% and boosts throughput by over 35%. Additionally, our method requires only two hours of LoRA fine-tuning on small datasets to recover most of the performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Memory access efficiency is significantly enhanced by caching recent address translations in the CPUs' Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLBs). However, since the operating system is not aware of which core is using a particular mapping, it flushes TLB entries across all cores where the application runs whenever addresses are unmapped, ensuring security and consistency. These TLB flushes, known as TLB shootdowns, are costly and create a performance and scalability bottleneck. A key contributor to TLB shootdowns is memory-mapped I/O, particularly during mmap-munmap cycles and page cache evictions. Often, the same physical pages are reassigned to the same process post-eviction, presenting an opportunity for the operating system to reduce the frequency of TLB shootdowns. We demonstrate, that by slightly extending the mmap function, TLB shootdowns for these "recycled pages" can be avoided.   Therefore we introduce and implement the "fast page recycling" (FPR) feature within the mmap system call. FPR-mmaps maintain security by only triggering TLB shootdowns when a page exits its recycling cycle and is allocated to a different process. To ensure consistency when FPR-mmap pointers are used, we made minor adjustments to virtual memory management to avoid the ABA problem. Unlike previous methods to mitigate shootdown effects, our approach does not require any hardware modifications and operates transparently within the existing Linux virtual memory framework.   Our evaluations across a variety of CPU, memory, and storage setups, including persistent memory and Optane SSDs, demonstrate that FPR delivers notable performance gains, with improvements of up to 28% in real-world applications and 92% in micro-benchmarks. Additionally, we show that TLB shootdowns are a significant source of bottlenecks, previously misattributed to other components of the Linux kernel.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The most commonly seen things on streets in any city are vehicles. However, most of them are used to transport people or goods. What if they also carry resources and capabilities for sensing, communications, computing, storage, and intelligence (SCCSI)? We will have a web of sensors to monitor the city, a network of powerful communicators to transport data around, a grid of computing power to conduct data analytics and machine learning (ML), a network of distributed storage to buffer/cache data/job for optimization, and a set of movable AI/ML toolboxes made available for specialized smart applications. This perspective article presents how to leverage SCCSI-empowered vehicles to design such a service network, simply called SCCSI network, to help build a smart city with a cost-effective and sustainable solution. It showcases how multi-dimensional technologies, namely, sensing, communications, computing, storage, and intelligence, converge to a unifying technology to solve grand challenges for resource demands from emerging large-scale applications. Thus, with SCCSI-empowered vehicles on the ground, over the air, and on the sea, SCCSI network can make resources and capabilities on the move, practically pushing SCCSI services to the edge! We hope this article serves as a spark to stimulate more disruptive thinking to address grand challenges of paramount importance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As the use of large language models (LLMs) expands rapidly, so does the range of knowledge needed to supplement various LLM queries. Thus, enabling flexible and efficient injection of new knowledge in LLM inference is critical. Three high-level options exist: (i) embedding the knowledge in LLM's weights (i.e., fine-tuning), (ii) including the knowledge as a part of LLM's text input (i.e., in-context learning), or (iii) injecting the KV caches of the new knowledge to LLM during prefill. This paper argues that, although fine-tuning and in-context learning are popular, using KV caches as the medium of knowledge could simultaneously enable more modular management of knowledge injection and more efficient LLM serving with low cost and fast response. To realize these benefits, we envision a Knowledge Delivery Network (KDN), a new system component in LLM services that dynamically optimizes the storage, transfer, and composition of KV cache across LLM engines and other compute and storage resources. We believe that, just like content delivery networks (CDNs), such as Akamai, enabled the success of the Internet ecosystem through their efficient data delivery, KDNs will be critical to the success of LLM applications through their efficient knowledge delivery. We have open-sourced a KDN prototype at https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache.

Following the size distribution of ejected particles, their aerodynamic properties and aggregation status upon ejection, we now focus on the electrification and charge distribution of ejected particles. We analyzed rebound and ejection trajectories of grains in a vacuum setup with a strong electric field of 100 kV/m and deduced particle charges from their acceleration. The ejected particles have sizes of about 10 to 100 microns. They carry charges up to $10^5$ e or charge densities up to $> 10^7$ e/mm$^2$. Within the given size range, we find a small bias towards positive charges.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A relatively simple safety-belt mechanism for improving DNS system availability and efficiency is proposed here. While it may seem ambitious, a careful examination shows it is both feasible and beneficial for the DNS system. The mechanism called "DNS Real-time Update" (DNSRU), a service that facilitates real-time and secure updates of cached domain records in DNS resolvers worldwide, even before the expiration of the corresponding Time To Live (TTL) values. This service allows Internet domain owners to quickly rectify any erroneous global IP address distribution, even if a long TTL value is associated with it. By addressing this critical DNS high availability issue, DNSRU eliminates the need for short TTL values and their associated drawbacks. Therefore, DNSRU DNSRU reduces the traffic load on authoritative servers while enhancing the system's fault tolerance. In this paper we show that our DNSRU design is backward compatible, supports gradual deployment, secure, efficient, and feasible.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Test Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a practical solution to mitigate the performance degradation of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in the presence of corruption/ noise affecting inputs. Existing approaches in TTA continuously adapt the DNN, leading to excessive resource consumption and performance degradation due to accumulation of error stemming from lack of supervision. In this work, we propose Domain-Aware Real-Time Dynamic Adaptation (DARDA) to address such issues. Our key approach is to proactively learn latent representations of some corruption types, each one associated with a sub-network state tailored to correctly classify inputs affected by that corruption. After deployment, DARDA adapts the DNN to previously unseen corruptions in an unsupervised fashion by (i) estimating the latent representation of the ongoing corruption; (ii) selecting the sub-network whose associated corruption is the closest in the latent space to the ongoing corruption; and (iii) adapting DNN state, so that its representation matches the ongoing corruption. This way, DARDA is more resource efficient and can swiftly adapt to new distributions caused by different corruptions without requiring a large variety of input data. Through experiments with two popular mobile edge devices - Raspberry Pi and NVIDIA Jetson Nano - we show that DARDA reduces energy consumption and average cache memory footprint respectively by 1.74x and 2.64x with respect to the state of the art, while increasing the performance by 10.4%, 5.7% and 4.4% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and TinyImagenet.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Language-queried target sound extraction (TSE) aims to extract specific sounds from mixtures based on language queries. Traditional fully-supervised training schemes require extensively annotated parallel audio-text data, which are labor-intensive. We introduce a language-free training scheme, requiring only unlabelled audio clips for TSE model training by utilizing the multi-modal representation alignment nature of the contrastive language-audio pre-trained model (CLAP). In a vanilla language-free training stage, target audio is encoded using the pre-trained CLAP audio encoder to form a condition embedding for the TSE model, while during inference, user language queries are encoded by CLAP text encoder. This straightforward approach faces challenges due to the modality gap between training and inference queries and information leakage from direct exposure to target audio during training. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented strategy. Specifically, we create an embedding cache using audio captions generated by a large language model (LLM). During training, target audio embeddings retrieve text embeddings from this cache to use as condition embeddings, ensuring consistent modalities between training and inference and eliminating information leakage. Extensive experiment results show that our retrieval-augmented approach achieves consistent and notable performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art with better generalizability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of retrieval augmentation in the Event Argument Extraction (EAE) task. However, existing retrieval-based EAE methods have two main limitations: (1) input length constraints and (2) the gap between the retriever and the inference model. These issues limit the diversity and quality of the retrieved information. In this paper, we propose a Compressive Memory-based Retrieval (CMR) mechanism for EAE, which addresses the two limitations mentioned above. Our compressive memory, designed as a dynamic matrix that effectively caches retrieved information and supports continuous updates, overcomes the limitations of the input length. Additionally, after pre-loading all candidate demonstrations into the compressive memory, the model further retrieves and filters relevant information from memory based on the input query, bridging the gap between the retriever and the inference model. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets (RAMS, WikiEvents, ACE05), significantly outperforming existing retrieval-based EAE methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work presents WarmSwap, a novel provider-side cold-start optimization for serverless computing. This optimization reduces cold-start time when booting and loading dependencies at runtime inside a function container. Previous approaches to the optimization of cold starts tend to fall into two categories: optimizing the infrastructure of serverless computing to benefit all serverless functions; or function-specific tuning for individual serverless functions. In contrast, WarmSwap offers a broad middle ground, which optimizes entire categories of serverless functions. WarmSwap eliminates the need to initialize middleware or software dependencies when launching a new serverless container, by migrating a pre-initialized live dependency image to the new function instance. WarmSwap respects the provider's cache constraints, as a single pre-warmed dependency image in the cache is shared among all serverless functions requiring that software dependency image. WarmSwap has been tested on seven representative functions from FunctionBench. The functions are chosen to compare with previous work. In those tests, WarmSwap accelerates cold-start executions for those serverless functions with large dependency requirements by a factor ranging from 1.2 to 2.2.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Conventional wisdom holds that an efficient interface between an OS running on a CPU and a high-bandwidth I/O device should be based on Direct Memory Access (DMA), descriptor rings, and interrupts: DMA offloads transfers from the CPU, descriptor rings provide buffering and queuing, and interrupts facilitate asynchronous interaction between cores and device with a lightweight notification mechanism. In this paper we question this wisdom in the light of modern hardware and workloads, particularly in cloud servers. We argue that the assumptions that led to this model are obsolete, and in many use-cases use of programmed I/O, where the CPU explicitly transfers data and control information to and from a device via loads and stores, actually results in a more efficient system. We quantitatively demonstrate these advantages using three use-cases: fine-grained RPC-style invocation of functions on an accelerator, offloading of operators in a streaming dataflow engine, and a network interface targeting for serverless functions. Moreover, we show that while these advantages are significant over a modern PCIe peripheral bus, a truly cache-coherent interconnect offers significant additional efficiency gains.

We derive a static local magnetic moment induced on the application of high-frequency light, using the Eilenberger formulation of quasiclassical theory. We include the effect of disorder and formulate a theory applicable across the entire temperature range, in the absence of external applied fields. For light-induced electric fields of amplitude $\sim 100 kV/cm$, the induced fields are large, $\sim 0.1 T$ for metallic Nb! The predictions of our theory agree with recent experimental and theoretical results [1]. An extension of this approach to superconductors would open a new route of inducing orbital magnetic field and potentially vortices in superconductors.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Monotonic alignment search (MAS), introduced by Glow-TTS, is one of the most popular algorithm in TTS to estimate unknown alignments between text and speech. Since this algorithm needs to search for the most probable alignment with dynamic programming by caching all paths, the time complexity of the algorithm is $O(T \times S)$. The authors of Glow-TTS run this algorithm on CPU, and while they mentioned it is difficult to parallelize, we found that MAS can be parallelized in text-length dimension and CPU execution consumes an inordinate amount of time for inter-device copy. Therefore, we implemented a Triton kernel and PyTorch JIT script to accelerate MAS on GPU without inter-device copy. As a result, Super-MAS Triton kernel is up to 72 times faster in the extreme-length case. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/supertone-inc/super-monotonic-align}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated great zero-shot performance on visual question answering (VQA). However, when it comes to knowledge-based VQA (KB-VQA), MLLMs may lack human commonsense or specialized domain knowledge to answer such questions and require obtaining necessary information from external knowledge sources. Previous works like Retrival-Augmented VQA-v2 (RAVQA-v2) focus on utilizing as much input information, such as image-based textual descriptions and retrieved knowledge, as possible to improve performance, but they all overlook the issue that with the number of input tokens increasing, inference efficiency significantly decreases, which contradicts the demands of practical applications. To address this issue, we propose Retrieval-Augmented MLLM with Compressed Contexts (RACC). RACC learns to compress and aggregate retrieved contexts, from which it generates a compact modulation in the form of Key-Value (KV) cache. This modulation is then used to adapt the downstream frozen MLLM, thereby achieving effective and efficient inference. RACC achieves a state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of 62.9% on OK-VQA. Moreover, it significantly reduces inference latency by 22.0%-59.7% compared to the prominent RAVQA-v2. Abundant experiments show RACC's broad applicability. It is compatible with various off-the-shelf MLLMs and can also handle different knowledge sources including textual and multimodal documents.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are distinguished by their multimodal comprehensive ability and widely used in many real-world applications including GPT-4o, autonomous driving and robotics. Despite their impressive performance, the multimodal inputs always incur long context. The inference under long context requires caching massive Key and Value states (KV cache) of previous tokens, which introduces high latency and excessive memory consumption. Due to this reason, it is challenging to deploy streaming inference of MLLMs on edge devices, which largely constrains the power and usage of MLLMs in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce Inf-MLLM, an efficient inference framework for MLLMs, which enable streaming inference of MLLM on a single GPU with infinite context. Inf-MLLM is based on our key observation of the attention pattern in both LLMs and MLLMs called "attention saddles". Thanks to the newly discovered attention pattern, Inf-MLLM maintains a size-constrained KV cache by dynamically caching recent tokens and relevant tokens. Furthermore, Inf-MLLM proposes attention bias, a novel approach to enable MLLMs to capture long-term dependency. We show that Inf-MLLM enables multiple LLMs and MLLMs to achieve stable performance over 4M-token long texts and multi-round conversations with 1-hour-long videos on a single GPU. In addition, Inf-MLLM exhibits superior streaming reasoning quality than existing methods such as StreamingLLM and 2x speedup than H2O.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Terahertz pulses generated by two-color laser plasmas have reported peak field strengths exceeding MV/cm, and when illuminating metal nanotips the near-field enhancement at the tip apex should result in extremely high bunch charges and electron energies via sub-cycle cold field emission. Here, electron emission from tungsten nanotips driven by THz pulses generated by a long filament air-plasma are reported. Electron energies up to 1.1 keV and bunch charges up to 2x$10^5$ electrons per pulse were detected, well below values expected for peak field calculated via the time averaged Poynting vector. Investigations revealed a failure in the use of the time-averaged Poynting vector when applied to long filament THz pulses, due to spatio-temporal restructuring of the THz pulse in the focus. Accounting for this restructuring significantly reduces the field strength to approximately 160 ~kV/cm, consistent with the observed electron bunch charges, peak energies and their dependence on the tip position in the THz focus. Despite these findings, our results surpass previous THz plasma-driven electron generation by an order of magnitude in both electron energy and bunch charge and a path to increasing these by an additional order of magnitude by modification of the THz optics is proposed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In-loop filtering (ILF) is a key technology for removing the artifacts in image/video coding standards. Recently, neural network-based in-loop filtering methods achieve remarkable coding gains beyond the capability of advanced video coding standards, which becomes a powerful coding tool candidate for future video coding standards. However, the utilization of deep neural networks brings heavy time and computational complexity, and high demands of high-performance hardware, which is challenging to apply to the general uses of coding scene. To address this limitation, inspired by explorations in image restoration, we propose an efficient and practical in-loop filtering scheme by adopting the Look-up Table (LUT). We train the DNN of in-loop filtering within a fixed filtering reference range, and cache the output values of the DNN into a LUT via traversing all possible inputs. At testing time in the coding process, the filtered pixel is generated by locating input pixels (to-be-filtered pixel with reference pixels) and interpolating cached filtered pixel values. To further enable the large filtering reference range with the limited storage cost of LUT, we introduce the enhanced indexing mechanism in the filtering process, and clipping/finetuning mechanism in the training. The proposed method is implemented into the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) reference software, VTM-11.0. Experimental results show that the ultrafast, very fast, and fast mode of the proposed method achieves on average 0.13%/0.34%/0.51%, and 0.10%/0.27%/0.39% BD-rate reduction, under the all intra (AI) and random access (RA) configurations. Especially, our method has friendly time and computational complexity, only 101%/102%-104%/108% time increase with 0.13-0.93 kMACs/pixel, and only 164-1148 KB storage cost for a single model. Our solution may shed light on the journey of practical neural network-based coding tool evolution.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output is promising to meet the stringent quality-of-experience (QoE) requirements of railway wireless communications by coordinating many successional access points (APs) to serve the onboard users coherently. A key challenge is how to deliver the desired contents timely due to the radical changing propagation environment caused by the growing train speed. In this paper, we propose to proactively cache the likely-requesting contents at the upcoming APs which perform the coherent transmission to reduce end-to-end delay. A long-term QoE-maximization problem is formulated and two cache placement algorithms are proposed. One is based on heuristic convex optimization (HCO) and the other exploits deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with soft actor-critic (SAC). Compared to the conventional benchmark, numerical results show the advantage of our proposed algorithms on QoE and hit probability. With the advanced DRL model, SAC outperforms HCO on QoE by predicting the user requests accurately.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Long text generation, such as novel writing and discourse-level translation with extremely long contexts, presents significant challenges to current language models. Existing methods mainly focus on extending the model's context window through strategies like length extrapolation. However, these approaches demand substantial hardware resources during the training and/or inference phases. Our proposed method, Temp-Lora, introduces an alternative concept. Instead of relying on the KV cache to store all context information, we embeds this information directly into a temporary Lora module. In the process of long text generation, this module is progressively trained with text generated previously. This approach not only efficiently preserves contextual knowledge but also prevents any permanent alteration to the model's parameters given that the module is discarded post-generation. Extensive experiments on the PG19 language modeling benchmark and the GuoFeng discourse-level translation benchmark validate the effectiveness of Temp-Lora. Our results show that: 1) Temp-Lora substantially enhances generation quality for long text, as indicated by a 13.2% decrease in perplexity (PPL) on a subset of PG19, and a 29.3% decrease in PPL along with a 113.2% increase in BLEU score on a subset of GuoFeng, 2) Temp-Lora is compatible with and enhances most existing long text generation methods, and 3) Temp-Lora can greatly reduce computational costs by shortening the context window. For example, we can ensure a moderate improvement in generation quality (a decrease of 3.8% in PPL) while enabling a 51.5% memory usage reduction and a 60.0% decrease in latency for inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Surgical phase recognition has become a crucial requirement in laparoscopic surgery, enabling various clinical applications like surgical risk forecasting. Current methods typically identify the surgical phase using individual frame-wise embeddings as the fundamental unit for time modeling. However, this approach is overly sensitive to current observations, often resulting in discontinuous and erroneous predictions within a complete surgical phase. In this paper, we propose DACAT, a novel dual-stream model that adaptively learns clip-aware context information to enhance the temporal relationship. In one stream, DACAT pretrains a frame encoder, caching all historical frame-wise features. In the other stream, DACAT fine-tunes a new frame encoder to extract the frame-wise feature at the current moment. Additionally, a max clip-response read-out (Max-R) module is introduced to bridge the two streams by using the current frame-wise feature to adaptively fetch the most relevant past clip from the feature cache. The clip-aware context feature is then encoded via cross-attention between the current frame and its fetched adaptive clip, and further utilized to enhance the time modeling for accurate online surgical phase recognition. The benchmark results on three public datasets, i.e., Cholec80, M2CAI16, and AutoLaparo, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DACAT over existing state-of-the-art methods, with improvements in Jaccard scores of at least 4.5%, 4.6%, and 2.7%, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the growing demand for live video streaming, there is an increasing need for low-latency and high-quality transmission, especially with the advent of 5G networks. While 5G offers hardware-level improvements, effective software solutions for minimizing latency remain essential. Current methods, such as multi-channel streaming, fail to address latency issues fundamentally, often only adding new channels without optimizing overall performance. This thesis proposes a novel approach using a 3D engine (e.g., Unity 3D) to stream multi-input video data through a single channel with reduced latency. By leveraging 3D engine capabilities, such as World/Screen Space Cameras, 3D Canvases, and Webcam Textures, the proposed system consolidates video streams from multiple external cameras into a unified, low-latency output. The affiliated project of this thesis demonstrates the implementation of a low-latency multi-channel live video streaming system. It employs the RTSP protocol and examines video encoding techniques, alongside a client-side application based on Unity 3D. The system architecture includes a WebSocket server for persistent connections, an HTTP server for communication, a MySQL database for storage, Redis for caching, and Nginx for load balancing. Each module operates independently, ensuring flexibility and scalability in the system's design. A key innovation of this system is its use of a 3D scene to map multiple video inputs onto a virtual canvas, recorded by an in-engine camera for transmission. This design minimizes redundant data, enabling an efficient and director-guided live streaming network. The thesis concludes by discussing challenges encountered during the project and provides solutions for future improvement.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> State-of-the-art techniques for 3D reconstruction are largely based on volumetric scene representations, which require sampling multiple points to compute the color arriving along a ray. Using these representations for more general inverse rendering -- reconstructing geometry, materials, and lighting from observed images -- is challenging because recursively path-tracing such volumetric representations is expensive. Recent works alleviate this issue through the use of radiance caches: data structures that store the steady-state, infinite-bounce radiance arriving at any point from any direction. However, these solutions rely on approximations that introduce bias into the renderings and, more importantly, into the gradients used for optimization. We present a method that avoids these approximations while remaining computationally efficient. In particular, we leverage two techniques to reduce variance for unbiased estimators of the rendering equation: (1) an occlusion-aware importance sampler for incoming illumination and (2) a fast cache architecture that can be used as a control variate for the radiance from a high-quality, but more expensive, volumetric cache. We show that by removing these biases our approach improves the generality of radiance cache based inverse rendering, as well as increasing quality in the presence of challenging light transport effects such as specular reflections.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing availability of real-world conversation data offers exciting opportunities for researchers to study user-chatbot interactions. However, the sheer volume of this data makes manually examining individual conversations impractical. To overcome this challenge, we introduce WildVis, an interactive tool that enables fast, versatile, and large-scale conversation analysis. WildVis provides search and visualization capabilities in the text and embedding spaces based on a list of criteria. To manage million-scale datasets, we implemented optimizations including search index construction, embedding precomputation and compression, and caching to ensure responsive user interactions within seconds. We demonstrate WildVis' utility through three case studies: facilitating chatbot misuse research, visualizing and comparing topic distributions across datasets, and characterizing user-specific conversation patterns. WildVis is open-source and designed to be extendable, supporting additional datasets and customized search and visualization functionalities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Low Earth Orbit Satellite Networks (LSNs) are integral to supporting a broad range of modern applications, which are typically modeled as Service Function Chains (SFCs). Each SFC is composed of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), where each VNF performs a specific task. In this work, we tackle two key challenges in deploying SFCs across an LSN. Firstly, we aim to optimize the long-term system performance by minimizing the average end-to-end SFC execution delay, given that each satellite comes with a pre-installed/cached subset of VNFs. To achieve optimal SFC placement, we formulate an offline Dynamic Programming (DP) equation. To overcome the challenges associated with DP, such as its complexity, the need for probability knowledge, and centralized decision-making, we put forth an online Multi-Agent Q-Learning (MAQL) solution. Our MAQL approach addresses convergence issues in the non-stationary LSN environment by enabling satellites to share learning parameters and update their Q-tables based on distinct rules for their selected actions. Secondly, to determine the optimal VNF subsets for satellite caching, we develop a Bayesian Optimization (BO)-based learning mechanism that operates both offline and continuously in the background during runtime. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MAQL approach achieves near-optimal performance comparable to the DP model and significantly outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, the BO-based approach effectively enhances the request serving rate over time.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The widespread of Large Language Models (LLMs) marks a significant milestone in generative AI. Nevertheless, the increasing context length and batch size in offline LLM inference escalate the memory requirement of the key-value (KV) cache, which imposes a huge burden on the GPU VRAM, especially for resource-constraint scenarios (e.g., edge computing and personal devices). Several cost-effective solutions leverage host memory or SSDs to reduce storage costs for offline inference scenarios and improve the throughput. Nevertheless, they suffer from significant performance penalties imposed by intensive KV cache accesses due to limited PCIe bandwidth. To address these issues, we propose InstInfer, a novel LLM inference system that offloads the most performance-critical computation (i.e., attention in decoding phase) and data (i.e., KV cache) parts to Computational Storage Drives (CSDs), which minimize the enormous KV transfer overheads. InstInfer designs a dedicated flash-aware in-storage attention engine with KV cache management mechanisms to exploit the high internal bandwidths of CSDs instead of being limited by the PCIe bandwidth. The optimized P2P transmission between GPU and CSDs further reduces data migration overheads. Experimental results demonstrate that for a 13B model using an NVIDIA A6000 GPU, InstInfer improves throughput for long-sequence inference by up to 11.1$\times$, compared to existing SSD-based solutions such as FlexGen.

Without disrupting the product's main composition in e-commerce images, we aim to use a train-free method guided by pre-set conditions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A critical approach for efficiently deploying computationally demanding large language models (LLMs) is Key-Value (KV) caching. The KV cache stores key-value states of previously generated tokens, significantly reducing the need for repetitive computations and thereby lowering latency in autoregressive generation. However, the size of the KV cache grows linearly with sequence length, posing challenges for applications requiring long context input and extensive sequence generation. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach, called MiniCache, to compress the KV cache across layers from a novel depth perspective, significantly reducing the memory footprint for LLM inference. Our approach is based on the observation that KV cache states exhibit high similarity between the adjacent layers in the middle-to-deep portion of LLMs. To facilitate merging, we propose disentangling the states into the magnitude and direction components, interpolating the directions of the state vectors while preserving their lengths unchanged. Furthermore, we introduce a token retention strategy to keep highly distinct state pairs unmerged, thus preserving the information with minimal additional storage overhead. Our MiniCache is training-free and general, complementing existing KV cache compression strategies, such as quantization and sparsity. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of MiniCache utilizing various models including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, Phi-3, Mistral, and Mixtral across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating its exceptional performance in achieving superior compression ratios and high throughput. On the ShareGPT dataset, LLaMA-2-7B with 4-bit MiniCache achieves a remarkable compression ratio of up to 5.02x, enhances inference throughput by approximately 5x, and reduces the memory footprint by 41% compared to the FP16 full cache baseline, all while maintaining near-lossless performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The matrix quantization entails representing matrix elements in a more space-efficient form to reduce storage usage, with dequantization restoring the original matrix for use. We formulate the Quantization Error Minimization (QEM) problem as minimizing the distance between a matrix before and after quantization, under the condition that the quantized matrix occupies the same memory space. Matrix quantization is crucial in various applications, including Large Language Models (LLMs) weight quantization, vector databases, KV cache quantization, graph compression, and image compression. Recent advancements in LLMs, such as GPT-4 and BERT, have highlighted the importance of matrix compression due to the large size of parameters and KV cache, which are stored as matrices.   We propose Quantum Entanglement Trees (QET) to address the QEM problem by leveraging the local orderliness of matrix elements, involving iterative element swapping to form a locally ordered matrix. This matrix is then grouped and quantized by columns. To enhance QET, we introduce two optimizations: further quantizing residuals to reduce MSE, and using masking and batch processing to accelerate the algorithm.   Experimental results demonstrate that QET can effectively reduce MSE to 5.05%, 13.33%, and 11.89% of the current best method on the LLM dataset, K cache, and V cache, respectively. Our contributions include the abstraction of the QEM problem, the design of the QET algorithm, and the proposal of two optimizations to improve accuracy and speed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Running LLMs on end devices has garnered significant attention recently due to their advantages in privacy preservation. With the advent of lightweight LLM models and specially designed GPUs, on-device LLM inference has achieved the necessary accuracy and performance metrics. However, we have identified that LLM inference on GPUs can leak privacy-sensitive intermediate information, specifically the KV pairs. An attacker could exploit these KV pairs to reconstruct the entire user conversation, leading to significant vulnerabilities. Existing solutions, such as Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), are either too computation-intensive or resource-limited. To address these issues, we designed KV-Shield, which operates in two phases. In the initialization phase, it permutes the weight matrices so that all KV pairs are correspondingly permuted. During the runtime phase, the attention vector is inversely permuted to ensure the correctness of the layer output. All permutation-related operations are executed within the TEE, ensuring that insecure GPUs cannot access the original KV pairs, thus preventing conversation reconstruction. Finally, we theoretically analyze the correctness of KV-Shield, along with its advantages and overhead.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper explores the potential of cryogenic semiconductor computing and superconductor electronics as promising alternatives to traditional semiconductor devices. As semiconductor devices face challenges such as increased leakage currents and reduced performance at higher temperatures, these novel technologies offer high performance and low power computation. Conventional semiconductor electronics operating at cryogenic temperatures (below -150{\deg}C or 123.15 K) can benefit from reduced leakage currents and improved electron mobility. On the other hand, superconductor electronics, operating below 10 K, allow electrons to flow without resistance, offering the potential for ultra-low-power, high-speed computation. This study presents a comprehensive performance modeling and analysis of these technologies and provides insights into their potential benefits and limitations. We implement models of in-order and out-of-order cores operating at high clock frequencies associated with superconductor electronics and cryogenic semiconductor computing in gem5. We evaluate the performance of these components using workloads representative of real-world applications like NPB, SPEC CPU2006, and GAPBS. Our results show the potential speedups achievable by these components and the limitations posed by cache bandwidth. This work provides valuable insights into the performance implications and design trade-offs associated with cryogenic and superconductor technologies, laying the foundation for future research in this field using gem5.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Control-flow leakage (CFL) attacks enable an attacker to expose control-flow decisions of a victim program via side-channel observations. Linearization (i.e., elimination) of secret-dependent control flow is the main countermeasure against these attacks, yet it comes at a non-negligible cost. Conversely, balancing secret-dependent branches often incurs a smaller overhead, but is notoriously insecure on high-end processors. Hence, linearization has been widely believed to be the only effective countermeasure against CFL attacks. In this paper, we challenge this belief and investigate an unexplored alternative: how to securely balance secret-dependent branches on higher-end processors?   We propose Libra, a generic and principled hardware-software codesign to efficiently address CFL on high-end processors. We perform a systematic classification of hardware primitives leaking control flow from the literature, and provide guidelines to handle them with our design. Importantly, Libra enables secure control-flow balancing without the need to disable performance-critical hardware such as the instruction cache and the prefetcher. We formalize the semantics of Libra and propose a code transformation algorithm for securing programs, which we prove correct and secure. Finally, we implement and evaluate Libra on an out-of-order RISC-V processor, showing performance overhead on par with insecure balanced code, and outperforming state-of-the-art linearized code by 19.3%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables computations on encrypted data, preserving confidentiality without the need for decryption. However, FHE is often hindered by significant performance overhead, particularly for high-precision and complex data like images. Due to serious efficiency issues, traditional FHE methods often encrypt images by monolithic data blocks (such as pixel rows), instead of pixels. However, this strategy compromises the advantages of homomorphic operations and disables pixel-level image processing. In this study, we address these challenges by proposing and implementing a pixel-level homomorphic encryption approach, iCHEETAH, based on the CKKS scheme. To enhance computational efficiency, we introduce three novel caching mechanisms to pre-encrypt radix values or frequently occurring pixel values, substantially reducing redundant encryption operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves up to a 19-fold improvement in encryption speed compared to the original CKKS, while maintaining high image quality. Additionally, real-world image applications such as mean filtering, brightness enhancement, image matching and watermarking are tested based on FHE, showcasing up to a 91.53% speed improvement. We also proved that our method is IND-CPA (Indistinguishability under Chosen Plaintext Attack) secure, providing strong encryption security. These results underscore the practicality and efficiency of iCHEETAH, marking a significant advancement in privacy-preserving image processing at scale.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Disaggregating memory from compute offers the opportunity to better utilize stranded memory in data centers. It is important to cache data in the compute nodes and maintain cache coherence across multiple compute nodes to save on round-trip communication cost between the disaggregated memory and the compute nodes. However, the limited computing power on the disaggregated memory servers makes it challenging to maintain cache coherence among multiple compute-side caches over disaggregated shared memory. This paper introduces SELCC; a Shared-Exclusive Latch Cache Coherence protocol that maintains cache coherence without imposing any computational burden on the remote memory side. SELCC builds on a one-sided shared-exclusive latch protocol by introducing lazy latch release and invalidation messages among the compute nodes so that it can guarantee both data access atomicity and cache coherence. SELCC minimizes communication round-trips by embedding the current cache copy holder IDs into RDMA latch words and prioritizes local concurrency control over global concurrency control. We instantiate the SELCC protocol onto compute-sided cache, forming an abstraction layer over disaggregated memory. This abstraction layer provides main-memory-like APIs to upper-level applications, and thus enabling existing data structures and algorithms to function over disaggregated memory with minimal code change. To demonstrate the usability of SELCC, we implement a B-tree and three transaction concurrency control algorithms over SELCC's APIs. Micro-benchmark results show that the SELCC protocol achieves better performance compared to RPC-based cache-coherence protocols. Additionally, YCSB and TPC-C benchmarks indicate that applications over SELCC can achieve comparable or superior performance against competitors over disaggregated memory.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various language processing tasks, motivating their adoption in simultaneous translation. Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as unnecessarily expanded training sets, computational inefficiency from dumping the key and value cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, in this work, we propose SimulMask, a new paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation. It utilizes a novel attention mask approach that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention for a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on five language pairs while reducing the computational cost.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The computational difficulties of large language model (LLM) inference remain a significant obstacle to their widespread deployment. The need for many applications to support long input sequences and process them in large batches typically causes token-generation to be bottlenecked by data transfer. For this reason, we introduce SparQ Attention, a technique for increasing the inference throughput of LLMs by utilising memory bandwidth more efficiently within the attention layers, through selective fetching of the cached history. Our proposed technique can be applied directly to off-the-shelf LLMs during inference, without requiring any modification to the pre-training setup or additional fine-tuning. We show that SparQ Attention brings up to 8x savings in attention data transfers without substantial drops in accuracy, by evaluating Llama 2 and 3, Mistral, Gemma and Pythia models on a wide range of downstream tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> KV Vel is a non-eclipsing short-period (P = 0.3571 days) close binary containing a very hot subdwarf primary (77000 K) and a cool low-mass secondary star (3400 K) that is located at the center of the planetary nebula DS 1. The changes in the orbital period of the close binary were analyzed based on 262 new times of light maximum together with those compiled from the literature. It is discovered that the O-C curve shows a small-amplitude (0.0034 days) cyclic period variation with a period of 29.55 years. The explanation by the solar-type magnetic activity cycles of the cool component is ruled out because the required energies are much larger than the total radiant energy of this component in a whole cycle. Therefore, the cyclic variation was plausibly explained as the light-travel time effect via the presence of a tertiary component, which is supported by the periodic changes of the O-C curve and the rather symmetric and stable light curves obtained by TESS. The mass of the tertiary companion is determined to be M_3sini' = 0.060(7) M_sun. If the third body is coplanar with the central binary (i.e., i' = 62.5{\deg}), the mass of the tertiary component is computed as M_3 ~ 0.068 M\sun, and thus it would be below the stable hydrogen-burning limit and is a brown dwarf. The orbital separation is shorter than 9.35 astronomical units (AU). KV Vel together with its surrounding planetary nebula and the brown-dwarf companion may be formed through the common-envelope evolution after the primary filled its Roche lobe during the early asymptotic giant branch stage.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing by achieving state-of-the-art results across a variety of tasks. However, the computational demands of LLM inference, including high memory consumption and slow processing speeds, pose significant challenges for real-world applications, particularly on resource-constrained devices. Efficient inference is crucial for scaling the deployment of LLMs to a broader range of platforms, including mobile and edge devices.   This survey explores contemporary techniques in model compression that address these challenges by reducing the size and computational requirements of LLMs while maintaining their performance. We focus on model-level compression methods, including quantization, knowledge distillation, and pruning, as well as system-level optimizations like KV cache efficient design. Each of these methodologies offers a unique approach to optimizing LLMs, from reducing numerical precision to transferring knowledge between models and structurally simplifying neural networks. Additionally, we discuss emerging trends in system-level design that further enhance the efficiency of LLM inference. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current advancements in model compression and their potential to make LLMs more accessible and practical for diverse applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In dense retrieval, deep encoders provide embeddings for both inputs and targets, and the softmax function is used to parameterize a distribution over a large number of candidate targets (e.g., textual passages for information retrieval). Significant challenges arise in training such encoders in the increasingly prevalent scenario of (1) a large number of targets, (2) a computationally expensive target encoder model, (3) cached target embeddings that are out-of-date due to ongoing training of target encoder parameters. This paper presents a simple and highly scalable response to these challenges by training a small parametric corrector network that adjusts stale cached target embeddings, enabling an accurate softmax approximation and thereby sampling of up-to-date high scoring "hard negatives." We theoretically investigate the generalization properties of our proposed target corrector, relating the complexity of the network, staleness of cached representations, and the amount of training data. We present experimental results on large benchmark dense retrieval datasets as well as on QA with retrieval augmented language models. Our approach matches state-of-the-art results even when no target embedding updates are made during training beyond an initial cache from the unsupervised pre-trained model, providing a 4-80x reduction in re-embedding computational cost.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Bugs in popular distributed protocol implementations have been the source of many downtimes in popular internet services. We describe a randomized testing approach for distributed protocol implementations based on reinforcement learning. Since the natural reward structure is very sparse, the key to successful exploration in reinforcement learning is reward augmentation. We show two different techniques that build on one another. First, we provide a decaying exploration bonus based on the discovery of new states -- the reward decays as the same state is visited multiple times. The exploration bonus captures the intuition from coverage-guided fuzzing of prioritizing new coverage points; in contrast to other schemes, we show that taking the maximum of the bonus and the Q-value leads to more effective exploration. Second, we provide waypoints to the algorithm as a sequence of predicates that capture interesting semantic scenarios. Waypoints exploit designer insight about the protocol and guide the exploration to ``interesting'' parts of the state space. Our reward structure ensures that new episodes can reliably get to deep interesting states even without execution caching. We have implemented our algorithm in Go. Our evaluation on three large benchmarks (RedisRaft, Etcd, and RSL) shows that our algorithm can significantly outperform baseline approaches in terms of coverage and bug finding.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> An open problem in artificial intelligence is how systems can flexibly learn discrete abstractions that are useful for solving inherently continuous problems. Previous work in computational neuroscience has considered this functional integration of discrete and continuous variables during decision-making under the formalism of active inference (Parr, Friston & de Vries, 2017; Parr & Friston, 2018). However, their focus is on the expressive physical implementation of categorical decisions and the hierarchical mixed generative model is assumed to be known. As a consequence, it is unclear how this framework might be extended to learning. We therefore present a novel hierarchical hybrid active inference agent in which a high-level discrete active inference planner sits above a low-level continuous active inference controller. We make use of recent work in recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS) which implement end-to-end learning of meaningful discrete representations via the piecewise linear decomposition of complex continuous dynamics (Linderman et al., 2016). The representations learned by the rSLDS inform the structure of the hybrid decision-making agent and allow us to (1) specify temporally-abstracted sub-goals in a method reminiscent of the options framework, (2) lift the exploration into discrete space allowing us to exploit information-theoretic exploration bonuses and (3) `cache' the approximate solutions to low-level problems in the discrete planner. We apply our model to the sparse Continuous Mountain Car task, demonstrating fast system identification via enhanced exploration and successful planning through the delineation of abstract sub-goals.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper addresses the challenges of throughput optimization in wireless cache-aided cooperative networks. We propose an opportunistic cooperative probing and scheduling strategy for efficient content delivery. The strategy involves the base station probing the relaying channels and cache states of multiple cooperative nodes, thereby enabling opportunistic user scheduling for content delivery. Leveraging the theory of Sequentially Planned Decision (SPD) optimization, we dynamically formulate decisions on cooperative probing and stopping time. Our proposed Reward Expected Thresholds (RET)-based strategy optimizes opportunistic probing and scheduling. This approach significantly enhances system throughput by exploiting gains from local caching, cooperative transmission and time diversity. Simulations confirm the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed Media Access Control (MAC) strategy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Computational Pangenomics is an emerging field that studies genetic variation using a graph structure encompassing multiple genomes. Visualizing pangenome graphs is vital for understanding genome diversity. Yet, handling large graphs can be challenging due to the high computational demands of the graph layout process.   In this work, we conduct a thorough performance characterization of a state-of-the-art pangenome graph layout algorithm, revealing significant data-level parallelism, which makes GPUs a promising option for compute acceleration. However, irregular data access and the algorithm's memory-bound nature present significant hurdles. To overcome these challenges, we develop a solution implementing three key optimizations: a cache-friendly data layout, coalesced random states, and warp merging. Additionally, we propose a quantitative metric for scalable evaluation of pangenome layout quality.   Evaluated on 24 human whole-chromosome pangenomes, our GPU-based solution achieves a 57.3x speedup over the state-of-the-art multithreaded CPU baseline without layout quality loss, reducing execution time from hours to minutes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> 3D integration offers key advantages in improving system performance and efficiency for the End-of-Scaling era. It enables the incorporation of heterogeneous system components and disparate technologies, eliminates off-chip communication constraints, reduces on-chip latency and total power dissipation. Moreover, AIs demand for increased computational power, larger GPU cache capacity, energy efficiency and low power custom AI hardware integration all serve as drivers for 3D integration. Although 3D advantages such as enhanced interconnectivity and increased performance have been demonstrated through numerous technology sites, heterogeneous 3D system design raises numerous unanswered questions. Among the primary challenges are the temperature and lifetime reliability issues caused by the complex interaction patterns among system components. Such interactions are harder to model with current modeling tools and require detailed hardware characterization. This study presents the latest drivers for 3D integration and the resulting need for hardware emulation frameworks. It then presents a design to profile power, temperature, noise, inter-layer bandwidth and lifetime reliability characterization that can emulate a wide range of stacking alternatives. This framework allows for controlling activity levels at the macro-level, along with customized sensor infrastructure to characterize heat propagation, inter-layer noise, power delivery, reliability and inter-connectivity as well as the interactions among critical design objectives.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we investigate an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted full-duplex (FD) integrated sensing, communication and computing system. Specifically, an FD base station (BS) provides service for uplink and downlink transmission, and a local cache is connected to the BS through a backhaul link to store data. Meanwhile, active sensing elements are deployed on the IRS to receive target echo signals. On this basis, in order to evaluate the overall performance of the system under consideration, we propose a system utility maximization problem while ensuring the sensing quality, expressed as the difference between the sum of communication throughput, total computation bits (offloading bits and local computation bits) and the total backhaul cost for content delivery. This makes the problem difficult to solve due to the highly non-convex coupling of the optimization variables. To effectively solve this problem, we first design the most effective caching strategy. Then, we develop an algorithm based on weighted minimum mean square error, alternative direction method of multipliers, majorization-minimization framework, semi-definite relaxation techniques, and several complex transformations to jointly solve the optimization variables. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the utility performance of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed scheme compared with the baseline scheme.

Distinct from the current state-of-the-art Ga2O3 HJDs, we achieve breakdown voltage exceeding 3 kV with a low turn on voltage (VON) of 0.8V, estimated at a forward current density (IF) of 1 A-cm-2. The measured devices exhibit excellent turn-on characteristics achieving 100 A-cm-2 current density at a forward bias of 1.5V along with a low differential specific on-resistance (Ron,sp) of 4.4 m{\Omega}-cm2. The SM-JTE was realized using concentric NiO rings with varying widths and spacing that approximates a gradual reduction in JTE charge. The unipolar figure of merit (FOM) calculated exceeds 2 GW-cm2 and is among the best reported for devices with a sub-1V turn-on. The fabricated devices also displayed minimal change in forward I-V characteristics post reverse bias stress of 3 kV applied during breakdown voltage testing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Functional approximation as a high-order continuous representation provides a more accurate value and gradient query compared to the traditional discrete volume representation. Volume visualization directly rendered from functional approximation generates high-quality rendering results without high-order artifacts caused by trilinear interpolations. However, querying an encoded functional approximation is computationally expensive, especially when the input dataset is large, making functional approximation impractical for interactive visualization. In this paper, we proposed a novel functional approximation multi-resolution representation, Adaptive-FAM, which is lightweight and fast to query. We also design a GPU-accelerated out-of-core multi-resolution volume visualization framework that directly utilizes the Adaptive-FAM representation to generate high-quality rendering with interactive responsiveness. Our method can not only dramatically decrease the caching time, one of the main contributors to input latency, but also effectively improve the cache hit rate through prefetching. Our approach significantly outperforms the traditional function approximation method in terms of input latency while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have yielded remarkable success across diverse fields. However, handling long contexts remains a significant challenge for LLMs due to the quadratic time and space complexity of attention mechanisms and the growing memory consumption of the key-value cache during generation. This work introduces MemLong: Memory-Augmented Retrieval for Long Text Generation, a method designed to enhance the capabilities of long-context language modeling by utilizing an external retriever for historical information retrieval. MemLong combines a non-differentiable ``ret-mem'' module with a partially trainable decoder-only language model and introduces a fine-grained, controllable retrieval attention mechanism that leverages semantic-level relevant chunks. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple long-context language modeling benchmarks demonstrate that MemLong consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art LLMs. More importantly, MemLong can extend the context length on a single 3090 GPU from 4k up to 80k.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In traditional Fog-Radio Access Networks (F-RANs), enhanced remote radio heads (eRRHs) are connected to a macro base station (MBS) through fronthaul links. Deploying a massive number of eRRHs is not always feasible due to site constraints and the cost of fronthaul links. This paper introduces an innovative concept of using smart helpers (SHs) in F-RANs. These SHs do not require fronthaul links and listen to the nearby eRRHs' communications. Then, they smartly select and cache popular content. This capability enables SHs to serve users with frequent on-demand service requests potentially. As such, network operators have the flexibility to easily deploy SHs in various scenarios, such as dense urban areas and temporary public events, to expand their F-RANs and improve the quality of service (QoS). To study the performance of the proposed SH-aided F-RAN, we formulate an optimization problem of minimizing the average transmission delay that jointly optimizes cache resources and user scheduling. To tackle the formulated problem, we develop an innovative multi-stage algorithm that uses a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Various performance measures, e.g., the average transmission delay, fronthaul load, and cache hit rate of the proposed SH-aided F-RAN are evaluated numerically and compared with those of traditional F-RANs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A well-known dilemma in large vision-language models (e.g., GPT-4, LLaVA) is that while increasing the number of vision tokens generally enhances visual understanding, it also significantly raises memory and computational costs, especially in long-term, dense video frame streaming scenarios. Although learnable approaches like Q-Former and Perceiver Resampler have been developed to reduce the vision token burden, they overlook the context causally modeled by LLMs (i.e., key-value cache), potentially leading to missed visual cues when addressing user queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to reduce vision compute by leveraging redundant vision tokens "skipping layers" rather than decreasing the number of vision tokens. Our method, VideoLLM-MoD, is inspired by mixture-of-depths LLMs and addresses the challenge of numerous vision tokens in long-term or streaming video. Specifically, for each transformer layer, we learn to skip the computation for a high proportion (e.g., 80\%) of vision tokens, passing them directly to the next layer. This approach significantly enhances model efficiency, achieving approximately \textasciitilde42\% time and \textasciitilde30\% memory savings for the entire training. Moreover, our method reduces the computation in the context and avoid decreasing the vision tokens, thus preserving or even improving performance compared to the vanilla model. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of VideoLLM-MoD, showing its state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including narration, forecasting, and summarization tasks in COIN, Ego4D, and Ego-Exo4D datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Key-value (KV) caching has become the de-facto to accelerate generation speed for large language models (LLMs) inference. However, the growing cache demand with increasing sequence length has transformed LLM inference to be a memory bound problem, significantly constraining the system throughput. Existing methods rely on dropping unimportant tokens or quantizing all entries uniformly. Such methods, however, often incur high approximation errors to represent the compressed matrices. The autoregressive decoding process further compounds the error of each step, resulting in critical deviation in model generation and deterioration of performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose GEAR, an efficient KV cache compression framework that achieves near-lossless high-ratio compression. GEAR first applies quantization to majority of entries of similar magnitudes to ultra-low precision. It then employs a low rank matrix to approximate the quantization error, and a sparse matrix to remedy individual errors from outlier entries. By adeptly integrating three techniques, GEAR is able to fully exploit their synergistic potentials. Our experiments demonstrate that compared to alternatives, GEAR achieves near-lossless 4-bit KV cache compression with up to 2.38x throughput improvement, while reducing peak-memory size up to 2.29x. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoKang-Timmy/GEAR.

  Targeted Instruction Hardening</h2>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Several software mitigations have been proposed to defend against Spectre vulnerabilities. However, these countermeasures often suffer from high performance overhead, largely due to unnecessary protections. We propose LightSLH, designed to mitigate this overhead by hardening instructions only when they are under threat from Spectre vulnerabilities. LightSLH leverages program analysis techniques based on abstract interpretation to identify all instructions that could potentially lead to Spectre vulnerabilities and provides provable protection. To enhance analysis efficiency and precision, LightSLH employs novel taint and value domains. The taint domain enables bit-level taint tracking, while the value domain allows LightSLH to analyze complex program structures such as pointers and structures. Furthermore, LightSLH uses a two-stage abstract interpretation approach to circumvent potential analysis paralysis issues.   We demonstrate the security guarantees of LightSLH and evaluate its performance on cryptographic algorithm implementations from OpenSSL. LightSLH significantly reduces the overhead associated with speculative-load-hardening techniques. Our results show that LightSLH introduces no protection and thus no overhead on 4 out of the 7 studied algorithms, which contrasts with existing countermeasures that introduce additional overhead due to unnecessary hardening. Additionally, LightSLH performs, for the first time, a rigorous analysis of the security guarantees of RSA against Spectre v1, highlighting that the memory access patterns generated by the scatter-gather algorithm depend on secrets, even for observers at the cache line granularity, necessitating protection for such accesses.

A solution for these issues is the application specific instruction set processor (ASIP) methodology, which can improve speed and reduce power consumption of the general purpose processor (GPP) technique. In ASIP, changing the instruction set architecture (ISA) of the processor will lead to alter the number and the mean time of accesses to the cache memory. This issue has a direct impact on the processor energy consumption. In this work, we study the impacts of extended ISA on the energy consumption of the extended ISA processor. Also, we demonstrate the extended ISA let the designer to reduce the cache size in order to minimize the energy consumption while meeting performance constraint.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Linked lists have long served as a valuable teaching tool in programming. However, the question arises: Are they truly practical for everyday program use? In most cases, it appears that array-based data structures offer distinct advantages, particularly in terms of memory efficiency and,more importantly, execution speed. While it's relatively straightforward to calculate the complexity of operations, gauging actual execution efficiency remains a challenge. This paper addresses this question by introducing a new benchmark. Our study compares various linked list implementations with several array-based alternatives. We also demonstrate the ease of incorporating memory caching for linked lists, enhancing their performance. Additionally, we introduce a new array-based data structure designed to excel in a wide range of operations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Existing LLM training and inference frameworks struggle in boosting efficiency with sparsity while maintaining the integrity of context and model architecture. Inspired by the sharding concept in database and the fact that attention parallelizes over heads on accelerators, we propose Sparsely-Sharded (S2) Attention, an attention algorithm that allocates heterogeneous context partitions for different attention heads to divide and conquer. S2-Attention enforces each attention head to only attend to a partition of contexts following a strided sparsity pattern, while the full context is preserved as the union of all the shards. As attention heads are processed in separate thread blocks, the context reduction for each head can thus produce end-to-end speed-up and memory reduction. At inference, LLMs trained with S2-Attention can then take the KV cache reduction as free meals with guaranteed model quality preserve. In experiments, we show S2-Attentioncan provide as much as (1) 25.3X wall-clock attention speed-up over FlashAttention-2, resulting in 6X reduction in end-to-end training time and 10X inference latency, (2) on-par model training quality compared to default attention, (3)perfect needle retrieval accuracy over 32K context window. On top of the algorithm, we build DKernel, an LLM training and inference kernel library that allows users to customize sparsity patterns for their own models. We open-sourced DKerneland make it compatible with Megatron, Pytorch, and vLLM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Developing stateful cloud applications, such as low-latency workflows and microservices with strict consistency requirements, remains arduous for programmers. The Stateful Functions-as-a-Service (SFaaS) paradigm aims to serve these use cases. However, existing approaches either provide serializable transactional guarantees at the level of individual functions, or separate application logic from the state and use inefficient transactional protocols. These design choices increase the execution latency, limiting the adoption of SFaaS systems.   In this paper, we present Styx, a novel SFaaS runtime that executes serializable transactions across functions with exactly-once guarantees. Styx extends a deterministic transactional protocol to support an arbitrary call graph of stateful functions. It introduces a transaction-execution acknowledgment scheme that allows tracking a transactional workflow's SFaaS calls, guaranteeing atomicity and exactly-once processing. Finally, Styx features a function-execution caching mechanism and early transactional commit replies for optimized performance. Experiments with the YCSB-T, TPC-C, and Deathstar benchmarks show that Styx outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by achieving at least one order of magnitude higher throughput while exhibiting near-linear scalability and low latency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we introduce Writing in the Margins (WiM), a new inference pattern for Large Language Models designed to optimize the handling of long input sequences in retrieval-oriented tasks. This approach leverages the chunked prefill of the key-value cache to perform segment-wise inference, which enables efficient processing of extensive contexts along with the generation and classification of intermediate information ("margins") that guide the model towards specific tasks. This method increases computational overhead marginally while significantly enhancing the performance of off-the-shelf models without the need for fine-tuning. Specifically, we observe that WiM provides an average enhancement of 7.5% in accuracy for reasoning skills (HotpotQA, MultiHop-RAG) and more than a 30.0% increase in the F1-score for aggregation tasks (CWE). Additionally, we show how the proposed pattern fits into an interactive retrieval design that provides end-users with ongoing updates about the progress of context processing, and pinpoints the integration of relevant information into the final response. We release our implementation of WiM using Hugging Face Transformers library at https://github.com/writer/writing-in-the-margins.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Online video streaming has evolved into an integral component of the contemporary Internet landscape. Yet, the disclosure of user requests presents formidable privacy challenges. As users stream their preferred online videos, their requests are automatically seized by video content providers, potentially leaking users' privacy.   Unfortunately, current protection methods are not well-suited to preserving user request privacy from content providers while maintaining high-quality online video services. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel Privacy-Preserving Video Fetching (PPVF) framework, which utilizes trusted edge devices to pre-fetch and cache videos, ensuring the privacy of users' requests while optimizing the efficiency of edge caching. More specifically, we design PPVF with three core components: (1) \textit{Online privacy budget scheduler}, which employs a theoretically guaranteed online algorithm to select non-requested videos as candidates with assigned privacy budgets. Alternative videos are chosen by an online algorithm that is theoretically guaranteed to consider both video utilities and available privacy budgets. (2) \textit{Noisy video request generator}, which generates redundant video requests (in addition to original ones) utilizing correlated differential privacy to obfuscate request privacy. (3) \textit{Online video utility predictor}, which leverages federated learning to collaboratively evaluate video utility in an online fashion, aiding in video selection in (1) and noise generation in (2). Finally, we conduct extensive experiments using real-world video request traces from Tencent Video. The results demonstrate that PPVF effectively safeguards user request privacy while upholding high video caching performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As the demand for long-context large language models (LLMs) increases, models with context windows of up to 128K or 1M tokens are becoming increasingly prevalent. However, long-context LLM inference is challenging since the inference speed decreases significantly as the sequence length grows. This slowdown is primarily caused by loading a large KV cache during self-attention. Previous works have shown that a small portion of critical tokens will dominate the attention outcomes. However, we observe the criticality of a token highly depends on the query. To this end, we propose Quest, a query-aware KV cache selection algorithm. Quest keeps track of the minimal and maximal Key values in KV cache pages and estimates the criticality of a given page using Query vectors. By only loading the Top-K critical KV cache pages for attention, Quest significantly speeds up self-attention without sacrificing accuracy. We show that Quest can achieve up to 2.23x self-attention speedup, which reduces inference latency by 7.03x while performing well on tasks with long dependencies with negligible accuracy loss.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Computational workflows are a common class of application on supercomputers, yet the loosely coupled and heterogeneous nature of workflows often fails to take full advantage of their capabilities. We created Colmena to leverage the massive parallelism of a supercomputer by using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to learn from and adapt a workflow as it executes. Colmena allows scientists to define how their application should respond to events (e.g., task completion) as a series of cooperative agents. In this paper, we describe the design of Colmena, the challenges we overcame while deploying applications on exascale systems, and the science workflows we have enhanced through interweaving AI. The scaling challenges we discuss include developing steering strategies that maximize node utilization, introducing data fabrics that reduce communication overhead of data-intensive tasks, and implementing workflow tasks that cache costly operations between invocations. These innovations coupled with a variety of application patterns accessible through our agent-based steering model have enabled science advances in chemistry, biophysics, and materials science using different types of AI. Our vision is that Colmena will spur creative solutions that harness AI across many domains of scientific computing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In many automated planning applications, action costs can be hard to specify. An example is the time needed to travel through a certain road segment, which depends on many factors, such as the current weather conditions. A natural way to address this issue is to learn to predict these parameters based on input features (e.g., weather forecasts) and use the predicted action costs in automated planning afterward. Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) has been successful in learning to predict the parameters of combinatorial optimization problems in a way that optimizes solution quality rather than prediction quality. This approach yields better results than treating prediction and optimization as separate tasks. In this paper, we investigate for the first time the challenges of implementing DFL for automated planning in order to learn to predict the action costs. There are two main challenges to overcome: (1) planning systems are called during gradient descent learning, to solve planning problems with negative action costs, which are not supported in planning. We propose novel methods for gradient computation to avoid this issue. (2) DFL requires repeated planner calls during training, which can limit the scalability of the method. We experiment with different methods approximating the optimal plan as well as an easy-to-implement caching mechanism to speed up the learning process. As the first work that addresses DFL for automated planning, we demonstrate that the proposed gradient computation consistently yields significantly better plans than predictions aimed at minimizing prediction error; and that caching can temper the computation requirements.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Hybrid main memory systems combine both performance and capacity advantages from heterogeneous memory technologies. With larger capacities, higher associativities, and finer granularities, hybrid memory systems currently exhibit significant metadata storage and lookup overheads for flexibly remapping data blocks between the two memory tiers. To alleviate the inefficiencies of existing designs, we propose Trimma, the combination of a multi-level metadata structure and an efficient metadata cache design. Trimma uses a multi-level metadata table to only track truly necessary address remap entries. The saved memory space is effectively utilized as extra DRAM cache capacity to improve performance. Trimma also uses separate formats to store the entries with non-identity and identity address mappings. This improves the overall remap cache hit rate, further boosting the performance. Trimma is transparent to software and compatible with various types of hybrid memory systems. When evaluated on a representative hybrid memory system with HBM3 and DDR5, Trimma achieves up to 1.68$\times$ and on average 1.33$\times$ speedup benefits, compared to state-of-the-art hybrid memory designs. These results show that Trimma effectively addresses metadata management overheads, especially for future scalable large-scale hybrid memory architectures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Shared caches are vulnerable to side channel attacks through contention in cache sets. Besides being a simple source of information leak, these side channels form useful gadgets for more sophisticated attacks that compromise the security of shared systems.   The fundamental design aspect that contention attacks exploit is the deterministic nature of the set of addresses contending for a cache set. In this paper, we present RollingCache, a cache design that defends against contention attacks by dynamically changing the set of addresses contending for cache sets. Unlike prior defenses, RollingCache does not rely on address encryption/decryption, data relocation, or cache partitioning. We use one level of indirection to implement dynamic mapping controlled by the whole-cache runtime behavior. Our solution does not depend on having defined security domains, and can defend against an attacker running on the same or another core.   We evaluate RollingCache on ChampSim using the SPEC-2017 benchmark suite. Our security evaluation shows that our dynamic mapping removes the deterministic ability to identify the source of contention. The performance evaluation shows an impact of 1.67\% over a mix of workloads, with a corresponding

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Today's most advanced multimodal models remain proprietary. The strongest open-weight models rely heavily on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs to achieve good performance, effectively distilling these closed models into open ones. As a result, the community is still missing foundational knowledge about how to build performant VLMs from scratch. We present Molmo, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art in their class of openness. Our key innovation is a novel, highly detailed image caption dataset collected entirely from human annotators using speech-based descriptions. To enable a wide array of user interactions, we also introduce a diverse dataset mixture for fine-tuning that includes in-the-wild Q&A and innovative 2D pointing data. The success of our approach relies on careful choices for the model architecture details, a well-tuned training pipeline, and, most critically, the quality of our newly collected datasets, all of which will be released. The best-in-class 72B model within the Molmo family not only outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models but also compares favorably against proprietary systems like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Gemini 1.5 on both academic benchmarks and human evaluation.   We will be releasing all of our model weights, captioning and fine-tuning data, and source code in the near future.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Compared with Large Language Models (LLMs), Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can also accept images as input, thus showcasing more interesting emergent capabilities and demonstrating impressive performance on various vision-language tasks. Motivated by text prompting in LLMs, visual prompting has been explored to enhance LVLMs' capabilities of perceiving visual information. However, previous visual prompting techniques solely process visual inputs without considering text queries, limiting the models' ability to follow text instructions to complete tasks. To fill this gap, in this work, we propose a new prompting technique named Attention Prompting on Image, which just simply overlays a text-query-guided attention heatmap on the original input image and effectively enhances LVLM on various tasks. Specifically, we generate an attention heatmap for the input image dependent on the text query with an auxiliary model like CLIP. Then the heatmap simply multiplies the pixel values of the original image to obtain the actual input image for the LVLM. Extensive experiments on various vison-language benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our technique. For example, Attention Prompting on Image improves LLaVA-1.5 by 3.8% and 2.9% on MM-Vet and LLaVA-Wild benchmarks, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While the language modeling objective has been shown to be deeply connected with compression, it is surprising that modern LLMs are not employed in practical text compression systems. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of neural network and transformer-based compression techniques to answer this question. We compare traditional text compression systems with neural network and LLM-based text compression methods. Although LLM-based systems significantly outperform conventional compression methods, they are highly impractical. Specifically, LLMZip, a recent text compression system using Llama3-8B requires 9.5 days to compress just 10 MB of text, although with huge improvements in compression ratios. To overcome this, we present FineZip - a novel LLM-based text compression system that combines ideas of online memorization and dynamic context to reduce the compression time immensely. FineZip can compress the above corpus in approximately 4 hours compared to 9.5 days, a 54 times improvement over LLMZip and comparable performance. FineZip outperforms traditional algorithmic compression methods with a large margin, improving compression ratios by approximately 50\%. With this work, we take the first step towards making lossless text compression with LLMs a reality. While FineZip presents a significant step in that direction, LLMs are still not a viable solution for large-scale text compression. We hope our work paves the way for future research and innovation to solve this problem.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled LLM-based agents to directly interact with application user interfaces (UIs), enhancing agents' performance in complex tasks. However, these agents often suffer from high latency and low reliability due to the extensive sequential UI interactions. To address this issue, we propose AXIS, a novel LLM-based agents framework prioritize actions through application programming interfaces (APIs) over UI actions. This framework also facilitates the creation and expansion of APIs through automated exploration of applications. Our experiments on Office Word demonstrate that AXIS reduces task completion time by 65%-70% and cognitive workload by 38%-53%, while maintaining accuracy of 97%-98% compare to humans. Our work contributes to a new human-agent-computer interaction (HACI) framework and a fresh UI design principle for application providers in the era of LLMs. It also explores the possibility of turning every applications into agents, paving the way towards an agent-centric operating system (Agent OS).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Count data play a crucial role in sports analytics, providing valuable insights into various aspects of the game. Models that accurately capture the characteristics of count data are essential for making reliable inferences. In this paper, we propose the use of the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) model for analyzing count data in sports. The CMP model offers flexibility in modeling data with different levels of dispersion. Here we consider a bivariate CMP model that models the potential correlation between home and away scores by incorporating a random effect specification. We illustrate the advantages of the CMP model through simulations. We then analyze data from baseball and soccer games before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The performance of our proposed CMP model matches or outperforms standard Poisson and Negative Binomial models, providing a good fit and an accurate estimation of the observed effects in count data with any level of dispersion. The results highlight the robustness and flexibility of the CMP model in analyzing count data in sports, making it a suitable default choice for modeling a diverse range of count data types in sports, where the data dispersion may vary.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language model pre-training has traditionally relied on human experts to craft heuristics for improving the corpora quality, resulting in numerous rules developed to date. However, these rules lack the flexibility to address the unique characteristics of individual example effectively. Meanwhile, applying tailored rules to every example is impractical for human experts. In this paper, we demonstrate that even small language models, with as few as 0.3B parameters, can exhibit substantial data refining capabilities comparable to those of human experts. We introduce Programming Every Example (ProX), a novel framework that treats data refinement as a programming task, enabling models to refine corpora by generating and executing fine-grained operations, such as string normalization, for each individual example at scale. Experimental results show that models pre-trained on ProX-curated data outperform either original data or data filtered by other selection methods by more than 2% across various downstream benchmarks. Its effectiveness spans various model sizes and pre-training corpora, including C4, RedPajama-V2, and FineWeb. Furthermore, ProX exhibits significant potential in domain-specific continual pre-training: without domain specific design, models trained on OpenWebMath refined by ProX outperform human-crafted rule-based methods, improving average accuracy by 7.6% over Mistral-7B, with 14.6% for Llama-2-7B and 20.3% for CodeLlama-7B, all within 10B tokens to be comparable to models like Llemma-7B trained on 200B tokens. Further analysis highlights that ProX significantly saves training FLOPs, offering a promising path for efficient LLM pre-training.We are open-sourcing ProX with >100B corpus, models, and sharing all training and implementation details for reproducible research and future innovation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We identify "stable regions" in the residual stream of Transformers, where the model's output remains insensitive to small activation changes, but exhibits high sensitivity at region boundaries. These regions emerge during training and become more defined as training progresses or model size increases. The regions appear to be much larger than previously studied polytopes. Our analysis suggests that these stable regions align with semantic distinctions, where similar prompts cluster within regions, and activations from the same region lead to similar next token predictions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful for cognitive tasks such as image classification, object detection, and scene segmentation. One drawback however is the significant high computational complexity and memory consumption, which makes them unfeasible to run real-time on embedded platforms because of the limited hardware resources. Block floating point (BFP) quantization is one of the representative compression approaches for reducing the memory and computational burden owing to their capability to effectively capture the broad data distribution of DNN models. Unfortunately, prior works on BFP-based quantization empirically choose the block size and the precision that preserve accuracy. In this paper, we develop a BFP-based bitwidth-aware analytical modeling framework (called ``BitQ'') for the best BFP implementation of DNN inference on embedded platforms. We formulate and resolve an optimization problem to identify the optimal BFP block size and bitwidth distribution by the trade-off of both accuracy and performance loss. Experimental results show that compared with an equal bitwidth setting, the BFP DNNs with optimized bitwidth allocation provide efficient computation, preserving accuracy on famous benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Several recent studies have investigated low-precision accumulation, reporting improvements in throughput, power, and area across various platforms. However, the accompanying proposals have only considered the quantization-aware training (QAT) paradigm, in which models are fine-tuned or trained from scratch with quantization in the loop. As models continue to grow in size, QAT techniques become increasingly more expensive, which has motivated the recent surge in post-training quantization (PTQ) research. To the best of our knowledge, ours marks the first formal study of accumulator-aware quantization in the PTQ setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce AXE, a practical framework of accumulator-aware extensions designed to endow overflow avoidance guarantees to existing layer-wise PTQ algorithms. We theoretically motivate AXE and demonstrate its flexibility by implementing it on top of two state-of-the-art PTQ algorithms: GPFQ and OPTQ. We further generalize AXE to support multi-stage accumulation for the first time, opening the door for full datapath optimization and scaling to large language models (LLMs). We evaluate AXE across image classification and language generation models, and observe significant improvements in the trade-off between accumulator bit width and model accuracy over baseline methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models are cognitively biased judges. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been shown to be effective as automatic evaluators with simple prompting and in-context learning. In this work, we assemble 15 LLMs of four different size ranges and evaluate their output responses by preference ranking from the other LLMs as evaluators, such as System Star is better than System Square. We then evaluate the quality of ranking outputs introducing the Cognitive Bias Benchmark for LLMs as Evaluators (CoBBLEr), a benchmark to measure six different cognitive biases in LLM evaluation outputs, such as the Egocentric bias where a model prefers to rank its own outputs highly in evaluation. We find that LLMs are biased text quality evaluators, exhibiting strong indications on our bias benchmark (average of 40% of comparisons across all models) within each of their evaluations that question their robustness as evaluators. Furthermore, we examine the correlation between human and machine preferences and calculate the average Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) score to be 49.6%, indicating that machine preferences are misaligned with humans. According to our findings, LLMs may still be unable to be utilized for automatic annotation aligned with human preferences. Our project page is at: https://minnesotanlp.github.io/cobbler.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> State-of-the-art computer vision tasks, like monocular depth estimation (MDE), rely heavily on large, modern Transformer-based architectures. However, their application in safety-critical domains demands reliable predictive performance and uncertainty quantification. While Bayesian neural networks provide a conceptually simple approach to serve those requirements, they suffer from the high dimensionality of the parameter space. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, in particular low-rank adaptations (LoRA), have emerged as a popular strategy for adapting large-scale models to down-stream tasks by performing parameter inference on lower-dimensional subspaces. In this work, we investigate the suitability of PEFT methods for subspace Bayesian inference in large-scale Transformer-based vision models. We show that, indeed, combining BitFit, DiffFit, LoRA, and CoLoRA, a novel LoRA-inspired PEFT method, with Bayesian inference enables more robust and reliable predictive performance in MDE.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Studies have shown that the morphologies of galaxies are substantially transformed following coalescence after a merger, but post-mergers are notoriously difficult to identify, especially in imaging that is shallow or low-resolution. We train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify simulated post-merger galaxies in a range of image qualities, modelled after five real surveys: the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS), the Canada-France Imaging Survey (CFIS), the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP), and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Holding constant all variables other than imaging quality, we present the performance of the CNNs on reserved test set data for each image quality. The success of CNNs on a given dataset is found to be sensitive to both imaging depth and resolution. We find that post-merger recovery generally increases with depth, but that limiting 5 sigma point-source depths in excess of ~25 mag, similar to what is achieved in CFIS, are only marginally beneficial. Finally, we present the results of a cross-survey inference experiment, and find that CNNs trained on a given image quality can sometimes be applied to different imaging data to good effect. The work presented here therefore represents a useful reference for the application of CNNs for merger searches in both current and future imaging surveys.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces a dynamic, error-bounded hierarchical matrix (H-matrix) compression method tailored for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The proposed approach reduces the computational complexity and memory demands of large-scale physics-based models while preserving the essential properties of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). By adaptively refining hierarchical matrix approximations based on local error estimates, our method ensures efficient training and robust model performance. Empirical results demonstrate that this technique outperforms traditional compression methods, such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), pruning, and quantization, by maintaining high accuracy and improving generalization capabilities. Additionally, the dynamic H-matrix method enhances inference speed, making it suitable for real-time applications. This approach offers a scalable and efficient solution for deploying PINNs in complex scientific and engineering domains, bridging the gap between computational feasibility and real-world applicability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurately attributing answer text to its source document is crucial for developing a reliable question-answering system. However, attribution for long documents remains largely unexplored. Post-hoc attribution systems are designed to map answer text back to the source document, yet the granularity of this mapping has not been addressed. Furthermore, a critical question arises: What precisely should be attributed, with an emphasis on identifying the information units within an answer that necessitate grounding? In this paper, we propose and investigate a novel approach to the factual decomposition of generated answers for attribution, employing template-based in-context learning. To accomplish this, we utilize the question and integrate negative sampling during few-shot in-context learning for decomposition. This approach enhances the semantic understanding of both abstractive and extractive answers. We examine the impact of answer decomposition by providing a thorough examination of various attribution approaches, ranging from retrieval-based techniques to LLM-based attributors.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scaling model size significantly challenges the deployment and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs). Due to the redundancy in LLM weights, recent research has focused on pushing weight-only quantization to extremely low-bit (even down to 2 bits). It reduces memory requirements, optimizes storage costs, and decreases memory bandwidth needs during inference. However, due to numerical representation limitations, traditional scalar-based weight quantization struggles to achieve such extreme low-bit. Recent research on Vector Quantization (VQ) for LLMs has demonstrated the potential for extremely low-bit model quantization by compressing vectors into indices using lookup tables.   In this paper, we introduce Vector Post-Training Quantization (VPTQ) for extremely low-bit quantization of LLMs. We use Second-Order Optimization to formulate the LLM VQ problem and guide our quantization algorithm design by solving the optimization. We further refine the weights using Channel-Independent Second-Order Optimization for a granular VQ. In addition, by decomposing the optimization problem, we propose a brief and effective codebook initialization algorithm. We also extend VPTQ to support residual and outlier quantization, which enhances model accuracy and further compresses the model. Our experimental results show that VPTQ reduces model quantization perplexity by $0.01$-$0.34$ on LLaMA-2, $0.38$-$0.68$ on Mistral-7B, $4.41$-$7.34$ on LLaMA-3 over SOTA at 2-bit, with an average accuracy improvement of $0.79$-$1.5\%$ on LLaMA-2, $1\%$ on Mistral-7B, $11$-$22\%$ on LLaMA-3 on QA tasks on average. We only utilize $10.4$-$18.6\%$ of the quantization algorithm execution time, resulting in a $1.6$-$1.8\times$ increase in inference throughput compared to SOTA.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion-based image super-resolution (SR) methods have achieved remarkable success by leveraging large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models as priors. However, these methods still face two challenges: the requirement for dozens of sampling steps to achieve satisfactory results, which limits efficiency in real scenarios, and the neglect of degradation models, which are critical auxiliary information in solving the SR problem. In this work, we introduced a novel one-step SR model, which significantly addresses the efficiency issue of diffusion-based SR methods. Unlike existing fine-tuning strategies, we designed a degradation-guided Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module specifically for SR, which corrects the model parameters based on the pre-estimated degradation information from low-resolution images. This module not only facilitates a powerful data-dependent or degradation-dependent SR model but also preserves the generative prior of the pre-trained diffusion model as much as possible. Furthermore, we tailor a novel training pipeline by introducing an online negative sample generation strategy. Combined with the classifier-free guidance strategy during inference, it largely improves the perceptual quality of the super-resolution results. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superior efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> One of the key issues contributing to inefficiency in Puskesmas is the time-consuming nature of doctor-patient interactions. Doctors need to conduct thorough consultations, which include diagnosing the patient's condition, providing treatment advice, and transcribing detailed notes into medical records. In regions with diverse linguistic backgrounds, doctors often have to ask clarifying questions, further prolonging the process. While diagnosing is essential, transcription and summarization can often be automated using AI to improve time efficiency and help doctors enhance care quality and enable early diagnosis and intervention. This paper proposes a solution using a localized large language model (LLM) to transcribe, translate, and summarize doctor-patient conversations. We utilize the Whisper model for transcription and GPT-3 to summarize them into the ePuskemas medical records format. This system is implemented as an add-on to an existing web browser extension, allowing doctors to fill out patient forms while talking. By leveraging this solution for real-time transcription, translation, and summarization, doctors can improve the turnaround time for patient care while enhancing the quality of records, which become more detailed and insightful for future visits. This innovation addresses challenges like overcrowded facilities and the administrative burden on healthcare providers in Indonesia. We believe this solution will help doctors save time, provide better care, and produce more accurate medical records, representing a significant step toward modernizing healthcare and ensuring patients receive timely, high-quality care, even in resource-constrained settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The remarkable performance achieved by Large Language Models (LLM) has driven research efforts to leverage them for a wide range of tasks and input modalities. In speech-to-text (S2T) tasks, the emerging solution consists of projecting the output of the encoder of a Speech Foundational Model (SFM) into the LLM embedding space through an adapter module. However, no work has yet investigated how much the downstream-task performance depends on each component (SFM, adapter, LLM) nor whether the best design of the adapter depends on the chosen SFM and LLM. To fill this gap, we evaluate the combination of 5 adapter modules, 2 LLMs (Mistral and Llama), and 2 SFMs (Whisper and SeamlessM4T) on two widespread S2T tasks, namely Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech Translation. Our results demonstrate that the SFM plays a pivotal role in downstream performance, while the adapter choice has moderate impact and depends on the SFM and LLM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We adapt Gaussian processes for estimating the average dose-response function in observational settings, introducing a powerful complement to treatment effect estimation for understanding heterogeneous effects. We incorporate samples from a Gaussian process posterior for the propensity score into a Gaussian process response model using Girard's approach to integrating over uncertainty in training data. We show Girard's method admits a positive-definite kernel, and provide theoretical justification by identifying it with an inner product of kernel mean embeddings. We demonstrate double robustness of our approach under a misspecified response function or propensity score. We characterize and mitigate regularization-induced confounding in Gaussian process response models. We show improvement over other methods for average dose-response function estimation in terms of coverage of the dose-response function and estimation bias, with less sensitivity to misspecification across experiments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach to decompose the activations of Large Language Models (LLMs) into human-interpretable latents. In this paper, we pose two questions. First, to what extent do SAEs extract monosemantic and interpretable latents? Second, to what extent does varying the sparsity or the size of the SAE affect monosemanticity / interpretability? By investigating these questions in the context of a simple first-letter identification task where we have complete access to ground truth labels for all tokens in the vocabulary, we are able to provide more detail than prior investigations. Critically, we identify a problematic form of feature-splitting we call feature absorption where seemingly monosemantic latents fail to fire in cases where they clearly should. Our investigation suggests that varying SAE size or sparsity is insufficient to solve this issue, and that there are deeper conceptual issues in need of resolution.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Students often drift in and out of focus during class. Effective teachers recognize this and re-engage them when necessary. With the shift to remote learning, teachers have lost the visual feedback needed to adapt to varying student engagement. We propose using readily available front-facing video to infer attention levels based on movements of the eyes, head, and face. We train a deep learning model to predict a measure of attention based on overt eye movements. Specifically, we measure Inter-Subject Correlation of eye movements in ten-second intervals while students watch the same educational videos. In 3 different experiments (N=83) we show that the trained model predicts this objective metric of attention on unseen data with $R^2$=0.38, and on unseen subjects with $R^2$=0.26-0.30. The deep network relies mostly on a student's eye movements, but to some extent also on movements of the brows, cheeks, and head. In contrast to Inter-Subject Correlation of the eyes, the model can estimate attentional engagement from individual students' movements without needing reference data from an attentive group. This enables a much broader set of online applications. The solution is lightweight and can operate on the client side, which mitigates some of the privacy concerns associated with online attention monitoring.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), aims to segment the object referred by a given sentence in an image by understanding both visual and linguistic information. However, existing RIS methods tend to explore top-performance models, disregarding considerations for practical applications on resources-limited edge devices. This oversight poses a significant challenge for on-device RIS inference. To this end, we propose an effective and efficient post-training quantization framework termed PTQ4RIS. Specifically, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of the root causes of performance degradation in RIS model quantization and propose dual-region quantization (DRQ) and reorder-based outlier-retained quantization (RORQ) to address the quantization difficulties in visual and text encoders. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks with different bits settings (from 8 to 4 bits) demonstrates its superior performance. Importantly, we are the first PTQ method specifically designed for the RIS task, highlighting the feasibility of PTQ in RIS applications. Code will be available at {https://github.com/gugu511yy/PTQ4RIS}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a novel approach that enhances the computational efficiency of CNNs by selectively processing channels based on their relevance to the current prediction. This method optimizes computational resources by dynamically selecting key channels in feature maps for focused processing within the convolutional blocks (Conv-Blocks), while skipping less relevant channels. Unlike conditional computation methods that require dynamic computation graphs, CNN MoD uses a static computation graph with fixed tensor sizes which improve hardware efficiency. It speeds up the training and inference processes without the need for customized CUDA kernels, unique loss functions, or finetuning. CNN MoD either matches the performance of traditional CNNs with reduced inference times, GMACs, and parameters, or exceeds their performance while maintaining similar inference times, GMACs, and parameters. For example, on ImageNet, ResNet86-MoD exceeds the performance of the standard ResNet50 by 0.45% with a 6% speedup on CPU and 5% on GPU. Moreover, ResNet75-MoD achieves the same performance as ResNet50 with a 25% speedup on CPU and 15% on GPU.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces SGCode, a flexible prompt-optimizing system to generate secure code with large language models (LLMs). SGCode integrates recent prompt-optimization approaches with LLMs in a unified system accessible through front-end and back-end APIs, enabling users to 1) generate secure code, which is free of vulnerabilities, 2) review and share security analysis, and 3) easily switch from one prompt optimization approach to another, while providing insights on model and system performance. We populated SGCode on an AWS server with PromSec, an approach that optimizes prompts by combining an LLM and security tools with a lightweight generative adversarial graph neural network to detect and fix security vulnerabilities in the generated code. Extensive experiments show that SGCode is practical as a public tool to gain insights into the trade-offs between model utility, secure code generation, and system cost. SGCode has only a marginal cost compared with prompting LLMs. SGCode is available at: https://sgcode.codes/.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rapid growth of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field, a vast variety of Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to emerge for diverse NLP tasks. As an increasing number of papers are presented, researchers and developers face the challenge of information overload. Thus, it is particularly important to develop a system that can automatically extract and organise key information about LLMs from academic papers (\textbf{LLM model card}). This work is to develop such a pioneer system by using Named Entity Recognition (\textbf{NER}) and Relation Extraction (\textbf{RE}) methods that automatically extract key information about large language models from the papers, helping researchers to efficiently access information about LLMs. These features include model \textit{licence}, model \textit{name}, and model \textit{application}. With these features, we can form a model card for each paper. \textbf{Data-contribution} wise, 106 academic papers were processed by defining three dictionaries - LLMs name, licence, and application. 11,051 sentences were extracted through dictionary lookup, and the dataset was constructed through manual review of the final selection of 129 sentences that have a link between the name and the licence, and 106 sentences that have a link between the model name and the application.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Ambiguities are common in human-robot interaction, especially when a robot follows user instructions in a large collocated space. For instance, when the user asks the robot to find an object in a home environment, the object might be in several places depending on its varying semantic properties (e.g., a bowl can be in the kitchen cabinet or on the dining room table, depending on whether it is clean/dirty, full/empty and the other objects around it). Previous works on object semantics have predicted such relationships using one shot-inferences which are likely to fail for ambiguous or partially understood instructions. This paper focuses on this gap and suggests a semantically-driven disambiguation approach by utilizing follow-up clarifications to handle such uncertainties. To achieve this, we first obtain semantic knowledge embeddings, and then these embeddings are used to generate clarifying questions by following an iterative process. The evaluation of our method shows that our approach is model agnostic, i.e., applicable to different semantic embedding models, and follow-up clarifications improve the performance regardless of the embedding model. Additionally, our ablation studies show the significance of informative clarifications and iterative predictions to enhance system accuracies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurate intra-operative Remaining Surgery Duration (RSD) predictions allow for anaesthetists to more accurately decide when to administer anaesthetic agents and drugs, as well as to notify hospital staff to send in the next patient. Therefore RSD plays an important role in improving patient care and minimising surgical theatre costs via efficient scheduling. In endoscopic pituitary surgery, it is uniquely challenging due to variable workflow sequences with a selection of optional steps contributing to high variability in surgery duration. This paper presents PitRSDNet for predicting RSD during pituitary surgery, a spatio-temporal neural network model that learns from historical data focusing on workflow sequences. PitRSDNet integrates workflow knowledge into RSD prediction in two forms: 1) multi-task learning for concurrently predicting step and RSD; and 2) incorporating prior steps as context in temporal learning and inference. PitRSDNet is trained and evaluated on a new endoscopic pituitary surgery dataset with 88 videos to show competitive performance improvements over previous statistical and machine learning methods. The findings also highlight how PitRSDNet improve RSD precision on outlier cases utilising the knowledge of prior steps.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As the foundation of large language models (LLMs), self-attention module faces the challenge of quadratic time and memory complexity with respect to sequence length. FlashAttention accelerates attention computation and reduces its memory usage by leveraging the GPU memory hierarchy. A promising research direction is to integrate FlashAttention with quantization methods. This paper introduces INT-FlashAttention, the first INT8 quantization architecture compatible with the forward workflow of FlashAttention, which significantly improves the inference speed of FlashAttention on Ampere GPUs. We implement our INT-FlashAttention prototype with fully INT8 activations and general matrix-multiplication (GEMM) kernels, making it the first attention operator with fully INT8 input. As a general token-level post-training quantization framework, INT-FlashAttention is also compatible with other data formats like INT4, etc. Experimental results show INT-FlashAttention achieves 72% faster inference speed and 82% smaller quantization error compared to standard FlashAttention with FP16 and FP8 data format.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Major search engine providers are rapidly incorporating Large Language Model (LLM)-generated content in response to user queries. These conversational search engines operate by loading retrieved website text into the LLM context for summarization and interpretation. Recent research demonstrates that LLMs are highly vulnerable to jailbreaking and prompt injection attacks, which disrupt the safety and quality goals of LLMs using adversarial strings. This work investigates the impact of prompt injections on the ranking order of sources referenced by conversational search engines. To this end, we introduce a focused dataset of real-world consumer product websites and formalize conversational search ranking as an adversarial problem. Experimentally, we analyze conversational search rankings in the absence of adversarial injections and show that different LLMs vary significantly in prioritizing product name, document content, and context position. We then present a tree-of-attacks-based jailbreaking technique which reliably promotes low-ranked products. Importantly, these attacks transfer effectively to state-of-the-art conversational search engines such as perplexity$.$ai. Given the strong financial incentive for website owners to boost their search ranking, we argue that our problem formulation is of critical importance for future robustness work.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in both industry and academia for various tasks, yet evaluating the consistency of generated text responses continues to be a challenge. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BLEU show a weak correlation with human judgment. More sophisticated metrics using Natural Language Inference (NLI) have shown improved correlations but are complex to implement, require domain-specific training due to poor cross-domain generalization, and lack explainability. More recently, prompt-based metrics using LLMs as evaluators have emerged; while they are easier to implement, they still lack explainability and depend on task-specific prompts, which limits their generalizability. This work introduces Automated eXplainable Consistency Evaluation using LLMs (AXCEL), a prompt-based consistency metric which offers explanations for the consistency scores by providing detailed reasoning and pinpointing inconsistent text spans. AXCEL is also a generalizable metric which can be adopted to multiple tasks without changing the prompt. AXCEL outperforms both non-prompt and prompt-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics in detecting inconsistencies across summarization by 8.7%, free text generation by 6.2%, and data-to-text conversion tasks by 29.4%. We also evaluate the influence of underlying LLMs on prompt based metric performance and recalibrate the SOTA prompt-based metrics with the latest LLMs for fair comparison. Further, we show that AXCEL demonstrates strong performance using open source LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized how we interact with technology, but their personalization to individual user preferences remains a significant challenge, particularly in on-device applications. Traditional methods often depend heavily on labeled datasets and can be resource-intensive. To address these issues, we present Adaptive Self-Supervised Learning Strategies (ASLS), which utilizes self-supervised learning techniques to personalize LLMs dynamically. The framework comprises a user profiling layer for collecting interaction data and a neural adaptation layer for real-time model fine-tuning. This innovative approach enables continuous learning from user feedback, allowing the model to generate responses that align closely with user-specific contexts. The adaptive mechanisms of ASLS minimize computational demands and enhance personalization efficiency. Experimental results across various user scenarios illustrate the superior performance of ASLS in boosting user engagement and satisfaction, highlighting its potential to redefine LLMs as highly responsive and context-aware systems on-device.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that capture the intensity changes asynchronously and output event streams with distinct advantages, such as high temporal resolution. To exploit event cameras for object/action recognition, existing methods predominantly sample and aggregate events in a second-level duration at every fixed temporal interval (or frequency). However, they often face difficulties in capturing the spatiotemporal relationships for longer, e.g., minute-level, events and generalizing across varying temporal frequencies. To fill the gap, we present a novel framework, dubbed PAST-SSM, exhibiting superior capacity in recognizing events with arbitrary duration (e.g., 0.1s to 4.5s) and generalizing to varying inference frequencies. Our key insight is to learn the spatiotemporal relationships from the encoded event features via the state space model (SSM) -- whose linear complexity makes it ideal for modeling high temporal resolution events with longer sequences. To achieve this goal, we first propose a Path-Adaptive Event Aggregation and Scan (PEAS) module to encode events of varying duration into features with fixed dimensions by adaptively scanning and selecting aggregated event frames. On top of PEAS, we introduce a novel Multi-faceted Selection Guiding (MSG) loss to minimize the randomness and redundancy of the encoded features. This subtly enhances the model generalization across different inference frequencies. Lastly, the SSM is employed to better learn the spatiotemporal properties from the encoded features. Moreover, we build a minute-level event-based recognition dataset, named ArDVS100, with arbitrary duration for the benefit of the community. Extensive experiments prove that our method outperforms prior arts by +3.45%, +0.38% and +8.31% on the DVS Action, SeAct and HARDVS datasets, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In environmental studies, realistic simulations are essential for understanding complex systems. Statistical emulation with Gaussian processes (GPs) in functional data models have become a standard tool for this purpose. Traditional centralized processing of such models requires substantial computational and storage resources, leading to emerging distributed Bayesian learning algorithms that partition data into shards for distributed computations. However, concerns about the sensitivity of distributed inference to shard selection arise. Instead of using data shards, our approach employs multiple random matrices to create random linear projections, or sketches, of the dataset. Posterior inference on functional data models is conducted using random data sketches on various machines in parallel. These individual inferences are combined across machines at a central server. The aggregation of inference across random matrices makes our approach resilient to the selection of data sketches, resulting in robust distributed Bayesian learning. An important advantage is its ability to maintain the privacy of sampling units, as random sketches prevent the recovery of raw data. We highlight the significance of our approach through simulation examples and showcase the performance of our approach as an emulator using surrogates of the Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) simulator - an important simulator for government agencies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we present an effective data augmentation framework leveraging the Large Language Model (LLM) and Diffusion Model (DM) to tackle the challenges inherent in data-scarce scenarios. Recently, DMs have opened up the possibility of generating synthetic images to complement a few training images. However, increasing the diversity of synthetic images also raises the risk of generating samples outside the target distribution. Our approach addresses this issue by embedding novel semantic information into text prompts via LLM and utilizing real images as visual prompts, thus generating semantically rich images. To ensure that the generated images remain within the target distribution, we dynamically adjust the guidance weight based on each image's CLIPScore to control the diversity. Experimental results show that our method produces synthetic images with enhanced diversity while maintaining adherence to the target distribution. Consequently, our approach proves to be more efficient in the few-shot setting on several benchmarks. Our code is available at https://github.com/kkyuhun94/dalda .

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Semantic relevance calculation is crucial for e-commerce search engines, as it ensures that the items selected closely align with customer intent. Inadequate attention to this aspect can detrimentally affect user experience and engagement. Traditional text-matching techniques are prevalent but often fail to capture the nuances of search intent accurately, so neural networks now have become a preferred solution to processing such complex text matching. Existing methods predominantly employ representation-based architectures, which strike a balance between high traffic capacity and low latency. However, they exhibit significant shortcomings in generalization and robustness when compared to interaction-based architectures. In this work, we introduce a robust interaction-based modeling paradigm to address these shortcomings. It encompasses 1) a dynamic length representation scheme for expedited inference, 2) a professional terms recognition method to identify subjects and core attributes from complex sentence structures, and 3) a contrastive adversarial training protocol to bolster the model's robustness and matching capabilities. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate the superior robustness and effectiveness of our approach, and online A/B testing confirms its ability to improve relevance in the same exposure position, resulting in more clicks and conversions. To the best of our knowledge, this method is the first interaction-based approach for large e-commerce search relevance calculation. Notably, we have deployed it for the entire search traffic on alibaba.com, the largest B2B e-commerce platform in the world.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Face Forgery Detection (FFD), or Deepfake detection, aims to determine whether a digital face is real or fake. Due to different face synthesis algorithms with diverse forgery patterns, FFD models often overfit specific patterns in training datasets, resulting in poor generalization to other unseen forgeries. This severe challenge requires FFD models to possess strong capabilities in representing complex facial features and extracting subtle forgery cues. Although previous FFD models directly employ existing backbones to represent and extract facial forgery cues, the critical role of backbones is often overlooked, particularly as their knowledge and capabilities are insufficient to address FFD challenges, inevitably limiting generalization. Therefore, it is essential to integrate the backbone pre-training configurations and seek practical solutions by revisiting the complete FFD workflow, from backbone pre-training and fine-tuning to inference of discriminant results. Specifically, we analyze the crucial contributions of backbones with different configurations in FFD task and propose leveraging the ViT network with self-supervised learning on real-face datasets to pre-train a backbone, equipping it with superior facial representation capabilities. We then build a competitive backbone fine-tuning framework that strengthens the backbone's ability to extract diverse forgery cues within a competitive learning mechanism. Moreover, we devise a threshold optimization mechanism that utilizes prediction confidence to improve the inference reliability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our FFD model with the elaborate backbone achieves excellent performance in FFD and extra face-related tasks, i.e., presentation attack detection.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We study estimation of large Dynamic Factor models implemented through the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, jointly with the Kalman smoother. We prove that as both the cross-sectional dimension, $n$, and the sample size, $T$, diverge to infinity: (i) the estimated loadings are $\sqrt T$-consistent, asymptotically normal and equivalent to their Quasi Maximum Likelihood estimates; (ii) the estimated factors are $\sqrt n$-consistent, asymptotically normal and equivalent to their Weighted Least Squares estimates. Moreover, the estimated loadings are asymptotically as efficient as those obtained by Principal Components analysis, while the estimated factors are more efficient if the idiosyncratic covariance is sparse enough.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4V, has led to significant advancements. However, these models still face challenges in medical multimodal capabilities due to limitations in the quantity and quality of medical vision-text data, stemming from data privacy concerns and high annotation costs. While pioneering approaches utilize PubMed's large-scale, de-identified medical image-text pairs to address these limitations, they still fall short due to inherent data noise. To tackle this, we refined medical image-text pairs from PubMed and employed MLLMs (GPT-4V) in an 'unblinded' capacity to denoise and reformat the data, resulting in the creation of the PubMedVision dataset with 1.3 million medical VQA samples. Our validation demonstrates that: (1) PubMedVision can significantly enhance the medical multimodal capabilities of current MLLMs, showing significant improvement in benchmarks including the MMMU Health & Medicine track; (2) manual checks by medical experts and empirical results validate the superior data quality of our dataset compared to other data construction methods. Using PubMedVision, we train a 34B medical MLLM HuatuoGPT-Vision, which shows superior performance in medical multimodal scenarios among open-source MLLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion generative models unlock new possibilities for inverse problems as they allow for the incorporation of strong empirical priors in scientific inference. Recently, diffusion models are repurposed for solving inverse problems using Gaussian approximations to conditional densities of the reverse process via Tweedie's formula to parameterise the mean, complemented with various heuristics. To address various challenges arising from these approximations, we leverage higher order information using Tweedie's formula and obtain a statistically principled approximation. We further provide a theoretical guarantee specifically for posterior sampling which can lead to a better theoretical understanding of diffusion-based conditional sampling. Finally, we illustrate the empirical effectiveness of our approach for general linear inverse problems on toy synthetic examples as well as image restoration. We show that our method (i) removes any time-dependent step-size hyperparameters required by earlier methods, (ii) brings stability and better sample quality across multiple noise levels, (iii) is the only method that works in a stable way with variance exploding (VE) forward processes as opposed to earlier works.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In regression-based analyses of group-level neuroimage data researchers typically fit a series of marginal general linear models to image outcomes at each spatially-referenced pixel. Spatial regularization of effects of interest is usually induced indirectly by applying spatial smoothing to the data during preprocessing. While this procedure often works well, resulting inference can be poorly calibrated. Spatial modeling of effects of interest leads to more powerful analyses, however the number of locations in a typical neuroimage can preclude standard computation with explicitly spatial models. Here we contribute a Bayesian spatial regression model for group-level neuroimaging analyses. We induce regularization of spatially varying regression coefficient functions through Gaussian process priors. When combined with a simple nonstationary model for the error process, our prior hierarchy can lead to more data-adaptive smoothing than standard methods. We achieve computational tractability through Vecchia approximation of our prior which, critically, can be constructed for a wide class of spatial correlation functions and results in prior models that retain full spatial rank. We outline several ways to work with our model in practice and compare performance against standard vertex-wise analyses. Finally we illustrate our method in an analysis of cortical surface fMRI task contrast data from a large cohort of children enrolled in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Neural Radiance Fields and Gaussian Splatting have transformed the field of computer vision by enabling photo-realistic representation of complex scenes. Despite this success, they have seen only limited use in real-world robotics tasks such as trajectory optimization. Two key factors have contributed to this limited success. First, it is challenging to reason about collisions in radiance models. Second, it is difficult to perform inference of radiance models fast enough for real-time trajectory synthesis. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing SPLANNING, a risk-aware trajectory optimizer that operates in a Gaussian Splatting model. This paper first derives a method for rigorously upper-bounding the probability of collision between a robot and a radiance field. Second, this paper introduces a normalized reformulation of Gaussian Splatting that enables the efficient computation of the collision bound in a Gaussian Splat. Third, a method is presented to optimize trajectories while avoiding collisions with a scene represented by a Gaussian Splat. Experiments demonstrate that SPLANNING outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating collision-free trajectories in highly cluttered environments. The proposed system is also tested on a real-world robot manipulator. A project page is available at https://roahmlab.github.io/splanning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing capability and widespread usage of large language models (LLMs) highlight the desirability of automatic detection of LLM-generated text. Zero-shot detectors, due to their training-free nature, have received considerable attention and notable success. In this paper, we identify a new feature, token cohesiveness, that is useful for zero-shot detection, and we demonstrate that LLM-generated text tends to exhibit higher token cohesiveness than human-written text. Based on this observation, we devise TOCSIN, a generic dual-channel detection paradigm that uses token cohesiveness as a plug-and-play module to improve existing zero-shot detectors. To calculate token cohesiveness, TOCSIN only requires a few rounds of random token deletion and semantic difference measurement, making it particularly suitable for a practical black-box setting where the source model used for generation is not accessible. Extensive experiments with four state-of-the-art base detectors on various datasets, source models, and evaluation settings demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed approach.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multilingual large language models (MLLMs), trained on multilingual balanced data, demonstrate better zero-shot learning performance in non-English languages compared to large language models trained on English-dominant data. However, the disparity in performance between English and non-English languages remains a challenge yet to be fully addressed. A distinctive characteristic of MLLMs is their high-quality translation capabilities, indicating an acquired proficiency in aligning between languages. This study explores how to enhance the zero-shot performance of MLLMs in non-English languages by leveraging their alignment capability between English and non-English languages. To achieve this, we first analyze the behavior of MLLMs when performing translation and reveal that there are large magnitude features that play a critical role in the translation process. Inspired by these findings, we retain the weights associated with operations involving the large magnitude features and prune other weights to force MLLMs to rely on these features for tasks beyond translation. We empirically demonstrate that this pruning strategy can enhance the MLLMs' performance in non-English language.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Moving object segmentation (MOS) in dynamic scenes is an important, challenging, but under-explored research topic for autonomous driving, especially for sequences obtained from moving ego vehicles. Most segmentation methods leverage motion cues obtained from optical flow maps. However, since these methods are often based on optical flows that are pre-computed from successive RGB frames, this neglects the temporal consideration of events occurring within the inter-frame, consequently constraining its ability to discern objects exhibiting relative staticity but genuinely in motion. To address these limitations, we propose to exploit event cameras for better video understanding, which provide rich motion cues without relying on optical flow. To foster research in this area, we first introduce a novel large-scale dataset called DSEC-MOS for moving object segmentation from moving ego vehicles, which is the first of its kind. For benchmarking, we select various mainstream methods and rigorously evaluate them on our dataset. Subsequently, we devise EmoFormer, a novel network able to exploit the event data. For this purpose, we fuse the event temporal prior with spatial semantic maps to distinguish genuinely moving objects from the static background, adding another level of dense supervision around our object of interest. Our proposed network relies only on event data for training but does not require event input during inference, making it directly comparable to frame-only methods in terms of efficiency and more widely usable in many application cases. The exhaustive comparison highlights a significant performance improvement of our method over all other methods. The source code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/ZZY-Zhou/DSEC-MOS.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Time-Sensitive Question Answering (TSQA) demands the effective utilization of specific temporal contexts, encompassing multiple time-evolving facts, to address time-sensitive questions. This necessitates not only the parsing of temporal information within questions but also the identification and understanding of time-evolving facts to generate accurate answers. However, current large language models still have limited sensitivity to temporal information and their inadequate temporal reasoning capabilities.In this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances temporal awareness and reasoning through Temporal Information-Aware Embedding and Granular Contrastive Reinforcement Learning. Experimental results on four TSQA datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing LLMs in TSQA tasks, marking a step forward in bridging the performance gap between machine and human temporal understanding and reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a challenging computational problem that typically requires to find collision-free paths for multiple agents in a shared environment. Solving MAPF optimally is NP-hard, yet efficient solutions are critical for numerous applications, including automated warehouses and transportation systems. Recently, learning-based approaches to MAPF have gained attention, particularly those leveraging deep reinforcement learning. Following current trends in machine learning, we have created a foundation model for the MAPF problems called MAPF-GPT. Using imitation learning, we have trained a policy on a set of pre-collected sub-optimal expert trajectories that can generate actions in conditions of partial observability without additional heuristics, reward functions, or communication with other agents. The resulting MAPF-GPT model demonstrates zero-shot learning abilities when solving the MAPF problem instances that were not present in the training dataset. We show that MAPF-GPT notably outperforms the current best-performing learnable-MAPF solvers on a diverse range of problem instances and is efficient in terms of computation (in the inference mode).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The fusion of Large Language Models (LLMs) and robotic systems has led to a transformative paradigm in the robotic field, offering unparalleled capabilities not only in the communication domain but also in skills like multimodal input handling, high-level reasoning, and plan generation. The grounding of LLMs knowledge into the empirical world has been considered a crucial pathway to exploit the efficiency of LLMs in robotics. Nevertheless, connecting LLMs' representations to the external world with multimodal approaches or with robots' bodies is not enough to let them understand the meaning of the language they are manipulating. Taking inspiration from humans, this work draws attention to three necessary elements for an agent to grasp and experience the world. The roadmap for LLMs grounding is envisaged in an active bodily system as the reference point for experiencing the environment, a temporally structured experience for a coherent, self-related interaction with the external world, and social skills to acquire a common-grounded shared experience.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce a novel Bayesian approach for variable selection using Gaussian process regression, which is crucial for enhancing interpretability and model regularization. Our method employs nearest neighbor Gaussian processes, serving as scalable approximations of classical Gaussian processes. Variable selection is achieved by conditioning the process mean and covariance function on a random set that represents the indices of contributing variables. A priori beliefs regarding this set control the variable selection, while reference priors are assigned to the remaining model parameters, ensuring numerical robustness in the process covariance matrix. We propose a Metropolis-Within-Gibbs algorithm for model inference. Evaluation using simulated data, a computer experiment approximation, and two real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> When operating in human environments, robots need to handle complex tasks while both adhering to social norms and accommodating individual preferences. For instance, based on common sense knowledge, a household robot can predict that it should avoid vacuuming during a social gathering, but it may still be uncertain whether it should vacuum before or after having guests. In such cases, integrating common-sense knowledge with human preferences, often conveyed through human explanations, is fundamental yet a challenge for existing systems. In this paper, we introduce GRACE, a novel approach addressing this while generating socially appropriate robot actions. GRACE leverages common sense knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs), and it integrates this knowledge with human explanations through a generative network architecture. The bidirectional structure of GRACE enables robots to refine and enhance LLM predictions by utilizing human explanations and makes robots capable of generating such explanations for human-specified actions. Our experimental evaluations show that integrating human explanations boosts GRACE's performance, where it outperforms several baselines and provides sensible explanations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have supplanted traditional methods in numerous natural language processing tasks. Nonetheless, in Named Entity Recognition (NER), existing LLM-based methods underperform compared to baselines and require significantly more computational resources, limiting their application. In this paper, we introduce the task of generation-based extraction and in-context classification (GEIC), designed to leverage LLMs' prior knowledge and self-attention mechanisms for NER tasks. We then propose CascadeNER, a universal and multilingual GEIC framework for few-shot and zero-shot NER. CascadeNER employs model cascading to utilize two small-parameter LLMs to extract and classify independently, reducing resource consumption while enhancing accuracy. We also introduce AnythingNER, the first NER dataset specifically designed for LLMs, including 8 languages, 155 entity types and a novel dynamic categorization system. Experiments show that CascadeNER achieves state-of-the-art performance on low-resource and fine-grained scenarios, including CrossNER and FewNERD. Our work is openly accessible.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Heuristics are commonly used to tackle diverse search and optimization problems. Design heuristics usually require tedious manual crafting with domain knowledge. Recent works have incorporated large language models (LLMs) into automatic heuristic search leveraging their powerful language and coding capacity. However, existing research focuses on the optimal performance on the target problem as the sole objective, neglecting other criteria such as efficiency and scalability, which are vital in practice. To tackle this challenge, we propose to model heuristic search as a multi-objective optimization problem and consider introducing other practical criteria beyond optimal performance. Due to the complexity of the search space, conventional multi-objective optimization methods struggle to effectively handle multi-objective heuristic search. We propose the first LLM-based multi-objective heuristic search framework, Multi-objective Evolution of Heuristic (MEoH), which integrates LLMs in a zero-shot manner to generate a non-dominated set of heuristics to meet multiple design criteria. We design a new dominance-dissimilarity mechanism for effective population management and selection, which incorporates both code dissimilarity in the search space and dominance in the objective space. MEoH is demonstrated in two well-known combinatorial optimization problems: the online Bin Packing Problem (BPP) and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Results indicate that a variety of elite heuristics are automatically generated in a single run, offering more trade-off options than existing methods. It successfully achieves competitive or superior performance while improving efficiency up to 10 times. Moreover, we also observe that the multi-objective search introduces novel insights into heuristic design and leads to the discovery of diverse heuristics.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in imitation learning, particularly with the integration of LLM techniques, are set to significantly improve robots' dexterity and adaptability. This paper proposes using Mamba, a state-of-the-art architecture with potential applications in LLMs, for robotic imitation learning, highlighting its ability to function as an encoder that effectively captures contextual information. By reducing the dimensionality of the state space, Mamba operates similarly to an autoencoder. It effectively compresses the sequential information into state variables while preserving the essential temporal dynamics necessary for accurate motion prediction. Experimental results in tasks such as cup placing and case loading demonstrate that despite exhibiting higher estimation errors, Mamba achieves superior success rates compared to Transformers in practical task execution. This performance is attributed to Mamba's structure, which encompasses the state space model. Additionally, the study investigates Mamba's capacity to serve as a real-time motion generator with a limited amount of training data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) create exciting possibilities for powerful language processing tools to accelerate research in materials science. While LLMs have great potential to accelerate materials understanding and discovery, they currently fall short in being practical materials science tools. In this position paper, we show relevant failure cases of LLMs in materials science that reveal current limitations of LLMs related to comprehending and reasoning over complex, interconnected materials science knowledge. Given those shortcomings, we outline a framework for developing Materials Science LLMs (MatSci-LLMs) that are grounded in materials science knowledge and hypothesis generation followed by hypothesis testing. The path to attaining performant MatSci-LLMs rests in large part on building high-quality, multi-modal datasets sourced from scientific literature where various information extraction challenges persist. As such, we describe key materials science information extraction challenges which need to be overcome in order to build large-scale, multi-modal datasets that capture valuable materials science knowledge. Finally, we outline a roadmap for applying future MatSci-LLMs for real-world materials discovery via: 1. Automated Knowledge Base Generation; 2. Automated In-Silico Material Design; and 3. MatSci-LLM Integrated Self-Driving Materials Laboratories.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> State-of-the-art (SOTA) visual object tracking methods have significantly enhanced the autonomy of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, in low-light conditions, the presence of irregular real noise from the environments severely degrades the performance of these SOTA methods. Moreover, existing SOTA denoising techniques often fail to meet the real-time processing requirements when deployed as plug-and-play denoisers for UAV tracking. To address this challenge, this work proposes a novel conditional generative denoiser (CGDenoiser), which breaks free from the limitations of traditional deterministic paradigms and generates the noise conditioning on the input, subsequently removing it. To better align the input dimensions and accelerate inference, a novel nested residual Transformer conditionalizer is developed. Furthermore, an innovative multi-kernel conditional refiner is designed to pertinently refine the denoised output. Extensive experiments show that CGDenoiser promotes the tracking precision of the SOTA tracker by 18.18\% on DarkTrack2021 whereas working 5.8 times faster than the second well-performed denoiser. Real-world tests with complex challenges also prove the effectiveness and practicality of CGDenoiser.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we address conditional testing problems through the conformal inference framework. We define the localized conformal p-values by inverting prediction intervals and prove their theoretical properties. These defined p-values are then applied to several conditional testing problems to illustrate their practicality. Firstly, we propose a conditional outlier detection procedure to test for outliers in the conditional distribution with finite-sample false discovery rate (FDR) control. We also introduce a novel conditional label screening problem with the goal of screening multivariate response variables and propose a screening procedure to control the family-wise error rate (FWER). Finally, we consider the two-sample conditional distribution test and define a weighted U-statistic through the aggregation of localized p-values. Numerical simulations and real-data examples validate the superior performance of our proposed strategies.

  Learning under Partial Observability</h2>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Optimal decision-making under partial observability requires reasoning about the uncertainty of the environment's hidden state. However, most reinforcement learning architectures handle partial observability with sequence models that have no internal mechanism to incorporate uncertainty in their hidden state representation, such as recurrent neural networks, deterministic state-space models and transformers. Inspired by advances in probabilistic world models for reinforcement learning, we propose a standalone Kalman filter layer that performs closed-form Gaussian inference in linear state-space models and train it end-to-end within a model-free architecture to maximize returns. Similar to efficient linear recurrent layers, the Kalman filter layer processes sequential data using a parallel scan, which scales logarithmically with the sequence length. By design, Kalman filter layers are a drop-in replacement for other recurrent layers in standard model-free architectures, but importantly they include an explicit mechanism for probabilistic filtering of the latent state representation. Experiments in a wide variety of tasks with partial observability show that Kalman filter layers excel in problems where uncertainty reasoning is key for decision-making, outperforming other stateful models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid growth of microcontroller-based IoT devices has opened up numerous applications, from smart manufacturing to personalized healthcare. Despite the widespread adoption of energy-efficient microcontroller units (MCUs) in the Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) domain, they still face significant limitations in terms of performance and memory (RAM, Flash). In this work, we combine approximate computing and software kernel design to accelerate the inference of approximate CNN models on MCUs. Our kernel-based approximation framework firstly unpacks the operands of each convolution layer and then conducts an offline calculation to determine the significance of each operand. Subsequently, through a design space exploration, it employs a computation skipping approximation strategy based on the calculated significance. Our evaluation on an STM32-Nucleo board and 2 popular CNNs trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset shows that, compared to state-of-the-art exact inference, our Pareto optimal solutions can feature on average 21% latency reduction with no degradation in Top-1 classification accuracy, while for lower accuracy requirements, the corresponding reduction becomes even more pronounced.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Peer review is an essential process to determine the quality of papers submitted to scientific conferences or journals. However, it is subjective and prone to biases. Several studies have been conducted to apply techniques from NLP to support peer review, but they are based on black-box techniques and their outputs are difficult to interpret and trust. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline to support and understand the reviewing and decision-making processes of peer review: the PeerArg system combining LLMs with methods from knowledge representation. PeerArg takes in input a set of reviews for a paper and outputs the paper acceptance prediction. We evaluate the performance of the PeerArg pipeline on three different datasets, in comparison with a novel end-2-end LLM that uses few-shot learning to predict paper acceptance given reviews. The results indicate that the end-2-end LLM is capable of predicting paper acceptance from reviews, but a variant of the PeerArg pipeline outperforms this LLM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern applications, such as autonomous vehicles, require deploying deep learning algorithms on resource-constrained edge devices for real-time image and video processing. However, there is limited understanding of the efficiency and performance of various object detection models on these devices. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art object detection models, including YOLOv8 (Nano, Small, Medium), EfficientDet Lite (Lite0, Lite1, Lite2), and SSD (SSD MobileNet V1, SSDLite MobileDet). We deployed these models on popular edge devices like the Raspberry Pi 3, 4, and 5 with/without TPU accelerators, and Jetson Orin Nano, collecting key performance metrics such as energy consumption, inference time, and Mean Average Precision (mAP). Our findings highlight that lower mAP models such as SSD MobileNet V1 are more energy-efficient and faster in inference, whereas higher mAP models like YOLOv8 Medium generally consume more energy and have slower inference, though with exceptions when accelerators like TPUs are used. Among the edge devices, Jetson Orin Nano stands out as the fastest and most energy-efficient option for request handling, despite having the highest idle energy consumption. These results emphasize the need to balance accuracy, speed, and energy efficiency when deploying deep learning models on edge devices, offering valuable guidance for practitioners and researchers selecting models and devices for their applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The climate crisis is a salient issue in online discussions, and hypocrisy accusations are a central rhetorical element in these debates. However, for large-scale text analysis, hypocrisy accusation detection is an understudied tool, most often defined as a smaller subtask of fallacious argument detection. In this paper, we define hypocrisy accusation detection as an independent task in NLP, and identify different relevant subtypes of hypocrisy accusations. Our Climate Hypocrisy Accusation Corpus (CHAC) consists of 420 Reddit climate debate comments, expert-annotated into two different types of hypocrisy accusations: personal versus political hypocrisy. We evaluate few-shot in-context learning with 6 shots and 3 instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) for detecting hypocrisy accusations in this dataset. Results indicate that the GPT-4o and Llama-3 models in particular show promise in detecting hypocrisy accusations (F1 reaching 0.68, while previous work shows F1 of 0.44). However, context matters for a complex semantic concept such as hypocrisy accusations, and we find models struggle especially at identifying political hypocrisy accusations compared to personal moral hypocrisy. Our study contributes new insights in hypocrisy detection and climate change discourse, and is a stepping stone for large-scale analysis of hypocrisy accusation in online climate debates.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Contemporary makeup approaches primarily hinge on unpaired learning paradigms, yet they grapple with the challenges of inaccurate supervision (e.g., face misalignment) and sophisticated facial prompts (including face parsing, and landmark detection). These challenges prohibit low-cost deployment of facial makeup models, especially on mobile devices. To solve above problems, we propose a brand-new learning paradigm, termed "Data Amplify Learning (DAL)," alongside a compact makeup model named "TinyBeauty." The core idea of DAL lies in employing a Diffusion-based Data Amplifier (DDA) to "amplify" limited images for the model training, thereby enabling accurate pixel-to-pixel supervision with merely a handful of annotations. Two pivotal innovations in DDA facilitate the above training approach: (1) A Residual Diffusion Model (RDM) is designed to generate high-fidelity detail and circumvent the detail vanishing problem in the vanilla diffusion models; (2) A Fine-Grained Makeup Module (FGMM) is proposed to achieve precise makeup control and combination while retaining face identity. Coupled with DAL, TinyBeauty necessitates merely 80K parameters to achieve a state-of-the-art performance without intricate face prompts. Meanwhile, TinyBeauty achieves a remarkable inference speed of up to 460 fps on the iPhone 13. Extensive experiments show that DAL can produce highly competitive makeup models using only 5 image pairs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reliable prediction of the All India Summer Monsoon Rainfall (AISMR) is pivotal for informed policymaking for the country, impacting the lives of billions of people. However, accurate simulation of AISMR has been a persistent challenge due to the complex interplay of various muti-scale factors and the inherent variability of the monsoon system. This research focuses on adapting and fine-tuning the latest LLM model, PatchTST, to accurately predict AISMR with a lead time of three months. The fine-tuned PatchTST model, trained with historical AISMR data, the Ni\~no3.4 index, and categorical Indian Ocean Dipole values, outperforms several popular neural network models and statistical models. This fine-tuned LLM model exhibits an exceptionally low RMSE percentage of 0.07% and a Spearman correlation of 0.976. This is particularly impressive, since it is nearly 80% more accurate than the best-performing NN models. The model predicts an above-normal monsoon for the year 2024, with an accumulated rainfall of 921.6 mm in the month of June-September for the entire country.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In-context learning (ICL) greatly improves the performance of large language models (LLMs) on various down-stream tasks, where the improvement highly depends on the quality of demonstrations. In this work, we introduce syntactic knowledge to select better in-context examples for machine translation (MT). We propose a new strategy, namely Syntax-augmented COverage-based In-context example selection (SCOI), leveraging the deep syntactic structure beyond conventional word matching. Specifically, we measure the set-level syntactic coverage by computing the coverage of polynomial terms with the help of a simplified tree-to-polynomial algorithm, and lexical coverage using word overlap. Furthermore, we devise an alternate selection approach to combine both coverage measures, taking advantage of syntactic and lexical information. We conduct experiments with two multi-lingual LLMs on six translation directions. Empirical results show that our proposed SCOI obtains the highest average COMET score among all learning-free methods, indicating that combining syntactic and lexical coverage successfully helps to select better in-context examples for MT.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, there has been a trend of evaluating the Large Language Model (LLM) quality in the flavor of LLM-as-a-Judge, namely leveraging another LLM to evaluate the current output quality. However, existing judges are proven to be biased, namely they would favor answers which present better superficial quality (such as verbosity, fluency) while ignoring the instruction following ability. In this work, we propose systematic research about the bias of LLM-as-a-Judge. Specifically, for closed-source judge models, we apply calibration to mitigate the significance of superficial quality, both on probability level and prompt level. For open-source judge models, we propose to mitigate the bias by contrastive training, with curated negative samples that deviate from instruction but present better superficial quality. We apply our methods on the bias evaluation benchmark, and experiment results show our methods mitigate the bias by a large margin while maintaining a satisfactory evaluation accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Automated red teaming is an effective method for identifying misaligned behaviors in large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches, however, often focus primarily on improving attack success rates while overlooking the need for comprehensive test case coverage. Additionally, most of these methods are limited to single-turn red teaming, failing to capture the multi-turn dynamics of real-world human-machine interactions. To overcome these limitations, we propose HARM (Holistic Automated Red teaMing), which scales up the diversity of test cases using a top-down approach based on an extensible, fine-grained risk taxonomy. Our method also leverages a novel fine-tuning strategy and reinforcement learning techniques to facilitate multi-turn adversarial probing in a human-like manner. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework enables a more systematic understanding of model vulnerabilities and offers more targeted guidance for the alignment process.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with tasks requiring mathematical reasoning, particularly multiple-choice questions (MCQs). To address this issue, we developed LLaMa-SciQ, an educational chatbot designed to assist college students in solving and understanding MCQs in STEM fields. We begin by fine-tuning and aligning the models to human preferences. After comparing the performance of Mistral-7B and LLaMa-8B, we selected the latter as the base model due to its higher evaluation accuracy. To further enhance accuracy, we implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and apply quantization to compress the model, reducing inference time and increasing accessibility for students. For mathematical reasoning, LLaMa-SciQ achieved 74.5% accuracy on the GSM8k dataset and 30% on the MATH dataset. However, RAG does not improve performance and even reduces it, likely due to retriever issues or the model's unfamiliarity with context. Despite this, the quantized model shows only a 5% loss in performance, demonstrating significant efficiency improvements.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, there has been increasing interest in applying large language models (LLMs) as zero-shot passage rankers. However, few studies have explored how to select appropriate in-context demonstrations for the passage ranking task, which is the focus of this paper. Previous studies mainly use LLM's feedback to train a retriever for demonstration selection. These studies apply the LLM to score each demonstration independently, which ignores the dependencies between demonstrations (especially important in ranking task), leading to inferior performance of top-$k$ retrieved demonstrations. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a demonstration reranker to rerank the retrieved demonstrations so that top-$k$ ranked ones are more suitable for ICL. However, generating training data for such reranker is quite challenging. On the one hand, different from demonstration retriever, the training samples of reranker need to incorporate demonstration dependencies. On the other hand, obtaining the gold ranking from the retrieved demonstrations is an NP-hard problem, which is hard to implement. To overcome these challenges, we propose a method to approximate the optimal demonstration list iteratively and utilize LLM to score demonstration lists of varying lengths. By doing so, the search space is greatly reduced and demonstration dependencies are considered. Based on these scored demonstration lists, we further design a list-pairwise training approach which compares a pair of lists that only differ in the last demonstration, to teach the reranker how to select the next demonstration given a previous sequence. In this paper, we propose a demonstration selection framework DemoRank for ranking task and conduct extensive experiments to prove its strong ability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Limited by the expensive labeling, polyp segmentation models are plagued by data shortages. To tackle this, we propose the mixed supervised polyp segmentation paradigm (MixPolyp). Unlike traditional models relying on a single type of annotation, MixPolyp combines diverse annotation types (mask, box, and scribble) within a single model, thereby expanding the range of available data and reducing labeling costs. To achieve this, MixPolyp introduces three novel supervision losses to handle various annotations: Subspace Projection loss (L_SP), Binary Minimum Entropy loss (L_BME), and Linear Regularization loss (L_LR). For box annotations, L_SP eliminates shape inconsistencies between the prediction and the supervision. For scribble annotations, L_BME provides supervision for unlabeled pixels through minimum entropy constraint, thereby alleviating supervision sparsity. Furthermore, L_LR provides dense supervision by enforcing consistency among the predictions, thus reducing the non-uniqueness. These losses are independent of the model structure, making them generally applicable. They are used only during training, adding no computational cost during inference. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate MixPolyp's effectiveness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> For data segmentation in high-dimensional linear regression settings, the regression parameters are often assumed to be sparse segment-wise, which enables many existing methods to estimate the parameters locally via $\ell_1$-regularised maximum likelihood-type estimation and then contrast them for change point detection. Contrary to this common practice, we show that the sparsity of neither regression parameters nor their differences, a.k.a. differential parameters, is necessary for consistency in multiple change point detection. In fact, both statistically and computationally, better efficiency is attained by a simple strategy that scans for large discrepancies in local covariance between the regressors and the response. We go a step further and propose a suite of tools for directly inferring about the differential parameters post-segmentation, which are applicable even when the regression parameters themselves are non-sparse. Theoretical investigations are conducted under general conditions permitting non-Gaussianity, temporal dependence and ultra-high dimensionality. Numerical results from simulated and macroeconomic datasets demonstrate the competitiveness and efficacy of the proposed methods. Implementation of all methods is provided in the R package inferchange on GitHub.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a superior ability to serve as ranking models. However, concerns have arisen as LLMs will exhibit discriminatory ranking behaviors based on users' sensitive attributes (\eg gender). Worse still, in this paper, we identify a subtler form of discrimination in LLMs, termed \textit{implicit ranking unfairness}, where LLMs exhibit discriminatory ranking patterns based solely on non-sensitive user profiles, such as user names. Such implicit unfairness is more widespread but less noticeable, threatening the ethical foundation. To comprehensively explore such unfairness, our analysis will focus on three research aspects: (1) We propose an evaluation method to investigate the severity of implicit ranking unfairness. (2) We uncover the reasons for causing such unfairness. (3) To mitigate such unfairness effectively, we utilize a pair-wise regression method to conduct fair-aware data augmentation for LLM fine-tuning. The experiment demonstrates that our method outperforms existing approaches in ranking fairness, achieving this with only a small reduction in accuracy. Lastly, we emphasize the need for the community to identify and mitigate the implicit unfairness, aiming to avert the potential deterioration in the reinforced human-LLMs ecosystem deterioration.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Automatic keyphrase labelling stands for the ability of models to retrieve words or short phrases that adequately describe documents' content. Previous work has put much effort into exploring extractive techniques to address this task; however, these methods cannot produce keyphrases not found in the text. Given this limitation, keyphrase generation approaches have arisen lately. This paper presents a keyphrase generation model based on the Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) architecture. Having a document's title and abstract as input, we learn a T5 model to generate keyphrases which adequately define its content. We name this model docT5keywords. We not only perform the classic inference approach, where the output sequence is directly selected as the predicted values, but we also report results from a majority voting approach. In this approach, multiple sequences are generated, and the keyphrases are ranked based on their frequency of occurrence across these sequences. Along with this model, we present a novel keyphrase filtering technique based on the T5 architecture. We train a T5 model to learn whether a given keyphrase is relevant to a document. We devise two evaluation methodologies to prove our model's capability to filter inadequate keyphrases. First, we perform a binary evaluation where our model has to predict if a keyphrase is relevant for a given document. Second, we filter the predicted keyphrases by several AKG models and check if the evaluation scores are improved. Experimental results demonstrate that our keyphrase generation model significantly outperforms all the baselines, with gains exceeding 100\% in some cases. The proposed filtering technique also achieves near-perfect accuracy in eliminating false positives across all datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Translating Natural Language Queries into Structured Query Language (Text-to-SQL or NLQ-to-SQL) is a critical task extensively studied by both the natural language processing and database communities, aimed at providing a natural language interface to databases (NLIDB) and lowering the barrier for non-experts. Despite recent advancements made through the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), significant challenges remain. These include handling complex database schemas, resolving ambiguity in user queries, and generating SQL queries with intricate structures that accurately reflect the user's intent. In this work, we introduce E-SQL, a novel pipeline specifically designed to address these challenges through direct schema linking and candidate predicate augmentation. E-SQL enhances the natural language query by incorporating relevant database items (i.e., tables, columns, and values) and conditions directly into the question, bridging the gap between the query and the database structure. The pipeline leverages candidate predicate augmentation to mitigate erroneous or incomplete predicates in generated SQLs. We further investigate the impact of schema filtering, a technique widely explored in previous work, and demonstrate its diminishing returns when applied alongside advanced large language models. Comprehensive evaluations on the BIRD benchmark illustrate that E-SQL achieves competitive performance, particularly excelling in complex queries with a 66.29% execution accuracy on the test set. All code required to reproduce the reported results is publicly available on our GitHub repository.

We propose a new efficient motion prediction model, which achieves highly competitive benchmark results while training only a few hours on a single GPU. Due to our lightweight architectural choices and the focus on reducing the required training resources, our model can easily be applied to custom datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Tensor Networks (TNs) are a computational paradigm used for representing quantum many-body systems. Recent works have shown how TNs can also be applied to perform Machine Learning (ML) tasks, yielding comparable results to standard supervised learning techniques. In this work, we study the use of Tree Tensor Networks (TTNs) in high-frequency real-time applications by exploiting the low-latency hardware of the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology. We present different implementations of TTN classifiers, capable of performing inference on classical ML datasets as well as on complex physics data. A preparatory analysis of bond dimensions and weight quantization is realized in the training phase, together with entanglement entropy and correlation measurements, that help setting the choice of the TTN architecture. The generated TTNs are then deployed on a hardware accelerator; using an FPGA integrated into a server, the inference of the TTN is completely offloaded. Eventually, a classifier for High Energy Physics (HEP) applications is implemented and executed fully pipelined with sub-microsecond latency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present initial results of a forthcoming benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on white-collar tasks of economic value. We evaluate agents on real-world "messy" open-web research tasks of the type that are routine in finance and consulting. In doing so, we lay the groundwork for an LLM agent evaluation suite where good performance directly corresponds to a large economic and societal impact. We built and tested several agent architectures with o1-preview, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1 (405b), and GPT-4o-mini. On average, LLM agents powered by Claude-3.5 Sonnet and o1-preview substantially outperformed agents using GPT-4o, with agents based on Llama 3.1 (405b) and GPT-4o-mini lagging noticeably behind. Across LLMs, a ReAct architecture with the ability to delegate subtasks to subagents performed best. In addition to quantitative evaluations, we qualitatively assessed the performance of the LLM agents by inspecting their traces and reflecting on their observations. Our evaluation represents the first in-depth assessment of agents' abilities to conduct challenging, economically valuable analyst-style research on the real open web.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present a surrogate numerical-relativity model for close hyperbolic black-hole encounters with equal masses and spins aligned with the orbital momentum. Our model, generated in terms of the Newman-Penrose scalar $\psi_4$, spans impact parameters $b/M\in [11, 15]$ and spin components $\chi_{i} \in [-0.5,0.5]$, modeling the $(\ell,m)=(2,0)$, $(2, \pm 2)$, $(3,\pm 2)$ and $(4,\pm 4)$ emission multipoles. The model is faithful to numerical relativity simulations, yielding mismatches lower than $10^{-3}$. We test the ability of our model to recover the parameters of numerically simulated signals. We find that, despite the high accuracy of the model, parameter inference struggles to correctly capture the parameters of the source even for SNRs as large as 50 due to the strong degeneracies present in the parameter space. This indicates that correctly identifying these systems will require of extremely large signal loudness, only typical of third generation detectors. Nevertheless, we also find that, if one attempts to infer certain combinations of such degenerated parameters, there might be a chance to prove the existence of this type of events, even with the current ground-based detectors, as long as these combinations make sense astrophysically and cosmologically.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Test smells arise from poor design practices and insufficient domain knowledge, which can lower the quality of test code and make it harder to maintain and update. Manually refactoring test smells is time-consuming and error-prone, highlighting the necessity for automated approaches. Current rule-based refactoring methods often struggle in scenarios not covered by predefined rules and lack the flexibility needed to handle diverse cases effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called UTRefactor, a context-enhanced, LLM-based framework for automatic test refactoring in Java projects. UTRefactor extracts relevant context from test code and leverages an external knowledge base that includes test smell definitions, descriptions, and DSL-based refactoring rules. By simulating the manual refactoring process through a chain-of-thought approach, UTRefactor guides the LLM to eliminate test smells in a step-by-step process, ensuring both accuracy and consistency throughout the refactoring. Additionally, we implement a checkpoint mechanism to facilitate comprehensive refactoring, particularly when multiple smells are present. We evaluate UTRefactor on 879 tests from six open-source Java projects, reducing the number of test smells from 2,375 to 265, achieving an 89% reduction. UTRefactor outperforms direct LLM-based refactoring methods by 61.82% in smell elimination and significantly surpasses the performance of a rule-based test smell refactoring tool. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of UTRefactor in enhancing test code quality while minimizing manual involvement.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Stories about overcoming personal struggles can effectively illustrate the application of psychological theories in real life, yet they may fail to resonate with individuals' experiences. In this work, we employ large language models (LLMs) to create tailored narratives that acknowledge and address unique challenging thoughts and situations faced by individuals. Our study, involving 346 young adults across two settings, demonstrates that LLM-enhanced stories were perceived to be better than human-written ones in conveying key takeaways, promoting reflection, and reducing belief in negative thoughts. These stories were not only seen as more relatable but also similarly authentic to human-written ones, highlighting the potential of LLMs in helping young adults manage their struggles. The findings of this work provide crucial design considerations for future narrative-based digital mental health interventions, such as the need to maintain relatability without veering into implausibility and refining the wording and tone of AI-enhanced content.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Role-playing systems powered by large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly influential in emotional communication applications. However, these systems are susceptible to character hallucinations, where the model deviates from predefined character roles and generates responses that are inconsistent with the intended persona. This paper presents the first systematic analysis of character hallucination from an attack perspective, introducing the RoleBreak framework. Our framework identifies two core mechanisms-query sparsity and role-query conflict-as key factors driving character hallucination. Leveraging these insights, we construct a novel dataset, RoleBreakEval, to evaluate existing hallucination mitigation techniques. Our experiments reveal that even enhanced models trained to minimize hallucination remain vulnerable to attacks. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose a novel defence strategy, the Narrator Mode, which generates supplemental context through narration to mitigate role-query conflicts and improve query generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that Narrator Mode significantly outperforms traditional refusal-based strategies by reducing hallucinations, enhancing fidelity to character roles and queries, and improving overall narrative coherence.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have recently gained much interest due to their ability to avoid excessive inference costs. However, LoRA still encounters the following challenges: (1) Limitation of low-rank assumption; and (2) Its initialization method may be suboptimal. To this end, we propose PMSS(Pre-trained Matrices Skeleton Selection), which enables high-rank updates with low costs while leveraging semantic and linguistic information inherent in pre-trained weight. It achieves this by selecting skeletons from the pre-trained weight matrix and only learning a small matrix instead. Experiments demonstrate that PMSS outperforms LoRA and other fine-tuning methods across tasks with much less trainable parameters. We demonstrate its effectiveness, especially in handling complex tasks such as DROP benchmark(+3.4%/+5.9% on LLaMA2-7B/13B) and math reasoning(+12.89%/+5.61%/+3.11% on LLaMA2-7B, Mistral-7B and Gemma-7B of GSM8K). The code and model will be released soon.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language and vision models (LLVMs) have been driven by the generalization power of large language models (LLMs) and the advent of visual instruction tuning. Along with scaling them up directly, these models enable LLVMs to showcase powerful vision language (VL) performances by covering diverse tasks via natural language instructions. However, existing open-source LLVMs that perform comparably to closed-source LLVMs such as GPT-4V are often considered too large (e.g., 26B, 34B, and 110B parameters), having a larger number of layers. These large models demand costly, high-end resources for both training and inference. To address this issue, we present a new efficient LLVM family with 1.8B, 3.8B, and 7B LLM model sizes, Traversal of Layers (TroL), which enables the reuse of layers in a token-wise manner. This layer traversing technique simulates the effect of looking back and retracing the answering stream while increasing the number of forward propagation layers without physically adding more layers. We demonstrate that TroL employs a simple layer traversing approach yet efficiently outperforms the open-source LLVMs with larger model sizes and rivals the performances of the closed-source LLVMs with substantial sizes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Whereas the power of reservoir computing (RC) in inferring chaotic systems has been well established in the literature, the studies are mostly restricted to mono-functional machines where the training and testing data are acquired from the same attractor. Here, using the strategies of attractor labeling and trajectory separation, we propose a new scheme of RC capable of learning multiple attractors generated by entirely different dynamics, namely multi-functional RC. Specifically, we demonstrate that by incorporating a label channel into the standard RC, a single machine is able to learn from data the dynamics of multiple chaotic attractors, while each attractor can be accurately retrieved by inputting just a scalar in the prediction phase. The dependence of the machine performance on the labeling and separation parameters is investigated, and it is found that the machine performance is optimized when the parameters take intermediate values. The working mechanism of multi-functional RC is analyzed by the method of functional networks in neuroscience, and it is revealed that each attractor is represented by a stable, unique functional network in the reservoir, and the optimal performance arises as a balance between the stability, complexity, and distinguishability of the functional networks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Uncovering early-stage metrics that reflect final model performance is one core principle for large-scale pretraining. The existing scaling law demonstrates the power-law correlation between pretraining loss and training flops, which serves as an important indicator of the current training state for large language models. However, this principle only focuses on the model's compression properties on the training data, resulting in an inconsistency with the ability improvements on the downstream tasks. Some follow-up works attempted to extend the scaling-law to more complex metrics (such as hyperparameters), but still lacked a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic differences among various capabilities during pretraining. To address the aforementioned limitations, this paper undertakes a comprehensive comparison of model capabilities at various pretraining intermediate checkpoints. Through this analysis, we confirm that specific downstream metrics exhibit similar training dynamics across models of different sizes, up to 67 billion parameters. In addition to our core findings, we've reproduced Amber and OpenLLaMA, releasing their intermediate checkpoints. This initiative offers valuable resources to the research community and facilitates the verification and exploration of LLM pretraining by open-source researchers. Besides, we provide empirical summaries, including performance comparisons of different models and capabilities, and tuition of key metrics for different training phases. Based on these findings, we provide a more user-friendly strategy for evaluating the optimization state, offering guidance for establishing a stable pretraining process.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the post-Turing era, evaluating large language models (LLMs) involves assessing generated text based on readers' reactions rather than merely its indistinguishability from human-produced content. This paper explores how LLM-generated text impacts readers' decisions, focusing on both amateur and expert audiences. Our findings indicate that GPT-4 can generate persuasive analyses affecting the decisions of both amateurs and professionals. Furthermore, we evaluate the generated text from the aspects of grammar, convincingness, logical coherence, and usefulness. The results highlight a high correlation between real-world evaluation through audience reactions and the current multi-dimensional evaluators commonly used for generative models. Overall, this paper shows the potential and risk of using generated text to sway human decisions and also points out a new direction for evaluating generated text, i.e., leveraging the reactions and decisions of readers. We release our dataset to assist future research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Open-source third-party libraries are widely used in software development. These libraries offer substantial advantages in terms of time and resource savings. However, a significant concern arises due to the publicly disclosed vulnerabilities within these libraries. Existing automated vulnerability detection tools often suffer from false positives and fail to accurately assess the propagation of inputs capable of triggering vulnerabilities from client projects to vulnerable code in libraries. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called VULEUT (Vulnerability Exploit Unit Test Generation), which combines vulnerability exploitation reachability analysis and LLM-based unit test generation. VULEUT is designed to automatically verify the exploitability of vulnerabilities in third-party libraries commonly used in client software projects. VULEUT first analyzes the client projects to determine the reachability of vulnerability conditions. And then, it leverages the Large Language Model (LLM) to generate unit tests for vulnerability confirmation. To evaluate the effectiveness of VULEUT, we collect 32 vulnerabilities from various third-party libraries and conduct experiments on 70 real client projects. Besides, we also compare our approach with two representative tools, i.e., TRANSFER and VESTA. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of VULEUT, with 229 out of 292 generated unit tests successfully confirming vulnerability exploitation across 70 client projects, which outperforms baselines by 24%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The impressive performances of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their immense potential for commercialization have given rise to serious concerns over the Intellectual Property (IP) of their training data. In particular, the synthetic texts generated by LLMs may infringe the IP of the data being used to train the LLMs. To this end, it is imperative to be able to perform source attribution by identifying the data provider who contributed to the generation of a synthetic text by an LLM. In this paper, we show that this problem can be tackled by watermarking, i.e., by enabling an LLM to generate synthetic texts with embedded watermarks that contain information about their source(s). We identify the key properties of such watermarking frameworks (e.g., source attribution accuracy, robustness against adversaries), and propose a source attribution framework that satisfies these key properties due to our algorithmic designs. Our framework enables an LLM to learn an accurate mapping from the generated texts to data providers, which sets the foundation for effective source attribution. Extensive empirical evaluations show that our framework achieves effective source attribution.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Time spent by academics on research quality assessment might be reduced if automated approaches can help. Whilst citation-based indicators have been extensively developed and evaluated for this, they have substantial limitations and Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT provide an alternative approach. This article assesses whether ChatGPT 4o-mini can be used to estimate the quality of journal articles across academia. It samples up to 200 articles from all 34 Units of Assessment (UoAs) in the UK's Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2021, comparing ChatGPT scores with departmental average scores. There was an almost universally positive Spearman correlation between ChatGPT scores and departmental averages, varying between 0.08 (Philosophy) and 0.78 (Psychology, Psychiatry and Neuroscience), except for Clinical Medicine (rho=-0.12). Although other explanations are possible, especially because REF score profiles are public, the results suggest that LLMs can provide reasonable research quality estimates in most areas of science, and particularly the physical and health sciences and engineering, even before citation data is available. Nevertheless, ChatGPT assessments seem to be more positive for most health and physical sciences than for other fields, a concern for multidisciplinary assessments, and the ChatGPT scores are only based on titles and abstracts, so cannot be research evaluations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in natural language processing, showcasing exceptional performance across various tasks. However, the expensive memory and computational requirements present significant challenges for their practical deployment. Low-bit quantization has emerged as a critical approach to mitigate these challenges by reducing the bit-width of model parameters, activations, and gradients, thus decreasing memory usage and computational demands. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of low-bit quantization methods tailored for LLMs, covering the fundamental principles, system implementations, and algorithmic strategies. An overview of basic concepts and new data formats specific to low-bit LLMs is first introduced, followed by a review of frameworks and systems that facilitate low-bit LLMs across various hardware platforms. Then, we categorize and analyze techniques and toolkits for efficient low-bit training and inference of LLMs. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of future trends and potential advancements of low-bit LLMs. Our systematic overview from basic, system, and algorithm perspectives can offer valuable insights and guidelines for future works to enhance the efficiency and applicability of LLMs through low-bit quantization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Long-term memory is significant for agents, in which insights play a crucial role. However, the emergence of irrelevant insight and the lack of general insight can greatly undermine the effectiveness of insight. To solve this problem, in this paper, we introduce Multi-Scale Insight Agent (MSI-Agent), an embodied agent designed to improve LLMs' planning and decision-making ability by summarizing and utilizing insight effectively across different scales. MSI achieves this through the experience selector, insight generator, and insight selector. Leveraging a three-part pipeline, MSI can generate task-specific and high-level insight, store it in a database, and then use relevant insight from it to aid in decision-making. Our experiments show that MSI outperforms another insight strategy when planning by GPT3.5. Moreover, We delve into the strategies for selecting seed experience and insight, aiming to provide LLM with more useful and relevant insight for better decision-making. Our observations also indicate that MSI exhibits better robustness when facing domain-shifting scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Although much progress has been made in the theory and application of bootstrap approximations for max statistics in high dimensions, the literature has largely been restricted to cases involving light-tailed data. To address this issue, we propose an approach to inference based on robust max statistics, and we show that their distributions can be accurately approximated via bootstrapping when the data are both high-dimensional and heavy-tailed. In particular, the data are assumed to satisfy an extended version of the well-established $L^{4}$-$L^2$ moment equivalence condition, as well as a weak variance decay condition. In this setting, we show that near-parametric rates of bootstrap approximation can be achieved in the Kolmogorov metric, independently of the data dimension. Moreover, this theoretical result is complemented by favorable empirical results involving both synthetic data and an application to financial data.

Despite success on multiple benchmarks, they have yet to be compared and their synergy remains unexplored. In this paper, we identify different strengths and weaknesses through evaluating state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets: Text-to-SQL demonstrates superiority in handling questions involving arithmetic operations and long tables; E2E TQA excels in addressing ambiguous questions, non-standard table schema, and complex table contents. To combine both strengths, we propose a Synergistic Table-based Question Answering approach that integrate different models via answer selection, which is agnostic to any model types. Further experiments validate that ensembling models by either feature-based or LLM-based answer selector significantly improves the performance over individual models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, Recommender Systems (RS) have witnessed a transformative shift with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Models such as GPT-3.5/4, Llama, have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. The extensive information pre-trained by these LLMs allows for the potential to capture a more profound semantic representation from different contextual information of users and items.   While the great potential lies behind the thriving of LLMs, the challenge of leveraging user-item preferences from contextual information and its alignment with the improvement of Recommender Systems needs to be addressed. Believing that a better understanding of the user or item itself can be the key factor in improving recommendation performance, we conduct research on generating informative profiles using state-of-the-art LLMs.   To boost the linguistic abilities of LLMs in Recommender Systems, we introduce the Prompting-Based Representation Learning Method for Recommendation (P4R). In our P4R framework, we utilize the LLM prompting strategy to create personalized item profiles. These profiles are then transformed into semantic representation spaces using a pre-trained BERT model for text embedding. Furthermore, we incorporate a Graph Convolution Network (GCN) for collaborative filtering representation. The P4R framework aligns these two embedding spaces in order to address the general recommendation tasks. In our evaluation, we compare P4R with state-of-the-art Recommender models and assess the quality of prompt-based profile generation.

It is important to assess the influence of different types of biases embedded in LLMs to ensure fair use in sensitive fields. Although there have been extensive works on bias assessment in English, such efforts are rare and scarce for a major language like Bangla. In this work, we examine two types of social biases in LLM generated outputs for Bangla language. Our main contributions in this work are: (1) bias studies on two different social biases for Bangla (2) a curated dataset for bias measurement benchmarking (3) testing two different probing techniques for bias detection in the context of Bangla. This is the first work of such kind involving bias assessment of LLMs for Bangla to the best of our knowledge. All our code and resources are publicly available for the progress of bias related research in Bangla NLP.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> By inducing privacy attacks on NLP models, attackers can obtain sensitive information such as training data and model parameters, etc. Although researchers have studied, in-depth, several kinds of attacks in NLP models, they are non-systematic analyses. It lacks a comprehensive understanding of the impact caused by the attacks. For example, we must consider which scenarios can apply to which attacks, what the common factors are that affect the performance of different attacks, the nature of the relationships between different attacks, and the influence of various datasets and models on the effectiveness of the attacks, etc. Therefore, we need a benchmark to holistically assess the privacy risks faced by NLP models. In this paper, we present a privacy attack and defense evaluation benchmark in the field of NLP, which includes the conventional/small models and large language models (LLMs). This benchmark supports a variety of models, datasets, and protocols, along with standardized modules for comprehensive evaluation of attacks and defense strategies. Based on the above framework, we present a study on the association between auxiliary data from different domains and the strength of privacy attacks. And we provide an improved attack method in this scenario with the help of Knowledge Distillation (KD). Furthermore, we propose a chained framework for privacy attacks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Compared with Large Language Models (LLMs), Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can also accept images as input, thus showcasing more interesting emergent capabilities and demonstrating impressive performance on various vision-language tasks. Motivated by text prompting in LLMs, visual prompting has been explored to enhance LVLMs' capabilities of perceiving visual information. However, previous visual prompting techniques solely process visual inputs without considering text queries, limiting the models' ability to follow text instructions to complete tasks. To fill this gap, in this work, we propose a new prompting technique named Attention Prompting on Image, which just simply overlays a text-query-guided attention heatmap on the original input image and effectively enhances LVLM on various tasks. Specifically, we generate an attention heatmap for the input image dependent on the text query with an auxiliary model like CLIP. Then the heatmap simply multiplies the pixel values of the original image to obtain the actual input image for the LVLM. Extensive experiments on various vison-language benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our technique. For example, Attention Prompting on Image improves LLaVA-1.5 by 3.8% and 2.9% on MM-Vet and LLaVA-Wild benchmarks, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While the language modeling objective has been shown to be deeply connected with compression, it is surprising that modern LLMs are not employed in practical text compression systems. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of neural network and transformer-based compression techniques to answer this question. We compare traditional text compression systems with neural network and LLM-based text compression methods. Although LLM-based systems significantly outperform conventional compression methods, they are highly impractical. Specifically, LLMZip, a recent text compression system using Llama3-8B requires 9.5 days to compress just 10 MB of text, although with huge improvements in compression ratios. To overcome this, we present FineZip - a novel LLM-based text compression system that combines ideas of online memorization and dynamic context to reduce the compression time immensely. FineZip can compress the above corpus in approximately 4 hours compared to 9.5 days, a 54 times improvement over LLMZip and comparable performance. FineZip outperforms traditional algorithmic compression methods with a large margin, improving compression ratios by approximately 50\%. With this work, we take the first step towards making lossless text compression with LLMs a reality. While FineZip presents a significant step in that direction, LLMs are still not a viable solution for large-scale text compression. We hope our work paves the way for future research and innovation to solve this problem.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled LLM-based agents to directly interact with application user interfaces (UIs), enhancing agents' performance in complex tasks. However, these agents often suffer from high latency and low reliability due to the extensive sequential UI interactions. To address this issue, we propose AXIS, a novel LLM-based agents framework prioritize actions through application programming interfaces (APIs) over UI actions. This framework also facilitates the creation and expansion of APIs through automated exploration of applications. Our experiments on Office Word demonstrate that AXIS reduces task completion time by 65%-70% and cognitive workload by 38%-53%, while maintaining accuracy of 97%-98% compare to humans. Our work contributes to a new human-agent-computer interaction (HACI) framework and a fresh UI design principle for application providers in the era of LLMs. It also explores the possibility of turning every applications into agents, paving the way towards an agent-centric operating system (Agent OS).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) into power systems requires the deployment of grid-forming inverters to ensure a stable operation. Accurate modeling of these devices is necessary. In this paper, a system identification approach to obtain low-dimensional models of grid-forming inverters is presented. The proposed approach is based on a Hammerstein-Wiener parametrization of the normal-form model. The normal-form is a gray-box model that utilizes complex frequency and phase to capture non-linear inverter dynamics. The model is validated on two well-known control strategies: droop-control and dispatchable virtual oscillators. Simulations and hardware-in-the-loop experiments demonstrate that the normal-form accurately models inverter dynamics across various operating conditions. The approach shows great potential for enhancing the modeling of RES-dominated power systems, especially when component models are unavailable or computationally expensive.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the aim of enabling robots to cooperate with humans, carry out human-like tasks, or navigate among humans, we need to ensure that they are equipped with the ability to comprehend human behaviors and use the extracted knowledge for intelligent decision-making. This ability is particularly important in the safety-critical and human-centred environment of health-care institutions. In the field of robotic navigation, the most cutting-edge approaches to enhancing robot reliability in the application domain of healthcare facilities and in general pertain to augmenting navigation systems with human-aware properties. To implement this in our work, the Co-operative Human-Aware Navigation planner has been integrated into the ROS-based differential-drive robot MARRtina and exhaustively challenged within various simulated contexts and scenarios (mainly modelling the situations relevant in the medical domain) to draw attention to the integrated system's benefits and identify its drawbacks or instances of poor performance while exploring the scope of system capabilities and creating a full characterization of its applicability. The simulation results are then presented to medical experts, and the enhanced robot acceptability within the domain is validated with them as the robot is further planned for deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language model pre-training has traditionally relied on human experts to craft heuristics for improving the corpora quality, resulting in numerous rules developed to date. However, these rules lack the flexibility to address the unique characteristics of individual example effectively. Meanwhile, applying tailored rules to every example is impractical for human experts. In this paper, we demonstrate that even small language models, with as few as 0.3B parameters, can exhibit substantial data refining capabilities comparable to those of human experts. We introduce Programming Every Example (ProX), a novel framework that treats data refinement as a programming task, enabling models to refine corpora by generating and executing fine-grained operations, such as string normalization, for each individual example at scale. Experimental results show that models pre-trained on ProX-curated data outperform either original data or data filtered by other selection methods by more than 2% across various downstream benchmarks. Its effectiveness spans various model sizes and pre-training corpora, including C4, RedPajama-V2, and FineWeb. Furthermore, ProX exhibits significant potential in domain-specific continual pre-training: without domain specific design, models trained on OpenWebMath refined by ProX outperform human-crafted rule-based methods, improving average accuracy by 7.6% over Mistral-7B, with 14.6% for Llama-2-7B and 20.3% for CodeLlama-7B, all within 10B tokens to be comparable to models like Llemma-7B trained on 200B tokens. Further analysis highlights that ProX significantly saves training FLOPs, offering a promising path for efficient LLM pre-training.We are open-sourcing ProX with >100B corpus, models, and sharing all training and implementation details for reproducible research and future innovation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We identify "stable regions" in the residual stream of Transformers, where the model's output remains insensitive to small activation changes, but exhibits high sensitivity at region boundaries. These regions emerge during training and become more defined as training progresses or model size increases. The regions appear to be much larger than previously studied polytopes. Our analysis suggests that these stable regions align with semantic distinctions, where similar prompts cluster within regions, and activations from the same region lead to similar next token predictions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper investigates the structural functional observability (SFO) and structural output controllability (SOC) of a class of systems with generically diagonalizable state matrices and explores the associated minimal sensor and actuator placement problems. The verification of SOC and the corresponding sensor and actuator placement problems, i.e., the problems of determining the minimum number of outputs and inputs required to achieve SFO and SOC, respectively, are yet open for general systems, which motivates our focus on a class of systems enabling polynomial-time solutions. In this line, we first define and characterize generically diagonalizable systems, referring to structured systems for which almost all realizations of the state matrices are diagonalizable. We then develop computationally efficient criteria for SFO and SOC within the context of generically diagonalizable systems. Our work expands the class of systems amenable to polynomial-time SOC verification. Thanks to the simplicity of the obtained criteria, we derive closed-form solutions for determining the minimal sensor placement to achieve SFO and the minimal actuator deployment to achieve SOC in such systems, along with efficient weighted maximum matching based and weighted maximum flow based algorithms. For more general systems to achieve SFO, an upper bound is given by identifying a non-decreasing property of SFO with respect to a specific class of edge additions, which is shown to be optimal under certain circumstances.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Several recent studies have investigated low-precision accumulation, reporting improvements in throughput, power, and area across various platforms. However, the accompanying proposals have only considered the quantization-aware training (QAT) paradigm, in which models are fine-tuned or trained from scratch with quantization in the loop. As models continue to grow in size, QAT techniques become increasingly more expensive, which has motivated the recent surge in post-training quantization (PTQ) research. To the best of our knowledge, ours marks the first formal study of accumulator-aware quantization in the PTQ setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce AXE, a practical framework of accumulator-aware extensions designed to endow overflow avoidance guarantees to existing layer-wise PTQ algorithms. We theoretically motivate AXE and demonstrate its flexibility by implementing it on top of two state-of-the-art PTQ algorithms: GPFQ and OPTQ. We further generalize AXE to support multi-stage accumulation for the first time, opening the door for full datapath optimization and scaling to large language models (LLMs). We evaluate AXE across image classification and language generation models, and observe significant improvements in the trade-off between accumulator bit width and model accuracy over baseline methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models are cognitively biased judges. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been shown to be effective as automatic evaluators with simple prompting and in-context learning. In this work, we assemble 15 LLMs of four different size ranges and evaluate their output responses by preference ranking from the other LLMs as evaluators, such as System Star is better than System Square. We then evaluate the quality of ranking outputs introducing the Cognitive Bias Benchmark for LLMs as Evaluators (CoBBLEr), a benchmark to measure six different cognitive biases in LLM evaluation outputs, such as the Egocentric bias where a model prefers to rank its own outputs highly in evaluation. We find that LLMs are biased text quality evaluators, exhibiting strong indications on our bias benchmark (average of 40% of comparisons across all models) within each of their evaluations that question their robustness as evaluators. Furthermore, we examine the correlation between human and machine preferences and calculate the average Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) score to be 49.6%, indicating that machine preferences are misaligned with humans. According to our findings, LLMs may still be unable to be utilized for automatic annotation aligned with human preferences. Our project page is at: https://minnesotanlp.github.io/cobbler.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurately attributing answer text to its source document is crucial for developing a reliable question-answering system. However, attribution for long documents remains largely unexplored. Post-hoc attribution systems are designed to map answer text back to the source document, yet the granularity of this mapping has not been addressed. Furthermore, a critical question arises: What precisely should be attributed, with an emphasis on identifying the information units within an answer that necessitate grounding? In this paper, we propose and investigate a novel approach to the factual decomposition of generated answers for attribution, employing template-based in-context learning. To accomplish this, we utilize the question and integrate negative sampling during few-shot in-context learning for decomposition. This approach enhances the semantic understanding of both abstractive and extractive answers. We examine the impact of answer decomposition by providing a thorough examination of various attribution approaches, ranging from retrieval-based techniques to LLM-based attributors.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scaling model size significantly challenges the deployment and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs). Due to the redundancy in LLM weights, recent research has focused on pushing weight-only quantization to extremely low-bit (even down to 2 bits). It reduces memory requirements, optimizes storage costs, and decreases memory bandwidth needs during inference. However, due to numerical representation limitations, traditional scalar-based weight quantization struggles to achieve such extreme low-bit. Recent research on Vector Quantization (VQ) for LLMs has demonstrated the potential for extremely low-bit model quantization by compressing vectors into indices using lookup tables.   In this paper, we introduce Vector Post-Training Quantization (VPTQ) for extremely low-bit quantization of LLMs. We use Second-Order Optimization to formulate the LLM VQ problem and guide our quantization algorithm design by solving the optimization. We further refine the weights using Channel-Independent Second-Order Optimization for a granular VQ. In addition, by decomposing the optimization problem, we propose a brief and effective codebook initialization algorithm. We also extend VPTQ to support residual and outlier quantization, which enhances model accuracy and further compresses the model. Our experimental results show that VPTQ reduces model quantization perplexity by $0.01$-$0.34$ on LLaMA-2, $0.38$-$0.68$ on Mistral-7B, $4.41$-$7.34$ on LLaMA-3 over SOTA at 2-bit, with an average accuracy improvement of $0.79$-$1.5\%$ on LLaMA-2, $1\%$ on Mistral-7B, $11$-$22\%$ on LLaMA-3 on QA tasks on average. We only utilize $10.4$-$18.6\%$ of the quantization algorithm execution time, resulting in a $1.6$-$1.8\times$ increase in inference throughput compared to SOTA.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> One of the key issues contributing to inefficiency in Puskesmas is the time-consuming nature of doctor-patient interactions. Doctors need to conduct thorough consultations, which include diagnosing the patient's condition, providing treatment advice, and transcribing detailed notes into medical records. In regions with diverse linguistic backgrounds, doctors often have to ask clarifying questions, further prolonging the process. While diagnosing is essential, transcription and summarization can often be automated using AI to improve time efficiency and help doctors enhance care quality and enable early diagnosis and intervention. This paper proposes a solution using a localized large language model (LLM) to transcribe, translate, and summarize doctor-patient conversations. We utilize the Whisper model for transcription and GPT-3 to summarize them into the ePuskemas medical records format. This system is implemented as an add-on to an existing web browser extension, allowing doctors to fill out patient forms while talking. By leveraging this solution for real-time transcription, translation, and summarization, doctors can improve the turnaround time for patient care while enhancing the quality of records, which become more detailed and insightful for future visits. This innovation addresses challenges like overcrowded facilities and the administrative burden on healthcare providers in Indonesia. We believe this solution will help doctors save time, provide better care, and produce more accurate medical records, representing a significant step toward modernizing healthcare and ensuring patients receive timely, high-quality care, even in resource-constrained settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The remarkable performance achieved by Large Language Models (LLM) has driven research efforts to leverage them for a wide range of tasks and input modalities. In speech-to-text (S2T) tasks, the emerging solution consists of projecting the output of the encoder of a Speech Foundational Model (SFM) into the LLM embedding space through an adapter module. However, no work has yet investigated how much the downstream-task performance depends on each component (SFM, adapter, LLM) nor whether the best design of the adapter depends on the chosen SFM and LLM. To fill this gap, we evaluate the combination of 5 adapter modules, 2 LLMs (Mistral and Llama), and 2 SFMs (Whisper and SeamlessM4T) on two widespread S2T tasks, namely Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech Translation. Our results demonstrate that the SFM plays a pivotal role in downstream performance, while the adapter choice has moderate impact and depends on the SFM and LLM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach to decompose the activations of Large Language Models (LLMs) into human-interpretable latents. In this paper, we pose two questions. First, to what extent do SAEs extract monosemantic and interpretable latents? Second, to what extent does varying the sparsity or the size of the SAE affect monosemanticity / interpretability? By investigating these questions in the context of a simple first-letter identification task where we have complete access to ground truth labels for all tokens in the vocabulary, we are able to provide more detail than prior investigations. Critically, we identify a problematic form of feature-splitting we call feature absorption where seemingly monosemantic latents fail to fire in cases where they clearly should. Our investigation suggests that varying SAE size or sparsity is insufficient to solve this issue, and that there are deeper conceptual issues in need of resolution.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces SGCode, a flexible prompt-optimizing system to generate secure code with large language models (LLMs). SGCode integrates recent prompt-optimization approaches with LLMs in a unified system accessible through front-end and back-end APIs, enabling users to 1) generate secure code, which is free of vulnerabilities, 2) review and share security analysis, and 3) easily switch from one prompt optimization approach to another, while providing insights on model and system performance. We populated SGCode on an AWS server with PromSec, an approach that optimizes prompts by combining an LLM and security tools with a lightweight generative adversarial graph neural network to detect and fix security vulnerabilities in the generated code. Extensive experiments show that SGCode is practical as a public tool to gain insights into the trade-offs between model utility, secure code generation, and system cost. SGCode has only a marginal cost compared with prompting LLMs. SGCode is available at: https://sgcode.codes/.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rapid growth of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field, a vast variety of Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to emerge for diverse NLP tasks. As an increasing number of papers are presented, researchers and developers face the challenge of information overload. Thus, it is particularly important to develop a system that can automatically extract and organise key information about LLMs from academic papers (\textbf{LLM model card}). This work is to develop such a pioneer system by using Named Entity Recognition (\textbf{NER}) and Relation Extraction (\textbf{RE}) methods that automatically extract key information about large language models from the papers, helping researchers to efficiently access information about LLMs. These features include model \textit{licence}, model \textit{name}, and model \textit{application}. With these features, we can form a model card for each paper. \textbf{Data-contribution} wise, 106 academic papers were processed by defining three dictionaries - LLMs name, licence, and application. 11,051 sentences were extracted through dictionary lookup, and the dataset was constructed through manual review of the final selection of 129 sentences that have a link between the name and the licence, and 106 sentences that have a link between the model name and the application.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As the foundation of large language models (LLMs), self-attention module faces the challenge of quadratic time and memory complexity with respect to sequence length. FlashAttention accelerates attention computation and reduces its memory usage by leveraging the GPU memory hierarchy. A promising research direction is to integrate FlashAttention with quantization methods. This paper introduces INT-FlashAttention, the first INT8 quantization architecture compatible with the forward workflow of FlashAttention, which significantly improves the inference speed of FlashAttention on Ampere GPUs. We implement our INT-FlashAttention prototype with fully INT8 activations and general matrix-multiplication (GEMM) kernels, making it the first attention operator with fully INT8 input. As a general token-level post-training quantization framework, INT-FlashAttention is also compatible with other data formats like INT4, etc. Experimental results show INT-FlashAttention achieves 72% faster inference speed and 82% smaller quantization error compared to standard FlashAttention with FP16 and FP8 data format.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Major search engine providers are rapidly incorporating Large Language Model (LLM)-generated content in response to user queries. These conversational search engines operate by loading retrieved website text into the LLM context for summarization and interpretation. Recent research demonstrates that LLMs are highly vulnerable to jailbreaking and prompt injection attacks, which disrupt the safety and quality goals of LLMs using adversarial strings. This work investigates the impact of prompt injections on the ranking order of sources referenced by conversational search engines. To this end, we introduce a focused dataset of real-world consumer product websites and formalize conversational search ranking as an adversarial problem. Experimentally, we analyze conversational search rankings in the absence of adversarial injections and show that different LLMs vary significantly in prioritizing product name, document content, and context position. We then present a tree-of-attacks-based jailbreaking technique which reliably promotes low-ranked products. Importantly, these attacks transfer effectively to state-of-the-art conversational search engines such as perplexity$.$ai. Given the strong financial incentive for website owners to boost their search ranking, we argue that our problem formulation is of critical importance for future robustness work.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in both industry and academia for various tasks, yet evaluating the consistency of generated text responses continues to be a challenge. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BLEU show a weak correlation with human judgment. More sophisticated metrics using Natural Language Inference (NLI) have shown improved correlations but are complex to implement, require domain-specific training due to poor cross-domain generalization, and lack explainability. More recently, prompt-based metrics using LLMs as evaluators have emerged; while they are easier to implement, they still lack explainability and depend on task-specific prompts, which limits their generalizability. This work introduces Automated eXplainable Consistency Evaluation using LLMs (AXCEL), a prompt-based consistency metric which offers explanations for the consistency scores by providing detailed reasoning and pinpointing inconsistent text spans. AXCEL is also a generalizable metric which can be adopted to multiple tasks without changing the prompt. AXCEL outperforms both non-prompt and prompt-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics in detecting inconsistencies across summarization by 8.7%, free text generation by 6.2%, and data-to-text conversion tasks by 29.4%. We also evaluate the influence of underlying LLMs on prompt based metric performance and recalibrate the SOTA prompt-based metrics with the latest LLMs for fair comparison. Further, we show that AXCEL demonstrates strong performance using open source LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized how we interact with technology, but their personalization to individual user preferences remains a significant challenge, particularly in on-device applications. Traditional methods often depend heavily on labeled datasets and can be resource-intensive. To address these issues, we present Adaptive Self-Supervised Learning Strategies (ASLS), which utilizes self-supervised learning techniques to personalize LLMs dynamically. The framework comprises a user profiling layer for collecting interaction data and a neural adaptation layer for real-time model fine-tuning. This innovative approach enables continuous learning from user feedback, allowing the model to generate responses that align closely with user-specific contexts. The adaptive mechanisms of ASLS minimize computational demands and enhance personalization efficiency. Experimental results across various user scenarios illustrate the superior performance of ASLS in boosting user engagement and satisfaction, highlighting its potential to redefine LLMs as highly responsive and context-aware systems on-device.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Autonomous exploration of unknown space is an essential component for the deployment of mobile robots in the real world. Safe navigation is crucial for all robotics applications and requires accurate and consistent maps of the robot's surroundings. To achieve full autonomy and allow deployment in a wide variety of environments, the robot must rely on on-board state estimation which is prone to drift over time. We propose a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) exploration framework based on local submaps to allow retaining global consistency by applying loop-closure corrections to the relative submap poses. To enable large-scale exploration we efficiently compute global, environment-wide frontiers from the local submap frontiers and use a sampling-based next-best-view exploration planner. Our method seamlessly supports using either a LiDAR sensor or a depth camera, making it suitable for different kinds of MAV platforms. We perform comparative evaluations in simulation against a state-of-the-art submap-based exploration framework to showcase the efficiency and reconstruction quality of our approach. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our method to real-world MAVs, one equipped with a LiDAR and the other with a depth camera. Video available at https://youtu.be/Uf5fwmYcuq4 .

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we present an effective data augmentation framework leveraging the Large Language Model (LLM) and Diffusion Model (DM) to tackle the challenges inherent in data-scarce scenarios. Recently, DMs have opened up the possibility of generating synthetic images to complement a few training images. However, increasing the diversity of synthetic images also raises the risk of generating samples outside the target distribution. Our approach addresses this issue by embedding novel semantic information into text prompts via LLM and utilizing real images as visual prompts, thus generating semantically rich images. To ensure that the generated images remain within the target distribution, we dynamically adjust the guidance weight based on each image's CLIPScore to control the diversity. Experimental results show that our method produces synthetic images with enhanced diversity while maintaining adherence to the target distribution. Consequently, our approach proves to be more efficient in the few-shot setting on several benchmarks. Our code is available at https://github.com/kkyuhun94/dalda .

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4V, has led to significant advancements. However, these models still face challenges in medical multimodal capabilities due to limitations in the quantity and quality of medical vision-text data, stemming from data privacy concerns and high annotation costs. While pioneering approaches utilize PubMed's large-scale, de-identified medical image-text pairs to address these limitations, they still fall short due to inherent data noise. To tackle this, we refined medical image-text pairs from PubMed and employed MLLMs (GPT-4V) in an 'unblinded' capacity to denoise and reformat the data, resulting in the creation of the PubMedVision dataset with 1.3 million medical VQA samples. Our validation demonstrates that: (1) PubMedVision can significantly enhance the medical multimodal capabilities of current MLLMs, showing significant improvement in benchmarks including the MMMU Health & Medicine track; (2) manual checks by medical experts and empirical results validate the superior data quality of our dataset compared to other data construction methods. Using PubMedVision, we train a 34B medical MLLM HuatuoGPT-Vision, which shows superior performance in medical multimodal scenarios among open-source MLLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing capability and widespread usage of large language models (LLMs) highlight the desirability of automatic detection of LLM-generated text. Zero-shot detectors, due to their training-free nature, have received considerable attention and notable success. In this paper, we identify a new feature, token cohesiveness, that is useful for zero-shot detection, and we demonstrate that LLM-generated text tends to exhibit higher token cohesiveness than human-written text. Based on this observation, we devise TOCSIN, a generic dual-channel detection paradigm that uses token cohesiveness as a plug-and-play module to improve existing zero-shot detectors. To calculate token cohesiveness, TOCSIN only requires a few rounds of random token deletion and semantic difference measurement, making it particularly suitable for a practical black-box setting where the source model used for generation is not accessible. Extensive experiments with four state-of-the-art base detectors on various datasets, source models, and evaluation settings demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed approach.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Time-Sensitive Question Answering (TSQA) demands the effective utilization of specific temporal contexts, encompassing multiple time-evolving facts, to address time-sensitive questions. This necessitates not only the parsing of temporal information within questions but also the identification and understanding of time-evolving facts to generate accurate answers. However, current large language models still have limited sensitivity to temporal information and their inadequate temporal reasoning capabilities.In this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances temporal awareness and reasoning through Temporal Information-Aware Embedding and Granular Contrastive Reinforcement Learning. Experimental results on four TSQA datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing LLMs in TSQA tasks, marking a step forward in bridging the performance gap between machine and human temporal understanding and reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The fusion of Large Language Models (LLMs) and robotic systems has led to a transformative paradigm in the robotic field, offering unparalleled capabilities not only in the communication domain but also in skills like multimodal input handling, high-level reasoning, and plan generation. The grounding of LLMs knowledge into the empirical world has been considered a crucial pathway to exploit the efficiency of LLMs in robotics. Nevertheless, connecting LLMs' representations to the external world with multimodal approaches or with robots' bodies is not enough to let them understand the meaning of the language they are manipulating. Taking inspiration from humans, this work draws attention to three necessary elements for an agent to grasp and experience the world. The roadmap for LLMs grounding is envisaged in an active bodily system as the reference point for experiencing the environment, a temporally structured experience for a coherent, self-related interaction with the external world, and social skills to acquire a common-grounded shared experience.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> When operating in human environments, robots need to handle complex tasks while both adhering to social norms and accommodating individual preferences. For instance, based on common sense knowledge, a household robot can predict that it should avoid vacuuming during a social gathering, but it may still be uncertain whether it should vacuum before or after having guests. In such cases, integrating common-sense knowledge with human preferences, often conveyed through human explanations, is fundamental yet a challenge for existing systems. In this paper, we introduce GRACE, a novel approach addressing this while generating socially appropriate robot actions. GRACE leverages common sense knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs), and it integrates this knowledge with human explanations through a generative network architecture. The bidirectional structure of GRACE enables robots to refine and enhance LLM predictions by utilizing human explanations and makes robots capable of generating such explanations for human-specified actions. Our experimental evaluations show that integrating human explanations boosts GRACE's performance, where it outperforms several baselines and provides sensible explanations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have supplanted traditional methods in numerous natural language processing tasks. Nonetheless, in Named Entity Recognition (NER), existing LLM-based methods underperform compared to baselines and require significantly more computational resources, limiting their application. In this paper, we introduce the task of generation-based extraction and in-context classification (GEIC), designed to leverage LLMs' prior knowledge and self-attention mechanisms for NER tasks. We then propose CascadeNER, a universal and multilingual GEIC framework for few-shot and zero-shot NER. CascadeNER employs model cascading to utilize two small-parameter LLMs to extract and classify independently, reducing resource consumption while enhancing accuracy. We also introduce AnythingNER, the first NER dataset specifically designed for LLMs, including 8 languages, 155 entity types and a novel dynamic categorization system. Experiments show that CascadeNER achieves state-of-the-art performance on low-resource and fine-grained scenarios, including CrossNER and FewNERD. Our work is openly accessible.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Heuristics are commonly used to tackle diverse search and optimization problems. Design heuristics usually require tedious manual crafting with domain knowledge. Recent works have incorporated large language models (LLMs) into automatic heuristic search leveraging their powerful language and coding capacity. However, existing research focuses on the optimal performance on the target problem as the sole objective, neglecting other criteria such as efficiency and scalability, which are vital in practice. To tackle this challenge, we propose to model heuristic search as a multi-objective optimization problem and consider introducing other practical criteria beyond optimal performance. Due to the complexity of the search space, conventional multi-objective optimization methods struggle to effectively handle multi-objective heuristic search. We propose the first LLM-based multi-objective heuristic search framework, Multi-objective Evolution of Heuristic (MEoH), which integrates LLMs in a zero-shot manner to generate a non-dominated set of heuristics to meet multiple design criteria. We design a new dominance-dissimilarity mechanism for effective population management and selection, which incorporates both code dissimilarity in the search space and dominance in the objective space. MEoH is demonstrated in two well-known combinatorial optimization problems: the online Bin Packing Problem (BPP) and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Results indicate that a variety of elite heuristics are automatically generated in a single run, offering more trade-off options than existing methods. It successfully achieves competitive or superior performance while improving efficiency up to 10 times. Moreover, we also observe that the multi-objective search introduces novel insights into heuristic design and leads to the discovery of diverse heuristics.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in imitation learning, particularly with the integration of LLM techniques, are set to significantly improve robots' dexterity and adaptability. This paper proposes using Mamba, a state-of-the-art architecture with potential applications in LLMs, for robotic imitation learning, highlighting its ability to function as an encoder that effectively captures contextual information. By reducing the dimensionality of the state space, Mamba operates similarly to an autoencoder. It effectively compresses the sequential information into state variables while preserving the essential temporal dynamics necessary for accurate motion prediction. Experimental results in tasks such as cup placing and case loading demonstrate that despite exhibiting higher estimation errors, Mamba achieves superior success rates compared to Transformers in practical task execution. This performance is attributed to Mamba's structure, which encompasses the state space model. Additionally, the study investigates Mamba's capacity to serve as a real-time motion generator with a limited amount of training data.

In this context, open 6G development involves multiple disciplines and requires advanced simulation approaches for testing. In this demo paper, we propose a generative simulation approach based on a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) and Network Simulator 3 (ns-3), called Generative Open xG Network Simulation (GenOnet), to effectively generate, debug, execute, and interpret simulated Open Fifth-Generation (5G) environments. The first version of GenOnet application represents a specialized adaptation of the OpenAI GPT models. It incorporates supplementary tools, agents, 5G standards, and seamless integration with ns-3 simulation capabilities, supporting both C++ variants and Python implementations. This release complies with the latest Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) and 3GPP standards.

In this work, we propose a simple and effective trajectory planning framework that tackles the design, deployment, and reconfiguration of a communication backbone by reframing the problem of networked multi-agent motion planning as a manipulator motion planning problem. Our approach works for backbones of variable configurations both in terms of the number of robots utilized and the distance limit between each robot. While research has been conducted on connection-restricted navigation for multi-robot systems in the last years, the field of manipulators is arguably more developed both in theory and practice. Hence, our methodology facilitates practical applications built on top of widely available motion planning algorithms and frameworks for manipulators.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) create exciting possibilities for powerful language processing tools to accelerate research in materials science. While LLMs have great potential to accelerate materials understanding and discovery, they currently fall short in being practical materials science tools. In this position paper, we show relevant failure cases of LLMs in materials science that reveal current limitations of LLMs related to comprehending and reasoning over complex, interconnected materials science knowledge. Given those shortcomings, we outline a framework for developing Materials Science LLMs (MatSci-LLMs) that are grounded in materials science knowledge and hypothesis generation followed by hypothesis testing. The path to attaining performant MatSci-LLMs rests in large part on building high-quality, multi-modal datasets sourced from scientific literature where various information extraction challenges persist. As such, we describe key materials science information extraction challenges which need to be overcome in order to build large-scale, multi-modal datasets that capture valuable materials science knowledge. Finally, we outline a roadmap for applying future MatSci-LLMs for real-world materials discovery via: 1. Automated Knowledge Base Generation; 2. Automated In-Silico Material Design; and 3. MatSci-LLM Integrated Self-Driving Materials Laboratories.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Peer review is an essential process to determine the quality of papers submitted to scientific conferences or journals. However, it is subjective and prone to biases. Several studies have been conducted to apply techniques from NLP to support peer review, but they are based on black-box techniques and their outputs are difficult to interpret and trust. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline to support and understand the reviewing and decision-making processes of peer review: the PeerArg system combining LLMs with methods from knowledge representation. PeerArg takes in input a set of reviews for a paper and outputs the paper acceptance prediction. We evaluate the performance of the PeerArg pipeline on three different datasets, in comparison with a novel end-2-end LLM that uses few-shot learning to predict paper acceptance given reviews. The results indicate that the end-2-end LLM is capable of predicting paper acceptance from reviews, but a variant of the PeerArg pipeline outperforms this LLM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The climate crisis is a salient issue in online discussions, and hypocrisy accusations are a central rhetorical element in these debates. However, for large-scale text analysis, hypocrisy accusation detection is an understudied tool, most often defined as a smaller subtask of fallacious argument detection. In this paper, we define hypocrisy accusation detection as an independent task in NLP, and identify different relevant subtypes of hypocrisy accusations. Our Climate Hypocrisy Accusation Corpus (CHAC) consists of 420 Reddit climate debate comments, expert-annotated into two different types of hypocrisy accusations: personal versus political hypocrisy. We evaluate few-shot in-context learning with 6 shots and 3 instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) for detecting hypocrisy accusations in this dataset. Results indicate that the GPT-4o and Llama-3 models in particular show promise in detecting hypocrisy accusations (F1 reaching 0.68, while previous work shows F1 of 0.44). However, context matters for a complex semantic concept such as hypocrisy accusations, and we find models struggle especially at identifying political hypocrisy accusations compared to personal moral hypocrisy. Our study contributes new insights in hypocrisy detection and climate change discourse, and is a stepping stone for large-scale analysis of hypocrisy accusation in online climate debates.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Contemporary makeup approaches primarily hinge on unpaired learning paradigms, yet they grapple with the challenges of inaccurate supervision (e.g., face misalignment) and sophisticated facial prompts (including face parsing, and landmark detection). These challenges prohibit low-cost deployment of facial makeup models, especially on mobile devices. To solve above problems, we propose a brand-new learning paradigm, termed "Data Amplify Learning (DAL)," alongside a compact makeup model named "TinyBeauty." The core idea of DAL lies in employing a Diffusion-based Data Amplifier (DDA) to "amplify" limited images for the model training, thereby enabling accurate pixel-to-pixel supervision with merely a handful of annotations. Two pivotal innovations in DDA facilitate the above training approach: (1) A Residual Diffusion Model (RDM) is designed to generate high-fidelity detail and circumvent the detail vanishing problem in the vanilla diffusion models; (2) A Fine-Grained Makeup Module (FGMM) is proposed to achieve precise makeup control and combination while retaining face identity. Coupled with DAL, TinyBeauty necessitates merely 80K parameters to achieve a state-of-the-art performance without intricate face prompts. Meanwhile, TinyBeauty achieves a remarkable inference speed of up to 460 fps on the iPhone 13. Extensive experiments show that DAL can produce highly competitive makeup models using only 5 image pairs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reliable prediction of the All India Summer Monsoon Rainfall (AISMR) is pivotal for informed policymaking for the country, impacting the lives of billions of people. However, accurate simulation of AISMR has been a persistent challenge due to the complex interplay of various muti-scale factors and the inherent variability of the monsoon system. This research focuses on adapting and fine-tuning the latest LLM model, PatchTST, to accurately predict AISMR with a lead time of three months. The fine-tuned PatchTST model, trained with historical AISMR data, the Ni\~no3.4 index, and categorical Indian Ocean Dipole values, outperforms several popular neural network models and statistical models. This fine-tuned LLM model exhibits an exceptionally low RMSE percentage of 0.07% and a Spearman correlation of 0.976. This is particularly impressive, since it is nearly 80% more accurate than the best-performing NN models. The model predicts an above-normal monsoon for the year 2024, with an accumulated rainfall of 921.6 mm in the month of June-September for the entire country.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In-context learning (ICL) greatly improves the performance of large language models (LLMs) on various down-stream tasks, where the improvement highly depends on the quality of demonstrations. In this work, we introduce syntactic knowledge to select better in-context examples for machine translation (MT). We propose a new strategy, namely Syntax-augmented COverage-based In-context example selection (SCOI), leveraging the deep syntactic structure beyond conventional word matching. Specifically, we measure the set-level syntactic coverage by computing the coverage of polynomial terms with the help of a simplified tree-to-polynomial algorithm, and lexical coverage using word overlap. Furthermore, we devise an alternate selection approach to combine both coverage measures, taking advantage of syntactic and lexical information. We conduct experiments with two multi-lingual LLMs on six translation directions. Empirical results show that our proposed SCOI obtains the highest average COMET score among all learning-free methods, indicating that combining syntactic and lexical coverage successfully helps to select better in-context examples for MT.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, there has been a trend of evaluating the Large Language Model (LLM) quality in the flavor of LLM-as-a-Judge, namely leveraging another LLM to evaluate the current output quality. However, existing judges are proven to be biased, namely they would favor answers which present better superficial quality (such as verbosity, fluency) while ignoring the instruction following ability. In this work, we propose systematic research about the bias of LLM-as-a-Judge. Specifically, for closed-source judge models, we apply calibration to mitigate the significance of superficial quality, both on probability level and prompt level. For open-source judge models, we propose to mitigate the bias by contrastive training, with curated negative samples that deviate from instruction but present better superficial quality. We apply our methods on the bias evaluation benchmark, and experiment results show our methods mitigate the bias by a large margin while maintaining a satisfactory evaluation accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Automated red teaming is an effective method for identifying misaligned behaviors in large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches, however, often focus primarily on improving attack success rates while overlooking the need for comprehensive test case coverage. Additionally, most of these methods are limited to single-turn red teaming, failing to capture the multi-turn dynamics of real-world human-machine interactions. To overcome these limitations, we propose HARM (Holistic Automated Red teaMing), which scales up the diversity of test cases using a top-down approach based on an extensible, fine-grained risk taxonomy. Our method also leverages a novel fine-tuning strategy and reinforcement learning techniques to facilitate multi-turn adversarial probing in a human-like manner. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework enables a more systematic understanding of model vulnerabilities and offers more targeted guidance for the alignment process.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with tasks requiring mathematical reasoning, particularly multiple-choice questions (MCQs). To address this issue, we developed LLaMa-SciQ, an educational chatbot designed to assist college students in solving and understanding MCQs in STEM fields. We begin by fine-tuning and aligning the models to human preferences. After comparing the performance of Mistral-7B and LLaMa-8B, we selected the latter as the base model due to its higher evaluation accuracy. To further enhance accuracy, we implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and apply quantization to compress the model, reducing inference time and increasing accessibility for students. For mathematical reasoning, LLaMa-SciQ achieved 74.5% accuracy on the GSM8k dataset and 30% on the MATH dataset. However, RAG does not improve performance and even reduces it, likely due to retriever issues or the model's unfamiliarity with context. Despite this, the quantized model shows only a 5% loss in performance, demonstrating significant efficiency improvements.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, there has been increasing interest in applying large language models (LLMs) as zero-shot passage rankers. However, few studies have explored how to select appropriate in-context demonstrations for the passage ranking task, which is the focus of this paper. Previous studies mainly use LLM's feedback to train a retriever for demonstration selection. These studies apply the LLM to score each demonstration independently, which ignores the dependencies between demonstrations (especially important in ranking task), leading to inferior performance of top-$k$ retrieved demonstrations. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a demonstration reranker to rerank the retrieved demonstrations so that top-$k$ ranked ones are more suitable for ICL. However, generating training data for such reranker is quite challenging. On the one hand, different from demonstration retriever, the training samples of reranker need to incorporate demonstration dependencies. On the other hand, obtaining the gold ranking from the retrieved demonstrations is an NP-hard problem, which is hard to implement. To overcome these challenges, we propose a method to approximate the optimal demonstration list iteratively and utilize LLM to score demonstration lists of varying lengths. By doing so, the search space is greatly reduced and demonstration dependencies are considered. Based on these scored demonstration lists, we further design a list-pairwise training approach which compares a pair of lists that only differ in the last demonstration, to teach the reranker how to select the next demonstration given a previous sequence. In this paper, we propose a demonstration selection framework DemoRank for ranking task and conduct extensive experiments to prove its strong ability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a superior ability to serve as ranking models. However, concerns have arisen as LLMs will exhibit discriminatory ranking behaviors based on users' sensitive attributes (\eg gender). Worse still, in this paper, we identify a subtler form of discrimination in LLMs, termed \textit{implicit ranking unfairness}, where LLMs exhibit discriminatory ranking patterns based solely on non-sensitive user profiles, such as user names. Such implicit unfairness is more widespread but less noticeable, threatening the ethical foundation. To comprehensively explore such unfairness, our analysis will focus on three research aspects: (1) We propose an evaluation method to investigate the severity of implicit ranking unfairness. (2) We uncover the reasons for causing such unfairness. (3) To mitigate such unfairness effectively, we utilize a pair-wise regression method to conduct fair-aware data augmentation for LLM fine-tuning. The experiment demonstrates that our method outperforms existing approaches in ranking fairness, achieving this with only a small reduction in accuracy. Lastly, we emphasize the need for the community to identify and mitigate the implicit unfairness, aiming to avert the potential deterioration in the reinforced human-LLMs ecosystem deterioration.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Translating Natural Language Queries into Structured Query Language (Text-to-SQL or NLQ-to-SQL) is a critical task extensively studied by both the natural language processing and database communities, aimed at providing a natural language interface to databases (NLIDB) and lowering the barrier for non-experts. Despite recent advancements made through the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), significant challenges remain. These include handling complex database schemas, resolving ambiguity in user queries, and generating SQL queries with intricate structures that accurately reflect the user's intent. In this work, we introduce E-SQL, a novel pipeline specifically designed to address these challenges through direct schema linking and candidate predicate augmentation. E-SQL enhances the natural language query by incorporating relevant database items (i.e., tables, columns, and values) and conditions directly into the question, bridging the gap between the query and the database structure. The pipeline leverages candidate predicate augmentation to mitigate erroneous or incomplete predicates in generated SQLs. We further investigate the impact of schema filtering, a technique widely explored in previous work, and demonstrate its diminishing returns when applied alongside advanced large language models. Comprehensive evaluations on the BIRD benchmark illustrate that E-SQL achieves competitive performance, particularly excelling in complex queries with a 66.29% execution accuracy on the test set. All code required to reproduce the reported results is publicly available on our GitHub repository.

While highly accurate, current motion prediction models often impose significant challenges in terms of training resource requirements and deployment on embedded hardware. We propose a new efficient motion prediction model, which achieves highly competitive benchmark results while training only a few hours on a single GPU. Due to our lightweight architectural choices and the focus on reducing the required training resources, our model can easily be applied to custom datasets. Furthermore, its low inference latency makes it particularly suitable for deployment in autonomous applications with limited computing resources.

In doing so, we lay the groundwork for an LLM agent evaluation suite where good performance directly corresponds to a large economic and societal impact. We built and tested several agent architectures with o1-preview, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1 (405b), and GPT-4o-mini. On average, LLM agents powered by Claude-3.5 Sonnet and o1-preview substantially outperformed agents using GPT-4o, with agents based on Llama 3.1 (405b) and GPT-4o-mini lagging noticeably behind. Across LLMs, a ReAct architecture with the ability to delegate subtasks to subagents performed best. In addition to quantitative evaluations, we qualitatively assessed the performance of the LLM agents by inspecting their traces and reflecting on their observations. Our evaluation represents the first in-depth assessment of agents' abilities to conduct challenging, economically valuable analyst-style research on the real open web.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Test smells arise from poor design practices and insufficient domain knowledge, which can lower the quality of test code and make it harder to maintain and update. Manually refactoring test smells is time-consuming and error-prone, highlighting the necessity for automated approaches. Current rule-based refactoring methods often struggle in scenarios not covered by predefined rules and lack the flexibility needed to handle diverse cases effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called UTRefactor, a context-enhanced, LLM-based framework for automatic test refactoring in Java projects. UTRefactor extracts relevant context from test code and leverages an external knowledge base that includes test smell definitions, descriptions, and DSL-based refactoring rules. By simulating the manual refactoring process through a chain-of-thought approach, UTRefactor guides the LLM to eliminate test smells in a step-by-step process, ensuring both accuracy and consistency throughout the refactoring. Additionally, we implement a checkpoint mechanism to facilitate comprehensive refactoring, particularly when multiple smells are present. We evaluate UTRefactor on 879 tests from six open-source Java projects, reducing the number of test smells from 2,375 to 265, achieving an 89% reduction. UTRefactor outperforms direct LLM-based refactoring methods by 61.82% in smell elimination and significantly surpasses the performance of a rule-based test smell refactoring tool. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of UTRefactor in enhancing test code quality while minimizing manual involvement.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Stories about overcoming personal struggles can effectively illustrate the application of psychological theories in real life, yet they may fail to resonate with individuals' experiences. In this work, we employ large language models (LLMs) to create tailored narratives that acknowledge and address unique challenging thoughts and situations faced by individuals. Our study, involving 346 young adults across two settings, demonstrates that LLM-enhanced stories were perceived to be better than human-written ones in conveying key takeaways, promoting reflection, and reducing belief in negative thoughts. These stories were not only seen as more relatable but also similarly authentic to human-written ones, highlighting the potential of LLMs in helping young adults manage their struggles. The findings of this work provide crucial design considerations for future narrative-based digital mental health interventions, such as the need to maintain relatability without veering into implausibility and refining the wording and tone of AI-enhanced content.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Role-playing systems powered by large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly influential in emotional communication applications. However, these systems are susceptible to character hallucinations, where the model deviates from predefined character roles and generates responses that are inconsistent with the intended persona. This paper presents the first systematic analysis of character hallucination from an attack perspective, introducing the RoleBreak framework. Our framework identifies two core mechanisms-query sparsity and role-query conflict-as key factors driving character hallucination. Leveraging these insights, we construct a novel dataset, RoleBreakEval, to evaluate existing hallucination mitigation techniques. Our experiments reveal that even enhanced models trained to minimize hallucination remain vulnerable to attacks. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose a novel defence strategy, the Narrator Mode, which generates supplemental context through narration to mitigate role-query conflicts and improve query generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that Narrator Mode significantly outperforms traditional refusal-based strategies by reducing hallucinations, enhancing fidelity to character roles and queries, and improving overall narrative coherence.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have recently gained much interest due to their ability to avoid excessive inference costs. However, LoRA still encounters the following challenges: (1) Limitation of low-rank assumption; and (2) Its initialization method may be suboptimal. To this end, we propose PMSS(Pre-trained Matrices Skeleton Selection), which enables high-rank updates with low costs while leveraging semantic and linguistic information inherent in pre-trained weight. It achieves this by selecting skeletons from the pre-trained weight matrix and only learning a small matrix instead. Experiments demonstrate that PMSS outperforms LoRA and other fine-tuning methods across tasks with much less trainable parameters. We demonstrate its effectiveness, especially in handling complex tasks such as DROP benchmark(+3.4%/+5.9% on LLaMA2-7B/13B) and math reasoning(+12.89%/+5.61%/+3.11% on LLaMA2-7B, Mistral-7B and Gemma-7B of GSM8K). The code and model will be released soon.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language and vision models (LLVMs) have been driven by the generalization power of large language models (LLMs) and the advent of visual instruction tuning. Along with scaling them up directly, these models enable LLVMs to showcase powerful vision language (VL) performances by covering diverse tasks via natural language instructions. However, existing open-source LLVMs that perform comparably to closed-source LLVMs such as GPT-4V are often considered too large (e.g., 26B, 34B, and 110B parameters), having a larger number of layers. These large models demand costly, high-end resources for both training and inference. To address this issue, we present a new efficient LLVM family with 1.8B, 3.8B, and 7B LLM model sizes, Traversal of Layers (TroL), which enables the reuse of layers in a token-wise manner. This layer traversing technique simulates the effect of looking back and retracing the answering stream while increasing the number of forward propagation layers without physically adding more layers. We demonstrate that TroL employs a simple layer traversing approach yet efficiently outperforms the open-source LLVMs with larger model sizes and rivals the performances of the closed-source LLVMs with substantial sizes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Uncovering early-stage metrics that reflect final model performance is one core principle for large-scale pretraining. The existing scaling law demonstrates the power-law correlation between pretraining loss and training flops, which serves as an important indicator of the current training state for large language models. However, this principle only focuses on the model's compression properties on the training data, resulting in an inconsistency with the ability improvements on the downstream tasks. Some follow-up works attempted to extend the scaling-law to more complex metrics (such as hyperparameters), but still lacked a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic differences among various capabilities during pretraining. To address the aforementioned limitations, this paper undertakes a comprehensive comparison of model capabilities at various pretraining intermediate checkpoints. Through this analysis, we confirm that specific downstream metrics exhibit similar training dynamics across models of different sizes, up to 67 billion parameters. In addition to our core findings, we've reproduced Amber and OpenLLaMA, releasing their intermediate checkpoints. This initiative offers valuable resources to the research community and facilitates the verification and exploration of LLM pretraining by open-source researchers. Besides, we provide empirical summaries, including performance comparisons of different models and capabilities, and tuition of key metrics for different training phases. Based on these findings, we provide a more user-friendly strategy for evaluating the optimization state, offering guidance for establishing a stable pretraining process.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the post-Turing era, evaluating large language models (LLMs) involves assessing generated text based on readers' reactions rather than merely its indistinguishability from human-produced content. This paper explores how LLM-generated text impacts readers' decisions, focusing on both amateur and expert audiences. Our findings indicate that GPT-4 can generate persuasive analyses affecting the decisions of both amateurs and professionals. Furthermore, we evaluate the generated text from the aspects of grammar, convincingness, logical coherence, and usefulness. The results highlight a high correlation between real-world evaluation through audience reactions and the current multi-dimensional evaluators commonly used for generative models. Overall, this paper shows the potential and risk of using generated text to sway human decisions and also points out a new direction for evaluating generated text, i.e., leveraging the reactions and decisions of readers. We release our dataset to assist future research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Open-source third-party libraries are widely used in software development. These libraries offer substantial advantages in terms of time and resource savings. However, a significant concern arises due to the publicly disclosed vulnerabilities within these libraries. Existing automated vulnerability detection tools often suffer from false positives and fail to accurately assess the propagation of inputs capable of triggering vulnerabilities from client projects to vulnerable code in libraries. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called VULEUT (Vulnerability Exploit Unit Test Generation), which combines vulnerability exploitation reachability analysis and LLM-based unit test generation. VULEUT is designed to automatically verify the exploitability of vulnerabilities in third-party libraries commonly used in client software projects. VULEUT first analyzes the client projects to determine the reachability of vulnerability conditions. And then, it leverages the Large Language Model (LLM) to generate unit tests for vulnerability confirmation. To evaluate the effectiveness of VULEUT, we collect 32 vulnerabilities from various third-party libraries and conduct experiments on 70 real client projects. Besides, we also compare our approach with two representative tools, i.e., TRANSFER and VESTA. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of VULEUT, with 229 out of 292 generated unit tests successfully confirming vulnerability exploitation across 70 client projects, which outperforms baselines by 24%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The impressive performances of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their immense potential for commercialization have given rise to serious concerns over the Intellectual Property (IP) of their training data. In particular, the synthetic texts generated by LLMs may infringe the IP of the data being used to train the LLMs. To this end, it is imperative to be able to perform source attribution by identifying the data provider who contributed to the generation of a synthetic text by an LLM. In this paper, we show that this problem can be tackled by watermarking, i.e., by enabling an LLM to generate synthetic texts with embedded watermarks that contain information about their source(s). We identify the key properties of such watermarking frameworks (e.g., source attribution accuracy, robustness against adversaries), and propose a source attribution framework that satisfies these key properties due to our algorithmic designs. Our framework enables an LLM to learn an accurate mapping from the generated texts to data providers, which sets the foundation for effective source attribution. Extensive empirical evaluations show that our framework achieves effective source attribution.

There was an almost universally positive Spearman correlation between ChatGPT scores and departmental averages, varying between 0.08 (Philosophy) and 0.78 (Psychology, Psychiatry and Neuroscience), except for Clinical Medicine (rho=-0.12). Although other explanations are possible, especially because REF score profiles are public, the results suggest that LLMs can provide reasonable research quality estimates in most areas of science, and particularly the physical and health sciences and engineering, even before citation data is available. Nevertheless, ChatGPT assessments seem to be more positive for most health and physical sciences than for other fields, a concern for multidisciplinary assessments, and the ChatGPT scores are only based on titles and abstracts, so cannot be research evaluations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in natural language processing, showcasing exceptional performance across various tasks. However, the expensive memory and computational requirements present significant challenges for their practical deployment. Low-bit quantization has emerged as a critical approach to mitigate these challenges by reducing the bit-width of model parameters, activations, and gradients, thus decreasing memory usage and computational demands. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of low-bit quantization methods tailored for LLMs, covering the fundamental principles, system implementations, and algorithmic strategies. An overview of basic concepts and new data formats specific to low-bit LLMs is first introduced, followed by a review of frameworks and systems that facilitate low-bit LLMs across various hardware platforms. Then, we categorize and analyze techniques and toolkits for efficient low-bit training and inference of LLMs. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of future trends and potential advancements of low-bit LLMs. Our systematic overview from basic, system, and algorithm perspectives can offer valuable insights and guidelines for future works to enhance the efficiency and applicability of LLMs through low-bit quantization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Long-term memory is significant for agents, in which insights play a crucial role. However, the emergence of irrelevant insight and the lack of general insight can greatly undermine the effectiveness of insight. To solve this problem, in this paper, we introduce Multi-Scale Insight Agent (MSI-Agent), an embodied agent designed to improve LLMs' planning and decision-making ability by summarizing and utilizing insight effectively across different scales. MSI achieves this through the experience selector, insight generator, and insight selector. Leveraging a three-part pipeline, MSI can generate task-specific and high-level insight, store it in a database, and then use relevant insight from it to aid in decision-making. Our experiments show that MSI outperforms another insight strategy when planning by GPT3.5. Moreover, We delve into the strategies for selecting seed experience and insight, aiming to provide LLM with more useful and relevant insight for better decision-making. Our observations also indicate that MSI exhibits better robustness when facing domain-shifting scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text-to-SQL parsing and end-to-end question answering (E2E TQA) are two main approaches for Table-based Question Answering task. Despite success on multiple benchmarks, they have yet to be compared and their synergy remains unexplored. In this paper, we identify different strengths and weaknesses through evaluating state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets: Text-to-SQL demonstrates superiority in handling questions involving arithmetic operations and long tables; E2E TQA excels in addressing ambiguous questions, non-standard table schema, and complex table contents. To combine both strengths, we propose a Synergistic Table-based Question Answering approach that integrate different models via answer selection, which is agnostic to any model types. Further experiments validate that ensembling models by either feature-based or LLM-based answer selector significantly improves the performance over individual models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, Recommender Systems (RS) have witnessed a transformative shift with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Models such as GPT-3.5/4, Llama, have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. The extensive information pre-trained by these LLMs allows for the potential to capture a more profound semantic representation from different contextual information of users and items.   While the great potential lies behind the thriving of LLMs, the challenge of leveraging user-item preferences from contextual information and its alignment with the improvement of Recommender Systems needs to be addressed. Believing that a better understanding of the user or item itself can be the key factor in improving recommendation performance, we conduct research on generating informative profiles using state-of-the-art LLMs.   To boost the linguistic abilities of LLMs in Recommender Systems, we introduce the Prompting-Based Representation Learning Method for Recommendation (P4R). In our P4R framework, we utilize the LLM prompting strategy to create personalized item profiles. These profiles are then transformed into semantic representation spaces using a pre-trained BERT model for text embedding. Furthermore, we incorporate a Graph Convolution Network (GCN) for collaborative filtering representation. The P4R framework aligns these two embedding spaces in order to address the general recommendation tasks. In our evaluation, we compare P4R with state-of-the-art Recommender models and assess the quality of prompt-based profile generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) has put forward the study of biases as a crucial field. It is important to assess the influence of different types of biases embedded in LLMs to ensure fair use in sensitive fields. Although there have been extensive works on bias assessment in English, such efforts are rare and scarce for a major language like Bangla. In this work, we examine two types of social biases in LLM generated outputs for Bangla language. Our main contributions in this work are: (1) bias studies on two different social biases for Bangla (2) a curated dataset for bias measurement benchmarking (3) testing two different probing techniques for bias detection in the context of Bangla. This is the first work of such kind involving bias assessment of LLMs for Bangla to the best of our knowledge. All our code and resources are publicly available for the progress of bias related research in Bangla NLP.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> By inducing privacy attacks on NLP models, attackers can obtain sensitive information such as training data and model parameters, etc. Although researchers have studied, in-depth, several kinds of attacks in NLP models, they are non-systematic analyses. It lacks a comprehensive understanding of the impact caused by the attacks. For example, we must consider which scenarios can apply to which attacks, what the common factors are that affect the performance of different attacks, the nature of the relationships between different attacks, and the influence of various datasets and models on the effectiveness of the attacks, etc. Therefore, we need a benchmark to holistically assess the privacy risks faced by NLP models. In this paper, we present a privacy attack and defense evaluation benchmark in the field of NLP, which includes the conventional/small models and large language models (LLMs). This benchmark supports a variety of models, datasets, and protocols, along with standardized modules for comprehensive evaluation of attacks and defense strategies. Based on the above framework, we present a study on the association between auxiliary data from different domains and the strength of privacy attacks. And we provide an improved attack method in this scenario with the help of Knowledge Distillation (KD). Furthermore, we propose a chained framework for privacy attacks. Allowing a practitioner to chain multiple attacks to achieve a higher-level attack objective. Based on this, we provide some defense and enhanced attack strategies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Creative story generation with diverse and detailed story elements is a long-standing goal for large language models. While existing methodologies generate long and coherent stories, they fall significantly short of human capabilities in terms of diversity and character detail. To address this, we introduce a novel story generation framework called CCI (Character-centric Creative story generation via Imagination). CCI features two innovative modules for creative story generation: IG (Image-Guided Imagination) and MW (Multi-Writer model). In the IG module, we utilize DALL-E 3 to create visual representations of key story elements. The IG generates more novel and concrete characters, backgrounds, and main plots than text-only methods. The MW module uses these story elements created by IG to generate multiple description candidates for the protagonist and select the best one. This method incorporates vivid and rich character descriptions into the story. We compared the stories generated by CCI and baseline models through human evaluation and statistical analysis. The results showed significant improvements in the creativity. Furthermore, by enabling interactive multi-modal story generation with users, we have opened up possibilities for human-LLM integration in cultural development.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Timeline Analysis (TA) plays a crucial role in Timeline Forensics (TF) within the field of Digital Forensics (DF). It focuses on examining and analyzing time-based digital artefacts, such as timestamps derived from event logs, file metadata, and other relevant data, to correlate events linked to cyber incidents and reconstruct their chronological sequence. Traditional tools often struggle to efficiently handle the large volume and variety of data generated during DF investigations and Incident Response (IR) processes. This paper introduces a novel framework, GenDFIR, which combines Rule-Based Artificial Intelligence (R-BAI) algorithms with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance and automate the TA process. The proposed approach consists of two key stages: (1) R-BAI is used to identify and select anomalous digital artefacts based on predefined rules. (2) The selected artefacts are then transformed into embeddings for processing by an LLM with the assistance of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent. The LLM uses its capabilities to perform automated TA on the artefacts and predict potential incident outcomes. To validate the framework, we evaluated its performance, efficiency, and reliability. Several metrics were applied to simulated cyber incident scenarios, which were presented as forensic case documents. Our findings demonstrate the significant potential of integrating R-BAI and LLMs for TA. This innovative approach underscores the power of Generative AI (GenAI), particularly LLMs, and opens up new possibilities for advanced threat detection and incident reconstruction, marking a significant advancement in the field.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Unit testing is an essential activity in software development for verifying the correctness of software components. However, manually writing unit tests is challenging and time-consuming. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a new direction for automating unit test generation. Existing research primarily focuses on closed-source LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT and CodeX) with fixed prompting strategies, leaving the capabilities of advanced open-source LLMs with various prompting settings unexplored. Particularly, open-source LLMs offer advantages in data privacy protection and have demonstrated superior performance in some tasks. Moreover, effective prompting is crucial for maximizing LLMs' capabilities. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study to fill this gap, based on 17 Java projects, five widely-used open-source LLMs with different structures and parameter sizes, and comprehensive evaluation metrics. Our findings highlight the significant influence of various prompt factors, show the performance of open-source LLMs compared to the commercial GPT-4 and the traditional Evosuite, and identify limitations in LLM-based unit test generation. We then derive a series of implications from our study to guide future research and practical use of LLM-based unit test generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce Block-Attention, an attention mechanism designed to address the increased inference latency and cost in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios. Unlike existing works that encodes the whole context, its main idea lies in dividing the retrieved documents into blocks, where each block calculates key-value (KV) states independently except for the final block. In RAG scenarios, by defining each passage as a block, Block-Attention enables us to pre-compute the KV states for all passages and cache them in memory, significantly reducing the latency and the computation cost during inference. The implementation involves block segmentation, positional encoding calculation, and fine-tuning the LLM to adapt to the Block-Attention mechanism. Experiments on four RAG benchmarks demonstrate that after block fine-tuning, the Block Attention model can achieve performance comparable to (68.4\% vs 67.9\% on Llama3) or even better (62.8\% vs 59.6\% on Mistral) than self-attention models. Notably, Block-Attention reduces the TTFT (the time to first token) and FLOPs (floating point operations) to a very low level. It only takes 45 ms to output the first token for an input sequence with a total length of 32K. Compared with the self-attention model, the time consumption and corresponding FLOPs are reduced by 98.7\% and 99.8\%, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The profound impact of food on health necessitates advanced nutrition-oriented food recommendation services. Conventional methods often lack the crucial elements of personalization, explainability, and interactivity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) bring interpretability and explainability, their standalone use falls short of achieving true personalization. In this paper, we introduce ChatDiet, a novel LLM-powered framework designed specifically for personalized nutrition-oriented food recommendation chatbots. ChatDiet integrates personal and population models, complemented by an orchestrator, to seamlessly retrieve and process pertinent information. The personal model leverages causal discovery and inference techniques to assess personalized nutritional effects for a specific user, whereas the population model provides generalized information on food nutritional content. The orchestrator retrieves, synergizes and delivers the output of both models to the LLM, providing tailored food recommendations designed to support targeted health outcomes. The result is a dynamic delivery of personalized and explainable food recommendations, tailored to individual user preferences. Our evaluation of ChatDiet includes a compelling case study, where we establish a causal personal model to estimate individual nutrition effects. Our assessments, including a food recommendation test showcasing a 92\% effectiveness rate, coupled with illustrative dialogue examples, underscore ChatDiet's strengths in explainability, personalization, and interactivity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized online content creation, making it much easier to generate high-quality fake news. This misuse threatens the integrity of our digital environment and ethical standards. Therefore, understanding the motivations and mechanisms behind LLM-generated fake news is crucial. In this study, we analyze the creation of fake news from a social psychology perspective and develop a comprehensive LLM-based theoretical framework, LLM-Fake Theory. We introduce a novel pipeline that automates the generation of fake news using LLMs, thereby eliminating the need for manual annotation. Utilizing this pipeline, we create a theoretically informed Machine-generated Fake news dataset, MegaFake, derived from the GossipCop dataset. We conduct comprehensive analyses to evaluate our MegaFake dataset. We believe that our dataset and insights will provide valuable contributions to future research focused on the detection and governance of fake news in the era of LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the mobile development process, creating the user interface (UI) is highly resource intensive. Consequently, numerous studies have focused on automating UI development, such as generating UI from screenshots or design specifications. However, they heavily rely on computer vision techniques for image recognition. Any recognition errors can cause invalid UI element generation, compromising the effectiveness of these automated approaches. Moreover, developing an app UI from scratch remains a time consuming and labor intensive task.   To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called GUIMIGRATOR, which enables the cross platform migration of existing Android app UIs to iOS, thereby automatically generating UI to facilitate the reuse of existing UI. This approach not only avoids errors from screenshot recognition but also reduces the cost of developing UIs from scratch. GUIMIGRATOR extracts and parses Android UI layouts, views, and resources to construct a UI skeleton tree. GUIMIGRATOR generates the final UI code files utilizing target code templates, which are then compiled and validated in the iOS development platform, i.e., Xcode. We evaluate the effectiveness of GUIMIGRATOR on 31 Android open source applications across ten domains. The results show that GUIMIGRATOR achieves a UI similarity score of 78 between migration screenshots, outperforming two popular existing LLMs substantially. Additionally, GUIMIGRATOR demonstrates high efficiency, taking only 7.6 seconds to migrate the datasets. These findings indicate that GUIMIGRATOR effectively facilitates the reuse of Android UI code on iOS, leveraging the strengths of both platforms UI frameworks and making new contributions to cross platform development.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLM) have demonstrated the ability to understand human language by leveraging large amount of text data. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are often limited by available transcribed speech data and benefit from a second pass rescoring using LLM. Recently multi-modal large language models, particularly speech and text foundational models have demonstrated strong spoken language understanding. Speech-Text foundational models leverage large amounts of unlabelled and labelled data both in speech and text modalities to model human language. In this work, we propose novel techniques to use multi-modal LLM for ASR rescoring. We also explore discriminative training to further improve the foundational model rescoring performance. We demonstrate cross-modal knowledge transfer in speech-text LLM can benefit rescoring. Our experiments demonstrate up-to 20% relative improvements over Whisper large ASR and up-to 15% relative improvements over text-only LLM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Leveraging the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), recent LLM-based robot task planning methods yield promising results. However, they mainly focus on single or multiple homogeneous robots on simple tasks. Practically, complex long-horizon tasks always require collaborations among multiple heterogeneous robots especially with more complex action spaces, which makes these tasks more challenging. To this end, we propose COHERENT, a novel LLM-based task planning framework for collaboration of heterogeneous multi-robot systems including quadrotors, robotic dogs, and robotic arms. Specifically, a Proposal-Execution-Feedback-Adjustment (PEFA) mechanism is designed to decompose and assign actions for individual robots, where a centralized task assigner makes a task planning proposal to decompose the complex task into subtasks, and then assigns subtasks to robot executors. Each robot executor selects a feasible action to implement the assigned subtask and reports self-reflection feedback to the task assigner for plan adjustment. The PEFA loops until the task is completed. Moreover, we create a challenging heterogeneous multi-robot task planning benchmark encompassing 100 complex long-horizon tasks. The experimental results show that our work surpasses the previous methods by a large margin in terms of success rate and execution efficiency. The experimental videos, code, and benchmark are released at https://github.com/MrKeee/COHERENT.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) power a new generation of interactive AI applications exemplified by ChatGPT. The interactive nature of these applications demands low latency for LLM inference. Existing LLM serving systems use run-to-completion processing for inference jobs, which suffers from head-of-line blocking and long latency.   We present FastServe, a distributed inference serving system for LLMs. FastServe exploits the autoregressive pattern of LLM inference to enable preemption at the granularity of each output token. FastServe uses preemptive scheduling to minimize latency with a novel skip-join Multi-Level Feedback Queue scheduler. Based on the new semi-information-agnostic setting of LLM inference, the scheduler leverages the input length information to assign an appropriate initial queue for each arrival job to join. The higher priority queues than the joined queue are skipped to reduce demotions. We design an efficient GPU memory management mechanism that proactively offloads and uploads intermediate state between GPU memory and host memory for LLM inference. We build a system prototype of FastServe and experimental results show that compared to the state-of-the-art solution vLLM, FastServe improves the throughput by up to 31.4x and 17.9x under the same average and tail latency requirements, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Speech quality assessment typically requires evaluating audio from multiple aspects, such as mean opinion score (MOS) and speaker similarity (SIM) etc., which can be challenging to cover using one small model designed for a single task. In this paper, we propose leveraging recently introduced auditory large language models (LLMs) for automatic speech quality assessment. By employing task-specific prompts, auditory LLMs are finetuned to predict MOS, SIM and A/B testing results, which are commonly used for evaluating text-to-speech systems. Additionally, the finetuned auditory LLM is able to generate natural language descriptions assessing aspects like noisiness, distortion, discontinuity, and overall quality, providing more interpretable outputs. Extensive experiments have been performed on the NISQA, BVCC, SOMOS and VoxSim speech quality datasets, using open-source auditory LLMs such as SALMONN, Qwen-Audio, and Qwen2-Audio. For the natural language descriptions task, a commercial model Google Gemini 1.5 Pro is also evaluated. The results demonstrate that auditory LLMs achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art task-specific small models in predicting MOS and SIM, while also delivering promising results in A/B testing and natural language descriptions. Our data processing scripts and finetuned model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper proposes a novel prompt engineering technique called Judgment of Thought (JoT) that is specifically tailored for binary logical reasoning tasks. JoT employs three roles$\unicode{x2014}$lawyer, prosecutor, and judge$\unicode{x2014}$to facilitate more reliable and accurate reasoning by the model. In this framework, the judge utilizes a high$\unicode{x2010}$level model, while the lawyer and prosecutor utilize low$\unicode{x2010}$level models. This structure helps the judge better understand the responses from both the lawyer and prosecutor, enabling a more accurate judgment. Experimental results on large language model (LLM) benchmark datasets, such as BigBenchHard and Winogrande, demonstrate that JoT outperforms existing methods, including Chain of Thought (CoT) and Self$\unicode{x2010}$Consistency (SC), in binary logical reasoning tasks. Additionally, in real$\unicode{x2010}$world tasks, such as Fake News Detection and SMS Spam Detection, JoT shows comparable or improved performance compared to existing techniques. JoT significantly enhances the accuracy and reliability of models in binary reasoning tasks and show potential for practical applicability across various domains. Future research should aim to further broaden the applicability of JoT and optimize its implementation for real$\unicode{x2010}$world problem$\unicode{x2010}$solving.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This preliminary white paper proposes a novel 8-bit floating-point data format HiFloat8 (abbreviated as HiF8) for deep learning. HiF8 features tapered precision. For normal value encoding, it provides 7 exponents with 3-bit mantissa, 8 exponents with 2-bit mantissa, and 16 exponents with 1-bit mantissa. For denormal or subnormal value encoding, it extends the dynamic range by 7 extra powers of 2, from 31 to 38 binades (notice that FP16 covers 40 binades). Meanwhile, HiF8 encodes all the special values except that positive zero and negative zero are represented by only one bit-pattern. Thanks to the better balance between precision and dynamic range, HiF8 can be simultaneously used in both forward and backward passes of AI training. In this paper, we will describe the definition and rounding methods of HiF8, as well as the tentative training and inference solutions. To demonstrate the efficacy of HiF8 format, massive simulation results on various neural networks, including traditional neural networks and large language models (LLMs), will also be presented.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While many online services provide privacy policies for end users to read and understand what personal data are being collected, these documents are often lengthy and complicated. As a result, the vast majority of users do not read them at all, leading to data collection under uninformed consent. Several attempts have been made to make privacy policies more user friendly by summarising them, providing automatic annotations or labels for key sections, or by offering chat interfaces to ask specific questions. With recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), there is an opportunity to develop more effective tools to parse privacy policies and help users make informed decisions. In this paper, we propose an entailment-driven LLM based framework to classify paragraphs of privacy policies into meaningful labels that are easily understood by users. The results demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional LLM methods, improving the F1 score in average by 11.2%. Additionally, our framework provides inherently explainable and meaningful predictions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LLM-based applications are helping people write, and LLM-generated text is making its way into social media, journalism, and our classrooms. However, the differences between LLM-generated and human-written text remain unclear. To explore this, we hired professional writers to edit paragraphs in several creative domains. We first found these writers agree on undesirable idiosyncrasies in LLM-generated text, formalizing it into a seven-category taxonomy (e.g. cliches, unnecessary exposition). Second, we curated the LAMP corpus: 1,057 LLM-generated paragraphs edited by professional writers according to our taxonomy. Analysis of LAMP reveals that none of the LLMs used in our study (GPT4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Llama-3.1-70b) outperform each other in terms of writing quality, revealing common limitations across model families. Third, we explored automatic editing methods to improve LLM-generated text. A large-scale preference annotation confirms that although experts largely prefer text edited by other experts, automatic editing methods show promise in improving alignment between LLM-generated and human-written text.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) are interactive systems that provide healthcare services, such as assistance and diagnosis. Current CHAs, especially those utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), primarily focus on conversation aspects. However, they offer limited agent capabilities, specifically lacking multi-step problem-solving, personalized conversations, and multimodal data analysis. Our aim is to overcome these limitations. We propose openCHA, an open-source LLM-powered framework, to empower conversational agents to generate a personalized response for users' healthcare queries. This framework enables developers to integrate external sources including data sources, knowledge bases, and analysis models, into their LLM-based solutions. openCHA includes an orchestrator to plan and execute actions for gathering information from external sources, essential for formulating responses to user inquiries. It facilitates knowledge acquisition, problem-solving capabilities, multilingual and multimodal conversations, and fosters interaction with various AI platforms. We illustrate the framework's proficiency in handling complex healthcare tasks via two demonstrations and four use cases. Moreover, we release openCHA as open source available to the community via GitHub.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has accelerated the progress of handwritten character classification/recognition. Handwritten character recognition (HCR) has found applications in various domains, such as traffic signal detection, language translation, and document information extraction. However, the widespread use of existing HCR technology is yet to be seen as it does not provide reliable character recognition with outstanding accuracy. One of the reasons for unreliable HCR is that existing HCR methods do not take the handwriting styles of non-native writers into account. Hence, further improvement is needed to ensure the reliability and extensive deployment of character recognition technologies for critical tasks. In this work, the classification of English characters written by non-native users is performed by proposing a custom-tailored CNN model. We train this CNN with a new dataset called the handwritten isolated English character (HIEC) dataset. This dataset consists of 16,496 images collected from 260 persons. This paper also includes an ablation study of our CNN by adjusting hyperparameters to identify the best model for the HIEC dataset. The proposed model with five convolutional layers and one hidden layer outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of character recognition accuracy and achieves an accuracy of $\mathbf{97.04}$%. Compared with the second-best model, the relative improvement of our model in terms of classification accuracy is $\mathbf{4.38}$%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To substantially enhance robot intelligence, there is a pressing need to develop a large model that enables general-purpose robots to proficiently undertake a broad spectrum of manipulation tasks, akin to the versatile task-planning ability exhibited by LLMs. The vast diversity in objects, robots, and manipulation tasks presents huge challenges. Our work introduces a comprehensive framework to develop a foundation model for general robotic manipulation that formalizes a manipulation task as contact synthesis. Specifically, our model takes as input object and robot manipulator point clouds, object physical attributes, target motions, and manipulation region masks. It outputs contact points on the object and associated contact forces or post-contact motions for robots to achieve the desired manipulation task. We perform extensive experiments both in the simulation and real-world settings, manipulating articulated rigid objects, rigid objects, and deformable objects that vary in dimensionality, ranging from one-dimensional objects like ropes to two-dimensional objects like cloth and extending to three-dimensional objects such as plasticine. Our model achieves average success rates of around 90\%. Supplementary materials and videos are available on our project website at https://manifoundationmodel.github.io/.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent studies have evaluated the creativity/novelty of large language models (LLMs) primarily from a semantic perspective, using benchmarks from cognitive science. However, accessing the novelty in scholarly publications is a largely unexplored area in evaluating LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a scholarly novelty benchmark (SchNovel) to evaluate LLMs' ability to assess novelty in scholarly papers. SchNovel consists of 15000 pairs of papers across six fields sampled from the arXiv dataset with publication dates spanning 2 to 10 years apart. In each pair, the more recently published paper is assumed to be more novel. Additionally, we propose RAG-Novelty, which simulates the review process taken by human reviewers by leveraging the retrieval of similar papers to assess novelty. Extensive experiments provide insights into the capabilities of different LLMs to assess novelty and demonstrate that RAG-Novelty outperforms recent baseline models.

  Features as Text Tokens for Autonomous Driving</h2>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-language models (VLMs) serve as general-purpose end-to-end models in autonomous driving, performing subtasks such as prediction, planning, and perception through question-and-answer interactions. However, most existing methods rely on computationally expensive visual encoders and large language models (LLMs), making them difficult to deploy in real-world scenarios and real-time applications. Meanwhile, most existing VLMs lack the ability to process multiple images, making it difficult to adapt to multi-camera perception in autonomous driving. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called MiniDrive, which incorporates our proposed Feature Engineering Mixture of Experts (FE-MoE) module and Dynamic Instruction Adapter (DI-Adapter). The FE-MoE effectively maps 2D features into visual token embeddings before being input into the language model. The DI-Adapter enables the visual token embeddings to dynamically change with the instruction text embeddings, resolving the issue of static visual token embeddings for the same image in previous approaches. Compared to previous works, MiniDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of parameter size, floating point operations, and response efficiency, with the smallest version containing only 83M parameters.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in the video comprehension field. Despite remarkable content reasoning and instruction following capabilities they demonstrated, the hallucination problem of these VideoLLMs is less explored compared with its counterpart in the image domain. To mitigate this gap, we first propose EventHallusion, a novel benchmark that focuses on assessing the VideoLMMs' hallucination phenomenon on video event comprehension. Based on the observation that existing VideoLLMs are entangled with the priors stemming from their foundation models, our EventHallusion is curated by meticulously collecting videos and annotating questions to intentionally mislead the VideoLLMs into interpreting events based on these priors rather than accurately understanding the video content. On the other hand, we also propose a simple yet effective method, called Temporal Contrastive Decoding (TCD), to tackle the hallucination problems of VideoLLMs. The proposed TCD suppresses the model's preference toward their priors by comparing the original video with a constructed counterpart, whose temporal cues are disrupted, during the autoregressive decoding stage. Through comprehensive evaluation of eight open-source and two closed-source VideoLLMs on the proposed EventHallusion benchmark, we find that the open-source models suffer significantly from hallucination problems, whereas the closed-source models perform markedly better. By further equipping open-sourced VideoLLMs with the proposed TCD approach, evident performance improvements are achieved across most metrics in the EventHallusion benchmark. Our codes and benchmark data are available at https://github.com/Stevetich/EventHallusion.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Online education platforms have significantly transformed the dissemination of educational resources by providing a dynamic and digital infrastructure. With the further enhancement of this transformation, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has elevated the intelligence levels of these platforms. However, current academic benchmarks provide limited guidance for real-world industry scenarios. This limitation arises because educational applications require more than mere test question responses. To bridge this gap, we introduce CJEval, a benchmark based on Chinese Junior High School Exam Evaluations. CJEval consists of 26,136 samples across four application-level educational tasks covering ten subjects. These samples include not only questions and answers but also detailed annotations such as question types, difficulty levels, knowledge concepts, and answer explanations. By utilizing this benchmark, we assessed LLMs' potential applications and conducted a comprehensive analysis of their performance by fine-tuning on various educational tasks. Extensive experiments and discussions have highlighted the opportunities and challenges of applying LLMs in the field of education.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, the Robotics field has initiated several efforts toward building generalist robot policies through large-scale multi-task Behavior Cloning. However, direct deployments of these policies have led to unsatisfactory performance, where the policy struggles with unseen states and tasks. How can we break through the performance plateau of these models and elevate their capabilities to new heights? In this paper, we propose FLaRe, a large-scale Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning framework that integrates robust pre-trained representations, large-scale training, and gradient stabilization techniques. Our method aligns pre-trained policies towards task completion, achieving state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance both on previously demonstrated and on entirely novel tasks and embodiments. Specifically, on a set of long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks, FLaRe achieves an average success rate of 79.5% in unseen environments, with absolute improvements of +23.6% in simulation and +30.7% on real robots over prior SoTA methods. By utilizing only sparse rewards, our approach can enable generalizing to new capabilities beyond the pretraining data with minimal human effort. Moreover, we demonstrate rapid adaptation to new embodiments and behaviors with less than a day of fine-tuning. Videos can be found on the project website at https://robot-flare.github.io/

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> For assistive robots, one critical use case of SLAM is to support localization as they navigate through an environment completing tasks. Current SLAM benchmarks do not consider task-based deployments where repeatability (precision) is more critical than accuracy. To address this gap, we propose a task-driven benchmarking framework for evaluating SLAM methods. The framework accounts for SLAM's mapping capabilities, employs precision as a key metric, and has low resource requirements to implement. Testing of state-of-the-art SLAM methods in both simulated and real-world scenarios provides insights into the performance properties of modern SLAM solutions. In particular, it shows that passive stereo SLAM operates at a level of precision comparable to LiDAR-based SLAM in typical indoor environments. The benchmarking approach offers a more relevant and accurate assessment of SLAM performance in task-driven applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper studies the problem of information retrieval, to adapt to unseen tasks. Existing work generates synthetic queries from domain-specific documents to jointly train the retriever. However, the conventional query generator assumes the query as a question, thus failing to accommodate general search intents. A more lenient approach incorporates task-adaptive elements, such as few-shot learning with an 137B LLM. In this paper, we challenge a trend equating query and question, and instead conceptualize query generation task as a "compilation" of high-level intent into task-adaptive query. Specifically, we propose EGG, a query generator that better adapts to wide search intents expressed in the BeIR benchmark. Our method outperforms baselines and existing models on four tasks with underexplored intents, while utilizing a query generator 47 times smaller than the previous state-of-the-art. Our findings reveal that instructing the LM with explicit search intent is a key aspect of modeling an effective query generator.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite significant progress in applying large language models (LLMs) to the medical domain, several limitations still prevent them from practical applications. Among these are the constraints on model size and the lack of cohort-specific labeled datasets. In this work, we investigated the potential of improving a lightweight LLM, such as Llama 3.1-8B, through fine-tuning with datasets using synthetic labels. Two tasks are jointly trained by combining their respective instruction datasets. When the quality of the task-specific synthetic labels is relatively high (e.g., generated by GPT4- o), Llama 3.1-8B achieves satisfactory performance on the open-ended disease detection task, with a micro F1 score of 0.91. Conversely, when the quality of the task-relevant synthetic labels is relatively low (e.g., from the MIMIC-CXR dataset), fine-tuned Llama 3.1-8B is able to surpass its noisy teacher labels (micro F1 score of 0.67 v.s. 0.63) when calibrated against curated labels, indicating the strong inherent underlying capability of the model. These findings demonstrate the potential of fine-tuning LLMs with synthetic labels, offering a promising direction for future research on LLM specialization in the medical domain.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown outstanding performance across numerous real-world tasks. However, the autoregressive nature of these models makes the inference process slow and costly. Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising solution, leveraging a smaller auxiliary model to draft future tokens, which are then validated simultaneously by the larger model, achieving a speed-up of 1-2x. Although speculative decoding matches the same distribution as multinomial sampling, multinomial sampling itself is prone to suboptimal outputs, whereas beam sampling is widely recognized for producing higher-quality results by maintaining multiple candidate sequences at each step. This paper explores the novel integration of speculative decoding with beam sampling. However, there are four key challenges: (1) how to generate multiple sequences from the larger model's distribution given drafts sequences from the small model; (2) how to dynamically optimize the number of beams to balance efficiency and accuracy; (3) how to efficiently verify the multiple drafts in parallel; and (4) how to address the extra memory costs inherent in beam sampling. To address these challenges, we propose dynamic-width speculative beam decoding (DSBD). Specifically, we first introduce a novel draft and verification scheme that generates multiple sequences following the large model's distribution based on beam sampling trajectories from the small model. Then, we introduce an adaptive mechanism to dynamically tune the number of beams based on the context, optimizing efficiency and effectiveness. Besides, we extend tree-based parallel verification to handle multiple trees simultaneously, accelerating the verification process. Finally, we illustrate a simple modification to our algorithm to mitigate the memory overhead of beam sampling...

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), an increasing number of open-source software projects are using LLMs as their core functional component. Although research and practice on LLMs are capturing considerable interest, no dedicated studies explored the challenges faced by practitioners of LLM open-source projects, the causes of these challenges, and potential solutions. To fill this research gap, we conducted an empirical study to understand the issues that practitioners encounter when developing and using LLM open-source software, the possible causes of these issues, and potential solutions.We collected all closed issues from 15 LLM open-source projects and labelled issues that met our requirements. We then randomly selected 994 issues from the labelled issues as the sample for data extraction and analysis to understand the prevalent issues, their underlying causes, and potential solutions. Our study results show that (1) Model Issue is the most common issue faced by practitioners, (2) Model Problem, Configuration and Connection Problem, and Feature and Method Problem are identified as the most frequent causes of the issues, and (3) Optimize Model is the predominant solution to the issues. Based on the study results, we provide implications for practitioners and researchers of LLM open-source projects.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LLMs obtain remarkable performance but suffer from hallucinations. Most research on detecting hallucination focuses on the questions with short and concrete correct answers that are easy to check the faithfulness. Hallucination detections for text generation with open-ended answers are more challenging. Some researchers use external knowledge to detect hallucinations in generated texts, but external resources for specific scenarios are hard to access. Recent studies on detecting hallucinations in long text without external resources conduct consistency comparison among multiple sampled outputs. To handle long texts, researchers split long texts into multiple facts and individually compare the consistency of each pairs of facts. However, these methods (1) hardly achieve alignment among multiple facts; (2) overlook dependencies between multiple contextual facts. In this paper, we propose a graph-based context-aware (GCA) hallucination detection for text generations, which aligns knowledge facts and considers the dependencies between contextual knowledge triples in consistency comparison. Particularly, to align multiple facts, we conduct a triple-oriented response segmentation to extract multiple knowledge triples. To model dependencies among contextual knowledge triple (facts), we construct contextual triple into a graph and enhance triples' interactions via message passing and aggregating via RGCN. To avoid the omission of knowledge triples in long text, we conduct a LLM-based reverse verification via reconstructing the knowledge triples. Experiments show that our model enhances hallucination detection and excels all baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Dialogue-based Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) have significantly advanced adaptive and personalized learning by automating sophisticated human tutoring strategies within interactive dialogues. However, replicating the nuanced patterns of expert human communication remains a challenge in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Recent advancements in NLP, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-4, offer promising solutions by providing human-like and context-aware responses based on extensive pre-trained knowledge. Motivated by the effectiveness of LLMs in various educational tasks (e.g., content creation and summarization, problem-solving, and automated feedback provision), our study introduces the Socratic Playground for Learning (SPL), a dialogue-based ITS powered by the GPT-4 model, which employs the Socratic teaching method to foster critical thinking among learners. Through extensive prompt engineering, SPL can generate specific learning scenarios and facilitates efficient multi-turn tutoring dialogues. The SPL system aims to enhance personalized and adaptive learning experiences tailored to individual needs, specifically focusing on improving critical thinking skills. Our pilot experimental results from essay writing tasks demonstrate SPL has the potential to improve tutoring interactions and further enhance dialogue-based ITS functionalities. Our study, exemplified by SPL, demonstrates how LLMs enhance dialogue-based ITSs and expand the accessibility and efficacy of educational technologies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Model quantization has become a crucial technique to address the issues of large memory consumption and long inference times associated with LLMs. Mixed-precision quantization, which distinguishes between important and unimportant parameters, stands out among numerous quantization schemes as it achieves a balance between precision and compression rate. However, existing approaches can only identify important parameters through qualitative analysis and manual experiments without quantitatively analyzing how their importance is determined. We propose a new criterion, so-called 'precision alignment', to build a quantitative framework to holistically evaluate the importance of parameters in mixed-precision quantization. Our observations on floating point addition under various real-world scenarios suggest that two addends should have identical precision, otherwise the information in the higher-precision number will be wasted. Such an observation offers an essential principle to determine the precision of each parameter in matrix multiplication operation. As the first step towards applying the above discovery to large model inference, we develop a dynamic KV-Cache quantization technique to effectively reduce memory access latency. Different from existing quantization approaches that focus on memory saving, this work directly aims to accelerate LLM inference through quantifying floating numbers. The proposed technique attains a 25% saving of memory access and delivers up to 1.3x speedup in the computation of attention in the decoding phase of LLM, with almost no loss of precision.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Secure pairing is crucial for ensuring the trustworthy deployment and operation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, traditional pairing methods are often unsuitable for IoT devices due to their lack of conventional user interfaces, such as keyboards. Proximity-based pairing approaches are usable but vulnerable to exploitation by co-located malicious devices. While methods based on a user's physical operations (such as shaking) on IoT devices offer greater security, they typically rely on inertial sensors to sense the operations, which most IoT devices lack. We introduce a novel technique called Universal Operation Sensing, enabling IoT devices to sense the user's physical operations without the need for inertial sensors. With this technique, users can complete the pairing process within seconds using simple actions such as pressing a button or twisting a knob, whether they are holding a smartphone or wearing a smartwatch. Moreover, we reveal an inaccuracy issue in the fuzzy commitment protocol, which is frequently used for pairing. To address it, we propose an accurate pairing protocol, which does not use fuzzy commitment and incurs zero information loss. The comprehensive evaluation shows that it is secure, usable and efficient.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), their applications have expanded into diverse fields, such as code assistance. However, the substantial size of LLMs makes their training highly resource- and time-intensive, rendering frequent retraining or updates impractical. Consequently, time-sensitive data can become outdated, potentially misleading LLMs in time-aware tasks. For example, new vulnerabilities are discovered in various programs every day. Without updating their knowledge, LLMs may inadvertently generate code that includes these newly discovered vulnerabilities. Current strategies, such as prompt engineering and fine-tuning, do not effectively address this issue.   To address this issue, we propose solution, named APILOT, which maintains a realtime, quickly updatable dataset of outdated APIs. Additionally, APILOT utilizes an augmented generation method that leverages this dataset to navigate LLMs in generating secure, version-aware code. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation to measure the effectiveness of APILOT in reducing the incidence of outdated API recommendations across seven different state-of-the-art LLMs. The evaluation results indicate that APILOT can reduce outdated code recommendations by 89.42% on average with limited performance overhead. Interestingly, while enhancing security, APILOT also improves the usability of the code generated by LLMs, showing an average increase of 27.54% in usability. This underscores APILOT's dual capability to enhance both the safety and practical utility of code suggestions in contemporary software development environments.
