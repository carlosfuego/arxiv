                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a powerful system of distributed caching servers that aims to accelerate content delivery, like high-definition video, IoT applications, and ultra-low-latency services, efficiently and with fast velocity. This has become of paramount importance in the post-pandemic era. Challenges arise when exponential content volume growth and scalability across different geographic locations are required. This paper investigates data-driven evaluations of CDN algorithms in dynamic server selection for latency reduction, bandwidth throttling for efficient resource management, real-time Round Trip Time analysis for adaptive routing, and programmatic network delay simulation to emulate various conditions. Key performance metrics, such as round-trip time (RTT) and CPU usage, are carefully analyzed to evaluate scalability and algorithmic efficiency through two experimental setups: a constrained edge-like local system and a scalable FABRIC testbed. The statistical validation of RTT trends, alongside CPU utilization, is presented in the results. The optimization process reveals significant trade-offs between scalability and resource consumption, providing actionable insights for effectively deploying and enhancing CDN algorithms in edge and distributed computing environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we investigate whether current state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are effective as AI tutors and whether they demonstrate pedagogical abilities necessary for good AI tutoring in educational dialogues. Previous efforts towards evaluation have been limited to subjective protocols and benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified evaluation taxonomy with eight pedagogical dimensions based on key learning sciences principles, which is designed to assess the pedagogical value of LLM-powered AI tutor responses grounded in student mistakes or confusion in the mathematical domain. We release MRBench -- a new evaluation benchmark containing 192 conversations and 1,596 responses from seven state-of-the-art LLM-based and human tutors, providing gold annotations for eight pedagogical dimensions. We assess reliability of the popular Prometheus2 LLM as an evaluator and analyze each tutor's pedagogical abilities, highlighting which LLMs are good tutors and which ones are more suitable as question-answering systems. We believe that the presented taxonomy, benchmark, and human-annotated labels will streamline the evaluation process and help track the progress in AI tutors' development.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As a core component in modern data centers, key-value cache provides high-throughput and low-latency services for high-speed data processing. The effectiveness of a key-value cache relies on its ability of accommodating the needed data. However, expanding the cache capacity is often more difficult than commonly expected because of many practical constraints, such as server costs, cooling issues, rack space, and even human resource expenses. A potential solution is compression, which virtually extends the cache capacity by condensing data in cache. In practice, this seemingly simple idea has not gained much traction in key-value cache system design, due to several critical issues: the compression-unfriendly index structure, severe read/write amplification, wasteful decompression operations, and heavy computing cost. This paper presents a hybrid DRAM-SSD cache design to realize a systematic integration of data compression in key-value cache. By treating compression as an essential component, we have redesigned the indexing structure, data management, and leveraged the emerging computational SSD hardware for collaborative optimizations. We have developed a prototype, called ZipCache. Our experimental results show that ZipCache can achieve up to 72.4% higher throughput and 42.4% lower latency, while reducing the write amplification by up to 26.2 times.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm that enables intelligent agents to collaboratively train Machine Learning (ML) models in a distributed manner, eliminating the need for sharing their local data. The recent work (arXiv:2106.02969) introduces a family of Federated Newton Learn (FedNL) algorithms, marking a significant step towards applying second-order methods to FL and large-scale optimization. However, the reference FedNL prototype exhibits three serious practical drawbacks: (i) It requires 4.8 hours to launch a single experiment in a sever-grade workstation; (ii) The prototype only simulates multi-node setting; (iii) Prototype integration into resource-constrained applications is challenging. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we present a self-contained implementation of FedNL, FedNL-LS, FedNL-PP for single-node and multi-node settings. Our work resolves the aforementioned issues and reduces the wall clock time by x1000. With this FedNL outperforms alternatives for training logistic regression in a single-node -- CVXPY (arXiv:1603.00943), and in a multi-node -- Apache Spark (arXiv:1505.06807), Ray/Scikit-Learn (arXiv:1712.05889). Finally, we propose two practical-orientated compressors for FedNL - adaptive TopLEK and cache-aware RandSeqK, which fulfill the theory of FedNL.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) on smartphones enable real-time AI assistance and privacy-preserving, offline operation. However, resource constraints of smartphones limit current deployments to small language models (SLMs), significantly compromising their capabilities. This paper introduces PowerInfer-2, a smartphone-based framework that enables fast inference for LLMs exceeding the memory capacity. The key insight is decomposing matrix operations into neuron clusters as the basic processing unit, which enables flexible scheduling and efficient I/O-computation pipelining. PowerInfer-2 leverages this neuron-cluster-based design in both computation and storage. For computation, neuron clusters with dense activations are processed on NPU, while sparse clusters use CPU. The storage engine provides a fine-grained pipeline mechanism that coordinates cluster-level computation and I/O operations, enhanced by a segmented neuron cache to reduce I/O activities. PowerInfer-2 achieves up to a 27.8x speed increase compared to state-of-the-art frameworks. PowerInfer-2 is the first system to serve a 47B LLM on a smartphone, achieving 11.68 tokens/s. Notably, these performance improvements preserve model quality with negligible accuracy degradation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a practical approach to scale up parameters for the Transformer model to achieve better generalization while maintaining a sub-linear increase in computation overhead. Current MoE models are mainly built with expert parallelism on distributed devices. However, it usually depends on homogeneous devices to deploy and suffers from heavy communication overhead and computation redundancy. In this paper, we explore developing a \texttt{H}eterogeneous-aware \texttt{EX}pert \texttt{A}llocation framework, \textbf{\texttt{HEXA-MoE}}, with significantly enhanced computing efficiency. It contains two components: ($1$) \textit{Expert-Specific Operators}. We replace the typical general matrix multiplication or grouped matrix multiplication interfaces with our operators, which allows the computing to be performed in an in-place manner with \textbf{ZERO} redundancy. ($2$) \textit{Adaptive Data- and Model-Centric Configurations} for different workload scales. Specifically, we introduce a pipeline-shared cache on each device to tackle the heavy memory consumption in the existing data-centric MoE library. Comprehensive experiments on the Swin-MoE benchmark consistently reveal the effectiveness of our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} framework, i.e., reducing $10\%\sim48\%$ memory consumption and achieving $0.5\sim4.3\times$ speed up compared to current state-of-the-art MoE libraries. Furthermore, we examine our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} with heterogeneous devices for both data- and model-centric settings. Promising results show that employing optimal parallel configuration with \texttt{HEXA-MoE} on heterogeneous devices can substantially minimize overall latency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Phishing is a critical cyber threat, exploiting deceptive tactics to compromise victims and cause significant financial losses. While reference-based phishing detectors (RBPDs) achieve high precision by analyzing brand-domain consistency, their real-world deployment is hindered by challenges such as high latency and inefficiency in URL analysis. To address these limitations, we present PhishIntel, an end-to-end phishing detection system for real-world deployment. PhishIntel intelligently determines whether a URL can be processed immediately or not, segmenting the detection process into two distinct tasks: a fast task that checks against local blacklists and result cache, and a slow task that conducts online blacklist verification, URL crawling, and webpage analysis using an RBPD. This fast-slow task system architecture ensures low response latency while retaining the robust detection capabilities of RBPDs for zero-day phishing threats. Furthermore, we develop two downstream applications based on PhishIntel: a phishing intelligence platform and a phishing email detection plugin for Microsoft Outlook, demonstrating its practical efficacy and utility.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language models (LLMs) have become a research hotspot. To accelerate the inference of LLMs, storing computed caches in memory has become the standard technique. However, as the inference length increases, growing KV caches might lead to out-of-memory issues. Many existing methods address this issue through KV cache compression, primarily by preserving key tokens throughout all layers to reduce information loss. Most of them allocate a uniform budget size for each layer to retain. However, we observe that the minimum budget sizes needed to retain essential information vary across layers and models based on the perspectives of attention and hidden state output. Building on this observation, this paper proposes a simple yet effective KV cache compression method that leverages layer uncertainty to allocate budget size for each layer. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce memory usage of the KV caches to only $\sim$20\% when compared to Full KV inference while achieving nearly lossless performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep learning kernels exhibit predictable memory accesses and compute patterns, making GPUs' parallel architecture well-suited for their execution. Software and runtime systems for GPUs are optimized to better utilize the stream multiprocessors, on-chip cache, and off-chip high-bandwidth memory. As deep learning models and GPUs evolve, access to newer GPUs is often limited, raising questions about the performance of new model architectures on existing GPUs, existing models on new GPUs, and new model architectures on new GPUs. To address these questions, we introduce NeuSight, a framework to predict the performance of various deep learning models, for both training and inference, on unseen GPUs without requiring actual execution. The framework leverages both GPU hardware behavior and software library optimizations to estimate end-to-end performance. Previous work uses regression models that capture linear trends or multilayer perceptrons to predict the overall latency of deep learning kernels on GPUs. These approaches suffer from higher error percentages when forecasting performance on unseen models and new GPUs. Instead, NeuSight decomposes the prediction problem into smaller problems, bounding the prediction through fundamental performance laws. NeuSight decomposes a single deep learning kernel prediction into smaller working sets called tiles, which are executed independently on the GPU. Tile-granularity predictions are determined using a machine learning approach and aggregated to estimate end-to-end latency. NeuSight outperforms prior work across various deep learning workloads and the latest GPUs. It reduces the percentage error from 121.4% and 30.8% to 2.3% in predicting the latency of GPT3 model for training and inference on H100, compared to state-of-the-art prior work, where both GPT3 and H100 were not used to train the framework.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce Lexico, a novel KV cache compression method that leverages sparse coding with a universal dictionary. Our key finding is that key-value cache in modern LLMs can be accurately approximated using sparse linear combination from a small, input-agnostic dictionary of ~4k atoms, enabling efficient compression across different input prompts, tasks and models. Using orthogonal matching pursuit for sparse approximation, Lexico achieves flexible compression ratios through direct sparsity control. On GSM8K, across multiple model families (Mistral, Llama 3, Qwen2.5), Lexico maintains 90-95% of the original performance while using only 15-25% of the full KV-cache memory, outperforming both quantization and token eviction methods. Notably, Lexico remains effective in low memory regimes where 2-bit quantization fails, achieving up to 1.7x better compression on LongBench and GSM8K while maintaining high accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language model (LLM) inference demands significant amount of computation and memory, especially in the key attention mechanism. While techniques, such as quantization and acceleration algorithms, like FlashAttention, have improved efficiency of the overall inference, they address different aspects of the problem: quantization focuses on weight-activation operations, while FlashAttention improves execution but requires high-precision formats. Recent Key-value (KV) cache quantization reduces memory bandwidth but still needs floating-point dequantization for attention operation.   We present TurboAttention, a comprehensive approach to enable quantized execution of attention that simultaneously addresses both memory and computational efficiency. Our solution introduces two key innovations: FlashQ, a headwise attention quantization technique that enables both compression of KV cache and quantized execution of activation-activation multiplication, and Sparsity-based Softmax Approximation (SAS), which eliminates the need for dequantization to FP32 during exponentiation operation in attention. Experimental results demonstrate that TurboAttention achieves 1.2-1.8x speedup in attention, reduces the KV cache size by over 4.4x, and enables up to 2.37x maximum throughput over the FP16 baseline while outperforming state-of-the-art quantization and compression techniques across various datasets and models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the demand for higher quality and faster processing of long contexts across various applications is growing. KV cache is widely adopted as it stores previously generated key and value tokens, effectively reducing redundant computations during inference. However, as memory overhead becomes a significant concern, efficient compression of KV cache has gained increasing attention. Most existing methods perform compression from two perspectives: identifying important tokens and designing compression strategies. However, these approaches often produce biased distributions of important tokens due to the influence of accumulated attention scores or positional encoding. Furthermore, they overlook the sparsity and redundancy across different heads, which leads to difficulties in preserving the most effective information at the head level. To this end, we propose EMS to overcome these limitations, while achieving better KV cache compression under extreme compression ratios. Specifically, we introduce a Global-Local score that combines accumulated attention scores from both global and local KV tokens to better identify the token importance. For the compression strategy, we design an adaptive and unified Evict-then-Merge framework that accounts for the sparsity and redundancy of KV tokens across different heads. Additionally, we implement the head-wise parallel compression through a zero-class mechanism to enhance efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate our SOTA performance even under extreme compression ratios. EMS consistently achieves the lowest perplexity, improves scores by over 1.28 points across four LLMs on LongBench under a 256 cache budget, and preserves 95% retrieval accuracy with a cache budget less than 2% of the context length in the Needle-in-a-Haystack task.

Unlike existing works, OrbitCache does not cache hot items in the switch memory. Instead, we make hot items revisit the switch data plane continuously by exploiting packet recirculation. Our approach keeps cached key-value pairs in the switch data plane while freeing them from item size limitations caused by hardware constraints. We implement an OrbitCache prototype on an Intel Tofino switch. Our experimental results show that OrbitCache can balance highly skewed workloads and is robust to various system conditions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite the efficiency of prompt learning in transferring vision-language models (VLMs) to downstream tasks, existing methods mainly learn the prompts in a coarse-grained manner where the learned prompt vectors are shared across all categories. Consequently, the tailored prompts often fail to discern class-specific visual concepts, thereby hindering the transferred performance for classes that share similar or complex visual attributes. Recent advances mitigate this challenge by leveraging external knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) to furnish class descriptions, yet incurring notable inference costs. In this paper, we introduce TextRefiner, a plug-and-play method to refine the text prompts of existing methods by leveraging the internal knowledge of VLMs. Particularly, TextRefiner builds a novel local cache module to encapsulate fine-grained visual concepts derivedfrom local tokens within the image branch. By aggregating and aligning the cached visual descriptions with the original output of the text branch, TextRefiner can efficiently refine and enrich the learned prompts from existing methods without relying on any external expertise. For example, it improves the performance of CoOp from 71.66 % to 76.94 % on 11 benchmarks, surpassing CoCoOp which introduces instance-wise features for text prompts. Equipped with TextRefiner, PromptKD achieves state-of-the-art performance and is efficient in inference. Our code is relesed at https://github.com/xjjxmu/TextRefiner

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in code completion tasks, where they assist developers by predicting and generating new code in real-time. However, existing LLM-based code completion systems primarily rely on the immediate context of the file being edited, often missing valuable repository-level information, user behaviour and edit history that could improve suggestion accuracy. Additionally, challenges such as efficiently retrieving relevant code snippets from large repositories, incorporating user behavior, and balancing accuracy with low-latency requirements in production environments remain unresolved. In this paper, we propose ContextModule, a framework designed to enhance LLM-based code completion by retrieving and integrating three types of contextual information from the repository: user behavior-based code, similar code snippets, and critical symbol definitions. By capturing user interactions across files and leveraging repository-wide static analysis, ContextModule improves the relevance and precision of generated code. We implement performance optimizations, such as index caching, to ensure the system meets the latency constraints of real-world coding environments. Experimental results and industrial practise demonstrate that ContextModule significantly improves code completion accuracy and user acceptance rates.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have propelled the field of computer vision, particularly in the zero-shot learning setting. Despite their promise, the effectiveness of these models often diminishes due to domain shifts in test environments. To address this, we introduce the Test-Time Prototype Shifting (TPS) framework, a pioneering approach designed to adapt VLMs to test datasets using unlabeled test inputs. Our method is based on the notion of modulating per-class prototypes in the shared embedding space. By pre-computing and caching prototypes generated with the pre-trained text encoder, TPS not only facilitates optimization-free prototype reuse for subsequent predictions but also enables seamless integration with current advancements in prompt engineering. At test-time, TPS dynamically learns shift vectors for each prototype based solely on the given test sample, effectively bridging the domain gap and enhancing classification accuracy. A notable aspect of our framework is its significantly reduced memory and computational demands when compared to conventional text-prompt tuning methods. Extensive evaluations across 15 image classification datasets involving natural distribution shifts and cross-dataset generalization, as well as in context-dependent visual reasoning, demonstrate TPS's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results while reducing resource requirements.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current video diffusion models achieve impressive generation quality but struggle in interactive applications due to bidirectional attention dependencies. The generation of a single frame requires the model to process the entire sequence, including the future. We address this limitation by adapting a pretrained bidirectional diffusion transformer to a causal transformer that generates frames on-the-fly. To further reduce latency, we extend distribution matching distillation (DMD) to videos, distilling 50-step diffusion model into a 4-step generator. To enable stable and high-quality distillation, we introduce a student initialization scheme based on teacher's ODE trajectories, as well as an asymmetric distillation strategy that supervises a causal student model with a bidirectional teacher. This approach effectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive generation, allowing long-duration video synthesis despite training on short clips. Our model supports fast streaming generation of high quality videos at 9.4 FPS on a single GPU thanks to KV caching. Our approach also enables streaming video-to-video translation, image-to-video, and dynamic prompting in a zero-shot manner. We will release the code based on an open-source model in the future.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While Transformers and other sequence-parallelizable neural network architectures seem like the current state of the art in sequence modeling, they specifically lack state-tracking capabilities. These are important for time-series tasks and logical reasoning. Traditional RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs, as well as modern variants like sLSTM do have these capabilities at the cost of strictly sequential processing. While this is often seen as a strong limitation, we show how fast these networks can get with our hardware-optimization FlashRNN in Triton and CUDA, optimizing kernels to the register level on modern GPUs. We extend traditional RNNs with a parallelization variant that processes multiple RNNs of smaller hidden state in parallel, similar to the head-wise processing in Transformers. To enable flexibility on different GPU variants, we introduce a new optimization framework for hardware-internal cache sizes, memory and compute handling. It models the hardware in a setting using polyhedral-like constraints, including the notion of divisibility. This speeds up the solution process in our ConstrINT library for general integer constraint satisfaction problems (integer CSPs). We show that our kernels can achieve 50x speed-ups over a vanilla PyTorch implementation and allow 40x larger hidden sizes compared to our Triton implementation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The recent surge of interest in comprehensive multimodal models has necessitated the unification of diverse modalities. However, the unification suffers from disparate methodologies. Continuous visual generation necessitates the full-sequence diffusion-based approach, despite its divergence from the autoregressive modeling in the text domain. We posit that autoregressive modeling, i.e., predicting the future based on past deterministic experience, remains crucial in developing both a visual generation model and a potential unified multimodal model. In this paper, we explore an interpolation between the autoregressive modeling and full-parameters diffusion to model visual information. At its core, we present ACDiT, an Autoregressive blockwise Conditional Diffusion Transformer, where the block size of diffusion, i.e., the size of autoregressive units, can be flexibly adjusted to interpolate between token-wise autoregression and full-sequence diffusion. ACDiT is easy to implement, as simple as creating a Skip-Causal Attention Mask (SCAM) during training. During inference, the process iterates between diffusion denoising and autoregressive decoding that can make full use of KV-Cache. We verify the effectiveness of ACDiT on image and video generation tasks. We also demonstrate that benefitted from autoregressive modeling, ACDiT can be seamlessly used in visual understanding tasks despite being trained on the diffusion objective. The analysis of the trade-off between autoregressive modeling and diffusion demonstrates the potential of ACDiT to be used in long-horizon visual generation tasks. These strengths make it promising as the backbone of future unified models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Long video understanding poses a significant challenge for current Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Notably, the MLLMs are constrained by their limited context lengths and the substantial costs while processing long videos. Although several existing methods attempt to reduce visual tokens, their strategies encounter severe bottleneck, restricting MLLMs' ability to perceive fine-grained visual details. In this work, we propose Video-XL, a novel approach that leverages MLLMs' inherent key-value (KV) sparsification capacity to condense the visual input. Specifically, we introduce a new special token, the Visual Summarization Token (VST), for each interval of the video, which summarizes the visual information within the interval as its associated KV. The VST module is trained by instruction fine-tuning, where two optimizing strategies are offered. 1.Curriculum learning, where VST learns to make small (easy) and large compression (hard) progressively. 2. Composite data curation, which integrates single-image, multi-image, and synthetic data to overcome the scarcity of long-video instruction data. The compression quality is further improved by dynamic compression, which customizes compression granularity based on the information density of different video intervals. Video-XL's effectiveness is verified from three aspects. First, it achieves a superior long-video understanding capability, outperforming state-of-the-art models of comparable sizes across multiple popular benchmarks. Second, it effectively preserves video information, with minimal compression loss even at 16x compression ratio. Third, it realizes outstanding cost-effectiveness, enabling high-quality processing of thousands of frames on a single A100 GPU.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT, have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling nuanced understanding and generation of human-like text across a wide range of applications. However, the high computational and financial costs associated with frequent API calls to these models present a substantial bottleneck, especially for applications like customer service chatbots that handle repetitive queries. In this paper, we introduce GPT Semantic Cache, a method that leverages semantic caching of query embeddings in in-memory storage (Redis). By storing embeddings of user queries, our approach efficiently identifies semantically similar questions, allowing for the retrieval of pre-generated responses without redundant API calls to the LLM. This technique achieves a notable reduction in operational costs while significantly enhancing response times, making it a robust solution for optimizing LLM-powered applications. Our experiments demonstrate that GPT Semantic Cache reduces API calls by up to 68.8% across various query categories, with cache hit rates ranging from 61.6% to 68.8%. Additionally, the system achieves high accuracy, with positive hit rates exceeding 97%, confirming the reliability of cached responses. This technique not only reduces operational costs, but also improves response times, enhancing the efficiency of LLM-powered applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Caching content at the edge network is a popular and effective technique widely deployed to alleviate the burden of network backhaul, shorten service delay and improve service quality. However, there has been some controversy over privacy violations in caching content at the edge network. On the one hand, the multi-access open edge network provides an ideal entrance or interface for external attackers to obtain private data from edge caches by extracting sensitive information. On the other hand, privacy can be infringed on by curious edge caching providers through caching trace analysis targeting the achievement of better caching performance or higher profits. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of privacy issues in edge caching networks is vital and indispensable for creating a privacy-preserving caching service at the edge network. In this article, we are among the first to fill this gap by examining privacy-preserving techniques for caching content at the edge network. Firstly, we provide an introduction to the background of privacy-preserving edge caching (PPEC). Next, we summarize the key privacy issues and present a taxonomy for caching at the edge network from the perspective of private information. Additionally, we conduct a retrospective review of the state-of-the-art countermeasures against privacy leakage from content caching at the edge network. Finally, we conclude the survey and envision challenges for future research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently the generative Large Language Model (LLM) has achieved remarkable success in numerous applications. Notably its inference generates output tokens one-by-one, leading to many redundant computations. The widely-used KV-Cache framework makes a compromise between time and space complexities. However, caching data generates the increasingly growing memory demand, that can quickly exhaust the limited memory capacity of the modern accelerator like GPUs, particularly in long-context inference tasks. Existing studies reduce memory consumption by evicting some of cached data that have less important impact on inference accuracy. But the benefit in practice is far from ideal due to the static cache allocation across different LLM network layers. This paper observes that the layer-specific cached data have very different impacts on accuracy. We quantify this difference, and give experimental and theoretical validation. We accordingly make a formal analysis and shows that customizing the cache size for each layer in a personalized manner can yield a significant memory reduction, while still providing comparable accuracy. We simulate the cache allocation as a combinatorial optimization problem and give a global optimal solution. In particular, we devise a mini- and sampling-based inference over a lightweight variant of the LLM model, so as to quickly capture the difference and then feed it into the personalized algorithms. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposals can reduce KV cache memory consumption by 61.6% on average, improve computational efficiency by 2.1x and then increase the throughput by up to 5.5x.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Content creators often use music to enhance their videos, from soundtracks in movies to background music in video blogs and social media content. However, identifying the best music for a video can be a difficult and time-consuming task. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for automatically retrieving a matching music clip for a given video, and vice versa. Our approach leverages annotated music labels, as well as the inherent artistic correspondence between visual and music elements. Distinct from previous cross-modal music retrieval works, our method combines both self-supervised and supervised training objectives. We use self-supervised and label-supervised contrastive learning to train a joint embedding space between music and video. We show the effectiveness of our approach by using music genre labels for the supervised training component, and our framework can be generalized to other music annotations (e.g., emotion, instrument, etc.). Furthermore, our method enables fine-grained control over how much the retrieval process focuses on self-supervised vs. label information at inference time. We evaluate the learned embeddings through a variety of video-to-music and music-to-video retrieval tasks. Our experiments show that the proposed approach successfully combines self-supervised and supervised objectives and is effective for controllable music-video retrieval.

The reflectivity anisotropy signal contains oscillations at the fundamental frequency of the resonant infrared-active phonon mode as well as its second, third, and fourth harmonics. The effect is ascribed to coherent anharmonic phonons resonantly excited by the strong terahertz field. Pump terahertz pulses also induce an almost instantaneous Kerr effect and a long-lived optical anisotropy of the crystal with a characteristic decay time of $\gtrsim$ 100 ps. We consider lattice distortion and phonon-assisted side valley population as possible origins of this metastable state.

In settings with limited GPU memory, and when the input context is longer than the generation length, we show that by also compressing the KV cache during the input processing phase, larger batch sizes can be used resulting in significantly higher throughput while still maintaining the original model's accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters demonstrate impressive performance. However, the widely used Multi-Head Attention (MHA) in LLMs incurs substantial computational and memory costs during inference. While some efforts have optimized attention mechanisms by pruning heads or sharing parameters among heads, these methods often lead to performance degradation or necessitate substantial continued pre-training costs to restore performance. Based on the analysis of attention redundancy, we design a Decoupled-Head Attention (DHA) mechanism. DHA adaptively configures group sharing for key heads and value heads across various layers, achieving a better balance between performance and efficiency. Inspired by the observation of clustering similar heads, we propose to progressively transform the MHA checkpoint into the DHA model through linear fusion of similar head parameters step by step, retaining the parametric knowledge of the MHA checkpoint. We construct DHA models by transforming various scales of MHA checkpoints given target head budgets. Our experiments show that DHA remarkably requires a mere 0.25\% of the original model's pre-training budgets to achieve 97.6\% of performance while saving 75\% of KV cache. Compared to Group-Query Attention (GQA), DHA achieves a 5$\times$ training acceleration, a maximum of 13.93\% performance improvement under 0.01\% pre-training budget, and 4\% relative improvement under 0.05\% pre-training budget.

The extensive key-value (KV) cache, necessitated by the lengthy input and output sequences, notably contributes to the high inference cost. Based on this, recent works have investigated ways to reduce the KV cache size for higher efficiency. Although effective, they generally overlook the distinct importance distributions of KV vectors across layers and maintain the same cache size for each layer during the next token prediction. This results in the significant contextual information loss for certain layers, leading to notable performance decline. To address this, we present PrefixKV. It reframes the challenge of determining KV cache sizes for all layers into the task of searching for the optimal global prefix configuration. With an adaptive layer-wise KV retention recipe based on binary search, the maximum contextual information can thus be preserved in each layer, facilitating the generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with others. It exhibits superior inference efficiency and generation quality trade-offs, showing promising potential for practical applications. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/THU-MIG/PrefixKV}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Latency is a major concern for web rendering engines like those in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. These engines reduce latency by using an incremental layout algorithm to redraw the page when the user interacts with it. In such an algorithm, elements that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty; only the dirty elements need be processed to draw the next frame, dramatically reducing latency. However, the standard incremental layout algorithm must search the page for dirty elements, accessing a number of auxiliary elements in the process. These auxiliary elements add cache misses and stalled cycles, and are responsible for a sizable fraction of all layout latency. We introduce a new, faster incremental layout algorithm called Spineless Traversal. Spineless Traversal uses a more computationally demanding priority queue algorithm to avoid the need to access auxiliary nodes and thus reduces cache traffic and stalls. This leads to dramatic speedups on the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, or animations. Moreover, thanks to numerous low-level optimizations, we are able to make Spineless Traversal competitive across the whole spectrum of incremental layout workloads. As a result, across 2216 benchmarks, Spineless Traversal is faster on 78.2% of the benchmark, with a mean speedup of 3.23x concentrated in the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, and animations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A microscopic model of a heterostructure with a quantum well (QW) is proposed to study the exciton behavior in an external electric field. The effect of an electric field ranging from 0 to 6 kV/cm applied to the GaAs/AlGaAs QW structure in the growth direction is studied for several QWs of various widths up to 100 nm. The three-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation (SE) of exciton is numerically solved using the finite difference method. Wave functions and energies for several states of the heavy-hole and light-hole excitons are calculated. Dependencies of the exciton state energy, the binding energy, the radiative broadening, and the static dipole moment on the applied electric fields are determined. The threshold of exciton dissociation for the 100-nm QW is also determined. In addition, we found the electric-field-induced shift of the center of mass of the heavy-hole and light-hole exciton in the QWs. Finally, we have modeled reflection spectra of heterostructures with the GaAs/AlGaAs QWs in the electric field using the calculated energies and radiative broadenings of excitons.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Shared-memory system-on-chips (SM-SoC) are ubiquitously employed by a wide-range of mobile computing platforms, including edge/IoT devices, autonomous systems and smartphones. In SM-SoCs, system-wide shared physical memory enables a convenient and financially-feasible way to make data accessible by dozens of processing units (PUs), such as CPU cores and domain specific accelerators. In this study, we investigate vulnerabilities that stem from the shared use of physical memory in such systems. Due to the diverse computational characteristics of the PUs they embed, SM-SoCs often do not employ a shared last level cache (LLC). While the literature proposes covert channel attacks for shared memory systems, high-throughput communication is currently possible by either relying on an LLC or privileged/physical access to the shared memory subsystem.   In this study, we introduce a new memory-contention based covert communication attack, MC3, which specifically targets the shared system memory in mobile SoCs. Different from existing attacks, our approach achieves high throughput communication between applications running on CPU and GPU without the need for an LLC or elevated access to the system. We extensively explore the effectiveness of our methodology by demonstrating the trade-off between the channel transmission rate and the robustness of the communication. We demonstrate the utility of MC3 on NVIDIA Orin AGX, Orin NX, and Orin Nano up to a transmit rate of 6.4 kbps with less than 1% error rate.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text-to-image (T2I) generation using diffusion models has become a blockbuster service in today's AI cloud. A production T2I service typically involves a serving workflow where a base diffusion model is augmented with various "add-on" modules, notably ControlNet and LoRA, to enhance image generation control. Compared to serving the base model alone, these add-on modules introduce significant loading and computational overhead, resulting in increased latency. In this paper, we present SwiftDiffusion, a system that efficiently serves a T2I workflow through a holistic approach. SwiftDiffusion decouples ControNet from the base model and deploys it as a separate, independently scaled service on dedicated GPUs, enabling ControlNet caching, parallelization, and sharing. To mitigate the high loading overhead of LoRA serving, SwiftDiffusion employs a bounded asynchronous LoRA loading (BAL) technique, allowing LoRA loading to overlap with the initial base model execution by up to k steps without compromising image quality. Furthermore, SwiftDiffusion optimizes base model execution with a novel latent parallelism technique. Collectively, these designs enable SwiftDiffusion to outperform the state-of-the-art T2I serving systems, achieving up to 7.8x latency reduction and 1.6x throughput improvement in serving SDXL models on H800 GPUs, without sacrificing image quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The quadratic computational complexity of the attention mechanism in current Large Language Models (LLMs) renders inference with long contexts prohibitively expensive. To address this challenge, various approaches aim to retain critical portions of the context to optimally approximate Full Attention (FA) through Key-Value (KV) compression or Sparse Attention (SA), enabling the processing of virtually unlimited text lengths in a streaming manner. However, these methods struggle to achieve performance levels comparable to FA, particularly in retrieval tasks. In this paper, our analysis of attention head patterns reveals that LLMs' attention distributions show strong local correlations, naturally reflecting a chunking mechanism for input context. We propose Ltri-LLM framework, which divides KVs into spans, stores them in an offline index, and retrieves the relevant KVs into memory for various queries. Experimental results on popular long text benchmarks show that Ltri-LLM can achieve performance close to FA while maintaining efficient, streaming-based inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces a novel one-hop sub-query result cache for processing graph read transactions, gR-Txs, in a graph database system. The one-hop navigation is from a vertex using either its in-coming or out-going edges with selection predicates that filter edges and vertices. Its cache entry identifies a unique one-hop sub-query (key) and its result set consisting of immutable vertex ids (value). When processing a gR-Tx, the query processor identifies its sequence of individual one-hop sub-queries and looks up their results in the cache. A cache hit fetches less data from the storage manager and eliminates the requirement to process the one-hop sub-query. A cache miss populates the cache asynchronously and in a transactional manner, maintaining the separation of read and write paths of our transactional storage manager. A graph read and write transaction, gRW-Tx, identifies the impacted cache entries and either deletes or updates them. Our implementation of the cache is inside the graph query processing engine and transparent to a user application. We evaluate the cache using our eCommerce production workload and with rules that re-write graph queries to maximize the performance enhancements observed with the cache. Obtained results show the cache enhances 95th and 99th percentile of query response times by at least 2x and 1.63x, respectively. When combined with query re-writing, the enhancements are at least 2.33x and 4.48x, respectively. An interesting result is the significant performance enhancement observed by the indirect beneficiaries of the cache, gRW-Txs and gR-Txs that do not reference one-hop sub-queries. The cache frees system resources to expedite their processing significantly.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> KV cache pruning has emerged as a promising technique for reducing memory and computation costs in long-context auto-regressive generation. Existing methods for vision-language models (VLMs) typically rely on self-attention scores from large language models (LLMs) to identify and prune irrelevant tokens. However, these approaches overlook the inherent distributional discrepancies between modalities, often leading to inaccurate token importance estimation and the over-pruning of critical visual tokens. To address this, we propose decomposing attention scores into intra-modality attention (within the same modality) and inter-modality attention (across modalities), enabling more precise KV cache pruning by independently managing these distinct attention types. Additionally, we introduce an n-softmax function to counteract distribution shifts caused by pruning, preserving the original smoothness of attention scores and ensuring stable performance. Our final training-free method, \textbf{C}ross-\textbf{S}elf \textbf{P}runing (CSP), achieves competitive performance compared to models with full KV caches while significantly outperforming previous pruning methods. Extensive evaluations on MileBench, a benchmark encompassing 29 multimodal datasets, demonstrate CSP's effectiveness, achieving up to a 41\% performance improvement on challenging tasks like conversational embodied dialogue while reducing the KV cache budget by 13.6\%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce an efficient Two-Level Monte Carlo (subset of Multi-Level Monte Carlo, MLMC) estimator for real-time rendering of scenes with global illumination. Using MLMC we split the shading integral into two parts: the radiance cache integral and the residual error integral that compensates for the bias of the first one. For the first part, we developed the Neural Incident Radiance Cache (NIRC) leveraging the power of fully-fused tiny neural networks as a building block, which is trained on the fly. The cache is designed to provide a fast and reasonable approximation of the incident radiance: an evaluation takes 2-25x less compute time than a path tracing sample. This enables us to estimate the radiance cache integral with a high number of samples and by this achieve faster convergence. For the residual error integral, we compute the difference between the NIRC predictions and the unbiased path tracing simulation. Our method makes no assumptions about the geometry, materials, or lighting of a scene and has only few intuitive hyper-parameters. We provide a comprehensive comparative analysis in different experimental scenarios. Since the algorithm is trained in an on-line fashion, it demonstrates significant noise level reduction even for dynamic scenes and can easily be combined with other importance sampling schemes and noise reduction techniques.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite the remarkable performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, the substantial training and inference costs impede their advancement. The majority of computation stems from the overwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer decoder. In this paper, we propose to build efficient MLLMs by leveraging the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each transformer decoder layer selects essential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant ones. However, integrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the challenges of training and inference stability as well as limited training data, we adapt the MoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight normalization (TanhNorm) and symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we observe that vision tokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layer and thus design a progressive ratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the token retention ratio layer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This crucial design fully unleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the efficiency and performance of our models. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments with two baseline models across 14 benchmarks. Our model, p-MoD, matches or even surpasses the performance of the baseline models, with only 55.6% TFLOPs and 53.8% KV cache storage during inference, and 77.7% GPU hours during training.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LLM inference for popular enterprise use cases, such as summarization, RAG, and code-generation, typically observes orders of magnitude longer prompt lengths than generation lengths. This characteristic leads to high cost of prefill and increased response latency. In this paper, we present SwiftKV, a novel model transformation and distillation procedure specifically designed to reduce the time and cost of processing prompt tokens while preserving high quality of generated tokens. SwiftKV combines three key mechanisms: i) SingleInputKV, which prefills later layers' KV cache using a much earlier layer's output, allowing prompt tokens to skip much of the model computation, ii) AcrossKV, which merges the KV caches of neighboring layers to reduce the memory footprint and support larger batch size for higher throughput, and iii) a knowledge-preserving distillation procedure that can adapt existing LLMs for SwiftKV with minimal accuracy impact and low compute and data requirement. For Llama-3.1-8B and 70B, SwiftKV reduces the compute requirement of prefill by 50% and the memory requirement of the KV cache by 62.5% while incurring minimum quality degradation across a wide range of tasks. In the end-to-end inference serving using an optimized vLLM implementation, SwiftKV realizes up to 2x higher aggregate throughput and 60% lower time per output token. It can achieve a staggering 560 TFlops/GPU of normalized inference throughput, which translates to 16K tokens/s for Llama-3.1-70B in 16-bit precision on 4x H100 GPUs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The current large language models are mainly based on decode-only structure transformers, which have great in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. It is generally believed that the important foundation of its ICL capability is the induction heads mechanism, which requires at least two layers attention. In order to more efficiently implement the ability of the model's induction, we revisit the induction heads mechanism and proposed a KV shifting attention. We theoretically prove that the KV shifting attention reducing the model's requirements for the depth and width of the induction heads mechanism. Our experimental results demonstrate that KV shifting attention is beneficial to learning induction heads and language modeling, which lead to better performance or faster convergence from toy models to the pre-training models with more than 10 B parameters.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Training and serving long-context large language models (LLMs) incurs substantial overhead. To address this, two critical steps are often required: a pretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length extension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural modifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper argues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction architecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but also achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed LongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during length extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention patterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink (initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are well-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their GPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just theoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to have direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention layers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency and long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data is sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.   We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its effectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts, LongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%, compared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV cache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding speedup.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This technical report presents Yi-Lightning, our latest flagship large language model (LLM). It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall on Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in specialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts. Yi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, featuring advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with optimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses comprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for multi-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling. Furthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a four-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training, post-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing infrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment and inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further evaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates competitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable disparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic human preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of conventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent and powerful AI systems for practical applications. Yi-Lightning is now available through our developer platform at https://platform.lingyiwanwu.com.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Many real-world workloads present a challenging set of requirements: point operations requiring high throughput, working sets much larger than main memory, and natural skew in key access patterns for both reads and writes. We find that modern key-value designs are either optimized for memory-efficiency, sacrificing high-performance (LSM-tree designs), or achieve high-performance, saturating modern NVMe SSD bandwidth, at the cost of substantial memory resources or high disk wear (CPU-optimized designs). Unfortunately these designs are not able to handle meet the challenging demands of such larger-than-memory, skewed workloads.   To this end, we present F2, a new key-value store that bridges this gap by combining the strengths of both approaches. F2 adopts a tiered, record-oriented architecture inspired by LSM-trees to effectively separate hot from cold records, while incorporating concurrent latch-free mechanisms from CPU-optimized engines to maximize performance on modern NVMe SSDs. To realize this design, we tackle key challenges and introduce several innovations, including new latch-free algorithms for multi-threaded log compaction and user operations (e.g., RMWs), as well as new components: a two-level hash index to reduce indexing overhead for cold records and a read-cache for serving read-hot data.   Detailed experimental results show that F2 matches or outperforms existing solutions, achieving on average better throughput on memory-constrained environments compared to state-of-the-art systems like RocksDB (11.75x), SplinterDB (4.52x), KVell (10.56x), LeanStore (2.04x), and FASTER (2.38x). F2 also maintains its high performance across varying workload skewness levels and memory budgets, while achieving low disk write amplification.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Hybrid models that combine the language modeling capabilities of Attention layers with the efficiency of Recurrent layers (e.g., State Space Models) have gained traction in practically supporting long contexts in Large Language Model serving. Yet, the unique properties of these models complicate the usage of complementary efficiency optimizations such as prefix caching that skip redundant computations across requests. Most notably, their use of in-place state updates for recurrent layers precludes rolling back cache entries for partial sequence overlaps, and instead mandates only exact-match cache hits; the effect is a deluge of (large) cache entries per sequence, most of which yield minimal reuse opportunities. We present Marconi, the first system that supports efficient prefix caching with Hybrid LLMs. Key to Marconi are its novel admission and eviction policies that more judiciously assess potential cache entries based not only on recency, but also on (1) forecasts of their reuse likelihood across a taxonomy of different hit scenarios, and (2) the compute savings that hits deliver relative to memory footprints. Across diverse workloads and Hybrid models, Marconi achieves up to 34.4$\times$ higher token hit rates (71.1% or 617 ms lower TTFT) compared to state-of-the-art prefix caching systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) experiments provide detailed insights into material microstructures, enabling high-resolution imaging as well as crystallographic analysis through advanced techniques like Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD). However, the interaction of the high-energy electron beam with the material can lead to localized heating, which may significantly impact specimen integrity, especially in applications requiring prolonged beam exposure, for instance when mapping the crystal structure using EBSD. This study examines electron-beam-induced heating effects on a model metal sample (iron), directly measuring the locally deposited electron beam energy with a MEMS-based heating device and validating these measurements through simulations, including Monte Carlo and Finite Element methods. The analysis focuses on the effects of various experimental parameters such as acceleration voltage (from 5 to 30 kV), beam current (from 0.17 nA to 22 nA), dwell time (from 1$\mu$s to 1ms) and sample tilt (0{\deg} to 70{\deg}). The findings reveal that local sample temperatures can increase by up to 70 {\deg}C during EBSD experiments, primarily affected by the choice in beam current and acceleration voltage, with beam current having the most significant impact.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in a variety of applications, and the context length is rapidly increasing to handle tasks such as long-document QA and complex logical reasoning. However, long context poses significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory costs of key-value (KV) cache and increased latency due to extensive memory accesses. Recent works have proposed compressing KV cache to approximate computation, but these methods either evict tokens permanently, never recalling them for later inference, or recall previous tokens at the granularity of pages divided by textual positions. Both approaches degrade the model accuracy and output quality. To achieve efficient and accurate recallable KV cache compression, we introduce ClusterKV, which recalls tokens at the granularity of semantic clusters. We design and implement efficient algorithms and systems for clustering, selection, indexing and caching. Experiment results show that ClusterKV attains negligible accuracy loss across various tasks with 32k context lengths, using only a 1k to 2k KV cache budget, and achieves up to a 2$\times$ speedup in latency and a 2.5$\times$ improvement in decoding throughput. Compared to SoTA recallable KV compression methods, ClusterKV demonstrates higher model accuracy and output quality, while maintaining or exceeding inference efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance but incur high serving costs due to substantial memory demands, with the key-value (KV) cache being a primary bottleneck. Existing KV cache compression methods, including quantization and pruning, struggle with limitations such as uniform treatment of keys and values and static memory allocation across attention heads. To address these challenges, we introduce LeanKV, a unified KV cache compression framework that enhances LLM serving efficiency without compromising accuracy through three innovations: (1) Hetero-KV quantization, which stores keys at a higher precision than values to reflect their greater impact on attention computations; (2) per-head dynamic sparsity, which allocates memory based on token importance per head and per request; and (3) unified KV compression, integrating mixed-precision quantization and selective pruning to enable a smooth tradeoff between model accuracy and memory efficiency. To efficiently support these techniques, LeanKV introduces systems optimizations including unified paging and on-GPU parallel memory management. Implemented on vLLM, LeanKV compresses the KV cache by $3.0\times$ to $5.0\times$ without accuracy loss and up to $11.0\times$ with under 5% accuracy loss, enhancing throughput by $1.9\times$ to $2.5\times$, and up to $6.9\times$.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Nowadays, the Hierarchical Storage System (HSS) is considered as an ideal model to meet the cost-performance demand. The data migration between storing tiers of HSS is the way to achieve the cost-performance goal. The bandwidth control is to limit the maximum amount of data migration. Most of previous research about HSS focus on studying the data migration policy instead of bandwidth control. However, the recent research about cache and networking optimization suggest that the bandwidth control has significant impact on the system performance. Few previous work achieves a satisfactory bandwidth control in HSS since it is hard to control bandwidth for so many data migration tasks simultaneously. In this paper, we first give a stochastic programming model to formalize the bandwidth control problem in HSS. Then we propose a learning-aided bandwidth control policy for HSS, named \Pascal{}, which learns to control the bandwidth of different data migration task in an cooperative way. We implement \Pascal{} on a commercial HSS and compare it with three strong baselines over a group of workloads. Our evaluation on the physical system shows that \Pascal{} can effectively decrease 1.95X the tail latency and greatly improve throughput stability (2X $\downarrow$ throughput jitter), and meanwhile keep the throughput at a relatively high level.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, the advances in digitalisation have also adversely contributed to the significant rise in cybercrimes. Hence, building the threat intelligence to shield against rising cybercrimes has become a fundamental requisite. Internet Protocol (IP) addresses play a crucial role in the threat intelligence and prevention of cyber crimes. However, we have noticed the lack of one-stop, free, and open-source tools that can analyse IP addresses. Hence, this work introduces a comprehensive web tool for advanced IP address characterisation. Our tool offers a wide range of features, including geolocation, blocklist check, VPN detection, proxy detection, bot detection, Tor detection, port scan, and accurate domain statistics that include the details about the name servers and registrar information. In addition, our tool calculates a confidence score based on a weighted sum of publicly accessible online results from different reliable sources to give users a dependable measure of accuracy. Further, to improve performance, our tool also incorporates a local database for caching the results, to enable fast content retrieval with minimal external Web API calls. Our tool supports domain names and IPv4 addresses, making it a multi-functional and powerful IP analyser tool for threat intelligence. Our tool is available at www.ipanalyzer.in

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As users conveniently stream their favorite online videos, video request records are automatically stored by video content providers, which have a high chance of privacy leakage. Unfortunately, most existing privacy-enhancing approaches are not applicable for protecting user privacy in video requests, because they cannot be easily altered or distorted by users and must be visible for content providers to stream correct videos. To preserve request privacy in online video services, it is possible to request additional videos that are irrelevant to users' interests so that content providers cannot precisely infer users' interest information. However, a naive redundant requesting approach would significantly degrade the performance of edge caches and increase bandwidth overhead. In this paper, we are among the first to propose a Cache-Friendly Redundant Video Requesting (cRVR) algorithm for User Devices (UDs) and its corresponding caching algorithm for the Edge Cache (EC), which can effectively mitigate the problem of request privacy leakage with minimal impact on the EC's performance. To tackle the problem, we first develop a Stackelberg game to analyze the dedicated interaction between UDs and EC, and obtain their optimal strategies to maximize their respective utility. For UDs, the utility function is a combination of both video playback utility and privacy protection utility. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium of the Stackelberg game. Extensive experiments are conducted with real traces to demonstrate that cRVR can effectively protect video request privacy by reducing up to 59.03\% of privacy disclosure compared to baseline algorithms. Meanwhile, the caching performance of EC is only slightly affected.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Serverless Computing is a computing paradigm that provides efficient infrastructure management and elastic scalability. Serverless functions scale up or down based on demand, which means that functions are not directly addressable and rely on platform-managed invocation. Serverless stateless nature requires functions to leverage external services, such as object storage and KVS, to exchange data. Serverless actors have emerged as a solution to these issues. However, the state-of-the-art serverless lifecycle and event-trigger invocation force actors to leverage remote services to manage their state and exchange data, which impacts the performance and incurs additional costs and dependency on third-party services.   To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce a novel serverless lifecycle model that allows short-term stateful actors, enabling actors to maintain their state between executions. Additionally, we propose a novel serverless Invocation Model that enables serverless actors to influence the processing of future messages. We present GoldFish, a lightweight WebAssembly short-term stateful serverless actor platform that provides a novel serverless actor lifecycle and invocation model. GoldFish leverages WebAssembly to provide the actors with lightweight sandbox isolation, making them suitable for the Edge-Cloud Continuum, where computational resources are limited. Experimental results show that GoldFish optimizes the data exchange latency by up to 92% and increases the throughput by up to 10x compared to OpenFaaS and Spin.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in vision understanding, reasoning, and interaction. However, the inference computation and memory increase progressively with the generation of output tokens during decoding, directly affecting the efficacy of MLLMs. Existing methods attempt to reduce the vision context redundancy to achieve efficient MLLMs. Unfortunately, the efficiency benefits of the vision context reduction in the prefill stage gradually diminish during the decoding stage. To address this problem, we proposed a dynamic vision-language context sparsification framework Dynamic-LLaVA, which dynamically reduces the redundancy of vision context in the prefill stage and decreases the memory and computation overhead of the generated language context during decoding. Dynamic-LLaVA designs a tailored sparsification inference scheme for different inference modes, i.e., prefill, decoding with and without KV cache, to achieve efficient inference of MLLMs. In practice, Dynamic-LLaVA can reduce computation consumption by $\sim$75\% in the prefill stage. Meanwhile, throughout the entire generation process of MLLMs, Dynamic-LLaVA reduces the $\sim$50\% computation consumption under decoding without KV cache, while saving $\sim$50\% GPU memory overhead when decoding with KV cache, due to the vision-language context sparsification. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that Dynamic-LLaVA achieves efficient inference for MLLMs with negligible understanding and generation ability degradation or even performance gains compared to the full-context inference baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformers can capture long-range dependencies using self-attention, allowing tokens to attend to all others directly. However, stacking multiple attention layers leads to attention concentration. One natural way to address this issue is to use cross-layer attention, allowing information from earlier layers to be directly accessible to later layers. However, this approach is computationally expensive. To address this problem, we propose Transformer with residual value (ResFormer) which approximates cross-layer attention through adding a residual connection from the values of the the first layer to all subsequent layers. Based on this method, one variant is the Transformer with single layer value (SVFormer), where all layers share the same value embedding from first layer. Comprehensive empirical evidence demonstrates ResFormer achieves equivalent validation loss with 10.4% fewer model parameters and 13.6% less training data compared to Transformer, while maintaining similar memory usage and computational cost. Besides, SVFormer reduces KV cache size by nearly half with only a small performance penalty and can be integrated with other KV-efficient methods, yielding further reductions in KV cache, with performance influenced by sequence length and cumulative learning rate. Further visualization results suggest that Resformer and SVFormer alleviate attention concentration in deeper layers through avoiding value-state drains and enhance representation across most layers.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing context window size in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the GPT and LLaMA series, has improved their ability to tackle complex, long-text tasks, but at the cost of inference efficiency, particularly regarding memory and computational complexity. Existing methods, including selective token retention and window-based attention, improve efficiency but risk discarding important tokens needed for future text generation. In this paper, we propose an approach that enhances LLM efficiency without token loss by reducing the memory and computational load of less important tokens, rather than discarding them.We address two challenges: 1) investigating the distribution of important tokens in the context, discovering recent tokens are more important than distant tokens in context, and 2) optimizing resources for distant tokens by sharing attention scores across layers. The experiments show that our method saves $35\%$ KV cache without compromising the performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Online e-commerce platforms have been extending in-store shopping, which allows users to keep the canonical online browsing and checkout experience while exploring in-store shopping. However, the growing transition between online and in-store becomes a challenge to sequential recommender systems for future online interaction prediction due to the lack of holistic modeling of hybrid user behaviors (online and in-store). The challenges are twofold. First, combining online and in-store user behavior data into a single data schema and supporting multiple stages in the model life cycle (pre-training, training, inference, etc.) organically needs a new data pipeline design. Second, online recommender systems, which solely rely on online user behavior sequences, must be redesigned to support online and in-store user data as input under the sequential modeling setting. To overcome the first challenge, we propose a hybrid, omnichannel data pipeline to compile online and in-store user behavior data by caching information from diverse data sources. Later, we introduce a model-agnostic encoder module to the sequential recommender system to interpret the user in-store transaction and augment the modeling capacity for better online interaction prediction given the hybrid user behavior.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The current Domain Name System (DNS), as a core infrastructure of the internet, exhibits several shortcomings: its centralized architecture leads to censorship risks and single points of failure, making domain name resolution vulnerable to attacks. The lack of encryption in the resolution process exposes it to DNS hijacking and cache poisoning attacks. Additionally, the high operational costs limit participation and innovation among small to medium-sized users. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Decentralized Domain Name Service (DDNS) based on blockchain (Phicoin) and distributed storage (IPFS). By leveraging the immutability of blockchain and the content verification of IPFS, the system achieves decentralized storage and distribution of domain name records, eliminating the centralized dependencies of traditional DNS. With a block time of 15 seconds, the system supports rapid broadcasting of domain name updates, significantly improving resolution efficiency. The DDNS aims to serve as a complement or backup to the existing DNS system, providing a pollution-resistant, censorship-resistant, high-performance, and low-cost domain name resolution solution, offering a new technical path for the security and stability of the internet.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce RandAR, a decoder-only visual autoregressive (AR) model capable of generating images in arbitrary token orders. Unlike previous decoder-only AR models that rely on a predefined generation order, RandAR removes this inductive bias, unlocking new capabilities in decoder-only generation. Our essential design enables random order by inserting a "position instruction token" before each image token to be predicted, representing the spatial location of the next image token. Trained on randomly permuted token sequences -- a more challenging task than fixed-order generation, RandAR achieves comparable performance to its conventional raster-order counterpart. More importantly, decoder-only transformers trained from random orders acquire new capabilities. For the efficiency bottleneck of AR models, RandAR adopts parallel decoding with KV-Cache at inference time, enjoying 2.5x acceleration without sacrificing generation quality. Additionally, RandAR supports inpainting, outpainting and resolution extrapolation in a zero-shot manner. We hope RandAR inspires new directions for decoder-only visual generation models and broadens their applications across diverse scenarios. Our project page is at https://rand-ar.github.io/.

Nitrogen oxides ($\mathrm{NO_x = NO_2 + NO}$) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in the presence of sunlight, lead to ozone formation in the troposphere. When the rate of oxidant production, defined as the sum of $\mathrm{O_3}$ and $\mathrm{NO_2}$, is faster than the rate of $\mathrm{NO_x}$ production, a region is said to be $\mathrm{NO_x}$limited, and ozone formation will be limited by the concentration of $\mathrm{NO_x}$ species in the region. The inverse of this situation makes the region VOC-limited. Knowing whether a region is $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited or VOC-limited can aid in generating effective mitigation strategies. Understanding the background or regional contributions to ozone in a region, whether from the transport of precursors or of ozone, provides information about the lower limit for ozone concentrations that a region can achieve through regulation of local precursors. In this paper, measured oxidant and $\mathrm{NO_x}$ concentrations are analyzed from 14 counties in the state of Utah to calculate the regional and local contributions to ozone for each region. This analysis is used to determine the nature of the atmosphere in each county by identifying whether the region is VOC or $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited. Furthermore, this analysis is performed for each county for the years 2012 and 2022 to assess changes in the oxidative nature and quantify regional and local contributions to ozone over a 10-year period. All studied counties--except for Washington County--in Utah were found to be VOC-limited in 2012. This shifted in 2022, with most counties being either in a transitional state or $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited. Local contributions to ozone increased in two major counties, Cache and Salt Lake Counties, but decreased in Carbon, Davis, Duchesne, Uinta, Utah, Washington, and Weber Counties. Generally, the regional contributions to oxidant concentrations decreased across the state. A summertime spike in both regional and local contributions to oxidants was observed. Smoke from wildfires was found to increase regional contributions to oxidants and shift the local regime to be more $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> End-to-end transformer-based detectors (DETRs) have shown exceptional performance in both closed-set and open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) tasks through the integration of language modalities. However, their demanding computational requirements have hindered their practical application in real-time object detection (OD) scenarios. In this paper, we scrutinize the limitations of two leading models in the OVDEval benchmark, OmDet and Grounding-DINO, and introduce OmDet-Turbo. This novel transformer-based real-time OVD model features an innovative Efficient Fusion Head (EFH) module designed to alleviate the bottlenecks observed in OmDet and Grounding-DINO. Notably, OmDet-Turbo-Base achieves a 100.2 frames per second (FPS) with TensorRT and language cache techniques applied. Notably, in zero-shot scenarios on COCO and LVIS datasets, OmDet-Turbo achieves performance levels nearly on par with current state-of-the-art supervised models. Furthermore, it establishes new state-of-the-art benchmarks on ODinW and OVDEval, boasting an AP of 30.1 and an NMS-AP of 26.86, respectively. The practicality of OmDet-Turbo in industrial applications is underscored by its exceptional performance on benchmark datasets and superior inference speed, positioning it as a compelling choice for real-time object detection tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While mobile devices provide ever more compute power, improvements in DRAM bandwidth are much slower. This is unfortunate for large language model (LLM) token generation, which is heavily memory-bound. Previous work has proposed to leverage natural dynamic activation sparsity in ReLU-activated LLMs to reduce effective DRAM bandwidth per token. However, more recent LLMs use SwiGLU instead of ReLU, which result in little inherent sparsity. While SwiGLU activations can be pruned based on magnitude, the resulting sparsity patterns are difficult to predict, rendering previous approaches ineffective. To circumvent this issue, our work introduces Dynamic Input Pruning (DIP): a predictor-free dynamic sparsification approach, which preserves accuracy with minimal fine-tuning. DIP can further use lightweight LoRA adapters to regain some performance lost during sparsification. Lastly, we describe a novel cache-aware masking strategy, which considers the cache state and activation magnitude to further increase cache hit rate, improving LLM token rate on mobile devices. DIP outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy, memory and throughput trade-offs across simulated hardware settings. On Phi-3-Medium, DIP achieves a 46% reduction in memory and 40% increase in throughput with $<$ 0.1 loss in perplexity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent speaker verification (SV) systems have shown a trend toward adopting deeper speaker embedding extractors. Although deeper and larger neural networks can significantly improve performance, their substantial memory requirements hinder training on consumer GPUs. In this paper, we explore a memory-efficient training strategy for deep speaker embedding learning in resource-constrained scenarios. Firstly, we conduct a systematic analysis of GPU memory allocation during SV system training. Empirical observations show that activations and optimizer states are the main sources of memory consumption. For activations, we design two types of reversible neural networks which eliminate the need to store intermediate activations during back-propagation, thereby significantly reducing memory usage without performance loss. For optimizer states, we introduce a dynamic quantization approach that replaces the original 32-bit floating-point values with a dynamic tree-based 8-bit data type. Experimental results on VoxCeleb demonstrate that the reversible variants of ResNets and DF-ResNets can perform training without the need to cache activations in GPU memory. In addition, the 8-bit versions of SGD and Adam save 75% of memory costs while maintaining performance compared to their 32-bit counterparts. Finally, a detailed comparison of memory usage and performance indicates that our proposed models achieve up to 16.2x memory savings, with nearly identical parameters and performance compared to the vanilla systems. In contrast to the previous need for multiple high-end GPUs such as the A100, we can effectively train deep speaker embedding extractors with just one or two consumer-level 2080Ti GPUs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the era of the sixth generation (6G) and industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), an industrial cyber-physical system (ICPS) drives the proliferation of sensor devices and computing-intensive tasks. To address the limited resources of IIoT sensor devices, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising solution, providing flexible and cost-effective services in close proximity of IIoT sensor devices (ISDs). However, leveraging aerial MEC to meet the delay-sensitive and computation-intensive requirements of the ISDs could face several challenges, including the limited communication, computation and caching (3C) resources, stringent offloading requirements for 3C services, and constrained on-board energy of UAVs. To address these issues, we first present a collaborative aerial MEC-assisted ICPS architecture by incorporating the computing capabilities of the macro base station (MBS) and UAVs. We then formulate a service delay minimization optimization problem (SDMOP). Since the SDMOP is proved to be an NP-hard problem, we propose a joint computation offloading, caching, communication resource allocation, computation resource allocation, and UAV trajectory control approach (JC5A). Specifically, JC5A consists of a block successive upper bound minimization method of multipliers (BSUMM) for computation offloading and service caching, a convex optimization-based method for communication and computation resource allocation, and a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based method for UAV trajectory control. Moreover, we theoretically prove the convergence and polynomial complexity of JC5A. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve superior system performance compared to the benchmark approaches and algorithms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is widely viewed as a potential candidate for providing enhanced multiple access in future mobile networks by eliminating the orthogonal distribution of radio resources amongst the users. Nevertheless, the performance of NOMA can be significantly improved by combining it with other sophisticated technologies such as wireless data caching and device-to-device (D2D) communications. In this letter, we propose a novel cellular system model which integrates uplink NOMA with cache based device-to-device (D2D) communications. The proposed system would enable a cellular user to upload data file to base station while simultaneously exchanging useful cache content with another nearby user. We maximize the system sum rate by deriving closed form solutions for optimal power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model over other potential combinations of uplink NOMA and D2D communications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, diffusion-based methods have achieved great improvements in the video inpainting task. However, these methods still face many challenges, such as maintaining temporal consistency and the time-consuming issue. This paper proposes an advanced video inpainting framework using optical Flow-guided Efficient Diffusion, called FloED. Specifically, FloED employs a dual-branch architecture, where a flow branch first restores corrupted flow and a multi-scale flow adapter provides motion guidance to the main inpainting branch. Additionally, a training-free latent interpolation method is proposed to accelerate the multi-step denoising process using flow warping. Further introducing a flow attention cache mechanism, FLoED efficiently reduces the computational cost brought by incorporating optical flow. Comprehensive experiments in both background restoration and object removal tasks demonstrate that FloED outperforms state-of-the-art methods from the perspective of both performance and efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models gain widespread adoption, running them efficiently becomes crucial. Recent works on LLM inference use speculative decoding to achieve extreme speedups. However, most of these works implicitly design their algorithms for high-end datacenter hardware. In this work, we ask the opposite question: how fast can we run LLMs on consumer machines? Consumer GPUs can no longer fit the largest available models (50B+ parameters) and must offload them to RAM or SSD. When running with offloaded parameters, the inference engine can process batches of hundreds or thousands of tokens at the same time as just one token, making it a natural fit for speculative decoding. We propose SpecExec (Speculative Execution), a simple parallel decoding method that can generate up to 20 tokens per target model iteration for popular LLM families. It utilizes the high spikiness of the token probabilities distribution in modern LLMs and a high degree of alignment between model output probabilities. SpecExec takes the most probable tokens continuation from the draft model to build a "cache" tree for the target model, which then gets validated in a single pass. Using SpecExec, we demonstrate inference of 50B+ parameter LLMs on consumer GPUs with RAM offloading at 4-6 tokens per second with 4-bit quantization or 2-3 tokens per second with 16-bit weights.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present an efficient algorithm for the application of sequences of planar rotations to a matrix. Applying such sequences efficiently is important in many numerical linear algebra algorithms for eigenvalues. Our algorithm is novel in three main ways. First, we introduce a new kernel that is optimized for register reuse in a novel way. Second, we introduce a blocking and packing scheme that improves the cache efficiency of the algorithm. Finally, we thoroughly analyze the memory operations of the algorithm which leads to important theoretical insights and makes it easier to select good parameters. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art and achieves a flop rate close to the theoretical peak on modern hardware.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Authentication in TLS is predominately carried out with X.509 digital certificates issued by certificate authorities (CA). The centralized nature of current public key infrastructures, however, comes along with severe risks, such as single points of failure and susceptibility to cyber-attacks, potentially undermining the security and trustworthiness of the entire system. With Decentralized Identifiers (DID) alongside distributed ledger technology, it becomes technically feasible to prove ownership of a unique identifier without requiring an attestation of the proof's public key by a centralized and therefore vulnerable CA. This article presents DID Link, a novel authentication scheme for TLS 1.3 that empowers entities to authenticate in a TLS-compliant way with self-issued X.509 certificates that are equipped with ledger-anchored DIDs instead of CA-issued identifiers. It facilitates the exchange of tamper-proof and 3rd-party attested claims in the form of DID-bound Verifiable Credentials after the TLS handshake to complete the authentication with a full identification of the communication partner. A prototypical implementation shows comparable TLS handshake durations of DID Link if verification material is cached and reasonable prolongations if it is obtained from a ledger. The significant speed improvement of the resulting TLS channel over a widely used, DID-based alternative transport protocol on the application layer demonstrates the potential of DID Link to become a viable solution for the establishment of secure and trustful end-to-end communication links with decentrally managed digital identities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge and question-answering capabilities, having been widely deployed in privacy-sensitive domains like finance and medical consultation. During LLM inferences, cache-sharing methods are commonly employed to enhance efficiency by reusing cached states or responses for the same or similar inference requests. However, we identify that these cache mechanisms pose a risk of private input leakage, as the caching can result in observable variations in response times, making them a strong candidate for a timing-based attack hint.   In this study, we propose a novel timing-based side-channel attack to execute input theft in LLMs inference. The cache-based attack faces the challenge of constructing candidate inputs in a large search space to hit and steal cached user queries. To address these challenges, we propose two primary components. The input constructor employs machine learning techniques and LLM-based approaches for vocabulary correlation learning while implementing optimized search mechanisms for generalized input construction. The time analyzer implements statistical time fitting with outlier elimination to identify cache hit patterns, continuously providing feedback to refine the constructor's search strategy. We conduct experiments across two cache mechanisms and the results demonstrate that our approach consistently attains high attack success rates in various applications. Our work highlights the security vulnerabilities associated with performance optimizations, underscoring the necessity of prioritizing privacy and security alongside enhancements in LLM inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Many LLM tasks are performed in large batches or even offline, and the performance indictor for which is throughput. These tasks usually show the characteristic of prefix sharing, where different prompt input can partially show the common prefix. However, the existing LLM inference engines tend to optimize the streaming requests and show limitations of supporting the large batched tasks with the prefix sharing characteristic. The existing solutions use the LRU-based cache to reuse the KV context of common prefix. The KV context that is about to be reused may prematurely be evicted with the implicit cache management. Even if not evicted, the lifetime of the shared KV context is extended since requests sharing the same context are not scheduled together, resulting in larger memory usage. These streaming oriented systems schedule the requests in the first-come-first-serve or similar order. As a result, the requests with larger ratio of decoding steps may be scheduled too late to be able to mix with the prefill chunks to increase the hardware utilization. Besides, the token and request number based batching can limit the size of token-batch, which keeps the GPU from saturating for the iterations dominated by decoding tokens. We propose BatchLLM to address the above problems. BatchLLM explicitly identifies the common prefixes globally. The requests sharing the same prefix will be scheduled together to reuse the KV context the best, which also shrinks the lifetime of common KV memory. BatchLLM reorders the requests and schedules the requests with larger ratio of decoding first to better mix the decoding tokens with the latter prefill chunks and applies memory-centric token batching to enlarge the token-batch sizes, which helps to increase the GPU utilization. Extensive evaluation shows that BatchLLM outperforms vLLM by 1.1x to 2x on a set of microbenchmarks and two typical industry workloads.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been treated as a core technique in improving wireless propagation environments for the next generation wireless communication systems. This paper proposes a new coded caching problem, referred to as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-antenna coded caching, which is composed of a server with multiple antennas and some single-antenna cache-aided users. Different from the existing multi-antenna coded caching problems, we introduce a passive RIS (with limited number of units) into the systems to further increase the multicast gain (i.e., degrees of freedom (DoF)) in the transmission, which is done by using RIS-assisted interference nulling. That is, by using RIS, we can `erase' any path between one transmission antenna and one receive antenna. We first propose a new RIS-assisted interference nulling approach to search for the phase-shift coefficients of RIS for the sake of interference nulling, which converges faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm. After erasing some paths in each time slot, the delivery can be divided into several non-overlapping groups including transmission antennas and users, where in each group the transmission antennas serve the contained users without suffering interference from the transmissions by other groups. The division of groups for the sake of maximizing the DoF could be formulated into a combinatorial optimization problem. We propose a grouping algorithm which can find the optimal solution with low complexity, and the corresponding coded caching scheme achieving this DoF.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We consider a dynamic content caching problem wherein the contents get updated at a central server, and local copies of a subset of contents are cached at a local cache associated with a Base station (BS). When a content request arrives, based on whether the content is in the local cache, the BS can decide whether to fetch the content from the central server or serve the cached version from the local cache. Fetching a content incurs a fixed fetching cost, and serving the cached version incurs an ageing cost proportional to the age-of-version (AoV) of the content. The BS has only partial information regarding AoVs of the contents. We formulate an optimal content fetching and caching problem to minimize the average cost subject to cache capacity constraints. The problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality and is provably hard to solve. We formulate this problem as a continuous time restless multi-armed bandit process (RMAB), where a single content problem of the corresponding RMAB is a partially observable Markov decision process. We reformulate the single content problem as a semi-Markov decision process, prove indexability, and provide a Whittle index based solution to this problem. Finally, we compare the performance with recent work and show that our proposed policy is optimal via simulations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As a fundamental backbone for video generation, diffusion models are challenged by low inference speed due to the sequential nature of denoising. Previous methods speed up the models by caching and reusing model outputs at uniformly selected timesteps. However, such a strategy neglects the fact that differences among model outputs are not uniform across timesteps, which hinders selecting the appropriate model outputs to cache, leading to a poor balance between inference efficiency and visual quality. In this study, we introduce Timestep Embedding Aware Cache (TeaCache), a training-free caching approach that estimates and leverages the fluctuating differences among model outputs across timesteps. Rather than directly using the time-consuming model outputs, TeaCache focuses on model inputs, which have a strong correlation with the modeloutputs while incurring negligible computational cost. TeaCache first modulates the noisy inputs using the timestep embeddings to ensure their differences better approximating those of model outputs. TeaCache then introduces a rescaling strategy to refine the estimated differences and utilizes them to indicate output caching. Experiments show that TeaCache achieves up to 4.41x acceleration over Open-Sora-Plan with negligible (-0.07% Vbench score) degradation of visual quality.

In this study, we investigate optimizing the KV cache, whose memory footprint poses a critical bottleneck in LLM inference, especially when dealing with long context tasks. To tackle the challenge, we introduce MiniKV, a KV cache optimization method that simultaneously preserves long context task accuracy while significantly reducing KV cache size via a novel 2-bit layer-discriminative KV cache. More importantly, we develop specialized CUDA kernels to make MiniKV compatible with FlashAttention. Experiments on a wide range of long context tasks show that MiniKV effectively achieves 86% KV cache compression ratio while recovering over 98.5% of accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while achieving excellent measured system performance improvements.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mixture of Experts (MoE) LLMs have recently gained attention for their ability to enhance performance by selectively engaging specialized subnetworks or "experts" for each input. However, deploying MoEs on memory-constrained devices remains challenging, particularly when generating tokens sequentially with a batch size of one, as opposed to typical high-throughput settings involving long sequences or large batches. In this work, we optimize MoE on memory-constrained devices where only a subset of expert weights fit in DRAM. We introduce a novel cache-aware routing strategy that leverages expert reuse during token generation to improve cache locality. We evaluate our approach on language modeling, MMLU, and GSM8K benchmarks and present on-device results demonstrating 2$\times$ speedups on mobile devices, offering a flexible, training-free solution to extend MoE's applicability across real-world applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> OASIS-UROS continues the previously published Open Acquisition System for IEPE Sensors (OASIS). While still building on the ESP32 microcontroller, this version improves the overall performance by switching to an SD card caching system and upgrading the analog-digital converter to an AD7606C-18, which has a higher resolution, provides eight channels, oversampling, and software-adjustable voltage ranges. Also improved is the IEPE front-end and power supply, as well as the firmware of the acquisition system, which can now achieve a sample rate of up to 36 kHz while sampling all eight channels. This paper documents the hardware and software of OASIS-UROS and provides all materials required to reproduce the open acquisition system. Lastly, the system was validated against commercial hardware and software in an experimental modal analysis context. This showed that the system performs close to the commercial one in some aspects with respect to the utilized test case. While OASIS-UROS cannot match the full performance of the commercial system, the developed system can be a viable alternative for students, people in academia, or smaller companies that have a constrained budget or require complete insight as well as adaptability of the hardware and software.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The input data pipeline is an essential component of each machine learning (ML) training job. It is responsible for reading massive amounts of training data, processing batches of samples using complex transformations, and loading them onto training nodes at low latency and high throughput. Performant input data systems are becoming increasingly critical, driven by skyrocketing data volumes and training throughput demands. Unfortunately, current input data systems cannot fully leverage key performance optimizations, resulting in hugely inefficient infrastructures that require significant resources - or worse - underutilize expensive accelerators.   To address these demands, we present cedar, an optimized and unified programming framework for ML input data pipelines. cedar allows users to define input data pipelines using composable operators that support arbitrary ML frameworks and libraries. cedar introduces an extensible optimizer that systematically applies a complex combination of optimizations (e.g., offloading, caching, prefetching, fusion, and reordering). It orchestrates processing across a customizable set of local and distributed compute resources in order to improve processing performance and efficiency, all without user input. Across eight pipelines, cedar improves performance by up to 1.87x to 10.65x compared to state-of-the-art input data systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Serving numerous users and requests concurrently requires good fairness in Large Language Models (LLMs) serving system. This ensures that, at the same cost, the system can meet the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) of more users , such as time to first token (TTFT) and time between tokens (TBT), rather than allowing a few users to experience performance far exceeding the SLOs. To achieve better fairness, the preemption-based scheduling policy dynamically adjusts the priority of each request to maintain balance during runtime. However, existing systems tend to overly prioritize throughput, overlooking the overhead caused by preemption-induced context switching, which is crucial for maintaining fairness through priority adjustments. In this work, we identify three main challenges that result in this overhead. 1) Inadequate I/O utilization. 2) GPU idleness. 3) Unnecessary I/O transmission during multi-turn conversations. Our key insight is that the block-based KV cache memory policy in existing systems, while achieving near-zero memory waste, leads to discontinuity and insufficient granularity in the KV cache memory. To respond, we introduce FastSwitch, a fairness-aware serving system that not only aligns with existing KV cache memory allocation policy but also mitigates context switching overhead. Our evaluation shows that FastSwitch outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM serving system vLLM with speedups of 1.4-11.2x across different tail TTFT and TBT.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Transformers (DiT), an emerging image and video generation model architecture, has demonstrated great potential because of its high generation quality and scalability properties. Despite the impressive performance, its practical deployment is constrained by computational complexity and redundancy in the sequential denoising process. While feature caching across timesteps has proven effective in accelerating diffusion models, its application to DiT is limited by fundamental architectural differences from U-Net-based approaches. Through empirical analysis of DiT feature dynamics, we identify that significant feature variation between DiT blocks presents a key challenge for feature reusability. To address this, we convert standard DiT into Skip-DiT with skip branches to enhance feature smoothness. Further, we introduce Skip-Cache which utilizes the skip branches to cache DiT features across timesteps at the inference time. We validated effectiveness of our proposal on different DiT backbones for video and image generation, showcasing skip branches to help preserve generation quality and achieve higher speedup. Experimental results indicate that Skip-DiT achieves a 1.5x speedup almost for free and a 2.2x speedup with only a minor reduction in quantitative metrics.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video Variational Autoencoder (VAE) encodes videos into a low-dimensional latent space, becoming a key component of most Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) to reduce model training costs. However, as the resolution and duration of generated videos increase, the encoding cost of Video VAEs becomes a limiting bottleneck in training LVDMs. Moreover, the block-wise inference method adopted by most LVDMs can lead to discontinuities of latent space when processing long-duration videos. The key to addressing the computational bottleneck lies in decomposing videos into distinct components and efficiently encoding the critical information. Wavelet transform can decompose videos into multiple frequency-domain components and improve the efficiency significantly, we thus propose Wavelet Flow VAE (WF-VAE), an autoencoder that leverages multi-level wavelet transform to facilitate low-frequency energy flow into latent representation. Furthermore, we introduce a method called Causal Cache, which maintains the integrity of latent space during block-wise inference. Compared to state-of-the-art video VAEs, WF-VAE demonstrates superior performance in both PSNR and LPIPS metrics, achieving 2x higher throughput and 4x lower memory consumption while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces a novel approach, the Bounded-Cache Transformer (BCT), for building large language models with a predefined Key-Value (KV) cache capacity. The BCT addresses the excessive memory consumption issue in traditional KV caches by implementing a bounded-length KV cache, which is particularly suitable for the attention layers in Transformer decode-only architectures. By dynamically updating the key-value vector sequences, the BCT achieves efficient inference within limited cache capacity, significantly reducing memory usage while maintaining model performance and system throughput. Experimental results demonstrate that the BCT significantly reduces memory usage while maintaining the model's inference quality, offering a new solution for efficient inference in large language models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> When predicting the next token in a sequence, vanilla transformers compute attention over all previous tokens, resulting in quadratic scaling of compute with sequence length. State-space models compress the entire sequence of tokens into a fixed-dimensional representation to improve efficiency, while other architectures achieve sub-quadratic complexity via low-rank projections or sparse attention patterns over the sequence. In this paper, we introduce Attamba, a novel architecture that uses state-space models to compress chunks of tokens and applies attention on these compressed key-value representations. We find that replacing key and value projections in a transformer with SSMs can improve model quality and enable flexible token chunking, resulting in 24% improved perplexity with transformer of similar KV-Cache and attention footprint, and ~4 times smaller KV-Cache and Attention FLOPs for 5% perplexity trade-off. Attamba can perform attention on chunked-sequences of variable length, enabling a smooth transition between quadratic and linear scaling, offering adaptable efficiency gains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Iterative improvement of model architectures is fundamental to deep learning: Transformers first enabled scaling, and recent advances in model hybridization have pushed the quality-efficiency frontier. However, optimizing architectures remains challenging and expensive. Current automated or manual approaches fall short, largely due to limited progress in the design of search spaces and due to the simplicity of resulting patterns and heuristics. In this work, we propose a new approach for the synthesis of tailored architectures (STAR). Our approach combines a novel search space based on the theory of linear input-varying systems, supporting a hierarchical numerical encoding into architecture genomes. STAR genomes are automatically refined and recombined with gradient-free, evolutionary algorithms to optimize for multiple model quality and efficiency metrics. Using STAR, we optimize large populations of new architectures, leveraging diverse computational units and interconnection patterns, improving over highly-optimized Transformers and striped hybrid models on the frontier of quality, parameter size, and inference cache for autoregressive language modeling.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Air quality is a prevalent concern due to its imposing health risks. The state of Utah, USA, has, at times over the last 20 years, experienced some of the worst air quality in the nation. The propensity for Utah to experience elevated concentrations of particulate matter ($\mathrm{PM_{2.5}}$) and ozone ($\mathrm{O_3}$) can, in part, be attributed to its unique geography, which features dry, mountainous terrain. Valleys in Utah create ideal environments for extended cold-pool events. In this review, we summarize air quality research conducted in Utah over the past 20 years (2002-2022) by dividing the state into six regions: Utah Valley, Summit County, Southern Utah (regions south of Utah Valley), Cache Valley, Uinta Basin, and Salt Lake Valley. We review the published literature chronologically and provide a summary for each region, identifying areas where additional research is warranted. We found that research efforts are heavily weighted toward the Uinta Basin and Salt Lake Valley, with the remaining regions collectively accounting for only 20% of studies. We identified the need for more source apportionment studies, speciated volatile organic compound (VOC) analyses, and ozone isopleths. Where ozone isopleths cannot be created, measurements of glyoxal ($\mathrm{CHOCHO}$) and formaldehyde ($\mathrm{HCHO}$) concentrations could serve as cost-effective surrogates to inform ozone mitigation policies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we present GaNI, a Global and Near-field Illumination-aware neural inverse rendering technique that can reconstruct geometry, albedo, and roughness parameters from images of a scene captured with co-located light and camera. Existing inverse rendering techniques with co-located light-camera focus on single objects only, without modeling global illumination and near-field lighting more prominent in scenes with multiple objects. We introduce a system that solves this problem in two stages; we first reconstruct the geometry powered by neural volumetric rendering NeuS, followed by inverse neural radiosity that uses the previously predicted geometry to estimate albedo and roughness. However, such a naive combination fails and we propose multiple technical contributions that enable this two-stage approach. We observe that NeuS fails to handle near-field illumination and strong specular reflections from the flashlight in a scene. We propose to implicitly model the effects of near-field illumination and introduce a surface angle loss function to handle specular reflections. Similarly, we observe that invNeRad assumes constant illumination throughout the capture and cannot handle moving flashlights during capture. We propose a light position-aware radiance cache network and additional smoothness priors on roughness to reconstruct reflectance. Experimental evaluation on synthetic and real data shows that our method outperforms the existing co-located light-camera-based inverse rendering techniques. Our approach produces significantly better reflectance and slightly better geometry than capture strategies that do not require a dark room.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper studies cache-aided wireless networks in the presence of active intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) from an information-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we explore interference management in a cache-aided wireless network assisted by an active IRS, to enhance the achievable degrees of freedom (DoF). To this end, we jointly design the content placement, delivery phase, and phase shifts of the IRS and propose a one-shot achievable scheme. Our scheme exploits transmitters' cooperation, cache contents (as side information), interference alignment, and IRS capabilities, adapting to the network's parameters. We derive the achievable one-shot sum-DoF for different sizes of cache memories, network configurations, and numbers of IRS elements. Our results highlight the potential of deploying an IRS in cache-aided wireless communication systems, underscoring the enhancement of achievable DoF for various parameter regimes, particularly when the sizes of the caches (especially at the transmitters) are inadequate. Notably, we show that access to an IRS with a sufficient number of elements enables the achievement of the maximum possible DoF for various parameter regimes of interest.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Personalized image generation requires text-to-image generative models that capture the core features of a reference subject to allow for controlled generation across different contexts. Existing methods face challenges due to complex training requirements, high inference costs, limited flexibility, or a combination of these issues. In this paper, we introduce DreamCache, a scalable approach for efficient and high-quality personalized image generation. By caching a small number of reference image features from a subset of layers and a single timestep of the pretrained diffusion denoiser, DreamCache enables dynamic modulation of the generated image features through lightweight, trained conditioning adapters. DreamCache achieves state-of-the-art image and text alignment, utilizing an order of magnitude fewer extra parameters, and is both more computationally effective and versatile than existing models.

We introduce Star Attention, a two-phase block-sparse approximation that improves computational efficiency by sharding attention across multiple hosts while minimizing communication overhead. In the first phase, the context is processed using blockwise-local attention across hosts, in parallel. In the second phase, query and response tokens attend to all prior cached tokens through sequence-global attention. Star Attention integrates seamlessly with most Transformer-based LLMs trained with global attention, reducing memory requirements and inference time by up to 11x while preserving 95-100% of accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is computationally demanding. To reduce the cost of auto-regressive decoding, Key-Value (KV) caching is used to store intermediate activations, enabling GPUs to perform only the incremental computation required for each new token. This approach significantly lowers the computational overhead for token generation. However, the memory required for KV caching grows rapidly, often exceeding the capacity of GPU memory. A cost-effective alternative is to offload KV cache to CPU memory, which alleviates GPU memory pressure but shifts the bottleneck to the limited bandwidth of the PCIe connection between the CPU and GPU. Existing methods attempt to address these issues by overlapping GPU computation with I/O or employing CPU-GPU heterogeneous execution, but they are hindered by excessive data movement and dependence on CPU capabilities. In this paper, we introduce an efficient CPU-GPU I/O-aware LLM inference method that avoids transferring the entire KV cache from CPU to GPU by recomputing partial KV cache from activations while concurrently transferring the remaining KV cache via PCIe bus. This approach overlaps GPU recomputation with data transfer to minimize idle GPU time and maximize inference performance. Our method is fully automated by integrating a profiler module that utilizes input characteristics and system hardware information, a scheduler module to optimize the distribution of computation and communication workloads, and a runtime module to efficiently execute the derived execution plan. Experimental results show that our method achieves up to 35.8% lower latency and 46.2% higher throughput during decoding compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the advance of diffusion models, today's video generation has achieved impressive quality. To extend the generation length and facilitate real-world applications, a majority of video diffusion models (VDMs) generate videos in an autoregressive manner, i.e., generating subsequent clips conditioned on the last frame(s) of the previous clip. However, existing autoregressive VDMs are highly inefficient and redundant: The model must re-compute all the conditional frames that are overlapped between adjacent clips. This issue is exacerbated when the conditional frames are extended autoregressively to provide the model with long-term context. In such cases, the computational demands increase significantly (i.e., with a quadratic complexity w.r.t. the autoregression step). In this paper, we propose Ca2-VDM, an efficient autoregressive VDM with Causal generation and Cache sharing. For causal generation, it introduces unidirectional feature computation, which ensures that the cache of conditional frames can be precomputed in previous autoregression steps and reused in every subsequent step, eliminating redundant computations. For cache sharing, it shares the cache across all denoising steps to avoid the huge cache storage cost. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Ca2-VDM achieves state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative video generation results and significantly improves the generation speed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer networks, driven by self-attention, are central to Large Language Models. In generative Transformers, self-attention uses cache memory to store token projections, avoiding recomputation at each time step. However, GPU-stored projections must be loaded into SRAM for each new generation step, causing latency and energy bottlenecks.   We present a custom self-attention in-memory computing architecture based on emerging charge-based memories called gain cells, which can be efficiently written to store new tokens during sequence generation and enable parallel analog dot-product computation required for self-attention. However, the analog gain cell circuits introduce non-idealities and constraints preventing the direct mapping of pre-trained models. To circumvent this problem, we design an initialization algorithm achieving text processing performance comparable to GPT-2 without training from scratch. Our architecture respectively reduces attention latency and energy consumption by up to two and five orders of magnitude compared to GPUs, marking a significant step toward ultra-fast, low-power generative Transformers.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Building a high-performance JIT-capable VM for a dynamic language has traditionally required a tremendous amount of time, money, and expertise. We present Deegen, a meta-compiler that allows users to generate a high-performance JIT-capable VM for their own language at an engineering cost similar to writing a simple interpreter. Deegen takes in the execution semantics of the bytecodes implemented as C++ functions, and automatically generates a two-tier VM execution engine with a state-of-the-art interpreter, a state-of-the-art baseline JIT, and the tier-switching logic that connects them into a self-adaptive system.   We are the first to demonstrate the automatic generation of a JIT compiler, and the automatic generation of an interpreter that outperforms the state of the art. Our performance comes from a long list of optimizations supported by Deegen, including bytecode specialization and quickening, register pinning, tag register optimization, call inline caching, generic inline caching, JIT polymorphic IC, JIT IC inline slab, type-check removal and strength reduction, type-based slow-path extraction and outlining, JIT hot-cold code splitting, and JIT OSR-entry. These optimizations are either employed automatically, or guided by the language implementer through intuitive APIs. As a result, the disassembly of the Deegen-generated interpreter, baseline JIT, and the generated JIT code rivals the assembly code hand-written by experts in state-of-the-art VMs.   We implement LuaJIT Remake (LJR), a standard-compliant Lua 5.1 VM, using Deegen. Across 44 benchmarks, LJR's interpreter is on average 179% faster than the official PUC Lua interpreter, and 31% faster than LuaJIT's interpreter. LJR's baseline JIT has negligible startup delay, and its execution performance is on average 360% faster than PUC Lua and only 33% slower (but faster on 13/44 benchmarks) than LuaJIT's optimizing JIT.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The widespread adoption of LLMs has driven an exponential rise in their deployment, imposing substantial demands on inference clusters. These clusters must handle numerous concurrent queries for different LLM downstream tasks. To handle multi-task settings with vast LLM parameter counts, methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable task-specific fine-tuning while sharing most of the base LLM model across tasks. Hence, they allow concurrent task serving with minimal memory requirements. However, existing LLM serving systems face inefficiencies: they overlook workload heterogeneity, impose high link bandwidth from frequent adapter loading, and suffer from head-of-line blocking in their schedulers. To address these challenges, we present Chameleon, a novel LLM serving system optimized for many adapter environments, that relies on two core ideas: adapter caching and adapter-aware scheduling. First, Chameleon caches popular adapters in GPU memory, minimizing the adapter loading times. Importantly, it uses the otherwise idle GPU memory, avoiding extra memory costs. Second, Chameleon uses a non-preemptive multi-queue scheduling to efficiently account for workload heterogeneity. In this way, Chameleon simultaneously prevents head of line blocking and starvation. We implement Chameleon on top of a state-of-the-art LLM serving platform and evaluate it with real-world production traces and open-source LLMs. Under high loads, Chameleon reduces P99 and P50 TTFT latency by 80.7% and 48.1%, respectively, while improving throughput by 1.5x compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Test-time adaptation with pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) has attracted increasing attention for tackling the issue of distribution shift during the test phase. While prior methods have shown effectiveness in addressing distribution shift by adjusting classification logits, they are not optimal due to keeping text features unchanged. To address this issue, we introduce a new approach called Test-time Alignment-Enhanced Adapter (TAEA), which trains an adapter with test samples to adjust text features during the test phase. We can enhance the text-to-image alignment prediction by utilizing an adapter to adapt text features. Furthermore, we also propose to adopt the negative cache from TDA as enhancement module, which further improves the performance of TAEA. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art TTA method of pre-trained VLMs by an average of 0.75% on the out-of-distribution benchmark and 2.5% on the cross-domain benchmark, with an acceptable training time.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Emerging Large Language Model (LLM) applications require long input prompts to perform complex downstream tasks like document analysis and code generation. For these long context length applications, the length of the input prompt poses a significant challenge in terms of inference efficiency since the inference costs increase linearly with sequence length. However, for many of these applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different user inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations to process user inputs quickly, as they are received. In this work, we propose Squeezed Attention as a mechanism to accelerate LLM applications where a large portion of the input prompt is fixed. We first leverage K-means clustering offline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity and represent each cluster with a single centroid value. During inference, we compare query tokens from the user input with the centroids to predict which of the keys from the fixed context are semantically relevant and need to be loaded during inference. We then compute exact attention using only these important keys from the fixed context, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational costs. We also extend our method to use a hierarchical centroid lookup to identify important keys, which can reduce the complexity of attention from linear to logarithmic with respect to the context length. We implement optimized Triton kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with important keys, achieving more than 4x speedups during both the prefill and generation phases for long-context inference. Furthermore, we have extensively evaluated our method on various long-context benchmarks including LongBench, where it achieves a 3x reduction in KV cache budget without accuracy loss and up to an 8x reduction with <0.5 point accuracy gap for various models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in various high-impact applications, including fraud detection and content recommendation. Despite the success of TGNNs, they are prone to the prevalent noise found in real-world dynamic graphs like time-deprecated links and skewed interaction distribution. The noise causes two critical issues that significantly compromise the accuracy of TGNNs: (1) models are supervised by inferior interactions, and (2) noisy input induces high variance in the aggregated messages. However, current TGNN denoising techniques do not consider the diverse and dynamic noise pattern of each node. In addition, they also suffer from the excessive mini-batch generation overheads caused by traversing more neighbors. We believe the remedy for fast and accurate TGNNs lies in temporal adaptive sampling. In this work, we propose TASER, the first adaptive sampling method for TGNNs optimized for accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. TASER adapts its mini-batch selection based on training dynamics and temporal neighbor selection based on the contextual, structural, and temporal properties of past interactions. To alleviate the bottleneck in mini-batch generation, TASER implements a pure GPU-based temporal neighbor finder and a dedicated GPU feature cache. We evaluate the performance of TASER using two state-of-the-art backbone TGNNs. On five popular datasets, TASER outperforms the corresponding baselines by an average of 2.3% in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) while achieving an average of 5.1x speedup in training time.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has advanced interactive segmentation but is limited by the high computational cost on high-resolution images. This requires downsampling to meet GPU constraints, sacrificing the fine-grained details needed for high-precision interactive segmentation. To address SAM's limitations, we focus on visual length extrapolation and propose a lightweight model named HRSAM. The extrapolation enables HRSAM trained on low resolutions to generalize to high resolutions. We begin by finding the link between the extrapolation and attention scores, which leads us to base HRSAM on Swin attention. We then introduce the Flexible Local Attention (FLA) framework, using CUDA-optimized Efficient Memory Attention to accelerate HRSAM. Within FLA, we implement Flash Swin attention, achieving over a 35% speedup compared to traditional Swin attention, and propose a KV-only padding mechanism to enhance extrapolation. We also develop the Cycle-scan module that uses State Space models to efficiently expand HRSAM's receptive field. We further develop the HRSAM++ within FLA by adding an anchor map, providing multi-scale data augmentation for the extrapolation and a larger receptive field at slight computational cost. Experiments show that, under standard training, HRSAMs surpass the previous SOTA with only 38% of the latency. With SAM-distillation, the extrapolation enables HRSAMs to outperform the teacher model at lower latency. Further finetuning achieves performance significantly exceeding the previous SOTA.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) can be a precise, minimally invasive treatment method for liver cancer and liver metastases. However, the effectiveness of SBRT relies on the accurate delivery of the dose to the tumor while sparing healthy tissue. Challenges persist in ensuring breath-hold reproducibility, with current methods often requiring manual verification of liver dome positions from kV-triggered images. To address this, we propose a proof-of-principle study of a deep learning-based pipeline to automatically delineate the liver dome from kV-planar images. From 24 patients who received SBRT for liver cancer or metastasis inside liver, 711 KV-triggered images acquired for online breath-hold verification were included in the current study. We developed a pipeline comprising a trained U-Net for automatic liver dome region segmentation from the triggered images followed by extraction of the liver dome via thresholding, edge detection, and morphological operations. The performance and generalizability of the pipeline was evaluated using 2-fold cross validation. The training of the U-Net model for liver region segmentation took under 30 minutes and the automatic delineation of a liver dome for any triggered image took less than one second. The RMSE and rate of detection for Fold1 with 366 images was (6.4 +/- 1.6) mm and 91.7%, respectively. For Fold2 with 345 images, the RMSE and rate of detection was (7.7 +/- 2.3) mm and 76.3% respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The influence of contextual input on the behavior of large language models (LLMs) has prompted the development of context attribution methods that aim to quantify each context span's effect on an LLM's generations. The leave-one-out (LOO) error, which measures the change in the likelihood of the LLM's response when a given span of the context is removed, provides a principled way to perform context attribution, but can be prohibitively expensive to compute for large models. In this work, we introduce AttriBoT, a series of novel techniques for efficiently computing an approximation of the LOO error for context attribution. Specifically, AttriBoT uses cached activations to avoid redundant operations, performs hierarchical attribution to reduce computation, and emulates the behavior of large target models with smaller proxy models. Taken together, AttriBoT can provide a >300x speedup while remaining more faithful to a target model's LOO error than prior context attribution methods. This stark increase in performance makes computing context attributions for a given response 30x faster than generating the response itself, empowering real-world applications that require computing attributions at scale. We release a user-friendly and efficient implementation of AttriBoT to enable efficient LLM interpretability as well as encourage future development of efficient context attribution methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the accumulated errors. To tackle this challenge, we propose FreeScale, a tuning-free inference paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation via scale fusion. Specifically, FreeScale processes information from different receptive scales and then fuses it by extracting desired frequency components. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models. Notably, compared with the previous best-performing method, FreeScale unlocks the generation of 8k-resolution images for the first time.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Significant achievements in personalization of diffusion models have been witnessed. Conventional tuning-free methods mostly encode multiple reference images by averaging their image embeddings as the injection condition, but such an image-independent operation cannot perform interaction among images to capture consistent visual elements within multiple references. Although the tuning-based Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can effectively extract consistent elements within multiple images through the training process, it necessitates specific finetuning for each distinct image group. This paper introduces EasyRef, a novel plug-and-play adaptation method that enables diffusion models to be conditioned on multiple reference images and the text prompt. To effectively exploit consistent visual elements within multiple images, we leverage the multi-image comprehension and instruction-following capabilities of the multimodal large language model (MLLM), prompting it to capture consistent visual elements based on the instruction. Besides, injecting the MLLM's representations into the diffusion process through adapters can easily generalize to unseen domains, mining the consistent visual elements within unseen data. To mitigate computational costs and enhance fine-grained detail preservation, we introduce an efficient reference aggregation strategy and a progressive training scheme. Finally, we introduce MRBench, a new multi-reference image generation benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate EasyRef surpasses both tuning-free methods like IP-Adapter and tuning-based methods like LoRA, achieving superior aesthetic quality and robust zero-shot generalization across diverse domains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has extended to the multimodal domain, achieving outstanding performance in image understanding and generation. Recent efforts to develop unified Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that integrate these capabilities have shown promising results. However, existing approaches often involve complex designs in model architecture or training pipeline, increasing the difficulty of model training and scaling. In this paper, we propose SynerGen-VL, a simple yet powerful encoder-free MLLM capable of both image understanding and generation. To address challenges identified in existing encoder-free unified MLLMs, we introduce the token folding mechanism and the vision-expert-based progressive alignment pretraining strategy, which effectively support high-resolution image understanding while reducing training complexity. After being trained on large-scale mixed image-text data with a unified next-token prediction objective, SynerGen-VL achieves or surpasses the performance of existing encoder-free unified MLLMs with comparable or smaller parameter sizes, and narrows the gap with task-specific state-of-the-art models, highlighting a promising path toward future unified MLLMs. Our code and models shall be released.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video temporal grounding aims to localize relevant temporal boundaries in a video given a textual prompt. Recent work has focused on enabling Video LLMs to perform video temporal grounding via next-token prediction of temporal timestamps. However, accurately localizing timestamps in videos remains challenging for Video LLMs when relying solely on temporal token prediction. Our proposed TimeRefine addresses this challenge in two ways. First, instead of directly predicting the start and end timestamps, we reformulate the temporal grounding task as a temporal refining task: the model first makes rough predictions and then refines them by predicting offsets to the target segment. This refining process is repeated multiple times, through which the model progressively self-improves its temporal localization accuracy. Second, to enhance the model's temporal perception capabilities, we incorporate an auxiliary prediction head that penalizes the model more if a predicted segment deviates further from the ground truth, thus encouraging the model to make closer and more accurate predictions. Our plug-and-play method can be integrated into most LLM-based temporal grounding approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that TimeRefine achieves 3.6% and 5.0% mIoU improvements on the ActivityNet and Charades-STA datasets, respectively. Code and pretrained models will be released.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The standard practice for developing contemporary MLLMs is to feed features from vision encoder(s) into the LLM and train with natural language supervision. In this work, we posit an overlooked opportunity to optimize the intermediate LLM representations through a vision perspective (objective), i.e., solely natural language supervision is sub-optimal for the MLLM's visual understanding ability. To that end, we propose OLA-VLM, the first approach distilling knowledge into the LLM's hidden representations from a set of target visual representations. Firstly, we formulate the objective during the pretraining stage in MLLMs as a coupled optimization of predictive visual embedding and next text-token prediction. Secondly, we investigate MLLMs trained solely with natural language supervision and identify a positive correlation between the quality of visual representations within these models and their downstream performance. Moreover, upon probing our OLA-VLM, we observe improved representation quality owing to the embedding optimization. Thirdly, we demonstrate that our OLA-VLM outperforms the single and multi-encoder baselines, proving our approach's superiority over explicitly feeding the corresponding features to the LLM. Particularly, OLA-VLM boosts performance by an average margin of up to 2.5% on various benchmarks, with a notable improvement of 8.7% on the Depth task in CV-Bench.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper describes a semi-automatic pipeline to generate challenging question-answer-decoy sets for understanding long videos. Many existing video datasets and models are focused on short clips (10s-30s). While some long video datasets do exist, they can often be solved by powerful image models applied per frame (and often to very few frames) in a video, and are usually manually annotated at high cost. In order to mitigate both these problems, we propose a scalable dataset creation pipeline which leverages large models (VLMs and LLMs), to automatically generate dense, time-aligned video captions, as well as tough question answer decoy sets for video segments (up to 15 minutes in length). Our dataset Neptune covers a broad range of long video reasoning abilities and consists of a subset that emphasizes multimodal reasoning. Since existing metrics for open-ended question answering are either rule-based or may rely on proprietary models, we provide a new open source model-based metric GEM to score open-ended responses on Neptune. Benchmark evaluations reveal that most current open-source long video models perform poorly on Neptune, particularly on questions testing temporal ordering, counting and state changes. Through Neptune, we aim to spur the development of more advanced models capable of understanding long videos. The dataset is available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/neptune

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantifying the uncertainty in the factual parametric knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in a black-box setting, poses a significant challenge. Existing methods, which gauge a model's uncertainty through evaluating self-consistency in responses to the original query, do not always capture true uncertainty. Models might respond consistently to the origin query with a wrong answer, yet respond correctly to varied questions from different perspectives about the same query, and vice versa. In this paper, we propose a novel method, DiverseAgentEntropy, for evaluating a model's uncertainty using multi-agent interaction under the assumption that if a model is certain, it should consistently recall the answer to the original query across a diverse collection of questions about the same original query. We further implement an abstention policy to withhold responses when uncertainty is high. Our method offers a more accurate prediction of the model's reliability and further detects hallucinations, outperforming other self-consistency-based methods. Additionally, it demonstrates that existing models often fail to consistently retrieve the correct answer to the same query under diverse varied questions even when knowing the correct answer.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Given the rapid progress of generative AI, there is a pressing need to systematically compare and choose between the numerous models and configurations available. The scale and versatility of such evaluations make the use of LLM-based judges a compelling solution for this challenge. Crucially, this approach requires first to validate the quality of the LLM judge itself. Previous work has focused on instance-based assessment of LLM judges, where a judge is evaluated over a set of responses, or response pairs, while being agnostic to their source systems. We argue that this setting overlooks critical factors affecting system-level ranking, such as a judge's positive or negative bias towards certain systems. To address this gap, we conduct the first large-scale study of LLM judges as system rankers. System scores are generated by aggregating judgment scores over multiple system outputs, and the judge's quality is assessed by comparing the resulting system ranking to a human-based ranking. Beyond overall judge assessment, our analysis provides a fine-grained characterization of judge behavior, including their decisiveness and bias.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent latent-space monitoring techniques have shown promise as defenses against LLM attacks. These defenses act as scanners that seek to detect harmful activations before they lead to undesirable actions. This prompts the question: Can models execute harmful behavior via inconspicuous latent states? Here, we study such obfuscated activations. We show that state-of-the-art latent-space defenses -- including sparse autoencoders, representation probing, and latent OOD detection -- are all vulnerable to obfuscated activations. For example, against probes trained to classify harmfulness, our attacks can often reduce recall from 100% to 0% while retaining a 90% jailbreaking rate. However, obfuscation has limits: we find that on a complex task (writing SQL code), obfuscation reduces model performance. Together, our results demonstrate that neural activations are highly malleable: we can reshape activation patterns in a variety of ways, often while preserving a network's behavior. This poses a fundamental challenge to latent-space defenses.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cable broadband networks are one of the few "last-mile" broadband technologies widely available in the U.S. Unfortunately, they have poor reliability after decades of deployment. The cable industry proposed a framework called Proactive Network Maintenance (PNM) to diagnose the cable networks. However, there is little public knowledge or systematic study on how to use these data to detect and localize cable network problems. Existing tools in the public domain have prohibitive high false-positive rates. In this paper, we propose CableMon, the first public-domain system that applies machine learning techniques to PNM data to improve the reliability of cable broadband networks. CableMon tackles two key challenges faced by cable ISPs: accurately detecting failures, and distinguishing whether a failure occurs within a network or at a subscriber's premise. CableMon uses statistical models to generate features from time series data and uses customer trouble tickets as hints to infer abnormal/failure thresholds for these generated features. Further, CableMon employs an unsupervised learning model to group cable devices sharing similar anomalous patterns and effectively identify impairments that occur inside a cable network and impairments occur at a subscriber's premise, as these two different faults require different types of technical personnel to repair them. We use eight months of PNM data and customer trouble tickets from an ISP and experimental deployment to evaluate CableMon's performance. Our evaluation results show that CableMon can effectively detect and distinguish failures from PNM data and outperforms existing public-domain tools.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding what defines a good representation in large language models (LLMs) is fundamental to both theoretical understanding and practical applications. In this paper, we investigate the quality of intermediate representations in various LLM architectures, including Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs). We find that intermediate layers often yield more informative representations for downstream tasks than the final layers. To measure the representation quality, we adapt and apply a suite of metrics - such as prompt entropy, curvature, and augmentation-invariance - originally proposed in other contexts. Our empirical study reveals significant architectural differences, how representations evolve throughout training, and how factors like input randomness and prompt length affect each layer. Notably, we observe a bimodal pattern in the entropy of some intermediate layers and consider potential explanations tied to training data. Overall, our results illuminate the internal mechanics of LLMs and guide strategies for architectural optimization and training.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Materials discovery and development are critical for addressing global challenges. Yet, the exponential growth in materials science literature comprising vast amounts of textual data has created significant bottlenecks in knowledge extraction, synthesis, and scientific reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to accelerate materials research through automated analysis and prediction. Still, their effective deployment requires domain-specific adaptation for understanding and solving domain-relevant tasks. Here, we present LLaMat, a family of foundational models for materials science developed through continued pretraining of LLaMA models on an extensive corpus of materials literature and crystallographic data. Through systematic evaluation, we demonstrate that LLaMat excels in materials-specific NLP and structured information extraction while maintaining general linguistic capabilities. The specialized LLaMat-CIF variant demonstrates unprecedented capabilities in crystal structure generation, predicting stable crystals with high coverage across the periodic table. Intriguingly, despite LLaMA-3's superior performance in comparison to LLaMA-2, we observe that LLaMat-2 demonstrates unexpectedly enhanced domain-specific performance across diverse materials science tasks, including structured information extraction from text and tables, more particularly in crystal structure generation, a potential adaptation rigidity in overtrained LLMs. Altogether, the present work demonstrates the effectiveness of domain adaptation towards developing practically deployable LLM copilots for materials research. Beyond materials science, our findings reveal important considerations for domain adaptation of LLMs, such as model selection, training methodology, and domain-specific performance, which may influence the development of specialized scientific AI systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) significantly enhances the zero-shot capabilities of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). While coding data is known to boost LLM reasoning abilities during pretraining, its role in activating internal reasoning capacities during IFT remains understudied. This paper investigates a key question: How does coding data impact LLMs' reasoning capacities during IFT stage? To explore this, we thoroughly examine the impact of coding data across different coding data proportions, model families, sizes, and reasoning domains, from various perspectives. Specifically, we create three IFT datasets with increasing coding data proportions, fine-tune six LLM backbones across different families and scales on these datasets, evaluate the tuned models' performance across twelve tasks in three reasoning domains, and analyze the outcomes from three broad-to-granular perspectives: overall, domain-level, and task-specific. Our holistic analysis provides valuable insights into each perspective. First, coding data tuning enhances the overall reasoning capabilities of LLMs across different model families and scales. Moreover, while the impact of coding data varies by domain, it shows consistent trends within each domain across different model families and scales. Additionally, coding data generally provides comparable task-specific benefits across model families, with optimal proportions in IFT datasets being task-dependent.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We study the problem of constructing an estimator of the average treatment effect (ATE) with observational data. The celebrated doubly-robust, augmented-IPW (AIPW) estimator generally requires consistent estimation of both nuisance functions for standard root-n inference, and moreover that the product of the errors of the nuisances should shrink at a rate faster than $n^{-1/2}$. A recent strand of research has aimed to understand the extent to which the AIPW estimator can be improved upon (in a minimax sense). Under structural assumptions on the nuisance functions, the AIPW estimator is typically not minimax-optimal, and improvements can be made using higher-order influence functions (Robins et al, 2017). Conversely, without any assumptions on the nuisances beyond the mean-square-error rates at which they can be estimated, the rate achieved by the AIPW estimator is already optimal (Balakrishnan et al, 2023; Jin and Syrgkanis, 2024).   We make three main contributions. First, we propose a new hybrid class of distributions that combine structural agnosticism regarding the nuisance function space with additional smoothness constraints. Second, we calculate minimax lower bounds for estimating the ATE in the new class, as well as in the pure structure-agnostic one. Third, we propose a new estimator of the ATE that enjoys doubly-robust asymptotic linearity; it can yield asymptotically valid Wald-type confidence intervals even when the propensity score or the outcome model is inconsistently estimated, or estimated at a slow rate. Under certain conditions, we show that its rate of convergence in the new class can be much faster than that achieved by the AIPW estimator and, in particular, matches the minimax lower bound rate, thereby establishing its optimality. Finally, we complement our theoretical findings with simulations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Meshes are fundamental representations of 3D surfaces. However, creating high-quality meshes is a labor-intensive task that requires significant time and expertise in 3D modeling. While a delicate object often requires over $10^4$ faces to be accurately modeled, recent attempts at generating artist-like meshes are limited to $1.6$K faces and heavy discretization of vertex coordinates. Hence, scaling both the maximum face count and vertex coordinate resolution is crucial to producing high-quality meshes of realistic, complex 3D objects. We present Meshtron, a novel autoregressive mesh generation model able to generate meshes with up to 64K faces at 1024-level coordinate resolution --over an order of magnitude higher face count and $8{\times}$ higher coordinate resolution than current state-of-the-art methods. Meshtron's scalability is driven by four key components: (1) an hourglass neural architecture, (2) truncated sequence training, (3) sliding window inference, (4) a robust sampling strategy that enforces the order of mesh sequences. This results in over $50{\%}$ less training memory, $2.5{\times}$ faster throughput, and better consistency than existing works. Meshtron generates meshes of detailed, complex 3D objects at unprecedented levels of resolution and fidelity, closely resembling those created by professional artists, and opening the door to more realistic generation of detailed 3D assets for animation, gaming, and virtual environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have paved the way for LLM-based agent systems that offer enhanced accuracy and interpretability across various domains. Radiology, with its complex analytical requirements, is an ideal field for the application of these agents. This paper aims to investigate the pre-requisite question for building concrete radiology agents which is, `Can modern LLMs act as agent cores in radiology environments?' To investigate it, we introduce RadABench with three-fold contributions: First, we present RadABench-Data, a comprehensive synthetic evaluation dataset for LLM-based agents, generated from an extensive taxonomy encompassing 6 anatomies, 5 imaging modalities, 10 tool categories, and 11 radiology tasks. Second, we propose RadABench-EvalPlat, a novel evaluation platform for agents featuring a prompt-driven workflow and the capability to simulate a wide range of radiology toolsets. Third, we assess the performance of 7 leading LLMs on our benchmark from 5 perspectives with multiple metrics. Our findings indicate that while current LLMs demonstrate strong capabilities in many areas, they are still not sufficiently advanced to serve as the central agent core in a fully operational radiology agent system. Additionally, we identify key factors influencing the performance of LLM-based agent cores, offering insights for clinicians on how to apply agent systems in real-world radiology practices effectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid advancement of ML models in critical sectors such as healthcare, finance, and security has intensified the need for robust data security, model integrity, and reliable outputs. Large multimodal foundational models, while crucial for complex tasks, present challenges in scalability, reliability, and potential misuse. Decentralized systems offer a solution by distributing workload and mitigating central points of failure, but they introduce risks of unauthorized access to sensitive data across nodes. We address these challenges with a comprehensive framework designed for responsible AI development. Our approach incorporates: 1) Zero-knowledge proofs for secure model verification, enhancing trust without compromising privacy. 2) Consensus-based verification checks to ensure consistent outputs across nodes, mitigating hallucinations and maintaining model integrity. 3) Split Learning techniques that segment models across different nodes, preserving data privacy by preventing full data access at any point. 4) Hardware-based security through trusted execution environments (TEEs) to protect data and computations. This framework aims to enhance security and privacy and improve the reliability and fairness of multimodal AI systems. Promoting efficient resource utilization contributes to more sustainable AI development. Our state-of-the-art proofs and principles demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in responsibly democratizing artificial intelligence, offering a promising approach for building secure and private foundational models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present Liquid, an auto-regressive generation paradigm that seamlessly integrates visual comprehension and generation by tokenizing images into discrete codes and learning these code embeddings alongside text tokens within a shared feature space for both vision and language. Unlike previous multimodal large language model (MLLM), Liquid achieves this integration using a single large language model (LLM), eliminating the need for external pretrained visual embeddings such as CLIP. For the first time, Liquid uncovers a scaling law that performance drop unavoidably brought by the unified training of visual and language tasks diminishes as the model size increases. Furthermore, the unified token space enables visual generation and comprehension tasks to mutually enhance each other, effectively removing the typical interference seen in earlier models. We show that existing LLMs can serve as strong foundations for Liquid, saving 100x in training costs while outperforming Chameleon in multimodal capabilities and maintaining language performance comparable to mainstream LLMs like LLAMA2. Liquid also outperforms models like SD v2.1 and SD-XL (FID of 5.47 on MJHQ-30K), excelling in both vision-language and text-only tasks. This work demonstrates that LLMs such as LLAMA3.2 and GEMMA2 are powerful multimodal generators, offering a scalable solution for enhancing both vision-language understanding and generation. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/FoundationVision/Liquid.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Pathological diagnosis is vital for determining disease characteristics, guiding treatment, and assessing prognosis, relying heavily on detailed, multi-scale analysis of high-resolution whole slide images (WSI). However, traditional pure vision models face challenges of redundant feature extraction, whereas existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) are limited by input resolution constraints, hindering their efficiency and accuracy. To overcome these issues, we propose two innovative strategies: the mixed task-guided feature enhancement, which directs feature extraction toward lesion-related details across scales, and the prompt-guided detail feature completion, which integrates coarse- and fine-grained features from WSI based on specific prompts without compromising inference speed. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of 490,000 samples from diverse pathology tasks-including cancer detection, grading, vascular and neural invasion identification, and so on-we trained the pathology-specialized LVLM, OmniPath. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this model significantly outperforms existing methods in diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, offering an interactive, clinically aligned approach for auxiliary diagnosis in a wide range of pathology applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Gradient descent is one of the most widely used iterative algorithms in modern statistical learning. However, its precise algorithmic dynamics in high-dimensional settings remain only partially understood, which has therefore limited its broader potential for statistical inference applications.   This paper provides a precise, non-asymptotic distributional characterization of gradient descent iterates in a broad class of empirical risk minimization problems, in the so-called mean-field regime where the sample size is proportional to the signal dimension. Our non-asymptotic state evolution theory holds for both general non-convex loss functions and non-Gaussian data, and reveals the central role of two Onsager correction matrices that precisely characterize the non-trivial dependence among all gradient descent iterates in the mean-field regime.   Although the Onsager correction matrices are typically analytically intractable, our state evolution theory facilitates a generic gradient descent inference algorithm that consistently estimates these matrices across a broad class of models. Leveraging this algorithm, we show that the state evolution can be inverted to construct (i) data-driven estimators for the generalization error of gradient descent iterates and (ii) debiased gradient descent iterates for inference of the unknown signal. Detailed applications to two canonical models--linear regression and (generalized) logistic regression--are worked out to illustrate model-specific features of our general theory and inference methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Panel data consists of a collection of $N$ units that are observed over $T$ units of time. A policy or treatment is subject to staggered adoption if different units take on treatment at different times and remains treated (or never at all). Assessing the effectiveness of such a policy requires estimating the treatment effect, corresponding to the difference between outcomes for treated versus untreated units. We develop inference procedures that build upon a computationally efficient matrix estimator for treatment effects in panel data. Our routines return confidence intervals (CIs) both for individual treatment effects, as well as for more general bilinear functionals of treatment effects, with prescribed coverage guarantees. We apply these inferential methods to analyze the effectiveness of Medicaid expansion portion of the Affordable Care Act. Based on our analysis, Medicaid expansion has led to substantial reductions in uninsurance rates, has reduced infant mortality rates, and has had no significant effects on healthcare expenditures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents the Long Context and Form Output (LCFO) benchmark, a novel evaluation framework for assessing gradual summarization and summary expansion capabilities across diverse domains. LCFO consists of long input documents (5k words average length), each of which comes with three summaries of different lengths (20%, 10%, and 5% of the input text), as well as approximately 15 questions and answers (QA) related to the input content. Notably, LCFO also provides alignments between specific QA pairs and corresponding summaries in 7 domains. The primary motivation behind providing summaries of different lengths is to establish a controllable framework for generating long texts from shorter inputs, i.e. summary expansion. To establish an evaluation metric framework for summarization and summary expansion, we provide human evaluation scores for human-generated outputs, as well as results from various state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). GPT-4o-mini achieves best human scores among automatic systems in both summarization and summary expansion tasks (~ +10% and +20%, respectively). It even surpasses human output quality in the case of short summaries (~ +7%). Overall automatic metrics achieve low correlations with human evaluation scores (~ 0.4) but moderate correlation on specific evaluation aspects such as fluency and attribution (~ 0.6). The LCFO benchmark offers a standardized platform for evaluating summarization and summary expansion performance, as well as corresponding automatic metrics, thereby providing an important evaluation framework to advance generative AI.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Automatically generating feedback via large language models (LLMs) in intelligent tutoring systems and online learning platforms has the potential to improve the learning outcomes of many students. However, both feedback generation and evaluation are challenging: feedback content has to be valid especially in subjects like math, which requires models to understand the problem, the solution, and where the student's error lies. Feedback also has to be pedagogically valid to reflect effective tutoring strategies, such as explaining possible misconceptions and encouraging the student, among other desirable features. In this work, we address both problems of automatically generating and evaluating feedback while considering both correctness and alignment. First, we propose a rubric for evaluating math feedback and show that GPT-4 is able to effectively use it to annotate human-written and LLM-generated feedback. Second, we propose a framework for feedback generation that optimizes both correctness and alignment using reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we use GPT-4's annotations to create preferences over feedback pairs in an augmented dataset for training via direct preference optimization (DPO). We show that our methods significantly increase the correctness and alignment of generated feedback with Llama 2, an open-source LLM, qualitatively analyze our generation and evaluation systems using case studies, and outline several areas for future work.

However, most existing datasets only evaluate limited application domains. To address this gap, we have developed a comprehensive code evaluation dataset FullStack Bench focusing on full-stack programming, which encompasses a wide range of application domains (e.g., basic programming, data analysis, software engineering, mathematics, and machine learning). Besides, to assess multilingual programming capabilities, in FullStack Bench, we design real-world instructions and corresponding unit test cases from 16 widely-used programming languages to reflect real-world usage scenarios rather than simple translations. Moreover, we also release an effective code sandbox execution tool (i.e., SandboxFusion) supporting various programming languages and packages to evaluate the performance of our FullStack Bench efficiently. Comprehensive experimental results on our FullStack Bench demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of our FullStack Bench and SandboxFusion.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continually acquire knowledge of new classes without forgetting old ones. Despite Pre-trained Models (PTMs) have shown excellent performance in CIL, catastrophic forgetting still occurs as the model learns new concepts. Existing work seeks to utilize lightweight components to adjust the PTM, while the forgetting phenomenon still comes from {\em parameter and retrieval} levels. Specifically, iterative updates of the model result in parameter drift, while mistakenly retrieving irrelevant modules leads to the mismatch during inference. To this end, we propose MOdel Surgery (MOS) to rescue the model from forgetting previous knowledge. By training task-specific adapters, we continually adjust the PTM to downstream tasks. To mitigate parameter-level forgetting, we present an adapter merging approach to learn task-specific adapters, which aims to bridge the gap between different components while reserve task-specific information. Besides, to address retrieval-level forgetting, we introduce a training-free self-refined adapter retrieval mechanism during inference, which leverages the model's inherent ability for better adapter retrieval. By jointly rectifying the model with those steps, MOS can robustly resist catastrophic forgetting in the learning process. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets validate MOS's state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at: https://github.com/sun-hailong/AAAI25-MOS

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantum processing units (QPUs) are highly heterogeneous in terms of physical qubit performance. To add even more complexity, drift in quantum noise landscapes has been well-documented. This makes resource allocation a challenging problem whenever a quantum program must be mapped to hardware. As a solution, we propose a novel resource allocation framework that applies Pauli checks. Pauli checks have demonstrated their efficacy at error mitigation in prior work, and in this paper, we highlight their potential to infer the noise characteristics of a quantum system. Circuits with embedded Pauli checks can be executed on different regions of qubits, and the syndrome data created by error-detecting Pauli checks can be leveraged to guide quantum program outcomes toward regions that produce higher-fidelity final distributions. Using noisy simulation and a real QPU testbed, we show that dynamic quantum resource allocation with Pauli checks can outperform state-of-art mapping techniques, such as those that are noise-aware. Further, when applied toward the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm, techniques guided by Pauli checks demonstrate the ability to increase circuit fidelity 11% on average, and up to 33%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Conventional biomedical research is increasingly labor-intensive due to the exponential growth of scientific literature and datasets. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has the potential to revolutionize this process by automating various steps. Still, significant challenges remain, including the need for multidisciplinary expertise, logicality of experimental design, and performance measurements. This paper introduces BioResearcher, the first end-to-end automated system designed to streamline the entire biomedical research process involving dry lab experiments. BioResearcher employs a modular multi-agent architecture, integrating specialized agents for search, literature processing, experimental design, and programming. By decomposing complex tasks into logically related sub-tasks and utilizing a hierarchical learning approach, BioResearcher effectively addresses the challenges of multidisciplinary requirements and logical complexity. Furthermore, BioResearcher incorporates an LLM-based reviewer for in-process quality control and introduces novel evaluation metrics to assess the quality and automation of experimental protocols. BioResearcher successfully achieves an average execution success rate of 63.07% across eight previously unmet research objectives. The generated protocols averagely outperform typical agent systems by 22.0% on five quality metrics. The system demonstrates significant potential to reduce researchers' workloads and accelerate biomedical discoveries, paving the way for future innovations in automated research systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Ultraviolet and visible integrated photonics are enabling for applications in quantum information, sensing, and spectroscopy, among others. Few materials support low-loss photonics into the UV, and the relatively low refractive index of known depositable materials limits the achievable functionality. Here we present a high-index integrated photonics platform based on HfO$_2$ and Al$_2$O$_3$ composites deposited via Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) with low loss in the visible and near-UV. We show that Al$_2$O$_3$ incorporation dramatically decreases bulk loss compared to pure HfO$_2$, consistent with inhibited crystallization due to the admixture of Al$_2$O$_3$. Composites exhibit refractive index $n$ following the average of that of HfO$_2$ and Al$_2$O$_3$, weighted by the HfO$_2$ fractional composition $x$. At $\lambda=375$ nm, composites with $x=0.67$ exhibit $n=2.08$ preserving most of HfO$_2$'s significantly higher index, and $3.8(7) $ dB/cm material loss. We further present fully etched and cladded waveguides, grating couplers, and ring resonators, realizing single-mode waveguide loss of $0.25(2)$ dB/cm inferred from resonators of 2.6 million intrinsic quality factor at $\lambda=729$ nm, $2.6(2)$ dB/cm at $\lambda=405$ nm, and $7.7(6)$ dB/cm at $\lambda=375$ nm. We measure the composite's thermo-optic coefficient (TOC) to be $2.44(3) \times 10^{-5}$ RIU/$^\circ$C near $\lambda=397$ nm. This work establishes (HfO$_2$)$_x$(Al$_2$O$_3$)$_{1-x}$ composites as a platform amenable to integration for low-loss, high-index photonics spanning the UV to NIR.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an experimental technique for protein structure determination that images an ensemble of macromolecules in near-physiological contexts. While recent advances enable the reconstruction of dynamic conformations of a single biomolecular complex, current methods do not adequately model samples with mixed conformational and compositional heterogeneity. In particular, datasets containing mixtures of multiple proteins require the joint inference of structure, pose, compositional class, and conformational states for 3D reconstruction. Here, we present Hydra, an approach that models both conformational and compositional heterogeneity fully ab initio by parameterizing structures as arising from one of K neural fields. We employ a new likelihood-based loss function and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic datasets composed of mixtures of proteins with large degrees of conformational variability. We additionally demonstrate Hydra on an experimental dataset of a cellular lysate containing a mixture of different protein complexes. Hydra expands the expressivity of heterogeneous reconstruction methods and thus broadens the scope of cryo-EM to increasingly complex samples.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we investigate whether current state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are effective as AI tutors and whether they demonstrate pedagogical abilities necessary for good AI tutoring in educational dialogues. Previous efforts towards evaluation have been limited to subjective protocols and benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified evaluation taxonomy with eight pedagogical dimensions based on key learning sciences principles, which is designed to assess the pedagogical value of LLM-powered AI tutor responses grounded in student mistakes or confusion in the mathematical domain. We release MRBench -- a new evaluation benchmark containing 192 conversations and 1,596 responses from seven state-of-the-art LLM-based and human tutors, providing gold annotations for eight pedagogical dimensions. We assess reliability of the popular Prometheus2 LLM as an evaluator and analyze each tutor's pedagogical abilities, highlighting which LLMs are good tutors and which ones are more suitable as question-answering systems. We believe that the presented taxonomy, benchmark, and human-annotated labels will streamline the evaluation process and help track the progress in AI tutors' development.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, slow-thinking reasoning systems, such as o1, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving complex reasoning tasks. These systems typically engage in an extended thinking process before responding to a query, allowing them to generate more thorough, accurate, and well-reasoned solutions. These systems are primarily developed and maintained by industry, with their core techniques not publicly disclosed. In response, an increasing number of studies from the research community aim to explore the technical foundations underlying these powerful reasoning systems. Building on these prior efforts, this paper presents a reproduction report on implementing o1-like reasoning systems. We introduce an "imitate, explore, and self-improve" framework as our primary technical approach to train the reasoning model. In the initial phase, we use distilled long-form thought data to fine-tune the reasoning model, enabling it to invoke a slow-thinking mode. The model is then encouraged to explore challenging problems by generating multiple rollouts, which can result in increasingly more high-quality trajectories that lead to correct answers. Furthermore, the model undergoes self-improvement by iteratively refining its training dataset. To verify the effectiveness of this approach, we conduct extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance compared to industry-level reasoning systems on these benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, yet they often struggle with spatial reasoning. This paper presents a novel neural-symbolic framework that enhances LLMs' spatial reasoning abilities through iterative feedback between LLMs and Answer Set Programming (ASP). We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets: StepGame and SparQA, implementing three distinct strategies: (1) direct prompting baseline, (2) Facts+Rules prompting, and (3) DSPy-based LLM+ASP pipeline with iterative refinement. Our experimental results demonstrate that the LLM+ASP pipeline significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving an average 82% accuracy on StepGame and 69% on SparQA, marking improvements of 40-50% and 8-15% respectively over direct prompting. The success stems from three key innovations: (1) effective separation of semantic parsing and logical reasoning through a modular pipeline, (2) iterative feedback mechanism between LLMs and ASP solvers that improves program rate, and (3) robust error handling that addresses parsing, grounding, and solving failures. Additionally, we propose Facts+Rules as a lightweight alternative that achieves comparable performance on complex SparQA dataset, while reducing computational overhead.Our analysis across different LLM architectures (Deepseek, Llama3-70B, GPT-4.0 mini) demonstrates the framework's generalizability and provides insights into the trade-offs between implementation complexity and reasoning capability, contributing to the development of more interpretable and reliable AI systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This study focuses on a radial alignment between Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO) on the 29$^{\text{th}}$ of April 2021 (during a solar minimum), when the two spacecraft were respectively located at $\sim 0.075$ and $\sim 0.9$~au from the Sun. A previous study of this alignment allowed the identification of the same density enhancement (with a time scale of $\sim$1.5~h), and substructures ($\sim$20-30~min timescale), passing first by PSP, and then SolO after a $\sim 138$~h propagation time in the inner heliosphere. We show here that this structure belongs to the large scale heliospheric magnetic sector boundary. In this region, the density is dominated by radial gradients, whereas the magnetic field reversal is consistent with longitudinal gradients in the Carrington reference frame. We estimate the density structure radial size to remain of the order L$_R \sim 10^6$~km, while its longitudinal and latitudinal sizes, are estimated to expand from L$_{\varphi, \theta} \sim 10^4$-$10^5$~km in the high solar corona, to L$_{\varphi, \theta} \sim 10^5$-$10^6$~km at PSP, and L$_{\varphi, \theta} \sim 10^6$-$10^7$~km at SolO. This implies a strong evolution of the structure's aspect ratio during the propagation, due to the plasma's nearly spherical expansion. The structure's shape is therefore inferred to evolve from elongated in the radial direction at $\sim$2-3 solar radii (high corona), to sizes of nearly the same order in all directions at PSP, and then becoming elongated in the directions transverse to the radial at SolO. Measurements are not concordant with local reconnection of open solar wind field lines, so we propose that the structure has been generated through interchange reconnection near the tip of a coronal streamer.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, LLMs (Large Language Models) have been adapted for time series prediction with significant success in pattern recognition. However, the common belief is that these models are not suitable for predicting financial market returns, which are known to be almost random. We aim to challenge this misconception through a counterexample. Specifically, we utilized the Chronos model from Ansari et al.(2024) and tested both pretrained configurations and fine-tuned supervised forecasts on the largest American single stocks using data from Guijarro-Ordonnez et al.(2022). We constructed a long/short portfolio, and the performance simulation indicates that LLMs can in reality handle time series that are nearly indistinguishable from noise, demonstrating an ability to identify inefficiencies amidst randomness and generate alpha. Finally, we compared these results with those of specialized models and smaller deep learning models, highlighting significant room for improvement in LLM performance to further enhance their predictive capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We tasked 16 state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) with estimating the likelihood of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) emerging by 2030. To assess the quality of these forecasts, we implemented an automated peer review process (LLM-PR). The LLMs' estimates varied widely, ranging from 3% (Reka- Core) to 47.6% (GPT-4o), with a median of 12.5%. These estimates closely align with a recent expert survey that projected a 10% likelihood of AGI by 2027, underscoring the relevance of LLMs in forecasting complex, speculative scenarios. The LLM-PR process demonstrated strong reliability, evidenced by a high Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC = 0.79), reflecting notable consistency in scoring across the models. Among the models, Pplx-70b-online emerged as the top performer, while Gemini-1.5-pro-api ranked the lowest. A cross-comparison with external benchmarks, such as LMSYS Chatbot Arena, revealed that LLM rankings remained consistent across different evaluation methods, suggesting that existing benchmarks may not encapsulate some of the skills relevant for AGI prediction. We further explored the use of weighting schemes based on external benchmarks, optimizing the alignment of LLMs' predictions with human expert forecasts. This analysis led to the development of a new, 'AGI benchmark' designed to highlight performance differences in AGI-related tasks. Our findings offer insights into LLMs' capabilities in speculative, interdisciplinary forecasting tasks and emphasize the growing need for innovative evaluation frameworks for assessing AI performance in complex, uncertain real-world scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown significant potential in various biological tasks such as protein engineering and molecule design. These tasks typically involve black-box discrete sequence optimization, where the challenge lies in generating sequences that are not only biologically feasible but also adhere to hard fine-grained constraints. However, LLMs often struggle with such constraints, especially in biological contexts where verifying candidate solutions is costly and time-consuming. In this study, we explore the possibility of employing LLMs as highly-constrained bilevel optimizers through a methodology we refer to as Language Model Optimization with Margin Expectation (LLOME). This approach combines both offline and online optimization, utilizing limited oracle evaluations to iteratively enhance the sequences generated by the LLM. We additionally propose a novel training objective -- Margin-Aligned Expectation (MargE) -- that trains the LLM to smoothly interpolate between the reward and reference distributions. Lastly, we introduce a synthetic test suite that bears strong geometric similarity to real biophysical problems and enables rapid evaluation of LLM optimizers without time-consuming lab validation. Our findings reveal that, in comparison to genetic algorithm baselines, LLMs achieve significantly lower regret solutions while requiring fewer test function evaluations. However, we also observe that LLMs exhibit moderate miscalibration, are susceptible to generator collapse, and have difficulty finding the optimal solution when no explicit ground truth rewards are available.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In a binary merger with a small mass ratio, as the secondary body approaches the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of the primary black hole, the motion transitions from the adiabatic inspiral to the plunge governed by the geodesic equation. The plunge orbit is expected to excite the ringdown gravitational wave, which encodes information about the primary black hole's geometry. The details of the transition regime depend on the binary's mass ratio through radiation fluxes, which in turn influence the initial conditions for the plunge. As such, the mass ratio affects the post-ISCO ringdown gravitational wave excitation. In this study, we numerically investigate the mass ratio dependence of higher harmonic quasi-normal mode excitations in the post-ISCO gravitational waves of rapidly spinning black holes, based on the Teukolsky-Sasaki-Nakamura formalism. We consider the effect of mass ratio on the gravitational waves by accounting for the energy and angular momentum losses during the transition regime following the Ori-Thorne procedure. We examine two mass ratio scenarios: the intermediate mass ratio (IMR) and the extreme mass ratio (EMR). Our main finding is that higher harmonic quasi-normal modes are significantly excited in an IMR merger involving a highly spinning primary black hole. This implies that detecting an IMR merger involving such a primary black hole with space-based gravitational wave interferometers can provide valuable opportunities to infer black hole properties or test general relativity with excellent precision.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Constitutive modelling is crucial for engineering design and simulations to accurately describe material behavior. However, traditional phenomenological models often struggle to capture the complexities of real materials under varying stress conditions due to their fixed forms and limited parameters. While recent advances in deep learning have addressed some limitations of classical models, purely data-driven methods tend to require large datasets, lack interpretability, and struggle to generalize beyond their training data. To tackle these issues, we introduce "Fusion-based Constitutive model (FuCe): Towards model-data augmentation in constitutive modelling". This approach combines established phenomenological models with an ICNN architecture, designed to train on the limited and noisy force-displacement data typically available in practical applications. The hybrid model inherently adheres to necessary constitutive conditions. During inference, Monte Carlo dropout is employed to generate Bayesian predictions, providing mean values and confidence intervals that quantify uncertainty. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness by learning two isotropic constitutive models and one anisotropic model with a single fibre direction, across six different stress states. The framework's applicability is also showcased in finite element simulations across three geometries of varying complexities. Our results highlight the framework's superior extrapolation capabilities, even when trained on limited and noisy data, delivering accurate and physically meaningful predictions across all numerical examples.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present an analysis of three near-infrared (NIR; 1.0-2.4 $\mu$m) spectra of the SN 2003fg-like/"super-Chandrasekhar" type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) SN 2009dc, SN 2020hvf, and SN 2022pul at respective phases +372, +296, and +294~d relative to the epoch of $B$-band maximum. We find that all objects in our sample have asymmetric, or "tilted", [Fe~II] 1.257 and 1.644 $\mu$m profiles. We quantify the asymmetry of these features using five methods: velocity at peak flux, profile tilts, residual testing, velocity fitting, and comparison to deflagration-detonation transition models. Our results demonstrate that, while the profiles of the [Fe II] 1.257 and 1.644 $\mu$m features are widely varied between 2003fg-likes, these features are correlated in shape within the same SN. This implies that line blending is most likely not the dominant cause of the asymmetries inferred from these profiles. Instead, it is more plausible that 2003fg-like SNe have aspherical chemical distributions in their inner regions. These distributions may come from aspherical progenitor systems, such as double white dwarf mergers, or off-center delayed-detonation explosions of Chandrasekhar-mass Carbon-Oxygen white dwarfs. Additional late-phase NIR observation of 2003fg-like SNe and detailed 3-D NLTE modeling of these two explosion scenarios are encouraged.

The project aimed not only to analyse user opinions and attitudes towards these mechanics, but also to advance methodological research in text analysis. By employing prompting techniques and iterative prompt refinement processes, the study sought to test and improve the accuracy of LLM-based text analysis. The findings indicate that while LLMs can effectively identify relevant patterns and themes on par with human coders, there are still challenges in handling more complex tasks, underscoring the need for ongoing refinement in methodologies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capability in numerous tasks and applications. However, fine-tuning LLMs using high-quality datasets under external supervision remains prohibitively expensive. In response, LLM self-improvement approaches have been vibrantly developed recently. The typical paradigm of LLM self-improvement involves training LLM on self-generated data, part of which may be detrimental and should be filtered out due to the unstable data quality. While current works primarily employs filtering strategies based on answer correctness, in this paper, we demonstrate that filtering out correct but with high distribution shift extent (DSE) samples could also benefit the results of self-improvement. Given that the actual sample distribution is usually inaccessible, we propose a new metric called DS weight to approximate DSE, inspired by the Importance Weighting methods. Consequently, we integrate DS weight with self-consistency to comprehensively filter the self-generated samples and fine-tune the language model. Experiments show that with only a tiny valid set (up to 5\% size of the training set) to compute DS weight, our approach can notably promote the reasoning ability of current LLM self-improvement methods. The resulting performance is on par with methods that rely on external supervision from pre-trained reward models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper investigates the properties of strongly coupled matter at high baryon densities ($\rho_B$) in a quark star (QS). The QS is built from the density-dependent quark mass model (DDQM model), modified (MDDQM model) to obtain a higher maximum gravitational mass ($\rm M_{max}$) of the QS, using the data from observed pulsars: HESS J1731$-$347, PSR J0030$+$0451, PSR J0740$+$6620, and PSR J0952$-$0607 as constraints in Bayesian inference to determine the model parameters. The parameters yielding a quark matter (QM) equation of state that generates $\rm M_{max} > 2M_\odot$ violate the near-conformality conditions analyzed at high $\rho_B$. This behavior is interpreted as a consequence of the increasing quark population with $\rho_B$, along with the simultaneous formation of colored quark and gluon condensates, both of which are influenced by the pressure build-up in the stellar core as $\rho_B$ rises. This is reflected in the MDDQM model employed, which introduces an additional term that becomes significant at high densities. On the other hand, parameters that yield $\rm M_{max} < 2M_\odot$ conform to the expected near-conformal behavior at higher densities, as analyzed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LLMs can generate human-like dialogues, yet their ability to simulate early child-adult interactions remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we examined how effectively LLMs can capture the distinctive features of child-caregiver language in interaction, using both static and interactive benchmarking methods. We found that state-of-the-art LLMs like Llama 3 and GPT-4o can approximate child-caregiver dialogues at the word and utterance level, but they struggle to reproduce the child and caregiver's discursive patterns, exaggerate alignment, and fail to reach the level of diversity shown by humans. The broader goal of this work is to initiate the development of a comprehensive benchmark for LLMs in child-oriented applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As standards of care advance, patients are living longer and once-fatal diseases are becoming manageable. Clinical trials increasingly focus on reducing disease burden, which can be quantified by the timing and occurrence of multiple non-fatal clinical events. Most existing methods for the analysis of multiple event-time data require stringent modeling assumptions that can be difficult to verify empirically, leading to treatment efficacy estimates that forego interpretability when the underlying assumptions are not met. Moreover, most existing methods do not appropriately account for informative terminal events, such as premature treatment discontinuation or death, which prevent the occurrence of subsequent events. To address these limitations, we derive and validate estimation and inference procedures for the area under the mean cumulative function (AUMCF), an extension of the restricted mean survival time to the multiple event-time setting. The AUMCF is nonparametric, clinically interpretable, and properly accounts for terminal competing risks. To enable covariate adjustment, we also develop an augmentation estimator that provides efficiency at least equaling, and often exceeding, the unadjusted estimator. The utility and interpretability of the AUMCF are illustrated with extensive simulation studies and through an analysis of multiple heart-failure-related endpoints using data from the Beta-Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST) clinical trial. Our open-source R package MCC makes conducting AUMCF analyses straightforward and accessible.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> [Study in German language.] This study examines the AI-powered grading tool "AI Grading Assistant" by the German company Fobizz, designed to support teachers in evaluating and providing feedback on student assignments. Against the societal backdrop of an overburdened education system and rising expectations for artificial intelligence as a solution to these challenges, the investigation evaluates the tool's functional suitability through two test series. The results reveal significant shortcomings: The tool's numerical grades and qualitative feedback are often random and do not improve even when its suggestions are incorporated. The highest ratings are achievable only with texts generated by ChatGPT. False claims and nonsensical submissions frequently go undetected, while the implementation of some grading criteria is unreliable and opaque. Since these deficiencies stem from the inherent limitations of large language models (LLMs), fundamental improvements to this or similar tools are not immediately foreseeable. The study critiques the broader trend of adopting AI as a quick fix for systemic problems in education, concluding that Fobizz's marketing of the tool as an objective and time-saving solution is misleading and irresponsible. Finally, the study calls for systematic evaluation and subject-specific pedagogical scrutiny of the use of AI tools in educational contexts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we investigate Extractive Question Answering (EQA) with Large Language Models (LLMs) under domain drift, i.e., can LLMs generalize to domains that require specific knowledge such as medicine and law in a zero-shot fashion without additional in-domain training? To this end, we devise a series of experiments to explain the performance gap empirically. Our findings suggest that: (a) LLMs struggle with dataset demands of closed domains such as retrieving long answer spans; (b) Certain LLMs, despite showing strong overall performance, display weaknesses in meeting basic requirements as discriminating between domain-specific senses of words which we link to pre-processing decisions; (c) Scaling model parameters is not always effective for cross domain generalization; and (d) Closed-domain datasets are quantitatively much different than open-domain EQA datasets and current LLMs struggle to deal with them. Our findings point out important directions for improving existing LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text-to-video generation has evolved rapidly in recent years, delivering remarkable results. Training typically relies on video-caption paired data, which plays a crucial role in enhancing generation performance. However, current video captions often suffer from insufficient details, hallucinations and imprecise motion depiction, affecting the fidelity and consistency of generated videos. In this work, we propose a novel instance-aware structured caption framework, termed InstanceCap, to achieve instance-level and fine-grained video caption for the first time. Based on this scheme, we design an auxiliary models cluster to convert original video into instances to enhance instance fidelity. Video instances are further used to refine dense prompts into structured phrases, achieving concise yet precise descriptions. Furthermore, a 22K InstanceVid dataset is curated for training, and an enhancement pipeline that tailored to InstanceCap structure is proposed for inference. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed InstanceCap significantly outperform previous models, ensuring high fidelity between captions and videos while reducing hallucinations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Powerful large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to be deployed with lower computational costs, enabling their capabilities on resource-constrained devices. Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a star approach to achieve this ambition, with best methods compressing weights to less than 2 bit on average. In this paper, we propose Channel-Relaxed Vector Quantization (CRVQ), a novel technique that significantly improves the performance of PTQ baselines at the cost of only minimal additional bits. This state-of-the-art extreme compression method achieves its results through two key innovations: (1) carefully selecting and reordering a very small subset of critical weight channels, and (2) leveraging multiple codebooks to relax the constraint of critical channels. With our method, we demonstrate a 38.9% improvement over the current strongest sub-2-bit PTQ baseline, enabling nearer lossless 1-bit compression. Furthermore, our approach offers flexible customization of quantization bit-width and performance, providing a wider range of deployment options for diverse hardware platforms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Domain Large Language Models (LLMs) are developed for domain-specific tasks based on general LLMs. But it still requires professional knowledge to facilitate the expertise for some domain-specific tasks. In this paper, we investigate into knowledge-intensive calculation problems. We find that the math problems to be challenging for LLMs, when involving complex domain-specific rules and knowledge documents, rather than simple formulations of terminologies. Therefore, we propose a pipeline to solve the domain-specific calculation problems with Knowledge-Intensive Programs Generator more effectively, named as KIPG. It generates knowledge-intensive programs according to the domain-specific documents. For each query, key variables are extracted, then outcomes which are dependent on domain knowledge are calculated with the programs. By iterative preference alignment, the code generator learns to improve the logic consistency with the domain knowledge. Taking legal domain as an example, we have conducted experiments to prove the effectiveness of our pipeline, and extensive analysis on the modules. We also find that the code generator is also adaptable to other domains, without training on the new knowledge.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) have achieved notable advancements, demonstrating the feasibility of developing an intelligent biomedical assistant. However, current biomedical MLLMs predominantly focus on image-level understanding and restrict interactions to textual commands, thus limiting their capability boundaries and the flexibility of usage. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end multimodal large language model for the biomedical domain, named MedPLIB, which possesses pixel-level understanding. Excitingly, it supports visual question answering (VQA), arbitrary pixel-level prompts (points, bounding boxes, and free-form shapes), and pixel-level grounding. We propose a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) multi-stage training strategy, which divides MoE into separate training phases for a visual-language expert model and a pixel-grounding expert model, followed by fine-tuning using MoE. This strategy effectively coordinates multitask learning while maintaining the computational cost at inference equivalent to that of a single expert model. To advance the research of biomedical MLLMs, we introduce the Medical Complex Vision Question Answering Dataset (MeCoVQA), which comprises an array of 8 modalities for complex medical imaging question answering and image region understanding. Experimental results indicate that MedPLIB has achieved state-of-the-art outcomes across multiple medical visual language tasks. More importantly, in zero-shot evaluations for the pixel grounding task, MedPLIB leads the best small and large models by margins of 19.7 and 15.6 respectively on the mDice metric. The codes, data, and model checkpoints will be made publicly available at https://github.com/ShawnHuang497/MedPLIB.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We study extractive question-answering in the medical domain (Medical-EQA). This problem has two main challenges: (i) domain specificity, as most AI models lack necessary domain knowledge, and (ii) extraction-based answering style, which restricts most autoregressive LLMs due to potential hallucinations. To handle those challenges, we propose TOP-Training, a target-oriented pre-training paradigm that stands out among all domain adaptation techniques with two desirable features: (i) TOP-Training moves one step further than popular domain-oriented fine-tuning since it not only moves closer to the target domain, but also familiarizes itself with the target dataset, and (ii) it does not assume the existence of a large set of unlabeled instances from the target domain. Specifically, for a target Medical-EQA dataset, we extract its entities and leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic texts containing those entities; we then demonstrate that pretraining on this synthetic text data yields better performance on the target Medical-EQA benchmarks. Overall, our contributions are threefold: (i) TOP-Training, a new pretraining technique to effectively adapt LLMs to better solve a target problem, (ii) TOP-Training has a wide application scope because it does not require the target problem to have a large set of unlabeled data, and (iii) our experiments highlight the limitations of autoregressive LLMs, emphasizing TOP-Training as a means to unlock the true potential of bidirectional LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Traditional evaluation metrics like BLEU and ROUGE fall short when capturing the nuanced qualities of generated text, particularly when there is no single ground truth. In this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Google Gemini 1, to serve as automatic evaluators for non-standardized metrics in summarization and dialog-based tasks. We conduct experiments across multiple prompting strategies to examine how LLMs fare as quality evaluators when compared with human judgments on the SummEval and USR datasets, asking the model to generate both a score as well as a justification for the score. Furthermore, we explore the robustness of the LLM evaluator by using perturbed inputs. Our findings suggest that while LLMs show promise, their alignment with human evaluators is limited, they are not robust against perturbations and significant improvements are required for their standalone use as reliable evaluators for subjective metrics.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Visual-motor policy learning has advanced with architectures like diffusion-based policies, known for modeling complex robotic trajectories. However, their prolonged inference times hinder high-frequency control tasks requiring real-time feedback. While consistency distillation (CD) accelerates inference, it introduces errors that compromise action quality. To address these limitations, we propose the Score and Distribution Matching Policy (SDM Policy), which transforms diffusion-based policies into single-step generators through a two-stage optimization process: score matching ensures alignment with true action distributions, and distribution matching minimizes KL divergence for consistency. A dual-teacher mechanism integrates a frozen teacher for stability and an unfrozen teacher for adversarial training, enhancing robustness and alignment with target distributions. Evaluated on a 57-task simulation benchmark, SDM Policy achieves a 6x inference speedup while having state-of-the-art action quality, providing an efficient and reliable framework for high-frequency robotic tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks require identifying the relationship between sentence pairs, typically classified as entailment, contradiction, or neutrality. While the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, Entailment Few-Shot Learning (EFL), achieves a 93.1% accuracy on the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset, further advancements are constrained by the dataset's limitations. To address this, we propose a novel approach leveraging synthetic data augmentation to enhance dataset diversity and complexity. We present UnitedSynT5, an advanced extension of EFL that leverages a T5-based generator to synthesize additional premise-hypothesis pairs, which are rigorously cleaned and integrated into the training data. These augmented examples are processed within the EFL framework, embedding labels directly into hypotheses for consistency. We train a GTR-T5-XL model on this expanded dataset, achieving a new benchmark of 94.7% accuracy on the SNLI dataset, 94.01% accuracy on the E-SNLI dataset, and 92.57% accuracy on the MultiNLI dataset, surpassing the previous SOTA models. This research demonstrates the potential of synthetic data augmentation in improving NLI models, offering a path forward for further advancements in natural language understanding tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Most graph contrastive learning (GCL) methods heavily rely on cross-view contrast, thus facing several concomitant challenges, such as the complexity of designing effective augmentations, the potential for information loss between views, and increased computational costs. To mitigate reliance on cross-view contrasts, we propose \ttt{SIGNA}, a novel single-view graph contrastive learning framework. Regarding the inconsistency between structural connection and semantic similarity of neighborhoods, we resort to soft neighborhood awareness for GCL. Specifically, we leverage dropout to obtain structurally-related yet randomly-noised embedding pairs for neighbors, which serve as potential positive samples. At each epoch, the role of partial neighbors is switched from positive to negative, leading to probabilistic neighborhood contrastive learning effect. Furthermore, we propose a normalized Jensen-Shannon divergence estimator for a better effect of contrastive learning. Surprisingly, experiments on diverse node-level tasks demonstrate that our simple single-view GCL framework consistently outperforms existing methods by margins of up to 21.74% (PPI). In particular, with soft neighborhood awareness, SIGNA can adopt MLPs instead of complicated GCNs as the encoder to generate representations in transductive learning tasks, thus speeding up its inference process by 109 times to 331 times.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), web developers increasingly apply their code-generation capabilities to website design. However, since these models are trained on existing designerly knowledge, they may inadvertently replicate bad or even illegal practices, especially deceptive designs (DD). This paper examines whether users can accidentally create DD for a fictitious webshop using GPT-4. We recruited 20 participants, asking them to use ChatGPT to generate functionalities (product overview or checkout) and then modify these using neutral prompts to meet a business goal (e.g., "increase the likelihood of us selling our product"). We found that all 20 generated websites contained at least one DD pattern (mean: 5, max: 9), with GPT-4 providing no warnings. When reflecting on the designs, only 4 participants expressed concerns, while most considered the outcomes satisfactory and not morally problematic, despite the potential ethical and legal implications for end-users and those adopting ChatGPT's recommendations

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> When can the input of a ReLU neural network be inferred from its output? In other words, when is the network injective? We consider a single layer, $x \mapsto \mathrm{ReLU}(Wx)$, with a random Gaussian $m \times n$ matrix $W$, in a high-dimensional setting where $n, m \to \infty$. Recent work connects this problem to spherical integral geometry giving rise to a conjectured sharp injectivity threshold for $\alpha = \frac{m}{n}$ by studying the expected Euler characteristic of a certain random set. We adopt a different perspective and show that injectivity is equivalent to a property of the ground state of the spherical perceptron, an important spin glass model in statistical physics. By leveraging the (non-rigorous) replica symmetry-breaking theory, we derive analytical equations for the threshold whose solution is at odds with that from the Euler characteristic. Furthermore, we use Gordon's min--max theorem to prove that a replica-symmetric upper bound refutes the Euler characteristic prediction. Along the way we aim to give a tutorial-style introduction to key ideas from statistical physics in an effort to make the exposition accessible to a broad audience. Our analysis establishes a connection between spin glasses and integral geometry but leaves open the problem of explaining the discrepancies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is computationally intensive because it requires updating all parameters. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) improves efficiency by modifying only a subset of weights but introduces a trade-off between expressivity and computational cost: lower ranks reduce resources but limit expressiveness, while higher ranks enhance expressivity at increased cost. Despite recent advances in adaptive LoRA techniques, existing methods fail to provide a theoretical basis for optimizing the trade-off between model performance and efficiency. We propose Geometric Low-Rank Adaptation (GeLoRA), a novel framework that computes the intrinsic dimensionality of hidden state representations to adaptively select LoRA ranks. We demonstrate that the intrinsic dimension provides a lower bound for the optimal rank of LoRA matrices, allowing for a principled selection that balances efficiency and expressivity. GeLoRA dynamically adjusts the rank for each layer based on the intrinsic dimensionality of its input and output representations, recognizing that not all model parameters equally impact fine-tuning. Empirical validation on multiple tasks shows that GeLoRA consistently outperforms recent baselines within the same parameter budget.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a research field that aims to estimate a student's knowledge state through learning interactions-a crucial component of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs). Despite significant advancements, no current KT models excel in both predictive accuracy and interpretability. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs), pre-trained on vast natural language datasets, have emerged as powerful tools with immense potential in various educational applications. This systematic review explores the intersections, opportunities, and challenges of combining KT models and LLMs in educational contexts. The review first investigates LLM applications in education, including their adaptability to domain-specific content and ability to support personalized learning. It then examines the development and current state of KT models, from traditional to advanced approaches, aiming to uncover potential challenges that LLMs could mitigate. The core of this review focuses on integrating LLMs with KT, exploring three primary functions: addressing general concerns in KT fields, overcoming specific KT model limitations, and performing as KT models themselves. Our findings reveal that LLMs can be customized for specific educational tasks through tailor-making techniques such as in-context learning and agent-based approaches, effectively managing complex and unbalanced educational data. These models can enhance existing KT models' performance and solve cold-start problems by generating relevant features from question data. However, both current models depend heavily on structured, limited datasets, missing opportunities to use diverse educational data that could offer deeper insights into individual learners and support various educational settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Resource leaks, caused by resources not being released after acquisition, often lead to performance issues and system crashes. Existing static detection techniques rely on mechanical matching of predefined resource acquisition/release APIs and null-checking conditions to find unreleased resources, suffering from both (1) false negatives caused by the incompleteness of predefined resource acquisition/release APIs and (2) false positives caused by the incompleteness of resource reachability validation identification. To overcome these challenges, we propose InferROI, a novel approach that leverages the exceptional code comprehension capability of large language models (LLMs) to directly infer resource-oriented intentions (acquisition, release, and reachability validation) in code. InferROI first prompts the LLM to infer involved intentions for a given code snippet, and then incorporates a two-stage static analysis approach to check control-flow paths for resource leak detection based on the inferred intentions.   We evaluate the effectiveness of InferROI in both resource-oriented intention inference and resource leak detection. Experimental results on the DroidLeaks and JLeaks datasets demonstrate InferROI achieves promising bug detection rate (59.3% and 62.5%) and false alarm rate (18.6% and 19.5%). Compared to three industrial static detectors, InferROI detects 14~45 and 149~485 more bugs in DroidLeaks and JLeaks, respectively. When applied to real-world open-source projects, InferROI identifies 29 unknown resource leak bugs (verified by authors), with 7 of them being confirmed by developers. In addition, the results of an ablation study underscores the importance of combining LLM-based inference with static analysis.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Satire detection is essential for accurately extracting opinions from textual data and combating misinformation online. However, the lack of diverse corpora for satire leads to the problem of stylistic bias which impacts the models' detection performances. This study proposes a debiasing approach for satire detection, focusing on reducing biases in training data by utilizing generative large language models. The approach is evaluated in both cross-domain (irony detection) and cross-lingual (English) settings. Results show that the debiasing method enhances the robustness and generalizability of the models for satire and irony detection tasks in Turkish and English. However, its impact on causal language models, such as Llama-3.1, is limited. Additionally, this work curates and presents the Turkish Satirical News Dataset with detailed human annotations, with case studies on classification, debiasing, and explainability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention in recommendation systems. Current LLM-based recommender systems primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train the model for recommendation tasks. However, relying solely on positive samples limits the model's ability to align with user satisfaction and expectations. To address this, researchers have introduced Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which explicitly aligns recommendations with user preferences using offline preference ranking data. Despite its advantages, our theoretical analysis reveals that DPO inherently biases the model towards a few items, exacerbating the filter bubble issue and ultimately degrading user experience. In this paper, we propose SPRec, a novel self-play recommendation framework designed to mitigate over-recommendation and improve fairness without requiring additional data or manual intervention. In each self-play iteration, the model undergoes an SFT step followed by a DPO step, treating offline interaction data as positive samples and the predicted outputs from the previous iteration as negative samples. This effectively re-weights the DPO loss function using the model's logits, adaptively suppressing biased items. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate SPRec's effectiveness in enhancing recommendation accuracy and addressing fairness concerns.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The believable simulation of multi-user behavior is crucial for understanding complex social systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs)-based AI agents have made significant progress, enabling them to achieve human-like intelligence across various tasks. However, real human societies are often dynamic and complex, involving numerous individuals engaging in multimodal interactions. In this paper, taking e-commerce scenarios as an example, we present LMAgent, a very large-scale and multimodal agents society based on multimodal LLMs. In LMAgent, besides freely chatting with friends, the agents can autonomously browse, purchase, and review products, even perform live streaming e-commerce. To simulate this complex system, we introduce a self-consistency prompting mechanism to augment agents' multimodal capabilities, resulting in significantly improved decision-making performance over the existing multi-agent system. Moreover, we propose a fast memory mechanism combined with the small-world model to enhance system efficiency, which supports more than 10,000 agent simulations in a society. Experiments on agents' behavior show that these agents achieve comparable performance to humans in behavioral indicators. Furthermore, compared with the existing LLMs-based multi-agent system, more different and valuable phenomena are exhibited, such as herd behavior, which demonstrates the potential of LMAgent in credible large-scale social behavior simulations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The goal of uplift modeling is to recommend actions that optimize specific outcomes by determining which entities should receive treatment. One common approach involves two steps: first, an inference step that estimates conditional average treatment effects (CATEs), and second, an optimization step that ranks entities based on their CATE values and assigns treatment to the top k within a given budget. While uplift modeling typically focuses on binary treatments, many real-world applications are characterized by continuous-valued treatments, i.e., a treatment dose. This paper presents a predict-then-optimize framework to allow for continuous treatments in uplift modeling. First, in the inference step, conditional average dose responses (CADRs) are estimated from data using causal machine learning techniques. Second, in the optimization step, we frame the assignment task of continuous treatments as a dose-allocation problem and solve it using integer linear programming (ILP). This approach allows decision-makers to efficiently and effectively allocate treatment doses while balancing resource availability, with the possibility of adding extra constraints like fairness considerations or adapting the objective function to take into account instance-dependent costs and benefits to maximize utility. The experiments compare several CADR estimators and illustrate the trade-offs between policy value and fairness, as well as the impact of an adapted objective function. This showcases the framework's advantages and flexibility across diverse applications in healthcare, lending, and human resource management. All code is available on github.com/SimonDeVos/UMCT.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While there is a rich literature on robust methodologies for contamination in continuously distributed data, contamination in categorical data is largely overlooked. This is regrettable because many datasets are categorical and oftentimes suffer from contamination. Examples include inattentive responding and bot responses in questionnaires or zero-inflated count data. We propose a novel class of contamination-robust estimators of models for categorical data, coined $C$-estimators (``$C$'' for categorical). We show that the countable and possibly finite sample space of categorical data results in non-standard theoretical properties. Notably, in contrast to classic robustness theory, $C$-estimators can be simultaneously robust \textit{and} fully efficient at the postulated model. In addition, a certain particularly robust specification fails to be asymptotically Gaussian at the postulated model, but is asymptotically Gaussian in the presence of contamination. We furthermore propose a diagnostic test to identify categorical outliers and demonstrate the enhanced robustness of $C$-estimators in a simulation study.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces PowerInfer, a high-speed Large Language Model (LLM) inference engine on a personal computer (PC) equipped with a single consumer-grade GPU. The key principle underlying the design of PowerInfer is exploiting the high locality inherent in LLM inference, characterized by a power-law distribution in neuron activation. This distribution indicates that a small subset of neurons, termed hot neurons, are consistently activated across inputs, while the majority, cold neurons, vary based on specific inputs. PowerInfer exploits such an insight to design a GPU-CPU hybrid inference engine: hot-activated neurons are preloaded onto the GPU for fast access, while cold-activated neurons are computed on the CPU, thus significantly reducing GPU memory demands and CPU-GPU data transfers. PowerInfer further integrates adaptive predictors and neuron-aware sparse operators, optimizing the efficiency of neuron activation and computational sparsity. The evaluation shows that PowerInfer significantly outperforms llama.cpp by up to 11.69x while retaining model accuracy across various LLMs (including OPT-175B) on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU. For the OPT-30B model, PowerInfer achieves performance comparable to that of a high-end server-grade A100 GPU, reaching 82% of its token generation rate on a single consumer-grade RTX 4090 GPU.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurate camera motion estimation is essential for recovering global human motion in world coordinates from RGB video inputs. SLAM is widely used for estimating camera trajectory and point cloud, but monocular SLAM does so only up to an unknown scale factor. Previous works estimate the scale factor through optimization, but this is unreliable and time-consuming. This paper presents an optimization-free scale calibration framework, Human as Checkerboard (HAC). HAC innovatively leverages the human body predicted by human mesh recovery model as a calibration reference. Specifically, it uses the absolute depth of human-scene contact joints as references to calibrate the corresponding relative scene depth from SLAM. HAC benefits from geometric priors encoded in human mesh recovery models to estimate the SLAM scale and achieves precise global human motion estimation. Simple yet powerful, our method sets a new state-of-the-art performance for global human mesh estimation tasks, reducing motion errors by 50% over prior local-to-global methods while using 100$\times$ less inference time than optimization-based methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) on smartphones enable real-time AI assistance and privacy-preserving, offline operation. However, resource constraints of smartphones limit current deployments to small language models (SLMs), significantly compromising their capabilities. This paper introduces PowerInfer-2, a smartphone-based framework that enables fast inference for LLMs exceeding the memory capacity. The key insight is decomposing matrix operations into neuron clusters as the basic processing unit, which enables flexible scheduling and efficient I/O-computation pipelining. PowerInfer-2 leverages this neuron-cluster-based design in both computation and storage. For computation, neuron clusters with dense activations are processed on NPU, while sparse clusters use CPU. The storage engine provides a fine-grained pipeline mechanism that coordinates cluster-level computation and I/O operations, enhanced by a segmented neuron cache to reduce I/O activities. PowerInfer-2 achieves up to a 27.8x speed increase compared to state-of-the-art frameworks. PowerInfer-2 is the first system to serve a 47B LLM on a smartphone, achieving 11.68 tokens/s. Notably, these performance improvements preserve model quality with negligible accuracy degradation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for robotics applications, particularly task planning, by harnessing their language comprehension and text generation capabilities. However, in applications such as household robotics, a critical gap remains in the personalization of these models to individual user preferences. We introduce LLM-Personalize, a novel framework with an optimization pipeline designed to personalize LLM planners for household robotics. Our LLM-Personalize framework features an LLM planner that performs iterative planning in multi-room, partially-observable household scenarios, making use of a scene graph constructed with local observations. The generated plan consists of a sequence of high-level actions which are subsequently executed by a controller. Central to our approach is the optimization pipeline, which combines imitation learning and iterative self-training to personalize the LLM planner. In particular, the imitation learning phase performs initial LLM alignment from demonstrations, and bootstraps the model to facilitate effective iterative self-training, which further explores and aligns the model to user preferences. We evaluate LLM-Personalize on Housekeep, a challenging simulated real-world 3D benchmark for household rearrangements, and show that LLM-Personalize achieves more than a 30 percent increase in success rate over existing LLM planners, showcasing significantly improved alignment with human preferences.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Chain-of-thought emerges as a promising technique for eliciting reasoning capabilities from Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it does not always improve task performance or accurately represent reasoning processes, leaving unresolved questions about its usage. In this paper, we diagnose the underlying mechanism by comparing the reasoning process of LLMs with humans, using causal analysis to understand the relationships between the problem instruction, reasoning, and the answer in LLMs. Our empirical study reveals that LLMs often deviate from the ideal causal chain, resulting in spurious correlations and potential consistency errors (inconsistent reasoning and answers). We also examine various factors influencing the causal structure, finding that in-context learning with examples strengthens it, while post-training techniques like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on human feedback weaken it. To our surprise, the causal structure cannot be strengthened by enlarging the model size only, urging research on new techniques. We hope that this preliminary study will shed light on understanding and improving the reasoning process in LLM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation, with applications broadening across various domains. Inpainting is one such application that can benefit significantly from diffusion models. Existing methods either hijack the reverse process of a pretrained diffusion model or cast the problem into a larger framework, \ie, conditioned generation. However, these approaches often require nested loops in the generation process or additional components for conditioning. In this paper, we present region-aware diffusion models (RAD) for inpainting with a simple yet effective reformulation of the vanilla diffusion models. RAD utilizes a different noise schedule for each pixel, which allows local regions to be generated asynchronously while considering the global image context. A plain reverse process requires no additional components, enabling RAD to achieve inference time up to 100 times faster than the state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we employ low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune RAD based on other pretrained diffusion models, reducing computational burdens in training as well. Experiments demonstrated that RAD provides state-of-the-art results both qualitatively and quantitatively, on the FFHQ, LSUN Bedroom, and ImageNet datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Activation sparsity refers to the existence of considerable weakly-contributed elements among activation outputs. As a prevalent property of the models using the ReLU activation function, activation sparsity has been proven a promising paradigm to boost model inference efficiency. Nevertheless, most large language models (LLMs) adopt activation functions without intrinsic activation sparsity (e.g., GELU and Swish). Some recent efforts have explored introducing ReLU or its variants as the substitutive activation function to help LLMs achieve activation sparsity and inference acceleration, but few can simultaneously obtain high sparsity and comparable model performance. This paper introduces a simple and effective sparsification method named "ProSparse" to push LLMs for higher activation sparsity while maintaining comparable performance. Specifically, after substituting the activation function of LLMs with ReLU, ProSparse adopts progressive sparsity regularization with a factor smoothly increasing along the multi-stage sine curves. This can enhance activation sparsity and mitigate performance degradation by avoiding radical shifts in activation distributions. With ProSparse, we obtain high sparsity of 89.32% for LLaMA2-7B, 88.80% for LLaMA2-13B, and 87.89% for end-size MiniCPM-1B, respectively, achieving comparable performance to their original Swish-activated versions. These present the most sparsely activated models among open-source LLaMA versions and competitive end-size models, considerably surpassing ReluLLaMA-7B (66.98%) and ReluLLaMA-13B (71.56%). Our inference acceleration experiments further demonstrate the significant practical acceleration potential of LLMs with higher activation sparsity, obtaining up to 4.52$\times$ inference speedup.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has streamlined frontend interface creation through tools like Vercel's V0, yet surfaced challenges in design quality (e.g., accessibility, and usability). Current solutions, often limited by their focus, generalisability, or data dependency, fall short in addressing these complexities. Moreover, none of them examine the quality of LLM-generated UI design. In this work, we introduce DesignRepair, a novel dual-stream design guideline-aware system to examine and repair the UI design quality issues from both code aspect and rendered page aspect. We utilised the mature and popular Material Design as our knowledge base to guide this process. Specifically, we first constructed a comprehensive knowledge base encoding Google's Material Design principles into low-level component knowledge base and high-level system design knowledge base. After that, DesignRepair employs a LLM for the extraction of key components and utilizes the Playwright tool for precise page analysis, aligning these with the established knowledge bases. Finally, we integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation with state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 to holistically refine and repair frontend code through a strategic divide and conquer approach. Our extensive evaluations validated the efficacy and utility of our approach, demonstrating significant enhancements in adherence to design guidelines, accessibility, and user experience metrics.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, radiance field rendering, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), has shown immense potential in VR content creation due to its high-quality rendering and efficient production process. However, existing physics-based interaction systems for 3DGS can only perform simple and non-realistic simulations or demand extensive user input for complex scenes, primarily due to the absence of scene understanding. In this paper, we propose LIVE-GS, a highly realistic interactive VR system powered by LLM. After object-aware GS reconstruction, we prompt GPT-4o to analyze the physical properties of objects in the scene, which are used to guide physical simulations consistent with real phenomena. We also design a GPT-assisted GS inpainting module to fill the unseen area covered by manipulative objects. To perform a precise segmentation of Gaussian kernels, we propose a feature-mask segmentation strategy. To enable rich interaction, we further propose a computationally efficient physical simulation framework through an PBD-based unified interpolation method, supporting various physical forms such as rigid body, soft body, and granular materials. Our experimental results show that with the help of LLM's understanding and enhancement of scenes, our VR system can support complex and realistic interactions without additional manual design and annotation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Following formatting instructions to generate well-structured content is a fundamental yet often unmet capability for large language models (LLMs). To study this capability, which we refer to as format faithfulness, we present FormatBench, a comprehensive format-related benchmark. Compared to previous format-related benchmarks, FormatBench involves a greater variety of tasks in terms of application scenes (traditional NLP tasks, creative works, autonomous agency tasks), human-LLM interaction styles (single-turn instruction, multi-turn chat), and format types (inclusion, wrapping, length, coding). Moreover, each task in FormatBench is attached with a format checker program. Extensive experiments on the benchmark reveal that state-of-the-art open- and closed-source LLMs still suffer from severe deficiency in format faithfulness. By virtue of the decidable nature of formats, we propose to Reinforce Format Faithfulness (ReFF) to help LLMs generate formatted output as instructed without compromising general quality. Without any annotated data, ReFF can substantially improve the format faithfulness rate (e.g., from 21.6% in original LLaMA3 to 95.0% on caption segmentation task), while keep the general quality comparable (e.g., from 47.3 to 46.4 in F1 scores). Combined with labeled training data, ReFF can simultaneously improve both format faithfulness (e.g., from 21.6% in original LLaMA3 to 75.5%) and general quality (e.g., from 47.3 to 61.6 in F1 scores). We further offer an interpretability analysis to explain how ReFF improves both format faithfulness and general quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text-to-image (T2I) models can effectively capture the content or style of reference images to perform high-quality customization. A representative technique for this is fine-tuning using low-rank adaptations (LoRA), which enables efficient model customization with reference images. However, fine-tuning with a limited number of reference images often leads to overfitting, resulting in issues such as prompt misalignment or content leakage. These issues prevent the model from accurately following the input prompt or generating undesired objects during inference. To address this problem, we examine the text embeddings that guide the diffusion model during inference. This study decomposes the text embedding matrix and conducts a component analysis to understand the embedding space geometry and identify the cause of overfitting. Based on this, we propose DECOR, which projects text embeddings onto a vector space orthogonal to undesired token vectors, thereby reducing the influence of unwanted semantics in the text embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate that DECOR outperforms state-of-the-art customization models and achieves Pareto frontier performance across text and visual alignment evaluation metrics. Furthermore, it generates images more faithful to the input prompts, showcasing its effectiveness in addressing overfitting and enhancing text-to-image customization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Background. Endowing intelligent systems with semantic data commonly requires designing and instantiating ontologies with domain-specific knowledge. Especially in the early phases, those activities are typically performed manually by human experts possibly leveraging on their own experience. The resulting process is therefore time-consuming, error-prone, and often biased by the personal background of the ontology designer. Objective. To mitigate that issue, we propose a novel domain-independent approach to automatically instantiate ontologies with domain-specific knowledge, by leveraging on large language models (LLMs) as oracles. Method. Starting from (i) an initial schema composed by inter-related classes and properties and (ii) a set of query templates, our method queries the LLM multiple times, and generates instances for both classes and properties from its replies. Thus, the ontology is automatically filled with domain-specific knowledge, compliant to the initial schema. As a result, the ontology is quickly and automatically enriched with manifold instances, which experts may consider to keep, adjust, discard, or complement according to their own needs and expertise. Contribution. We formalise our method in general way and instantiate it over various LLMs, as well as on a concrete case study. We report experiments rooted in the nutritional domain where an ontology of food meals and their ingredients is automatically instantiated from scratch, starting from a categorisation of meals and their relationships. There, we analyse the quality of the generated ontologies and compare ontologies attained by exploiting different LLMs. Experimentally, our approach achieves a quality metric that is up to five times higher than the state-of-the-art, while reducing erroneous entities and relations by up to ten times. Finally, we provide a SWOT analysis of the proposed method.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper is concerned with a Bayesian approach to testing hypotheses in statistical inverse problems. Based on the posterior distribution $\Pi \left(\cdot |Y = y\right)$, we want to infer whether a feature $\langle\varphi, u^\dagger\rangle$ of the unknown quantity of interest $u^\dagger$ is positive. This can be done by the so-called maximum a posteriori test. We provide a frequentistic analysis of this test's properties such as level and power, and prove that it is a regularized test in the sense of Kretschmann et al. (2024). Furthermore we provide lower bounds for its power under classical spectral source conditions in case of Gaussian priors. Numerical simulations illustrate its superior performance both in moderately and severely ill-posed situations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Robots reason about the environment through dedicated representations. Popular choices for dense representations exploit Truncated Signed Distance Functions (TSDF) and Octree data structures. However, TSDF provides a projective or non-projective signed distance obtained directly from depth measurements that overestimate the Euclidean distance. Octrees, despite being memory efficient, require tree traversal and can lead to increased runtime in large scenarios. Other representations based on the Gaussian Process (GP) distance fields are appealing due to their probabilistic and continuous nature, but the computational complexity is a concern. In this paper, we present an online efficient mapping framework that seamlessly couples GP distance fields and the fast-access OpenVDB data structure. The key aspect is a latent Local GP Signed Distance Field (L-GPDF) contained in a local VDB structure that allows fast queries of the Euclidean distance, surface properties and their uncertainties for arbitrary points in the field of view. Probabilistic fusion is then performed by merging the inferred values of these points into a global VDB structure that is efficiently maintained over time. After fusion, the surface mesh is recovered, and a global GP Signed Distance Field (G-GPDF) is generated and made available for downstream applications to query accurate distance and gradients. A comparison with the state-of-the-art frameworks shows superior efficiency and accuracy of the inferred distance field and comparable reconstruction performance. https://github.com/UTS-RI/VDB_GPDF

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text embedding has become a foundational technology in natural language processing (NLP) during the deep learning era, driving advancements across a wide array of downstream tasks. While many natural language understanding challenges can now be modeled using generative paradigms and leverage the robust generative and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs), numerous practical applications, such as semantic matching, clustering, and information retrieval, continue to rely on text embeddings for their efficiency and effectiveness. In this survey, we categorize the interplay between LLMs and text embeddings into three overarching themes: (1) LLM-augmented text embedding, enhancing traditional embedding methods with LLMs; (2) LLMs as text embedders, utilizing their innate capabilities for embedding generation; and (3) Text embedding understanding with LLMs, leveraging LLMs to analyze and interpret embeddings. By organizing these efforts based on interaction patterns rather than specific downstream applications, we offer a novel and systematic overview of contributions from various research and application domains in the era of LLMs. Furthermore, we highlight the unresolved challenges that persisted in the pre-LLM era with pre-trained language models (PLMs) and explore the emerging obstacles brought forth by LLMs. Building on this analysis, we outline prospective directions for the evolution of text embedding, addressing both theoretical and practical opportunities in the rapidly advancing landscape of NLP.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Dynamic latent space models are widely used for characterizing changes in networks and relational data over time. These models assign to each node latent attributes that characterize connectivity with other nodes, with these latent attributes dynamically changing over time. Node attributes can be organized as a three-way tensor with modes corresponding to nodes, latent space dimension, and time. Unfortunately, as the number of nodes and time points increases, the number of elements of this tensor becomes enormous, leading to computational and statistical challenges, particularly when data are sparse. We propose a new approach for massively reducing dimensionality by expressing the latent node attribute tensor as low rank. This leads to an interesting new nested exemplar latent space model, which characterizes the node attribute tensor as dependent on low-dimensional exemplar traits for each node, weights for each latent space dimension, and exemplar curves characterizing time variation. We study properties of this framework, including expressivity, and develop efficient Bayesian inference algorithms. The approach leads to substantial advantages in simulations and applications to ecological networks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various tasks using the in-context learning (ICL) paradigm. However, their effectiveness is often compromised by inherent bias, leading to prompt brittleness, i.e., sensitivity to design settings such as example selection, order, and prompt formatting. Previous studies have addressed LLM bias through external adjustment of model outputs, but the internal mechanisms that lead to such bias remain unexplored. Our work delves into these mechanisms, particularly investigating how feedforward neural networks (FFNs) and attention heads result in the bias of LLMs. By Interpreting the contribution of individual FFN vectors and attention heads, we identify the biased LLM components that skew LLMs' prediction toward specific labels. To mitigate these biases, we introduce UniBias, an inference-only method that effectively identifies and eliminates biased FFN vectors and attention heads. Extensive experiments across 12 NLP datasets demonstrate that UniBias significantly enhances ICL performance and alleviates prompt brittleness of LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has relied on specific combinations of herbs in prescriptions to treat various symptoms and signs for thousands of years. Predicting TCM prescriptions poses a fascinating technical challenge with significant practical implications. However, this task faces limitations due to the scarcity of high-quality clinical datasets and the complex relationship between symptoms and herbs. To address these issues, we introduce \textit{DigestDS}, a novel dataset comprising practical medical records from experienced experts in digestive system diseases. We also propose a method, TCM-FTP (TCM Fine-Tuning Pre-trained), to leverage pre-trained large language models (LLMs) via supervised fine-tuning on \textit{DigestDS}. Additionally, we enhance computational efficiency using a low-rank adaptation technique. Moreover, TCM-FTP incorporates data augmentation by permuting herbs within prescriptions, exploiting their order-agnostic nature. Impressively, TCM-FTP achieves an F1-score of 0.8031, significantly outperforming previous methods. Furthermore, it demonstrates remarkable accuracy in dosage prediction, achieving a normalized mean square error of 0.0604. In contrast, LLMs without fine-tuning exhibit poor performance. Although LLMs have demonstrated wide-ranging capabilities, our work underscores the necessity of fine-tuning for TCM prescription prediction and presents an effective way to accomplish this.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text-to-image diffusion model is a popular paradigm that synthesizes personalized images by providing a text prompt and a random Gaussian noise. While people observe that some noises are ``golden noises'' that can achieve better text-image alignment and higher human preference than others, we still lack a machine learning framework to obtain those golden noises. To learn golden noises for diffusion sampling, we mainly make three contributions in this paper. First, we identify a new concept termed the \textit{noise prompt}, which aims at turning a random Gaussian noise into a golden noise by adding a small desirable perturbation derived from the text prompt. Following the concept, we first formulate the \textit{noise prompt learning} framework that systematically learns ``prompted'' golden noise associated with a text prompt for diffusion models. Second, we design a noise prompt data collection pipeline and collect a large-scale \textit{noise prompt dataset}~(NPD) that contains 100k pairs of random noises and golden noises with the associated text prompts. With the prepared NPD as the training dataset, we trained a small \textit{noise prompt network}~(NPNet) that can directly learn to transform a random noise into a golden noise. The learned golden noise perturbation can be considered as a kind of prompt for noise, as it is rich in semantic information and tailored to the given text prompt. Third, our extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive effectiveness and generalization of NPNet on improving the quality of synthesized images across various diffusion models, including SDXL, DreamShaper-xl-v2-turbo, and Hunyuan-DiT. Moreover, NPNet is a small and efficient controller that acts as a plug-and-play module with very limited additional inference and computational costs, as it just provides a golden noise instead of a random noise without accessing the original pipeline.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid advancement of Language Model technologies has opened new opportunities, but also introduced new challenges related to bias and fairness. This paper explores the uncharted territory of potential biases in state-of-the-art universal text embedding models towards specific document and query writing styles within Information Retrieval (IR) systems. Our investigation reveals that different embedding models exhibit different preferences of document writing style, while more informal and emotive styles are less favored by most embedding models. In terms of query writing styles, many embedding models tend to match the style of the query with the style of the retrieved documents, but some show a consistent preference for specific styles. Text embedding models fine-tuned on synthetic data generated by LLMs display a consistent preference for certain style of generated data. These biases in text embedding based IR systems can inadvertently silence or marginalize certain communication styles, thereby posing a significant threat to fairness in information retrieval. Finally, we also compare the answer styles of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems based on different LLMs and find out that most text embedding models are biased towards LLM's answer styles when used as evaluation metrics for answer correctness. This study sheds light on the critical issue of writing style based bias in IR systems, offering valuable insights for the development of more fair and robust models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Computed tomography from a low radiation dose (LDCT) is challenging due to high noise in the projection data. Popular approaches for LDCT image reconstruction are two-stage methods, typically consisting of the filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm followed by a neural network for LDCT image enhancement. Two-stage methods are attractive for their simplicity and potential for computational efficiency, typically requiring only a single FBP and a neural network forward pass for inference. However, the best reconstruction quality is currently achieved by unrolled iterative methods (Learned Primal-Dual and ItNet), which are more complex and thus have a higher computational cost for training and inference. We propose a method combining the simplicity and efficiency of two-stage methods with state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. Our strategy utilizes a neural network pretrained for Gaussian noise removal from natural grayscale images, fine-tuned for LDCT image enhancement. We call this method FBP-DTSGD (Domain and Task Shifted Gaussian Denoisers) as the fine-tuning is a task shift from Gaussian denoising to enhancing LDCT images and a domain shift from natural grayscale to LDCT images. An ablation study with three different pretrained Gaussian denoisers indicates that the performance of FBP-DTSGD does not depend on a specific denoising architecture, suggesting future advancements in Gaussian denoising could benefit the method. The study also shows that pretraining on natural images enhances LDCT reconstruction quality, especially with limited training data. Notably, pretraining involves no additional cost, as existing pretrained models are used. The proposed method currently holds the top mean position in the LoDoPaB-CT challenge.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Query answering over data with dependencies plays a central role in most applications of dependencies. The problem is commonly solved by using a suitable variant of the chase algorithm to compute a universal model of the dependencies and the data and thus explicate all knowledge implicit in the dependencies. After this preprocessing step, an arbitrary conjunctive query over the dependencies and the data can be answered by evaluating it the computed universal model. If, however, the query to be answered is fixed and known in advance, computing the universal model is often inefficient as many inferences made during this process can be irrelevant to a given query. In such cases, a goal-driven approach, which avoids drawing unnecessary inferences, promises to be more efficient and thus preferable in practice.   In this paper we present what we believe to be the first technique for goal-driven query answering over first- and second-order dependencies with equality reasoning. Our technique transforms the input dependencies so that applying the chase to the output avoids many inferences that are irrelevant to the query. The transformation proceeds in several steps, which comprise the following three novel techniques. First, we present a variant of the singularisation technique by Marnette [60] that is applicable to second-order dependencies and that corrects an incompleteness of a related formulation by ten Cate et al. [74]. Second, we present a relevance analysis technique that can eliminate from the input dependencies that provably do not contribute to query answers. Third, we present a variant of the magic sets algorithm [19] that can handle second-order dependencies with equality reasoning. We also present the results of an extensive empirical evaluation, which show that goal-driven query answering can be orders of magnitude faster than computing the full universal model.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> It is well known that LLM-based systems are data-hungry. Recent LLM-based TTS works typically employ complex data processing pipelines to obtain high-quality training data. These sophisticated pipelines require excellent models at each stage (e.g., speech denoising, speech enhancement, speaker diarization, and punctuation models), which themselves demand high-quality training data and are rarely open-sourced. Even with state-of-the-art models, issues persist, such as incomplete background noise removal and misalignment between punctuation and actual speech pauses. Moreover, the stringent filtering strategies often retain only 10-30\% of the original data, significantly impeding data scaling efforts. In this work, we leverage a noise-robust audio tokenizer (S3Tokenizer) to design a simplified yet effective TTS data processing pipeline that maintains data quality while substantially reducing data acquisition costs, achieving a data retention rate of over 50\%. Beyond data scaling challenges, LLM-based TTS systems also incur higher deployment costs compared to conventional approaches. Current systems typically use LLMs solely for text-to-token generation, while requiring separate models (e.g., flow matching models) for token-to-waveform generation, which cannot be directly executed by LLM inference engines, further complicating deployment. To address these challenges, we eliminate redundant modules in both LLM and flow components, replacing the flow model backbone with an LLM architecture. Building upon this simplified flow backbone, we propose a unified architecture for both streaming and non-streaming inference, significantly reducing deployment costs. Finally, we explore the feasibility of unifying TTS and ASR tasks using the same data for training, thanks to the simplified pipeline and the S3Tokenizer that reduces the quality requirements for TTS training data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Most static program analyses depend on Call Graphs (CGs), including reachability of security vulnerabilities. Static CGs ensure soundness through over-approximation, which results in inflated sizes and imprecision. Recent research has employed machine learning (ML) models to prune false edges and enhance CG precision. However, these models require real-world programs with high test coverage to generalize effectively and the inference is expensive. In this paper, we present OriginPruner, a novel call graph pruning technique that leverages the method origin, which is where a method signature is first introduced within a class hierarchy. By incorporating insights from a localness analysis that investigated the scope of method interactions into our approach, OriginPruner confidently identifies and prunes edges related to these origin methods. Our key findings reveal that (1) dominant origin methods, such as Iterator.next, significantly impact CG sizes; (2) derivatives of these origin methods are primarily local, enabling safe pruning without affecting downstream inter-procedural analyses; (3) OriginPruner achieves a significant reduction in CG size while maintaining the soundness of CGs for security applications like vulnerability propagation analysis; and (4) OriginPruner introduces minimal computational overhead. These findings underscore the potential of leveraging domain knowledge about the type system for more effective CG pruning, offering a promising direction for future work in static program analysis.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Complex Graph Patterns (CGPs), which combine pattern matching with relational operations, are widely used in real-world applications. Existing systems rely on monolithic architectures for CGPs, which restrict their ability to integrate multiple query languages and lack certain advanced optimization techniques. Therefore, to address these issues, we introduce GOpt, a modular graph-native query optimization framework with the following features: (1) support for queries in multiple query languages, (2) decoupling execution from specific graph systems, and (3) integration of advanced optimization techniques. Specifically, GOpt offers a high-level interface, GraphIrBuilder, for converting queries from various graph query languages into a unified intermediate representation (GIR), thereby streamlining the optimization process. It also provides a low-level interface, PhysicalSpec, enabling backends to register backend-specific physical operators and cost models. Moreover, GOpt employs a graph-native optimizer that encompasses extensive heuristic rules, an automatic type inference approach, and cost-based optimization techniques tailored for CGPs. Comprehensive experiments show that integrating GOpt significantly boosts performance, with Neo4j achieving an average speedup of 9.2 times (up to 48.6 times), and GraphsScope achieving an average speedup of 33.4 times (up to 78.7 times), on real-world datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Event cameras hold significant promise for high-temporal-resolution (HTR) motion estimation. However, estimating event-based HTR optical flow faces two key challenges: the absence of HTR ground-truth data and the intrinsic sparsity of event data. Most existing approaches rely on the flow accumulation paradigms to indirectly supervise intermediate flows, often resulting in accumulation errors and optimization difficulties. To address these challenges, we propose a residual-based paradigm for estimating HTR optical flow with event data. Our approach separates HTR flow estimation into two stages: global linear motion estimation and HTR residual flow refinement. The residual paradigm effectively mitigates the impacts of event sparsity on optimization and is compatible with any LTR algorithm. Next, to address the challenge posed by the absence of HTR ground truth, we incorporate novel learning strategies. Specifically, we initially employ a shared refiner to estimate the residual flows, enabling both LTR supervision and HTR inference. Subsequently, we introduce regional noise to simulate the residual patterns of intermediate flows, facilitating the adaptation from LTR supervision to HTR inference. Additionally, we show that the noise-based strategy supports in-domain self-supervised training. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in both LTR and HTR metrics, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Hubble expansion of the Universe is considered in the classical limit of a Big Bang quantum cosmology. In an IR-consistent coupling to the the bare cosmological constant, we infer a dark energy as a relic of the Big Bang by loss of time-translation invariance on a Hubble time-scale. This dark energy is identified with the trace $J$ of the Schouten tensor permitting an analytic solution $H(z)$. Anchored by the {\em Baryonic Accoustic Oscillations}, $J$CDM predicts a Hubble constant $H_0=\sqrt{6/5}\,H_0^\Lambda$ alleviating $H_0$-tension between the Local Distance Ladder and $H_0^\Lambda$ in $\Lambda$CDM, whose dark energy $\Lambda$ is a constant. Emulated by $w(a)\Lambda$CDM, a CAMB analysis shows a $J$CDM fit to the {\em Planck} 2018 $C_l^{TT}$ power spectrum on par with $\Lambda$CDM with small positive curvature consistent with {\em Planck}-$\Lambda$CDM with no extra relativistic degrees of freedom. In late-time cosmology, $J$CDM is also consistent with the BAO recently measured by DESI. { $J$CDM offers a novel framework to address $H_0$-tension, predicting background quantities consistent with the uncertainties in BAO measurements and early-Universe observations.} It predicts a deceleration parameter $q_0\simeq-1$, that may be tested with upcoming low-redshift galaxy surveys.

However, studies into their ability to switch between opposite styles of responses in professional domains remain underexplored. This study introduces a novel approach, named ProSwitch, which enables a language model to switch between professional and non-professional answers, by tuning and evaluating through the guidance of domain and style knowledge. ProSwitch unfolds in three phases: LLM-augmented preparation to collect domain knowledge and QA pairs, instruction tuning to optimize LLMs with multiple levels of knowledge, and comprehensive evaluation to assess both style discrimination and reference-based quality of the generated text. Comparative analysis of ProSwitch against general and specialized LLMs reveals that our approach outperforms baselines in switching between professional and non-professional responses.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) present massive inherent knowledge and superior semantic comprehension capability, which have revolutionized various tasks in natural language processing. Despite their success, a critical gap remains in enabling LLMs to perform knowledge graph completion (KGC). Empirical evidence suggests that LLMs consistently perform worse than conventional KGC approaches, even through sophisticated prompt design or tailored instruction-tuning. Fundamentally, applying LLMs on KGC introduces several critical challenges, including a vast set of entity candidates, hallucination issue of LLMs, and under-exploitation of the graph structure. To address these challenges, we propose a novel instruction-tuning-based method, namely FtG. Specifically, we present a \textit{filter-then-generate} paradigm and formulate the KGC task into a multiple-choice question format. In this way, we can harness the capability of LLMs while mitigating the issue casused by hallucinations. Moreover, we devise a flexible ego-graph serialization prompt and employ a structure-text adapter to couple structure and text information in a contextualized manner. Experimental results demonstrate that FtG achieves substantial performance gain compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. The instruction dataset and code are available at \url{https://github.com/LB0828/FtG}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current RLHF frameworks for aligning large language models (LLMs) typically assume a fixed prompt distribution, which is sub-optimal and limits the scalability of alignment and generalizability of models. To address this, we introduce a general open-ended RLHF framework that casts alignment as an asymmetric game between two players: (i) a creator that generates increasingly informative prompt distributions using reward signals, and (ii) a solver that learns to produce more preferred responses on prompts produced by the creator. This framework of Evolving Alignment via Asymmetric Self-Play (eva), results in a simple and efficient approach that can utilize any existing RLHF algorithm for scalable alignment. eva outperforms state-of-the-art methods on widely-used benchmarks, without the need of any additional human crafted prompts. Specifically, eva improves the win rate of Gemma-2-9B-it on Arena-Hard from 51.6% to 60.1% with DPO, from 55.7% to 58.9% with SPPO, from 52.3% to 60.7% with SimPO, and from 54.8% to 60.3% with ORPO, surpassing its 27B version and matching claude-3-opus. This improvement is persistent even when new human crafted prompts are introduced. Finally, we show eva is effective and robust under various ablation settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have facilitated the definition of autonomous intelligent agents. Such agents have already demonstrated their potential in solving complex tasks in different domains. And they can further increase their performance when collaborating with other agents in a multi-agent system. However, the orchestration and coordination of these agents is still challenging, especially when they need to interact with humans as part of human-agentic collaborative workflows. These kinds of workflows need to be precisely specified so that it is clear whose responsible for each task, what strategies agents can follow to complete individual tasks or how decisions will be taken when different alternatives are proposed, among others. Current business process modeling languages fall short when it comes to specifying these new mixed collaborative scenarios. In this exploratory paper, we extend a well-known process modeling language (i.e., BPMN) to enable the definition of this new type of workflow. Our extension covers both the formalization of the new metamodeling concepts required and the proposal of a BPMN-like graphical notation to facilitate the definition of these workflows. Our extension has been implemented and is available as an open-source human-agentic workflow modeling editor on GitHub.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Machine learning methods strive to acquire a robust model during the training process that can effectively generalize to test samples, even in the presence of distribution shifts. However, these methods often suffer from performance degradation due to unknown test distributions. Test-time adaptation (TTA), an emerging paradigm, has the potential to adapt a pre-trained model to unlabeled data during testing, before making predictions. Recent progress in this paradigm has highlighted the significant benefits of using unlabeled data to train self-adapted models prior to inference. In this survey, we categorize TTA into several distinct groups based on the form of test data, namely, test-time domain adaptation, test-time batch adaptation, and online test-time adaptation. For each category, we provide a comprehensive taxonomy of advanced algorithms and discuss various learning scenarios. Furthermore, we analyze relevant applications of TTA and discuss open challenges and promising areas for future research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities across various language tasks, but solving complex reasoning problems remains a challenge. While existing methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) enhance reasoning by decomposing problems or structuring prompts, they typically perform a single pass of reasoning and may fail to revisit flawed paths, compromising accuracy. To address this, we propose a novel reasoning framework called Forest-of-Thought (FoT), which integrates multiple reasoning trees to leverage collective decision-making for solving complex logical problems. FoT utilizes sparse activation strategies to select the most relevant reasoning paths, improving both efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic self-correction strategy that enables real-time error correction and learning from past mistakes, as well as consensus-guided decision making strategies to optimize correctness and computational resources. Experimental results demonstrate that the FoT framework, combined with these strategies, significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, enabling them to solve complex tasks with greater precision and efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Honour based abuse covers a wide range of family abuse including female genital mutilation and forced marriage. Safeguarding professionals need to identify where abuses are happening in their local community to best support those at risk of these crimes and take preventative action. However, there is little local data about these kinds of crime. To tackle this problem, we ran comparative judgement surveys to map abuses at local level, where participants where shown pairs of wards and asked which had a higher rate of honour based abuse. In previous comparative judgement studies, participants reported fatigue associated with comparisons between areas with similar levels of abuse. Allowing for tied comparisons reduces fatigue, but increase the computational complexity when fitting the model. We designed an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to fit a model with ties, allowing for a wide range of prior distributions on the model parameters. Working with South Yorkshire Police and Oxford Against Cutting, we mapped the risk of honour based abuse at community level in two counties in the UK.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Significant achievements in personalization of diffusion models have been witnessed. Conventional tuning-free methods mostly encode multiple reference images by averaging their image embeddings as the injection condition, but such an image-independent operation cannot perform interaction among images to capture consistent visual elements within multiple references. Although the tuning-based Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can effectively extract consistent elements within multiple images through the training process, it necessitates specific finetuning for each distinct image group. This paper introduces EasyRef, a novel plug-and-play adaptation method that enables diffusion models to be conditioned on multiple reference images and the text prompt. To effectively exploit consistent visual elements within multiple images, we leverage the multi-image comprehension and instruction-following capabilities of the multimodal large language model (MLLM), prompting it to capture consistent visual elements based on the instruction. Besides, injecting the MLLM's representations into the diffusion process through adapters can easily generalize to unseen domains, mining the consistent visual elements within unseen data. To mitigate computational costs and enhance fine-grained detail preservation, we introduce an efficient reference aggregation strategy and a progressive training scheme. Finally, we introduce MRBench, a new multi-reference image generation benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate EasyRef surpasses both tuning-free methods like IP-Adapter and tuning-based methods like LoRA, achieving superior aesthetic quality and robust zero-shot generalization across diverse domains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has extended to the multimodal domain, achieving outstanding performance in image understanding and generation. Recent efforts to develop unified Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that integrate these capabilities have shown promising results. However, existing approaches often involve complex designs in model architecture or training pipeline, increasing the difficulty of model training and scaling. In this paper, we propose SynerGen-VL, a simple yet powerful encoder-free MLLM capable of both image understanding and generation. To address challenges identified in existing encoder-free unified MLLMs, we introduce the token folding mechanism and the vision-expert-based progressive alignment pretraining strategy, which effectively support high-resolution image understanding while reducing training complexity. After being trained on large-scale mixed image-text data with a unified next-token prediction objective, SynerGen-VL achieves or surpasses the performance of existing encoder-free unified MLLMs with comparable or smaller parameter sizes, and narrows the gap with task-specific state-of-the-art models, highlighting a promising path toward future unified MLLMs. Our code and models shall be released.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video temporal grounding aims to localize relevant temporal boundaries in a video given a textual prompt. Recent work has focused on enabling Video LLMs to perform video temporal grounding via next-token prediction of temporal timestamps. However, accurately localizing timestamps in videos remains challenging for Video LLMs when relying solely on temporal token prediction. Our proposed TimeRefine addresses this challenge in two ways. First, instead of directly predicting the start and end timestamps, we reformulate the temporal grounding task as a temporal refining task: the model first makes rough predictions and then refines them by predicting offsets to the target segment. This refining process is repeated multiple times, through which the model progressively self-improves its temporal localization accuracy. Second, to enhance the model's temporal perception capabilities, we incorporate an auxiliary prediction head that penalizes the model more if a predicted segment deviates further from the ground truth, thus encouraging the model to make closer and more accurate predictions. Our plug-and-play method can be integrated into most LLM-based temporal grounding approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that TimeRefine achieves 3.6% and 5.0% mIoU improvements on the ActivityNet and Charades-STA datasets, respectively. Code and pretrained models will be released.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The standard practice for developing contemporary MLLMs is to feed features from vision encoder(s) into the LLM and train with natural language supervision. In this work, we posit an overlooked opportunity to optimize the intermediate LLM representations through a vision perspective (objective), i.e., solely natural language supervision is sub-optimal for the MLLM's visual understanding ability. To that end, we propose OLA-VLM, the first approach distilling knowledge into the LLM's hidden representations from a set of target visual representations. Firstly, we formulate the objective during the pretraining stage in MLLMs as a coupled optimization of predictive visual embedding and next text-token prediction. Secondly, we investigate MLLMs trained solely with natural language supervision and identify a positive correlation between the quality of visual representations within these models and their downstream performance. Moreover, upon probing our OLA-VLM, we observe improved representation quality owing to the embedding optimization. Thirdly, we demonstrate that our OLA-VLM outperforms the single and multi-encoder baselines, proving our approach's superiority over explicitly feeding the corresponding features to the LLM. Particularly, OLA-VLM boosts performance by an average margin of up to 2.5% on various benchmarks, with a notable improvement of 8.7% on the Depth task in CV-Bench.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper describes a semi-automatic pipeline to generate challenging question-answer-decoy sets for understanding long videos. Many existing video datasets and models are focused on short clips (10s-30s). While some long video datasets do exist, they can often be solved by powerful image models applied per frame (and often to very few frames) in a video, and are usually manually annotated at high cost. In order to mitigate both these problems, we propose a scalable dataset creation pipeline which leverages large models (VLMs and LLMs), to automatically generate dense, time-aligned video captions, as well as tough question answer decoy sets for video segments (up to 15 minutes in length). Our dataset Neptune covers a broad range of long video reasoning abilities and consists of a subset that emphasizes multimodal reasoning. Since existing metrics for open-ended question answering are either rule-based or may rely on proprietary models, we provide a new open source model-based metric GEM to score open-ended responses on Neptune. Benchmark evaluations reveal that most current open-source long video models perform poorly on Neptune, particularly on questions testing temporal ordering, counting and state changes. Through Neptune, we aim to spur the development of more advanced models capable of understanding long videos. The dataset is available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/neptune

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantifying the uncertainty in the factual parametric knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in a black-box setting, poses a significant challenge. Existing methods, which gauge a model's uncertainty through evaluating self-consistency in responses to the original query, do not always capture true uncertainty. Models might respond consistently to the origin query with a wrong answer, yet respond correctly to varied questions from different perspectives about the same query, and vice versa. In this paper, we propose a novel method, DiverseAgentEntropy, for evaluating a model's uncertainty using multi-agent interaction under the assumption that if a model is certain, it should consistently recall the answer to the original query across a diverse collection of questions about the same original query. We further implement an abstention policy to withhold responses when uncertainty is high. Our method offers a more accurate prediction of the model's reliability and further detects hallucinations, outperforming other self-consistency-based methods. Additionally, it demonstrates that existing models often fail to consistently retrieve the correct answer to the same query under diverse varied questions even when knowing the correct answer.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Given the rapid progress of generative AI, there is a pressing need to systematically compare and choose between the numerous models and configurations available. The scale and versatility of such evaluations make the use of LLM-based judges a compelling solution for this challenge. Crucially, this approach requires first to validate the quality of the LLM judge itself. Previous work has focused on instance-based assessment of LLM judges, where a judge is evaluated over a set of responses, or response pairs, while being agnostic to their source systems. We argue that this setting overlooks critical factors affecting system-level ranking, such as a judge's positive or negative bias towards certain systems. To address this gap, we conduct the first large-scale study of LLM judges as system rankers. System scores are generated by aggregating judgment scores over multiple system outputs, and the judge's quality is assessed by comparing the resulting system ranking to a human-based ranking. Beyond overall judge assessment, our analysis provides a fine-grained characterization of judge behavior, including their decisiveness and bias.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent latent-space monitoring techniques have shown promise as defenses against LLM attacks. These defenses act as scanners that seek to detect harmful activations before they lead to undesirable actions. This prompts the question: Can models execute harmful behavior via inconspicuous latent states? Here, we study such obfuscated activations. We show that state-of-the-art latent-space defenses -- including sparse autoencoders, representation probing, and latent OOD detection -- are all vulnerable to obfuscated activations. For example, against probes trained to classify harmfulness, our attacks can often reduce recall from 100% to 0% while retaining a 90% jailbreaking rate. However, obfuscation has limits: we find that on a complex task (writing SQL code), obfuscation reduces model performance. Together, our results demonstrate that neural activations are highly malleable: we can reshape activation patterns in a variety of ways, often while preserving a network's behavior. This poses a fundamental challenge to latent-space defenses.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cable broadband networks are one of the few "last-mile" broadband technologies widely available in the U.S. Unfortunately, they have poor reliability after decades of deployment. The cable industry proposed a framework called Proactive Network Maintenance (PNM) to diagnose the cable networks. However, there is little public knowledge or systematic study on how to use these data to detect and localize cable network problems. Existing tools in the public domain have prohibitive high false-positive rates. In this paper, we propose CableMon, the first public-domain system that applies machine learning techniques to PNM data to improve the reliability of cable broadband networks. CableMon tackles two key challenges faced by cable ISPs: accurately detecting failures, and distinguishing whether a failure occurs within a network or at a subscriber's premise. CableMon uses statistical models to generate features from time series data and uses customer trouble tickets as hints to infer abnormal/failure thresholds for these generated features. Further, CableMon employs an unsupervised learning model to group cable devices sharing similar anomalous patterns and effectively identify impairments that occur inside a cable network and impairments occur at a subscriber's premise, as these two different faults require different types of technical personnel to repair them. We use eight months of PNM data and customer trouble tickets from an ISP and experimental deployment to evaluate CableMon's performance. Our evaluation results show that CableMon can effectively detect and distinguish failures from PNM data and outperforms existing public-domain tools.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding what defines a good representation in large language models (LLMs) is fundamental to both theoretical understanding and practical applications. In this paper, we investigate the quality of intermediate representations in various LLM architectures, including Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs). We find that intermediate layers often yield more informative representations for downstream tasks than the final layers. To measure the representation quality, we adapt and apply a suite of metrics - such as prompt entropy, curvature, and augmentation-invariance - originally proposed in other contexts. Our empirical study reveals significant architectural differences, how representations evolve throughout training, and how factors like input randomness and prompt length affect each layer. Notably, we observe a bimodal pattern in the entropy of some intermediate layers and consider potential explanations tied to training data. Overall, our results illuminate the internal mechanics of LLMs and guide strategies for architectural optimization and training.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Materials discovery and development are critical for addressing global challenges. Yet, the exponential growth in materials science literature comprising vast amounts of textual data has created significant bottlenecks in knowledge extraction, synthesis, and scientific reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to accelerate materials research through automated analysis and prediction. Still, their effective deployment requires domain-specific adaptation for understanding and solving domain-relevant tasks. Here, we present LLaMat, a family of foundational models for materials science developed through continued pretraining of LLaMA models on an extensive corpus of materials literature and crystallographic data. Through systematic evaluation, we demonstrate that LLaMat excels in materials-specific NLP and structured information extraction while maintaining general linguistic capabilities. The specialized LLaMat-CIF variant demonstrates unprecedented capabilities in crystal structure generation, predicting stable crystals with high coverage across the periodic table. Intriguingly, despite LLaMA-3's superior performance in comparison to LLaMA-2, we observe that LLaMat-2 demonstrates unexpectedly enhanced domain-specific performance across diverse materials science tasks, including structured information extraction from text and tables, more particularly in crystal structure generation, a potential adaptation rigidity in overtrained LLMs. Altogether, the present work demonstrates the effectiveness of domain adaptation towards developing practically deployable LLM copilots for materials research. Beyond materials science, our findings reveal important considerations for domain adaptation of LLMs, such as model selection, training methodology, and domain-specific performance, which may influence the development of specialized scientific AI systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) significantly enhances the zero-shot capabilities of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). While coding data is known to boost LLM reasoning abilities during pretraining, its role in activating internal reasoning capacities during IFT remains understudied. This paper investigates a key question: How does coding data impact LLMs' reasoning capacities during IFT stage? To explore this, we thoroughly examine the impact of coding data across different coding data proportions, model families, sizes, and reasoning domains, from various perspectives. Specifically, we create three IFT datasets with increasing coding data proportions, fine-tune six LLM backbones across different families and scales on these datasets, evaluate the tuned models' performance across twelve tasks in three reasoning domains, and analyze the outcomes from three broad-to-granular perspectives: overall, domain-level, and task-specific. Our holistic analysis provides valuable insights into each perspective. First, coding data tuning enhances the overall reasoning capabilities of LLMs across different model families and scales. Moreover, while the impact of coding data varies by domain, it shows consistent trends within each domain across different model families and scales. Additionally, coding data generally provides comparable task-specific benefits across model families, with optimal proportions in IFT datasets being task-dependent.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have paved the way for LLM-based agent systems that offer enhanced accuracy and interpretability across various domains. Radiology, with its complex analytical requirements, is an ideal field for the application of these agents. This paper aims to investigate the pre-requisite question for building concrete radiology agents which is, `Can modern LLMs act as agent cores in radiology environments?' To investigate it, we introduce RadABench with three-fold contributions: First, we present RadABench-Data, a comprehensive synthetic evaluation dataset for LLM-based agents, generated from an extensive taxonomy encompassing 6 anatomies, 5 imaging modalities, 10 tool categories, and 11 radiology tasks. Second, we propose RadABench-EvalPlat, a novel evaluation platform for agents featuring a prompt-driven workflow and the capability to simulate a wide range of radiology toolsets. Third, we assess the performance of 7 leading LLMs on our benchmark from 5 perspectives with multiple metrics. Our findings indicate that while current LLMs demonstrate strong capabilities in many areas, they are still not sufficiently advanced to serve as the central agent core in a fully operational radiology agent system. Additionally, we identify key factors influencing the performance of LLM-based agent cores, offering insights for clinicians on how to apply agent systems in real-world radiology practices effectively. All of our code and data are open-sourced in https://github.com/MAGIC-AI4Med/RadABench.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present Liquid, an auto-regressive generation paradigm that seamlessly integrates visual comprehension and generation by tokenizing images into discrete codes and learning these code embeddings alongside text tokens within a shared feature space for both vision and language. Unlike previous multimodal large language model (MLLM), Liquid achieves this integration using a single large language model (LLM), eliminating the need for external pretrained visual embeddings such as CLIP. For the first time, Liquid uncovers a scaling law that performance drop unavoidably brought by the unified training of visual and language tasks diminishes as the model size increases. Furthermore, the unified token space enables visual generation and comprehension tasks to mutually enhance each other, effectively removing the typical interference seen in earlier models. We show that existing LLMs can serve as strong foundations for Liquid, saving 100x in training costs while outperforming Chameleon in multimodal capabilities and maintaining language performance comparable to mainstream LLMs like LLAMA2. Liquid also outperforms models like SD v2.1 and SD-XL (FID of 5.47 on MJHQ-30K), excelling in both vision-language and text-only tasks. This work demonstrates that LLMs such as LLAMA3.2 and GEMMA2 are powerful multimodal generators, offering a scalable solution for enhancing both vision-language understanding and generation. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/FoundationVision/Liquid.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Since classical machine learning has become a powerful tool for developing data-driven algorithms, quantum machine learning is expected to similarly impact the development of quantum algorithms. The literature reflects a mutually beneficial relationship between machine learning and quantum computing, where progress in one field frequently drives improvements in the other. Motivated by the fertile connection between machine learning and quantum computing enabled by parameterized quantum circuits, we use a resource-efficient and scalable Single-Qubit Quantum Neural Network (SQQNN) for both regression and classification tasks. The SQQNN leverages parameterized single-qubit unitary operators and quantum measurements to achieve efficient learning. To train the model, we use gradient descent for regression tasks. For classification, we introduce a novel training method inspired by the Taylor series, which can efficiently find a global minimum in a single step. This approach significantly accelerates training compared to iterative methods. Evaluated across various applications, the SQQNN exhibits virtually error-free and strong performance in regression and classification tasks, including the MNIST dataset. These results demonstrate the versatility, scalability, and suitability of the SQQNN for deployment on near-term quantum devices.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents the Long Context and Form Output (LCFO) benchmark, a novel evaluation framework for assessing gradual summarization and summary expansion capabilities across diverse domains. LCFO consists of long input documents (5k words average length), each of which comes with three summaries of different lengths (20%, 10%, and 5% of the input text), as well as approximately 15 questions and answers (QA) related to the input content. Notably, LCFO also provides alignments between specific QA pairs and corresponding summaries in 7 domains. The primary motivation behind providing summaries of different lengths is to establish a controllable framework for generating long texts from shorter inputs, i.e. summary expansion. To establish an evaluation metric framework for summarization and summary expansion, we provide human evaluation scores for human-generated outputs, as well as results from various state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). GPT-4o-mini achieves best human scores among automatic systems in both summarization and summary expansion tasks (~ +10% and +20%, respectively). It even surpasses human output quality in the case of short summaries (~ +7%). Overall automatic metrics achieve low correlations with human evaluation scores (~ 0.4) but moderate correlation on specific evaluation aspects such as fluency and attribution (~ 0.6). The LCFO benchmark offers a standardized platform for evaluating summarization and summary expansion performance, as well as corresponding automatic metrics, thereby providing an important evaluation framework to advance generative AI.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Automatically generating feedback via large language models (LLMs) in intelligent tutoring systems and online learning platforms has the potential to improve the learning outcomes of many students. However, both feedback generation and evaluation are challenging: feedback content has to be valid especially in subjects like math, which requires models to understand the problem, the solution, and where the student's error lies. Feedback also has to be pedagogically valid to reflect effective tutoring strategies, such as explaining possible misconceptions and encouraging the student, among other desirable features. In this work, we address both problems of automatically generating and evaluating feedback while considering both correctness and alignment. First, we propose a rubric for evaluating math feedback and show that GPT-4 is able to effectively use it to annotate human-written and LLM-generated feedback. Second, we propose a framework for feedback generation that optimizes both correctness and alignment using reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we use GPT-4's annotations to create preferences over feedback pairs in an augmented dataset for training via direct preference optimization (DPO). We show that our methods significantly increase the correctness and alignment of generated feedback with Llama 2, an open-source LLM, qualitatively analyze our generation and evaluation systems using case studies, and outline several areas for future work.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As the capabilities of code large language models (LLMs) continue to expand, their applications across diverse code intelligence domains are rapidly increasing. However, most existing datasets only evaluate limited application domains. To address this gap, we have developed a comprehensive code evaluation dataset FullStack Bench focusing on full-stack programming, which encompasses a wide range of application domains (e.g., basic programming, data analysis, software engineering, mathematics, and machine learning). Besides, to assess multilingual programming capabilities, in FullStack Bench, we design real-world instructions and corresponding unit test cases from 16 widely-used programming languages to reflect real-world usage scenarios rather than simple translations. Moreover, we also release an effective code sandbox execution tool (i.e., SandboxFusion) supporting various programming languages and packages to evaluate the performance of our FullStack Bench efficiently. Comprehensive experimental results on our FullStack Bench demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of our FullStack Bench and SandboxFusion.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has revolutionised quadruped robot locomotion, but existing control frameworks struggle to generalise beyond their training-induced observational scope, resulting in limited adaptability. In contrast, animals achieve exceptional adaptability through gait transition strategies, diverse gait utilisation, and seamless adjustment to immediate environmental demands. Inspired by these capabilities, we present a novel DRL framework that incorporates key attributes of animal locomotion: gait transition strategies, pseudo gait procedural memory, and adaptive motion adjustments. This approach enables our framework to achieve unparalleled adaptability, demonstrated through blind zero-shot deployment on complex terrains and recovery from critically unstable states. Our findings offer valuable insights into the biomechanics of animal locomotion, paving the way for robust, adaptable robotic systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Conventional biomedical research is increasingly labor-intensive due to the exponential growth of scientific literature and datasets. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has the potential to revolutionize this process by automating various steps. Still, significant challenges remain, including the need for multidisciplinary expertise, logicality of experimental design, and performance measurements. This paper introduces BioResearcher, the first end-to-end automated system designed to streamline the entire biomedical research process involving dry lab experiments. BioResearcher employs a modular multi-agent architecture, integrating specialized agents for search, literature processing, experimental design, and programming. By decomposing complex tasks into logically related sub-tasks and utilizing a hierarchical learning approach, BioResearcher effectively addresses the challenges of multidisciplinary requirements and logical complexity. Furthermore, BioResearcher incorporates an LLM-based reviewer for in-process quality control and introduces novel evaluation metrics to assess the quality and automation of experimental protocols. BioResearcher successfully achieves an average execution success rate of 63.07% across eight previously unmet research objectives. The generated protocols averagely outperform typical agent systems by 22.0% on five quality metrics. The system demonstrates significant potential to reduce researchers' workloads and accelerate biomedical discoveries, paving the way for future innovations in automated research systems.

Previous efforts towards evaluation have been limited to subjective protocols and benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified evaluation taxonomy with eight pedagogical dimensions based on key learning sciences principles, which is designed to assess the pedagogical value of LLM-powered AI tutor responses grounded in student mistakes or confusion in the mathematical domain. We release MRBench -- a new evaluation benchmark containing 192 conversations and 1,596 responses from seven state-of-the-art LLM-based and human tutors, providing gold annotations for eight pedagogical dimensions. We assess reliability of the popular Prometheus2 LLM as an evaluator and analyze each tutor's pedagogical abilities, highlighting which LLMs are good tutors and which ones are more suitable as question-answering systems. We believe that the presented taxonomy, benchmark, and human-annotated labels will streamline the evaluation process and help track the progress in AI tutors' development.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, slow-thinking reasoning systems, such as o1, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving complex reasoning tasks. These systems typically engage in an extended thinking process before responding to a query, allowing them to generate more thorough, accurate, and well-reasoned solutions. These systems are primarily developed and maintained by industry, with their core techniques not publicly disclosed. In response, an increasing number of studies from the research community aim to explore the technical foundations underlying these powerful reasoning systems. Building on these prior efforts, this paper presents a reproduction report on implementing o1-like reasoning systems. We introduce an "imitate, explore, and self-improve" framework as our primary technical approach to train the reasoning model. In the initial phase, we use distilled long-form thought data to fine-tune the reasoning model, enabling it to invoke a slow-thinking mode. The model is then encouraged to explore challenging problems by generating multiple rollouts, which can result in increasingly more high-quality trajectories that lead to correct answers. Furthermore, the model undergoes self-improvement by iteratively refining its training dataset. To verify the effectiveness of this approach, we conduct extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance compared to industry-level reasoning systems on these benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, yet they often struggle with spatial reasoning. This paper presents a novel neural-symbolic framework that enhances LLMs' spatial reasoning abilities through iterative feedback between LLMs and Answer Set Programming (ASP). We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets: StepGame and SparQA, implementing three distinct strategies: (1) direct prompting baseline, (2) Facts+Rules prompting, and (3) DSPy-based LLM+ASP pipeline with iterative refinement. Our experimental results demonstrate that the LLM+ASP pipeline significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving an average 82% accuracy on StepGame and 69% on SparQA, marking improvements of 40-50% and 8-15% respectively over direct prompting. The success stems from three key innovations: (1) effective separation of semantic parsing and logical reasoning through a modular pipeline, (2) iterative feedback mechanism between LLMs and ASP solvers that improves program rate, and (3) robust error handling that addresses parsing, grounding, and solving failures. Additionally, we propose Facts+Rules as a lightweight alternative that achieves comparable performance on complex SparQA dataset, while reducing computational overhead.Our analysis across different LLM architectures (Deepseek, Llama3-70B, GPT-4.0 mini) demonstrates the framework's generalizability and provides insights into the trade-offs between implementation complexity and reasoning capability, contributing to the development of more interpretable and reliable AI systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, LLMs (Large Language Models) have been adapted for time series prediction with significant success in pattern recognition. However, the common belief is that these models are not suitable for predicting financial market returns, which are known to be almost random. We aim to challenge this misconception through a counterexample. Specifically, we utilized the Chronos model from Ansari et al.(2024) and tested both pretrained configurations and fine-tuned supervised forecasts on the largest American single stocks using data from Guijarro-Ordonnez et al.(2022). We constructed a long/short portfolio, and the performance simulation indicates that LLMs can in reality handle time series that are nearly indistinguishable from noise, demonstrating an ability to identify inefficiencies amidst randomness and generate alpha. Finally, we compared these results with those of specialized models and smaller deep learning models, highlighting significant room for improvement in LLM performance to further enhance their predictive capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We tasked 16 state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) with estimating the likelihood of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) emerging by 2030. To assess the quality of these forecasts, we implemented an automated peer review process (LLM-PR). The LLMs' estimates varied widely, ranging from 3% (Reka- Core) to 47.6% (GPT-4o), with a median of 12.5%. These estimates closely align with a recent expert survey that projected a 10% likelihood of AGI by 2027, underscoring the relevance of LLMs in forecasting complex, speculative scenarios. The LLM-PR process demonstrated strong reliability, evidenced by a high Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC = 0.79), reflecting notable consistency in scoring across the models. Among the models, Pplx-70b-online emerged as the top performer, while Gemini-1.5-pro-api ranked the lowest. A cross-comparison with external benchmarks, such as LMSYS Chatbot Arena, revealed that LLM rankings remained consistent across different evaluation methods, suggesting that existing benchmarks may not encapsulate some of the skills relevant for AGI prediction. We further explored the use of weighting schemes based on external benchmarks, optimizing the alignment of LLMs' predictions with human expert forecasts. This analysis led to the development of a new, 'AGI benchmark' designed to highlight performance differences in AGI-related tasks. Our findings offer insights into LLMs' capabilities in speculative, interdisciplinary forecasting tasks and emphasize the growing need for innovative evaluation frameworks for assessing AI performance in complex, uncertain real-world scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown significant potential in various biological tasks such as protein engineering and molecule design. These tasks typically involve black-box discrete sequence optimization, where the challenge lies in generating sequences that are not only biologically feasible but also adhere to hard fine-grained constraints. However, LLMs often struggle with such constraints, especially in biological contexts where verifying candidate solutions is costly and time-consuming. In this study, we explore the possibility of employing LLMs as highly-constrained bilevel optimizers through a methodology we refer to as Language Model Optimization with Margin Expectation (LLOME). This approach combines both offline and online optimization, utilizing limited oracle evaluations to iteratively enhance the sequences generated by the LLM. We additionally propose a novel training objective -- Margin-Aligned Expectation (MargE) -- that trains the LLM to smoothly interpolate between the reward and reference distributions. Lastly, we introduce a synthetic test suite that bears strong geometric similarity to real biophysical problems and enables rapid evaluation of LLM optimizers without time-consuming lab validation. Our findings reveal that, in comparison to genetic algorithm baselines, LLMs achieve significantly lower regret solutions while requiring fewer test function evaluations. However, we also observe that LLMs exhibit moderate miscalibration, are susceptible to generator collapse, and have difficulty finding the optimal solution when no explicit ground truth rewards are available.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capability in numerous tasks and applications. However, fine-tuning LLMs using high-quality datasets under external supervision remains prohibitively expensive. In response, LLM self-improvement approaches have been vibrantly developed recently. The typical paradigm of LLM self-improvement involves training LLM on self-generated data, part of which may be detrimental and should be filtered out due to the unstable data quality. While current works primarily employs filtering strategies based on answer correctness, in this paper, we demonstrate that filtering out correct but with high distribution shift extent (DSE) samples could also benefit the results of self-improvement. Given that the actual sample distribution is usually inaccessible, we propose a new metric called DS weight to approximate DSE, inspired by the Importance Weighting methods. Consequently, we integrate DS weight with self-consistency to comprehensively filter the self-generated samples and fine-tune the language model. Experiments show that with only a tiny valid set (up to 5\% size of the training set) to compute DS weight, our approach can notably promote the reasoning ability of current LLM self-improvement methods. The resulting performance is on par with methods that rely on external supervision from pre-trained reward models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LLMs can generate human-like dialogues, yet their ability to simulate early child-adult interactions remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we examined how effectively LLMs can capture the distinctive features of child-caregiver language in interaction, using both static and interactive benchmarking methods. We found that state-of-the-art LLMs like Llama 3 and GPT-4o can approximate child-caregiver dialogues at the word and utterance level, but they struggle to reproduce the child and caregiver's discursive patterns, exaggerate alignment, and fail to reach the level of diversity shown by humans. The broader goal of this work is to initiate the development of a comprehensive benchmark for LLMs in child-oriented applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-Language models like CLIP have been shown to be highly effective at linking visual perception and natural language understanding, enabling sophisticated image-text capabilities, including strong retrieval and zero-shot classification performance. Their widespread use, as well as the fact that CLIP models are trained on image-text pairs from the web, make them both a worthwhile and relatively easy target for backdoor attacks. As training foundational models, such as CLIP, from scratch is very expensive, this paper focuses on cleaning potentially poisoned models via fine-tuning. We first show that existing cleaning techniques are not effective against simple structured triggers used in Blended or BadNet backdoor attacks, exposing a critical vulnerability for potential real-world deployment of these models. Then, we introduce PAR, Perturb and Recover, a surprisingly simple yet effective mechanism to remove backdoors from CLIP models. Through extensive experiments across different encoders and types of backdoor attacks, we show that PAR achieves high backdoor removal rate while preserving good standard performance. Finally, we illustrate that our approach is effective even only with synthetic text-image pairs, i.e. without access to real training data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> [Study in German language.] This study examines the AI-powered grading tool "AI Grading Assistant" by the German company Fobizz, designed to support teachers in evaluating and providing feedback on student assignments. Against the societal backdrop of an overburdened education system and rising expectations for artificial intelligence as a solution to these challenges, the investigation evaluates the tool's functional suitability through two test series. The results reveal significant shortcomings: The tool's numerical grades and qualitative feedback are often random and do not improve even when its suggestions are incorporated. The highest ratings are achievable only with texts generated by ChatGPT. False claims and nonsensical submissions frequently go undetected, while the implementation of some grading criteria is unreliable and opaque. Since these deficiencies stem from the inherent limitations of large language models (LLMs), fundamental improvements to this or similar tools are not immediately foreseeable. The study critiques the broader trend of adopting AI as a quick fix for systemic problems in education, concluding that Fobizz's marketing of the tool as an objective and time-saving solution is misleading and irresponsible. Finally, the study calls for systematic evaluation and subject-specific pedagogical scrutiny of the use of AI tools in educational contexts.

To this end, we devise a series of experiments to explain the performance gap empirically. Our findings suggest that: (a) LLMs struggle with dataset demands of closed domains such as retrieving long answer spans; (b) Certain LLMs, despite showing strong overall performance, display weaknesses in meeting basic requirements as discriminating between domain-specific senses of words which we link to pre-processing decisions; (c) Scaling model parameters is not always effective for cross domain generalization; and (d) Closed-domain datasets are quantitatively much different than open-domain EQA datasets and current LLMs struggle to deal with them. Our findings point out important directions for improving existing LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Powerful large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to be deployed with lower computational costs, enabling their capabilities on resource-constrained devices. Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a star approach to achieve this ambition, with best methods compressing weights to less than 2 bit on average. In this paper, we propose Channel-Relaxed Vector Quantization (CRVQ), a novel technique that significantly improves the performance of PTQ baselines at the cost of only minimal additional bits. This state-of-the-art extreme compression method achieves its results through two key innovations: (1) carefully selecting and reordering a very small subset of critical weight channels, and (2) leveraging multiple codebooks to relax the constraint of critical channels. With our method, we demonstrate a 38.9% improvement over the current strongest sub-2-bit PTQ baseline, enabling nearer lossless 1-bit compression. Furthermore, our approach offers flexible customization of quantization bit-width and performance, providing a wider range of deployment options for diverse hardware platforms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Domain Large Language Models (LLMs) are developed for domain-specific tasks based on general LLMs. But it still requires professional knowledge to facilitate the expertise for some domain-specific tasks. In this paper, we investigate into knowledge-intensive calculation problems. We find that the math problems to be challenging for LLMs, when involving complex domain-specific rules and knowledge documents, rather than simple formulations of terminologies. Therefore, we propose a pipeline to solve the domain-specific calculation problems with Knowledge-Intensive Programs Generator more effectively, named as KIPG. It generates knowledge-intensive programs according to the domain-specific documents. For each query, key variables are extracted, then outcomes which are dependent on domain knowledge are calculated with the programs. By iterative preference alignment, the code generator learns to improve the logic consistency with the domain knowledge. Taking legal domain as an example, we have conducted experiments to prove the effectiveness of our pipeline, and extensive analysis on the modules. We also find that the code generator is also adaptable to other domains, without training on the new knowledge.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We study extractive question-answering in the medical domain (Medical-EQA). This problem has two main challenges: (i) domain specificity, as most AI models lack necessary domain knowledge, and (ii) extraction-based answering style, which restricts most autoregressive LLMs due to potential hallucinations. To handle those challenges, we propose TOP-Training, a target-oriented pre-training paradigm that stands out among all domain adaptation techniques with two desirable features: (i) TOP-Training moves one step further than popular domain-oriented fine-tuning since it not only moves closer to the target domain, but also familiarizes itself with the target dataset, and (ii) it does not assume the existence of a large set of unlabeled instances from the target domain. Specifically, for a target Medical-EQA dataset, we extract its entities and leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic texts containing those entities; we then demonstrate that pretraining on this synthetic text data yields better performance on the target Medical-EQA benchmarks. Overall, our contributions are threefold: (i) TOP-Training, a new pretraining technique to effectively adapt LLMs to better solve a target problem, (ii) TOP-Training has a wide application scope because it does not require the target problem to have a large set of unlabeled data, and (iii) our experiments highlight the limitations of autoregressive LLMs, emphasizing TOP-Training as a means to unlock the true potential of bidirectional LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Traditional evaluation metrics like BLEU and ROUGE fall short when capturing the nuanced qualities of generated text, particularly when there is no single ground truth. In this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Google Gemini 1, to serve as automatic evaluators for non-standardized metrics in summarization and dialog-based tasks. We conduct experiments across multiple prompting strategies to examine how LLMs fare as quality evaluators when compared with human judgments on the SummEval and USR datasets, asking the model to generate both a score as well as a justification for the score. Furthermore, we explore the robustness of the LLM evaluator by using perturbed inputs. Our findings suggest that while LLMs show promise, their alignment with human evaluators is limited, they are not robust against perturbations and significant improvements are required for their standalone use as reliable evaluators for subjective metrics.

However, since these models are trained on existing designerly knowledge, they may inadvertently replicate bad or even illegal practices, especially deceptive designs (DD). This paper examines whether users can accidentally create DD for a fictitious webshop using GPT-4. We recruited 20 participants, asking them to use ChatGPT to generate functionalities (product overview or checkout) and then modify these using neutral prompts to meet a business goal (e.g., "increase the likelihood of us selling our product"). We found that all 20 generated websites contained at least one DD pattern (mean: 5, max: 9), with GPT-4 providing no warnings. When reflecting on the designs, only 4 participants expressed concerns, while most considered the outcomes satisfactory and not morally problematic, despite the potential ethical and legal implications for end-users and those adopting ChatGPT's recommendations

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is computationally intensive because it requires updating all parameters. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) improves efficiency by modifying only a subset of weights but introduces a trade-off between expressivity and computational cost: lower ranks reduce resources but limit expressiveness, while higher ranks enhance expressivity at increased cost. Despite recent advances in adaptive LoRA techniques, existing methods fail to provide a theoretical basis for optimizing the trade-off between model performance and efficiency. We propose Geometric Low-Rank Adaptation (GeLoRA), a novel framework that computes the intrinsic dimensionality of hidden state representations to adaptively select LoRA ranks. We demonstrate that the intrinsic dimension provides a lower bound for the optimal rank of LoRA matrices, allowing for a principled selection that balances efficiency and expressivity. GeLoRA dynamically adjusts the rank for each layer based on the intrinsic dimensionality of its input and output representations, recognizing that not all model parameters equally impact fine-tuning. Empirical validation on multiple tasks shows that GeLoRA consistently outperforms recent baselines within the same parameter budget.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a research field that aims to estimate a student's knowledge state through learning interactions-a crucial component of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs). Despite significant advancements, no current KT models excel in both predictive accuracy and interpretability. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs), pre-trained on vast natural language datasets, have emerged as powerful tools with immense potential in various educational applications. This systematic review explores the intersections, opportunities, and challenges of combining KT models and LLMs in educational contexts. The review first investigates LLM applications in education, including their adaptability to domain-specific content and ability to support personalized learning. It then examines the development and current state of KT models, from traditional to advanced approaches, aiming to uncover potential challenges that LLMs could mitigate. The core of this review focuses on integrating LLMs with KT, exploring three primary functions: addressing general concerns in KT fields, overcoming specific KT model limitations, and performing as KT models themselves. Our findings reveal that LLMs can be customized for specific educational tasks through tailor-making techniques such as in-context learning and agent-based approaches, effectively managing complex and unbalanced educational data. These models can enhance existing KT models' performance and solve cold-start problems by generating relevant features from question data. However, both current models depend heavily on structured, limited datasets, missing opportunities to use diverse educational data that could offer deeper insights into individual learners and support various educational settings.

  Intention Inference</h2>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Resource leaks, caused by resources not being released after acquisition, often lead to performance issues and system crashes. Existing static detection techniques rely on mechanical matching of predefined resource acquisition/release APIs and null-checking conditions to find unreleased resources, suffering from both (1) false negatives caused by the incompleteness of predefined resource acquisition/release APIs and (2) false positives caused by the incompleteness of resource reachability validation identification. To overcome these challenges, we propose InferROI, a novel approach that leverages the exceptional code comprehension capability of large language models (LLMs) to directly infer resource-oriented intentions (acquisition, release, and reachability validation) in code. InferROI first prompts the LLM to infer involved intentions for a given code snippet, and then incorporates a two-stage static analysis approach to check control-flow paths for resource leak detection based on the inferred intentions.   We evaluate the effectiveness of InferROI in both resource-oriented intention inference and resource leak detection. Experimental results on the DroidLeaks and JLeaks datasets demonstrate InferROI achieves promising bug detection rate (59.3% and 62.5%) and false alarm rate (18.6% and 19.5%). Compared to three industrial static detectors, InferROI detects 14~45 and 149~485 more bugs in DroidLeaks and JLeaks, respectively. When applied to real-world open-source projects, InferROI identifies 29 unknown resource leak bugs (verified by authors), with 7 of them being confirmed by developers. In addition, the results of an ablation study underscores the importance of combining LLM-based inference with static analysis.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Satire detection is essential for accurately extracting opinions from textual data and combating misinformation online. However, the lack of diverse corpora for satire leads to the problem of stylistic bias which impacts the models' detection performances. This study proposes a debiasing approach for satire detection, focusing on reducing biases in training data by utilizing generative large language models. The approach is evaluated in both cross-domain (irony detection) and cross-lingual (English) settings. Results show that the debiasing method enhances the robustness and generalizability of the models for satire and irony detection tasks in Turkish and English. However, its impact on causal language models, such as Llama-3.1, is limited. Additionally, this work curates and presents the Turkish Satirical News Dataset with detailed human annotations, with case studies on classification, debiasing, and explainability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention in recommendation systems. Current LLM-based recommender systems primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train the model for recommendation tasks. However, relying solely on positive samples limits the model's ability to align with user satisfaction and expectations. To address this, researchers have introduced Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which explicitly aligns recommendations with user preferences using offline preference ranking data. Despite its advantages, our theoretical analysis reveals that DPO inherently biases the model towards a few items, exacerbating the filter bubble issue and ultimately degrading user experience. In this paper, we propose SPRec, a novel self-play recommendation framework designed to mitigate over-recommendation and improve fairness without requiring additional data or manual intervention. In each self-play iteration, the model undergoes an SFT step followed by a DPO step, treating offline interaction data as positive samples and the predicted outputs from the previous iteration as negative samples. This effectively re-weights the DPO loss function using the model's logits, adaptively suppressing biased items. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate SPRec's effectiveness in enhancing recommendation accuracy and addressing fairness concerns.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The believable simulation of multi-user behavior is crucial for understanding complex social systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs)-based AI agents have made significant progress, enabling them to achieve human-like intelligence across various tasks. However, real human societies are often dynamic and complex, involving numerous individuals engaging in multimodal interactions. In this paper, taking e-commerce scenarios as an example, we present LMAgent, a very large-scale and multimodal agents society based on multimodal LLMs. In LMAgent, besides freely chatting with friends, the agents can autonomously browse, purchase, and review products, even perform live streaming e-commerce. To simulate this complex system, we introduce a self-consistency prompting mechanism to augment agents' multimodal capabilities, resulting in significantly improved decision-making performance over the existing multi-agent system. Moreover, we propose a fast memory mechanism combined with the small-world model to enhance system efficiency, which supports more than 10,000 agent simulations in a society. Experiments on agents' behavior show that these agents achieve comparable performance to humans in behavioral indicators. Furthermore, compared with the existing LLMs-based multi-agent system, more different and valuable phenomena are exhibited, such as herd behavior, which demonstrates the potential of LMAgent in credible large-scale social behavior simulations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces PowerInfer, a high-speed Large Language Model (LLM) inference engine on a personal computer (PC) equipped with a single consumer-grade GPU. The key principle underlying the design of PowerInfer is exploiting the high locality inherent in LLM inference, characterized by a power-law distribution in neuron activation. This distribution indicates that a small subset of neurons, termed hot neurons, are consistently activated across inputs, while the majority, cold neurons, vary based on specific inputs. PowerInfer exploits such an insight to design a GPU-CPU hybrid inference engine: hot-activated neurons are preloaded onto the GPU for fast access, while cold-activated neurons are computed on the CPU, thus significantly reducing GPU memory demands and CPU-GPU data transfers. PowerInfer further integrates adaptive predictors and neuron-aware sparse operators, optimizing the efficiency of neuron activation and computational sparsity. The evaluation shows that PowerInfer significantly outperforms llama.cpp by up to 11.69x while retaining model accuracy across various LLMs (including OPT-175B) on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU. For the OPT-30B model, PowerInfer achieves performance comparable to that of a high-end server-grade A100 GPU, reaching 82% of its token generation rate on a single consumer-grade RTX 4090 GPU.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) on smartphones enable real-time AI assistance and privacy-preserving, offline operation. However, resource constraints of smartphones limit current deployments to small language models (SLMs), significantly compromising their capabilities. This paper introduces PowerInfer-2, a smartphone-based framework that enables fast inference for LLMs exceeding the memory capacity. The key insight is decomposing matrix operations into neuron clusters as the basic processing unit, which enables flexible scheduling and efficient I/O-computation pipelining. PowerInfer-2 leverages this neuron-cluster-based design in both computation and storage. For computation, neuron clusters with dense activations are processed on NPU, while sparse clusters use CPU. The storage engine provides a fine-grained pipeline mechanism that coordinates cluster-level computation and I/O operations, enhanced by a segmented neuron cache to reduce I/O activities. PowerInfer-2 achieves up to a 27.8x speed increase compared to state-of-the-art frameworks. PowerInfer-2 is the first system to serve a 47B LLM on a smartphone, achieving 11.68 tokens/s. Notably, these performance improvements preserve model quality with negligible accuracy degradation.

By significantly reducing annotation time, lowering technical barriers through its ease of deployment, and enhancing segmentation accuracy, SAM 2 addresses critical challenges faced by researchers and practitioners. Utilizing its zero-shot segmentation capabilities with minimal user input-a single click per video-we tested SAM 2 on over 14 million eye images from diverse datasets, including virtual reality setups and the world's largest unified dataset recorded using wearable eye trackers. Remarkably, in pupil segmentation tasks, SAM 2 matches the performance of domain-specific models trained solely on eye images, achieving competitive mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) scores of up to 93% without fine-tuning. Additionally, we provide our code and segmentation masks for these widely used datasets to promote further research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for robotics applications, particularly task planning, by harnessing their language comprehension and text generation capabilities. However, in applications such as household robotics, a critical gap remains in the personalization of these models to individual user preferences. We introduce LLM-Personalize, a novel framework with an optimization pipeline designed to personalize LLM planners for household robotics. Our LLM-Personalize framework features an LLM planner that performs iterative planning in multi-room, partially-observable household scenarios, making use of a scene graph constructed with local observations. The generated plan consists of a sequence of high-level actions which are subsequently executed by a controller. Central to our approach is the optimization pipeline, which combines imitation learning and iterative self-training to personalize the LLM planner. In particular, the imitation learning phase performs initial LLM alignment from demonstrations, and bootstraps the model to facilitate effective iterative self-training, which further explores and aligns the model to user preferences. We evaluate LLM-Personalize on Housekeep, a challenging simulated real-world 3D benchmark for household rearrangements, and show that LLM-Personalize achieves more than a 30 percent increase in success rate over existing LLM planners, showcasing significantly improved alignment with human preferences.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Chain-of-thought emerges as a promising technique for eliciting reasoning capabilities from Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it does not always improve task performance or accurately represent reasoning processes, leaving unresolved questions about its usage. In this paper, we diagnose the underlying mechanism by comparing the reasoning process of LLMs with humans, using causal analysis to understand the relationships between the problem instruction, reasoning, and the answer in LLMs. Our empirical study reveals that LLMs often deviate from the ideal causal chain, resulting in spurious correlations and potential consistency errors (inconsistent reasoning and answers). We also examine various factors influencing the causal structure, finding that in-context learning with examples strengthens it, while post-training techniques like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on human feedback weaken it. To our surprise, the causal structure cannot be strengthened by enlarging the model size only, urging research on new techniques. We hope that this preliminary study will shed light on understanding and improving the reasoning process in LLM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Activation sparsity refers to the existence of considerable weakly-contributed elements among activation outputs. As a prevalent property of the models using the ReLU activation function, activation sparsity has been proven a promising paradigm to boost model inference efficiency. Nevertheless, most large language models (LLMs) adopt activation functions without intrinsic activation sparsity (e.g., GELU and Swish). Some recent efforts have explored introducing ReLU or its variants as the substitutive activation function to help LLMs achieve activation sparsity and inference acceleration, but few can simultaneously obtain high sparsity and comparable model performance. This paper introduces a simple and effective sparsification method named "ProSparse" to push LLMs for higher activation sparsity while maintaining comparable performance. Specifically, after substituting the activation function of LLMs with ReLU, ProSparse adopts progressive sparsity regularization with a factor smoothly increasing along the multi-stage sine curves. This can enhance activation sparsity and mitigate performance degradation by avoiding radical shifts in activation distributions. With ProSparse, we obtain high sparsity of 89.32% for LLaMA2-7B, 88.80% for LLaMA2-13B, and 87.89% for end-size MiniCPM-1B, respectively, achieving comparable performance to their original Swish-activated versions. These present the most sparsely activated models among open-source LLaMA versions and competitive end-size models, considerably surpassing ReluLLaMA-7B (66.98%) and ReluLLaMA-13B (71.56%). Our inference acceleration experiments further demonstrate the significant practical acceleration potential of LLMs with higher activation sparsity, obtaining up to 4.52$\times$ inference speedup.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has streamlined frontend interface creation through tools like Vercel's V0, yet surfaced challenges in design quality (e.g., accessibility, and usability). Current solutions, often limited by their focus, generalisability, or data dependency, fall short in addressing these complexities. Moreover, none of them examine the quality of LLM-generated UI design. In this work, we introduce DesignRepair, a novel dual-stream design guideline-aware system to examine and repair the UI design quality issues from both code aspect and rendered page aspect. We utilised the mature and popular Material Design as our knowledge base to guide this process. Specifically, we first constructed a comprehensive knowledge base encoding Google's Material Design principles into low-level component knowledge base and high-level system design knowledge base. After that, DesignRepair employs a LLM for the extraction of key components and utilizes the Playwright tool for precise page analysis, aligning these with the established knowledge bases. Finally, we integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation with state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 to holistically refine and repair frontend code through a strategic divide and conquer approach. Our extensive evaluations validated the efficacy and utility of our approach, demonstrating significant enhancements in adherence to design guidelines, accessibility, and user experience metrics.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As a critical component of beyond fifth-generation (B5G) and sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication systems, ultra-reliable low-latency communication (uRLLC) imposes stringent requirements on latency and reliability. In recent years, with the improvement of mobile communication network, centralized and distributed processing schemes for cellfree massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) have attracted significant research attention. This paper investigates the performance of a novel scalable cell-free radio access network (CF-RAN) architecture featuring multiple edge distributed units (EDUs) under the finite block length regime. Closed expressions for the upper and lower bounds of its expected spectral efficiency (SE) performance are derived, where centralized and fully distributed deployment can be treated as two special cases, respectively. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of user equipments (UEs) and remote radio units (RRUs) is examined and the analysis reveals that the interleaving RRUs deployment associated with the EDU can enhance SE performance under finite block length constraints with specific transmission error probability. The paper also compares Monte Carlo simulation results with multi-RRU clustering-based collaborative processing, validating the accuracy of the space-time exchange theory in the scalable CF-RAN scenario. By deploying scalable EDUs, a practical trade-off between latency and reliability can be achieved through spatial degree-of-freedom (DoF), offering a distributed and scalable realization of the space-time exchange theory.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, radiance field rendering, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), has shown immense potential in VR content creation due to its high-quality rendering and efficient production process. However, existing physics-based interaction systems for 3DGS can only perform simple and non-realistic simulations or demand extensive user input for complex scenes, primarily due to the absence of scene understanding. In this paper, we propose LIVE-GS, a highly realistic interactive VR system powered by LLM. After object-aware GS reconstruction, we prompt GPT-4o to analyze the physical properties of objects in the scene, which are used to guide physical simulations consistent with real phenomena. We also design a GPT-assisted GS inpainting module to fill the unseen area covered by manipulative objects. To perform a precise segmentation of Gaussian kernels, we propose a feature-mask segmentation strategy. To enable rich interaction, we further propose a computationally efficient physical simulation framework through an PBD-based unified interpolation method, supporting various physical forms such as rigid body, soft body, and granular materials. Our experimental results show that with the help of LLM's understanding and enhancement of scenes, our VR system can support complex and realistic interactions without additional manual design and annotation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Following formatting instructions to generate well-structured content is a fundamental yet often unmet capability for large language models (LLMs). To study this capability, which we refer to as format faithfulness, we present FormatBench, a comprehensive format-related benchmark. Compared to previous format-related benchmarks, FormatBench involves a greater variety of tasks in terms of application scenes (traditional NLP tasks, creative works, autonomous agency tasks), human-LLM interaction styles (single-turn instruction, multi-turn chat), and format types (inclusion, wrapping, length, coding). Moreover, each task in FormatBench is attached with a format checker program. Extensive experiments on the benchmark reveal that state-of-the-art open- and closed-source LLMs still suffer from severe deficiency in format faithfulness. By virtue of the decidable nature of formats, we propose to Reinforce Format Faithfulness (ReFF) to help LLMs generate formatted output as instructed without compromising general quality. Without any annotated data, ReFF can substantially improve the format faithfulness rate (e.g., from 21.6% in original LLaMA3 to 95.0% on caption segmentation task), while keep the general quality comparable (e.g., from 47.3 to 46.4 in F1 scores). Combined with labeled training data, ReFF can simultaneously improve both format faithfulness (e.g., from 21.6% in original LLaMA3 to 75.5%) and general quality (e.g., from 47.3 to 61.6 in F1 scores). We further offer an interpretability analysis to explain how ReFF improves both format faithfulness and general quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Background. Endowing intelligent systems with semantic data commonly requires designing and instantiating ontologies with domain-specific knowledge. Especially in the early phases, those activities are typically performed manually by human experts possibly leveraging on their own experience. The resulting process is therefore time-consuming, error-prone, and often biased by the personal background of the ontology designer. Objective. To mitigate that issue, we propose a novel domain-independent approach to automatically instantiate ontologies with domain-specific knowledge, by leveraging on large language models (LLMs) as oracles. Method. Starting from (i) an initial schema composed by inter-related classes and properties and (ii) a set of query templates, our method queries the LLM multiple times, and generates instances for both classes and properties from its replies. Thus, the ontology is automatically filled with domain-specific knowledge, compliant to the initial schema. As a result, the ontology is quickly and automatically enriched with manifold instances, which experts may consider to keep, adjust, discard, or complement according to their own needs and expertise. Contribution. We formalise our method in general way and instantiate it over various LLMs, as well as on a concrete case study. We report experiments rooted in the nutritional domain where an ontology of food meals and their ingredients is automatically instantiated from scratch, starting from a categorisation of meals and their relationships. There, we analyse the quality of the generated ontologies and compare ontologies attained by exploiting different LLMs. Experimentally, our approach achieves a quality metric that is up to five times higher than the state-of-the-art, while reducing erroneous entities and relations by up to ten times. Finally, we provide a SWOT analysis of the proposed method.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text embedding has become a foundational technology in natural language processing (NLP) during the deep learning era, driving advancements across a wide array of downstream tasks. While many natural language understanding challenges can now be modeled using generative paradigms and leverage the robust generative and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs), numerous practical applications, such as semantic matching, clustering, and information retrieval, continue to rely on text embeddings for their efficiency and effectiveness. In this survey, we categorize the interplay between LLMs and text embeddings into three overarching themes: (1) LLM-augmented text embedding, enhancing traditional embedding methods with LLMs; (2) LLMs as text embedders, utilizing their innate capabilities for embedding generation; and (3) Text embedding understanding with LLMs, leveraging LLMs to analyze and interpret embeddings. By organizing these efforts based on interaction patterns rather than specific downstream applications, we offer a novel and systematic overview of contributions from various research and application domains in the era of LLMs. Furthermore, we highlight the unresolved challenges that persisted in the pre-LLM era with pre-trained language models (PLMs) and explore the emerging obstacles brought forth by LLMs. Building on this analysis, we outline prospective directions for the evolution of text embedding, addressing both theoretical and practical opportunities in the rapidly advancing landscape of NLP.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various tasks using the in-context learning (ICL) paradigm. However, their effectiveness is often compromised by inherent bias, leading to prompt brittleness, i.e., sensitivity to design settings such as example selection, order, and prompt formatting. Previous studies have addressed LLM bias through external adjustment of model outputs, but the internal mechanisms that lead to such bias remain unexplored. Our work delves into these mechanisms, particularly investigating how feedforward neural networks (FFNs) and attention heads result in the bias of LLMs. By Interpreting the contribution of individual FFN vectors and attention heads, we identify the biased LLM components that skew LLMs' prediction toward specific labels. To mitigate these biases, we introduce UniBias, an inference-only method that effectively identifies and eliminates biased FFN vectors and attention heads. Extensive experiments across 12 NLP datasets demonstrate that UniBias significantly enhances ICL performance and alleviates prompt brittleness of LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has relied on specific combinations of herbs in prescriptions to treat various symptoms and signs for thousands of years. Predicting TCM prescriptions poses a fascinating technical challenge with significant practical implications. However, this task faces limitations due to the scarcity of high-quality clinical datasets and the complex relationship between symptoms and herbs. To address these issues, we introduce \textit{DigestDS}, a novel dataset comprising practical medical records from experienced experts in digestive system diseases. We also propose a method, TCM-FTP (TCM Fine-Tuning Pre-trained), to leverage pre-trained large language models (LLMs) via supervised fine-tuning on \textit{DigestDS}. Additionally, we enhance computational efficiency using a low-rank adaptation technique. Moreover, TCM-FTP incorporates data augmentation by permuting herbs within prescriptions, exploiting their order-agnostic nature. Impressively, TCM-FTP achieves an F1-score of 0.8031, significantly outperforming previous methods. Furthermore, it demonstrates remarkable accuracy in dosage prediction, achieving a normalized mean square error of 0.0604. In contrast, LLMs without fine-tuning exhibit poor performance. Although LLMs have demonstrated wide-ranging capabilities, our work underscores the necessity of fine-tuning for TCM prescription prediction and presents an effective way to accomplish this.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid advancement of Language Model technologies has opened new opportunities, but also introduced new challenges related to bias and fairness. This paper explores the uncharted territory of potential biases in state-of-the-art universal text embedding models towards specific document and query writing styles within Information Retrieval (IR) systems. Our investigation reveals that different embedding models exhibit different preferences of document writing style, while more informal and emotive styles are less favored by most embedding models. In terms of query writing styles, many embedding models tend to match the style of the query with the style of the retrieved documents, but some show a consistent preference for specific styles. Text embedding models fine-tuned on synthetic data generated by LLMs display a consistent preference for certain style of generated data. These biases in text embedding based IR systems can inadvertently silence or marginalize certain communication styles, thereby posing a significant threat to fairness in information retrieval. Finally, we also compare the answer styles of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems based on different LLMs and find out that most text embedding models are biased towards LLM's answer styles when used as evaluation metrics for answer correctness. This study sheds light on the critical issue of writing style based bias in IR systems, offering valuable insights for the development of more fair and robust models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> It is well known that LLM-based systems are data-hungry. Recent LLM-based TTS works typically employ complex data processing pipelines to obtain high-quality training data. These sophisticated pipelines require excellent models at each stage (e.g., speech denoising, speech enhancement, speaker diarization, and punctuation models), which themselves demand high-quality training data and are rarely open-sourced. Even with state-of-the-art models, issues persist, such as incomplete background noise removal and misalignment between punctuation and actual speech pauses. Moreover, the stringent filtering strategies often retain only 10-30\% of the original data, significantly impeding data scaling efforts. In this work, we leverage a noise-robust audio tokenizer (S3Tokenizer) to design a simplified yet effective TTS data processing pipeline that maintains data quality while substantially reducing data acquisition costs, achieving a data retention rate of over 50\%. Beyond data scaling challenges, LLM-based TTS systems also incur higher deployment costs compared to conventional approaches. Current systems typically use LLMs solely for text-to-token generation, while requiring separate models (e.g., flow matching models) for token-to-waveform generation, which cannot be directly executed by LLM inference engines, further complicating deployment. To address these challenges, we eliminate redundant modules in both LLM and flow components, replacing the flow model backbone with an LLM architecture. Building upon this simplified flow backbone, we propose a unified architecture for both streaming and non-streaming inference, significantly reducing deployment costs. Finally, we explore the feasibility of unifying TTS and ASR tasks using the same data for training, thanks to the simplified pipeline and the S3Tokenizer that reduces the quality requirements for TTS training data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Machine unlearning, the process of selectively removing data from trained models, is increasingly crucial for addressing privacy concerns and knowledge gaps post-deployment. Despite this importance, existing approaches are often heuristic and lack formal guarantees. In this paper, we analyze the fundamental utility, time, and space complexity trade-offs of approximate unlearning, providing rigorous certification analogous to differential privacy. For in-distribution forget data -- data similar to the retain set -- we show that a surprisingly simple and general procedure, empirical risk minimization with output perturbation, achieves tight unlearning-utility-complexity trade-offs, addressing a previous theoretical gap on the separation from unlearning "for free" via differential privacy, which inherently facilitates the removal of such data. However, such techniques fail with out-of-distribution forget data -- data significantly different from the retain set -- where unlearning time complexity can exceed that of retraining, even for a single sample. To address this, we propose a new robust and noisy gradient descent variant that provably amortizes unlearning time complexity without compromising utility.

This study introduces a novel approach, named ProSwitch, which enables a language model to switch between professional and non-professional answers, by tuning and evaluating through the guidance of domain and style knowledge. ProSwitch unfolds in three phases: LLM-augmented preparation to collect domain knowledge and QA pairs, instruction tuning to optimize LLMs with multiple levels of knowledge, and comprehensive evaluation to assess both style discrimination and reference-based quality of the generated text. Comparative analysis of ProSwitch against general and specialized LLMs reveals that our approach outperforms baselines in switching between professional and non-professional responses.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) present massive inherent knowledge and superior semantic comprehension capability, which have revolutionized various tasks in natural language processing. Despite their success, a critical gap remains in enabling LLMs to perform knowledge graph completion (KGC). Empirical evidence suggests that LLMs consistently perform worse than conventional KGC approaches, even through sophisticated prompt design or tailored instruction-tuning. Fundamentally, applying LLMs on KGC introduces several critical challenges, including a vast set of entity candidates, hallucination issue of LLMs, and under-exploitation of the graph structure. To address these challenges, we propose a novel instruction-tuning-based method, namely FtG. Specifically, we present a \textit{filter-then-generate} paradigm and formulate the KGC task into a multiple-choice question format. In this way, we can harness the capability of LLMs while mitigating the issue casused by hallucinations. Moreover, we devise a flexible ego-graph serialization prompt and employ a structure-text adapter to couple structure and text information in a contextualized manner. Experimental results demonstrate that FtG achieves substantial performance gain compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. The instruction dataset and code are available at \url{https://github.com/LB0828/FtG}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current RLHF frameworks for aligning large language models (LLMs) typically assume a fixed prompt distribution, which is sub-optimal and limits the scalability of alignment and generalizability of models. To address this, we introduce a general open-ended RLHF framework that casts alignment as an asymmetric game between two players: (i) a creator that generates increasingly informative prompt distributions using reward signals, and (ii) a solver that learns to produce more preferred responses on prompts produced by the creator. This framework of Evolving Alignment via Asymmetric Self-Play (eva), results in a simple and efficient approach that can utilize any existing RLHF algorithm for scalable alignment. eva outperforms state-of-the-art methods on widely-used benchmarks, without the need of any additional human crafted prompts. Specifically, eva improves the win rate of Gemma-2-9B-it on Arena-Hard from 51.6% to 60.1% with DPO, from 55.7% to 58.9% with SPPO, from 52.3% to 60.7% with SimPO, and from 54.8% to 60.3% with ORPO, surpassing its 27B version and matching claude-3-opus. This improvement is persistent even when new human crafted prompts are introduced. Finally, we show eva is effective and robust under various ablation settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have facilitated the definition of autonomous intelligent agents. Such agents have already demonstrated their potential in solving complex tasks in different domains. And they can further increase their performance when collaborating with other agents in a multi-agent system. However, the orchestration and coordination of these agents is still challenging, especially when they need to interact with humans as part of human-agentic collaborative workflows. These kinds of workflows need to be precisely specified so that it is clear whose responsible for each task, what strategies agents can follow to complete individual tasks or how decisions will be taken when different alternatives are proposed, among others. Current business process modeling languages fall short when it comes to specifying these new mixed collaborative scenarios. In this exploratory paper, we extend a well-known process modeling language (i.e., BPMN) to enable the definition of this new type of workflow. Our extension covers both the formalization of the new metamodeling concepts required and the proposal of a BPMN-like graphical notation to facilitate the definition of these workflows. Our extension has been implemented and is available as an open-source human-agentic workflow modeling editor on GitHub.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities across various language tasks, but solving complex reasoning problems remains a challenge. While existing methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) enhance reasoning by decomposing problems or structuring prompts, they typically perform a single pass of reasoning and may fail to revisit flawed paths, compromising accuracy. To address this, we propose a novel reasoning framework called Forest-of-Thought (FoT), which integrates multiple reasoning trees to leverage collective decision-making for solving complex logical problems. FoT utilizes sparse activation strategies to select the most relevant reasoning paths, improving both efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic self-correction strategy that enables real-time error correction and learning from past mistakes, as well as consensus-guided decision making strategies to optimize correctness and computational resources. Experimental results demonstrate that the FoT framework, combined with these strategies, significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, enabling them to solve complex tasks with greater precision and efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in comprehending and generating natural language, with a growing prevalence in the domain of recommendation systems. However, LLMs still face a significant challenge called prompt sensitivity, which refers to that it is highly susceptible to the influence of prompt words. This inconsistency in response to minor alterations in prompt input may compromise the accuracy and resilience of recommendation models. To address this issue, this paper proposes GANPrompt, a multi-dimensional LLMs prompt diversity framework based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The framework enhances the model's adaptability and stability to diverse prompts by integrating GANs generation techniques with the deep semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs. GANPrompt first trains a generator capable of producing diverse prompts by analysing multidimensional user behavioural data. These diverse prompts are then used to train the LLMs to improve its performance in the face of unseen prompts. Furthermore, to ensure a high degree of diversity and relevance of the prompts, this study introduces a mathematical theory-based diversity constraint mechanism that optimises the generated prompts to ensure that they are not only superficially distinct, but also semantically cover a wide range of user intentions. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, especially in improving the adaptability and robustness of recommendation systems in complex and dynamic environments. The experimental results demonstrate that GANPrompt yields substantial enhancements in accuracy and robustness relative to existing state-of-the-art methodologies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Embedded IoT system development is crucial for enabling seamless connectivity and functionality across a wide range of applications. However, such a complex process requires cross-domain knowledge of hardware and software and hence often necessitates direct developer involvement, making it labor-intensive, time-consuming, and error-prone. To address this challenge, this paper introduces EmbedGenius, the first fully automated software development platform for general-purpose embedded IoT systems. The key idea is to leverage the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and embedded system expertise to automate the hardware-in-the-loop development process. The main methods include a component-aware library resolution method for addressing hardware dependencies, a library knowledge generation method that injects utility domain knowledge into LLMs, and an auto-programming method that ensures successful deployment. We evaluate EmbedGenius's performance across 71 modules and four mainstream embedded development platforms with over 350 IoT tasks. Experimental results show that EmbedGenius can generate codes with an accuracy of 95.7% and complete tasks with a success rate of 86.5%, surpassing human-in-the-loop baselines by 15.6%--37.7% and 25.5%--53.4%, respectively. We also show EmbedGenius's potential through case studies in environmental monitoring and remote control systems development.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Phishing is a critical cyber threat, exploiting deceptive tactics to compromise victims and cause significant financial losses. While reference-based phishing detectors (RBPDs) achieve high precision by analyzing brand-domain consistency, their real-world deployment is hindered by challenges such as high latency and inefficiency in URL analysis. To address these limitations, we present PhishIntel, an end-to-end phishing detection system for real-world deployment. PhishIntel intelligently determines whether a URL can be processed immediately or not, segmenting the detection process into two distinct tasks: a fast task that checks against local blacklists and result cache, and a slow task that conducts online blacklist verification, URL crawling, and webpage analysis using an RBPD. This fast-slow task system architecture ensures low response latency while retaining the robust detection capabilities of RBPDs for zero-day phishing threats. Furthermore, we develop two downstream applications based on PhishIntel: a phishing intelligence platform and a phishing email detection plugin for Microsoft Outlook, demonstrating its practical efficacy and utility.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The discovery of customer intention from dialogue plays an important role in automated support system. However, traditional text clustering methods are poorly aligned with human perceptions due to the shift from embedding distance to semantic distance, and existing quantitative metrics for text clustering may not accurately reflect the true quality of intent clusters. In this paper, we leverage the superior language understanding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for designing better-calibrated intent clustering algorithms. We first establish the foundation by verifying the robustness of fine-tuned LLM utility in semantic coherence evaluation and cluster naming, resulting in an accuracy of 97.50% and 94.40%, respectively, when compared to the human-labeled ground truth. Then, we propose an iterative clustering algorithm that facilitates cluster-level refinement and the continuous discovery of high-quality intent clusters. Furthermore, we present several LLM-in-the-loop semi-supervised clustering techniques tailored for intent discovery from customer service dialogue. Experiments on a large-scale industrial dataset comprising 1,507 intent clusters demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. The methods outperformed existing counterparts, achieving 6.25% improvement in quantitative metrics and 12% enhancement in application-level performance when constructing an intent classifier.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The integration of large language models (LLMs) into computing education offers many potential benefits to student learning, and several novel pedagogical approaches have been reported in the literature. However LLMs also present challenges, one of the most commonly cited being that of student over-reliance. This challenge is compounded by the fact that LLMs are always available to provide instant help and solutions to students, which can undermine their ability to independently solve problems and diagnose and resolve errors. Providing instructor oversight of LLM-generated content can mitigate this problem, however it is often not practical in real-time learning contexts. Online class discussion forums, which are widely used in computing education, present an opportunity for exploring instructor oversight because they operate asynchronously. Unlike real-time interactions, the discussion forum format aligns with the expectation that responses may take time, making oversight not only feasible but also pedagogically appropriate. In this practitioner paper, we present the design, deployment, and evaluation of a `bot' module that is controlled by the instructor, and integrated into an online discussion forum. The bot assists the instructor by generating draft responses to student questions, which are reviewed, modified, and approved before release. Key features include the ability to leverage course materials, access archived discussions, and publish responses anonymously to encourage open participation. We report our experiences using this tool in a 12-week second-year software engineering course on object-oriented programming. Instructor feedback confirmed the tool successfully alleviated workload but highlighted a need for improvement in handling complex, context-dependent queries. We report the features that were viewed as most beneficial, and suggest avenues for future exploration.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Implicit sentiment analysis (ISA) presents significant challenges due to the absence of salient cue words. Previous methods have struggled with insufficient data and limited reasoning capabilities to infer underlying opinions. Integrating multi-task learning (MTL) with large language models (LLMs) offers the potential to enable models of varying sizes to reliably perceive and recognize genuine opinions in ISA. However, existing MTL approaches are constrained by two sources of uncertainty: data-level uncertainty, arising from hallucination problems in LLM-generated contextual information, and task-level uncertainty, stemming from the varying capacities of models to process contextual information. To handle these uncertainties, we introduce MT-ISA, a novel MTL framework that enhances ISA by leveraging the generation and reasoning capabilities of LLMs through automatic MTL. Specifically, MT-ISA constructs auxiliary tasks using generative LLMs to supplement sentiment elements and incorporates automatic MTL to fully exploit auxiliary data. We introduce data-level and task-level automatic weight learning (AWL), which dynamically identifies relationships and prioritizes more reliable data and critical tasks, enabling models of varying sizes to adaptively learn fine-grained weights based on their reasoning capabilities. We investigate three strategies for data-level AWL, while also introducing homoscedastic uncertainty for task-level AWL. Extensive experiments reveal that models of varying sizes achieve an optimal balance between primary prediction and auxiliary tasks in MT-ISA. This underscores the effectiveness and adaptability of our approach.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Entity matching (EM) is a critical step in entity resolution (ER). Recently, entity matching based on large language models (LLMs) has shown great promise. However, current LLM-based entity matching approaches typically follow a binary matching paradigm that ignores the global consistency among record relationships. In this paper, we investigate various methodologies for LLM-based entity matching that incorporate record interactions from different perspectives. Specifically, we comprehensively compare three representative strategies: matching, comparing, and selecting, and analyze their respective advantages and challenges in diverse scenarios. Based on our findings, we further design a compound entity matching framework (ComEM) that leverages the composition of multiple strategies and LLMs. ComEM benefits from the advantages of different sides and achieves improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results on 8 ER datasets and 10 LLMs verify the superiority of incorporating record interactions through the selecting strategy, as well as the further cost-effectiveness brought by ComEM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Enabling LLMs to handle lengthy context is currently a research hotspot. Most LLMs are built upon rotary position embedding (RoPE), a popular position encoding method. Therefore, a prominent path is to extrapolate the RoPE trained on comparably short texts to far longer texts. A heavy bunch of efforts have been dedicated to boosting the extrapolation via extending the formulations of the RoPE, however, few of them have attempted to showcase their inner workings comprehensively. In this paper, we are driven to offer a straightforward yet in-depth understanding of RoPE extensions from an attention perspective and on two benchmarking tasks. A broad array of experiments reveals several valuable findings: 1) Maintaining attention patterns to those at the pretrained length improves extrapolation; 2) Large attention uncertainty leads to retrieval errors; 3) Using longer continual pretraining lengths for RoPE extensions could reduce attention uncertainty and significantly enhance extrapolation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language models (LLMs) have become a research hotspot. To accelerate the inference of LLMs, storing computed caches in memory has become the standard technique. However, as the inference length increases, growing KV caches might lead to out-of-memory issues. Many existing methods address this issue through KV cache compression, primarily by preserving key tokens throughout all layers to reduce information loss. Most of them allocate a uniform budget size for each layer to retain. However, we observe that the minimum budget sizes needed to retain essential information vary across layers and models based on the perspectives of attention and hidden state output. Building on this observation, this paper proposes a simple yet effective KV cache compression method that leverages layer uncertainty to allocate budget size for each layer. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce memory usage of the KV caches to only $\sim$20\% when compared to Full KV inference while achieving nearly lossless performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable few-shot learning capabilities and unified the paradigm of NLP tasks through the in-context learning (ICL) technique. Despite the success of ICL, the quality of the exemplar demonstrations can significantly influence the LLM's performance. Existing exemplar selection methods mainly focus on the semantic similarity between queries and candidate exemplars. On the other hand, the logical connections between reasoning steps can be beneficial to depict the problem-solving process as well. In this paper, we proposes a novel method named Reasoning Graph-enhanced Exemplar Retrieval (RGER). RGER first quires LLM to generate an initial response, then expresses intermediate problem-solving steps to a graph structure. After that, it employs graph kernel to select exemplars with semantic and structural similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the structural relationship is helpful to the alignment of queries and candidate exemplars. The efficacy of RGER on math and logit reasoning tasks showcases its superiority over state-of-the-art retrieval-based approaches. Our code is released at https://github.com/Yukang-Lin/RGER.

Previous research suggests that solving such puzzles is challenging even for modern NLP models, including Large Language Models (LLMs). However, there is little to no research on the reasons for their poor performance on this task. In this paper, we establish the benchmark results for three popular LLMs: Gemma2, LLaMA3 and ChatGPT, showing that their performance on this task is still significantly below that of humans. We also investigate why these models struggle to achieve superior performance. We release our code and introduced datasets at https://github.com/bodasadallah/decrypting-crosswords.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have demonstrated remarkable potential as question answering systems in the K-12 Education domain, where knowledge is typically queried within the restricted scope of authoritative textbooks. However, the discrepancy between textbooks and the parametric knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs) could undermine the effectiveness of RAG systems. To systematically investigate the robustness of RAG systems under such knowledge discrepancies, we present EduKDQA, a question answering dataset that simulates knowledge discrepancies in real applications by applying hypothetical knowledge updates in answers and source documents. EduKDQA includes 3,005 questions covering five subjects, under a comprehensive question typology from the perspective of context utilization and knowledge integration. We conducted extensive experiments on retrieval and question answering performance. We find that most RAG systems suffer from a substantial performance drop in question answering with knowledge discrepancies, while questions that require integration of contextual knowledge and parametric knowledge pose a challenge to LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper addresses the cost-efficiency aspect of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). RLHF leverages datasets of human preferences over outputs of large language models (LLM)s to instill human expectations into LLMs. Although preference annotation comes with a monetized cost, the economic utility of a preference dataset has not been considered by far. What exacerbates this situation is that, given complex intransitive or cyclic relationships in preference datasets, existing algorithms for fine-tuning LLMs are still far from capturing comprehensive preferences. This raises severe cost-efficiency concerns in production environments, where preference data accumulate over time. In this paper, we discuss the fine-tuning of LLMs as a monetized economy and introduce an auction mechanism to improve the efficiency of preference data collection in dollar terms. We show that introducing an auction mechanism can play an essential role in enhancing the cost-efficiency of RLHF, while maintaining satisfactory model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed auction-based protocol is cost-effective for fine-tuning LLMs concentrating on high-quality feedback.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces RuleArena, a novel and challenging benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow complex, real-world rules in reasoning. Covering three practical domains -- airline baggage fees, NBA transactions, and tax regulations -- RuleArena assesses LLMs' proficiency in handling intricate natural language instructions that demand long-context understanding, logical reasoning, and accurate mathematical computation. Two key attributes distinguish RuleArena from traditional rule-based reasoning benchmarks: (1) it extends beyond standard first-order logic representations, and (2) it is grounded in authentic, practical scenarios, providing insights into the suitability and reliability of LLMs for real-world applications. Our findings reveal several notable limitations in LLMs: (1) they struggle to identify and apply the appropriate rules, frequently becoming confused by similar but distinct regulations, (2) they cannot consistently perform accurate mathematical computations, even when they correctly identify the relevant rules, and (3) in general, they perform poorly in the benchmark. These results highlight significant challenges in advancing LLMs' rule-guided reasoning capabilities in real-life applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Query-focused summarization over multi-table data is a challenging yet critical task for extracting precise and relevant information from structured data. Existing methods often rely on complex preprocessing steps and struggle to generalize across domains or handle the logical reasoning required for multi-table queries. In this paper, we propose QueryTableSummarizer++, an end-to-end generative framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced with table-aware pre-training, query-aligned fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning with feedback. Our method eliminates the need for intermediate serialization steps and directly generates query-relevant summaries. Experiments on a benchmark dataset demonstrate that QueryTableSummarizer++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of BLEU, ROUGE, and F1-score. Additional analyses highlight its scalability, generalization across domains, and robust handling of complex queries. Human evaluation further validates the superior quality and practical applicability of the generated summaries, establishing QueryTableSummarizer++ as a highly effective solution for multi-table summarization tasks.

Our method introduces two key objectives: a retrieval-generation alignment loss to optimize the quality of selected examples and a semantic coherence loss to ensure cross-lingual consistency. Through extensive experiments on multilingual benchmarks, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Further analysis highlights its robustness across diverse language families and its ability to generalize to unseen tasks. Human evaluations confirm the superior fluency, relevance, and semantic correctness of outputs generated by our method. This work provides a scalable, effective, and generalizable solution for cross-lingual in-context learning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, directly using large language models (LLMs) has been shown to be the most reliable method to evaluate QA models. However, it suffers from limited interpretability, high cost, and environmental harm. To address these, we propose to use soft EM with entity-driven answer set expansion. Our approach expands the gold answer set to include diverse surface forms, based on the observation that the surface forms often follow particular patterns depending on the entity type. The experimental results show that our method outperforms traditional evaluation methods by a large margin. Moreover, the reliability of our evaluation method is comparable to that of LLM-based ones, while offering the benefits of high interpretability and reduced environmental harm.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success with their billion-level parameters, yet they incur high inference overheads. The emergence of activation sparsity in LLMs provides a natural approach to reduce this cost by involving only parts of the parameters for inference. However, existing methods only focus on utilizing this naturally formed activation sparsity in a post-training setting, overlooking the potential for further amplifying this inherent sparsity. In this paper, we hypothesize that LLMs can learn to be efficient by achieving more structured activation sparsity. To achieve this, we introduce a novel training algorithm, Learn-To-be-Efficient (LTE), designed to train efficiency-aware LLMs to learn to activate fewer neurons and achieve a better trade-off between sparsity and performance. Furthermore, unlike SOTA MoEfication methods, which mainly focus on ReLU-based models, LTE can also be applied to LLMs like LLaMA using non-ReLU activations. Extensive evaluation on language understanding, language generation, and instruction tuning tasks show that LTE consistently outperforms SOTA baselines. Along with our hardware-aware custom kernel implementation, LTE reduces LLaMA2-7B inference latency by 25% at 50% sparsity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Conformal Prediction (CP) has attracted great attention from the research community due to its strict theoretical guarantees. However, researchers and developers still face challenges of applicability and efficiency when applying CP algorithms to deep learning models. In this paper, we introduce \torchcp, a comprehensive PyTorch-based toolkit to strengthen the usability of CP for deep learning models. \torchcp implements a wide range of post-hoc and training methods of conformal prediction for various machine learning tasks, including classification, regression, GNN, and LLM. Moreover, we provide user-friendly interfaces and extensive evaluations to easily integrate CP algorithms into specific tasks. Our \torchcp toolkit, built entirely with PyTorch, enables high-performance GPU acceleration for deep learning models and mini-batch computation on large-scale datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Although people are impressed by the content generation skills of large language models, the use of LLMs, such as ChatGPT, is limited by the domain grounding of the content. The correctness and groundedness of the generated content need to be based on a verified context, such as results from Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). One important issue when adapting LLMs to a customized domain is that the generated responses are often incomplete, or the additions are not verified and may even be hallucinated. Prior studies on hallucination detection have focused on evaluation metrics, which are not easily adaptable to dynamic domains and can be vulnerable to attacks like jail-breaking. In this work, we propose 1) a post-processing algorithm that leverages knowledge triplets in RAG context to correct hallucinations and 2) a dual-decoder model that fuses RAG context to guide the generation process.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Interpretability is a key challenge in fostering trust for Large Language Models (LLMs), which stems from the complexity of extracting reasoning from model's parameters. We present the Frame Representation Hypothesis, a theoretically robust framework grounded in the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) to interpret and control LLMs by modeling multi-token words. Prior research explored LRH to connect LLM representations with linguistic concepts, but was limited to single token analysis. As most words are composed of several tokens, we extend LRH to multi-token words, thereby enabling usage on any textual data with thousands of concepts. To this end, we propose words can be interpreted as frames, ordered sequences of vectors that better capture token-word relationships. Then, concepts can be represented as the average of word frames sharing a common concept. We showcase these tools through Top-k Concept-Guided Decoding, which can intuitively steer text generation using concepts of choice. We verify said ideas on Llama 3.1, Gemma 2, and Phi 3 families, demonstrating gender and language biases, exposing harmful content, but also potential to remediate them, leading to safer and more transparent LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/phvv-me/frame-representation-hypothesis.git

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Traditional accelerators, while effective, suffer from extensive spatial and financial demands, necessitating the exploration of compact alternatives like PWFA, which significantly reduces the necessary accelerator length by utilizing the wake generated by a high-speed pulse traveling through plasma. Our research focuses on mitigating instabilities, particularly timing jitter, which critically impacts the quality of accelerated beams. Through the deployment of Impact-T, Bmad, and Tao simulation tools at the FACET-II facility, we examined how timing jitter influences key beam parameters, including peak currents and emittance, over various simulation scenarios. The findings reveal that even minute variations in accelerator settings can significantly influence beam characteristics, underscoring the importance of precise control in beam dynamics. The outcomes contribute to enhancing the reliability and precision of PWFA systems, promising improved applications in both scientific research and medical therapies. Future research directions include integrating machine learning techniques to refine control strategies further and reduce experimental redundancies, highlighting the evolving synergy between accelerator physics and computational data science.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Channel prediction permits to acquire channel state information (CSI) without signaling overhead. However, almost all existing channel prediction methods necessitate the deployment of a dedicated model to accommodate a specific configuration. Leveraging the powerful modeling and multi-task learning capabilities of foundation models, we propose the first space-time-frequency (STF) wireless foundation model (WiFo) to address time-frequency channel prediction tasks in a one-for-all manner. Specifically, WiFo is initially pre-trained over massive and extensive diverse CSI datasets. Then, the model will be instantly used for channel prediction under various CSI configurations without any fine-tuning. We propose a masked autoencoder (MAE)-based network structure for WiFo to handle heterogeneous STF CSI data, and design several mask reconstruction tasks for self-supervised pre-training to capture the inherent 3D variations of CSI. To fully unleash its predictive power, we build a large-scale heterogeneous simulated CSI dataset consisting of 160K CSI samples for pre-training. Simulations validate its superior unified learning performance across multiple datasets and demonstrate its state-of-the-art (SOTA) zero-shot generalization performance via comparisons with other full-shot baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Model-based Dense Retrieval (LLM-DR) optimizes over numerous heterogeneous fine-tuning collections from different domains. However, the discussion about its training data distribution is still minimal. Previous studies rely on empirically assigned dataset choices or sampling ratios, which inevitably lead to sub-optimal retrieval performances. In this paper, we propose a new task-level Distributionally Robust Optimization (tDRO) algorithm for LLM-DR fine-tuning, targeted at improving the universal domain generalization ability by end-to-end reweighting the data distribution of each task. The tDRO parameterizes the domain weights and updates them with scaled domain gradients. The optimized weights are then transferred to the LLM-DR fine-tuning to train more robust retrievers. Experiments show optimal improvements in large-scale retrieval benchmarks and reduce up to 30% dataset usage after applying our optimization algorithm with a series of different-sized LLM-DR models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce Lexico, a novel KV cache compression method that leverages sparse coding with a universal dictionary. Our key finding is that key-value cache in modern LLMs can be accurately approximated using sparse linear combination from a small, input-agnostic dictionary of ~4k atoms, enabling efficient compression across different input prompts, tasks and models. Using orthogonal matching pursuit for sparse approximation, Lexico achieves flexible compression ratios through direct sparsity control. On GSM8K, across multiple model families (Mistral, Llama 3, Qwen2.5), Lexico maintains 90-95% of the original performance while using only 15-25% of the full KV-cache memory, outperforming both quantization and token eviction methods. Notably, Lexico remains effective in low memory regimes where 2-bit quantization fails, achieving up to 1.7x better compression on LongBench and GSM8K while maintaining high accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In order to address the issue of limited data samples for the deployment of pre-trained models in unseen environments, this paper proposes a residual channel-based data augmentation strategy for Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI), coupled with a lightweight SimSiam contrastive learning framework. By applying least square (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimations followed by equalization, signals with different residual channel effects are generated. These residual channels enable the model to learn more effective representations. Then the pre-trained model is fine-tuned with 1% samples in a novel environment for RFFI. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances both feature extraction ability and generalization while requiring fewer samples and less time, making it suitable for practical wireless security applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rise of various social platforms has transformed journalism. The growing demand for news content has led to the increased use of large language models (LLMs) in news production due to their speed and cost-effectiveness. However, LLMs still encounter limitations in professionalism and ethical judgment in news generation. Additionally, predicting public feedback is usually difficult before news is released. To tackle these challenges, we introduce AI-Press, an automated news drafting and polishing system based on multi-agent collaboration and Retrieval-Augmented Generation. We develop a feedback simulation system that generates public feedback considering demographic distributions. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our system shows significant improvements in news-generating capabilities and verifies the effectiveness of public feedback simulation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite recent efforts to develop large language models with robust long-context capabilities, the lack of long-context benchmarks means that relatively little is known about their performance. To alleviate this gap, in this paper, we propose \textbf{Counting-Stars}, a multi-evidence, position-aware, and scalable benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-evidence retrieval capabilities of long-context LLMs. \textbf{Counting-Stars} comprises two counting-based multiple pieces of evidence retrieval tasks: searching and reasoning. Using Counting-Stars, we conducted experiments to evaluate several long-context LLMs, including GPT-4 Turbo, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude3 Opus, GLM-4, and Moonshot-v1. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Gemini 1.5 Pro achieves the best overall results, while GPT-4 Turbo exhibits the most stable performance across various tasks. Furthermore, our analysis of these LLMs, which have been extended to handle long-context scenarios, indicates that significant room for improvement remains as the length of the input context and the complexity of the tasks increase.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantization stands as a pivotal technique for large language model (LLM) serving, yet it poses significant challenges particularly in achieving effective low-bit quantization. The limited numerical mapping makes the quantized model produce a non-trivial error, bringing out intolerable performance degration. This paper is anchored in the basic idea of model compression objectives, and delves into the layer-wise error distribution of LLMs during post-training quantization. Subsequently, we introduce ASER, an algorithm consisting of (1) Error Reconstruction: low-rank compensation for quantization error with LoRA-style matrices constructed by whitening SVD; (2) Activation Smoothing: outlier extraction to gain smooth activation and better error compensation. ASER is capable of quantizing typical LLMs to low-bit ones, particularly preserving accuracy even in W4A8 per-channel setup. Experimental results show that ASER is competitive among the state-of-the-art quantization algorithms, showing potential to activation quantization, with minor overhead.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Assessing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in performing different tasks is crucial for understanding their strengths and weaknesses. This paper presents Hierarchical Prompting Taxonomy (HPT), grounded on human cognitive principles and designed to assess LLMs by examining the cognitive demands of various tasks. The HPT utilizes the Hierarchical Prompting Framework (HPF), which structures five unique prompting strategies in a hierarchical order based on their cognitive requirement on LLMs when compared to human mental capabilities. It assesses the complexity of tasks with the Hierarchical Prompting Index (HPI), which demonstrates the cognitive competencies of LLMs across diverse datasets and offers insights into the cognitive demands that datasets place on different LLMs. This approach enables a comprehensive evaluation of an LLMs problem solving abilities and the intricacy of a dataset, offering a standardized metric for task complexity. Extensive experiments with multiple datasets and LLMs show that HPF enhances LLM performance by 2% to 63% compared to baseline performance, with GSM8k being the most cognitively complex task among reasoning and coding tasks with an average HPI of 3.20 confirming the effectiveness of HPT. To support future research and reproducibility in this domain, the implementations of HPT and HPF are available here.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper proposes LATTE, the first static binary taint analysis that is powered by a large language model (LLM). LATTE is superior to the state of the art (e.g., Emtaint, Arbiter, Karonte) in three aspects. First, LATTE is fully automated while prior static binary taint analyzers need rely on human expertise to manually customize taint propagation rules and vulnerability inspection rules. Second, LATTE is significantly effective in vulnerability detection, demonstrated by our comprehensive evaluations. For example, LATTE has found 37 new bugs in real-world firmware which the baselines failed to find, and 7 of them have been assigned CVE numbers. Lastly, LATTE incurs remarkably low engineering cost, making it a cost-efficient and scalable solution for security researchers and practitioners. We strongly believe that LATTE opens up a new direction to harness the recent advance in LLMs to improve vulnerability analysis for binary programs.
