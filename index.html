                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In our recent research, we have developed a framework called GraphSnapShot, which has been proven an useful tool for graph learning acceleration. GraphSnapShot is a framework for fast cache, storage, retrieval and computation for graph learning. It can quickly store and update the local topology of graph structure and allows us to track patterns in the structure of graph networks, just like take snapshots of the graphs. In experiments, GraphSnapShot shows efficiency, it can achieve up to 30% training acceleration and 73% memory reduction for lossless graph ML training compared to current baselines such as dgl.This technique is particular useful for large dynamic graph learning tasks such as social media analysis and recommendation systems to process complex relationships between entities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The possibility of using the Eulerian discretization for the problem of modelling high-dimensional distributions and sampling, is studied. The problem is posed as a minimization problem over the space of probability measures with respect to the Wasserstein distance and solved with entropy-regularized JKO scheme. Each proximal step can be formulated as a fixed-point equation and solved with accelerated methods, such as Anderson's. The usage of low-rank Tensor Train format allows to overcome the \emph{curse of dimensionality}, i.e. the exponential growth of degrees of freedom with dimension, inherent to Eulerian approaches. The resulting method requires only pointwise computations of the unnormalized posterior and is, in particular, gradient-free. Fixed Eulerian grid allows to employ a caching strategy, significally reducing the expensive evaluations of the posterior. When the Eulerian model of the target distribution is fitted, the passage back to the Lagrangian perspective can also be made, allowing to approximately sample from it. We test our method both for synthetic target distributions and particular Bayesian inverse problems and report comparable or better performance than the baseline Metropolis-Hastings MCMC with same amount of resources. Finally, the fitted model can be modified to facilitate the solution of certain associated problems, which we demonstrate by fitting an importance distribution for a particular quantity of interest.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper proposes an intelligent cache management strategy based on CNN-LSTM to improve the performance and cache hit rate of storage systems. Through comparative experiments with traditional algorithms (such as LRU and LFU) and other deep learning models (such as RNN, GRU-RNN and LSTM), the results show that the CNN-LSTM model has significant advantages in cache demand prediction. The MSE and MAE values of this model are significantly reduced, proving its effectiveness under complex data access patterns. This study not only verifies the potential of deep learning technology in storage system optimization, but also provides direction and reference for further optimizing and improving cache management strategies. This intelligent cache management strategy performs well in complex storage environments. By combining the spatial feature extraction capabilities of convolutional neural networks and the time series modeling capabilities of long short-term memory networks, the CNN-LSTM model can more accurately predict cache needs, thereby Dynamically optimize cache allocation to improve system response speed and resource utilization. This research provides theoretical support and practical reference for cache optimization under large-scale data access modes, and is of great significance to improving the performance of future storage systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The typical selective state-space model (SSM) of Mamba addresses several limitations of Transformers, such as quadratic computational complexity with sequence length and significant inference-time memory requirements due to the key-value cache. However, the growing size of Mamba models continues to pose training and deployment challenges and raises environmental concerns due to considerable energy consumption. In this work, we introduce Bi-Mamba, a scalable and powerful 1-bit Mamba architecture designed for more efficient large language models with multiple sizes across 780M, 1.3B, and 2.7B. Bi-Mamba models are trained from scratch on data volume as regular LLM pertaining using an autoregressive distillation loss. Extensive experimental results on language modeling demonstrate that Bi-Mamba achieves performance comparable to its full-precision counterparts (e.g., FP16 or BF16) and much better accuracy than post-training-binarization (PTB) Mamba baselines, while significantly reducing memory footprint and energy consumption compared to the original Mamba model. Our study pioneers a new linear computational complexity LLM framework under low-bit representation and facilitates the future design of specialized hardware tailored for efficient 1-bit Mamba-based LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, with the significant evolution of multi-modal large models, many recommender researchers realized the potential of multi-modal information for user interest modeling. In industry, a wide-used modeling architecture is a cascading paradigm: (1) first pre-training a multi-modal model to provide omnipotent representations for downstream services; (2) The downstream recommendation model takes the multi-modal representation as additional input to fit real user-item behaviours. Although such paradigm achieves remarkable improvements, however, there still exist two problems that limit model performance: (1) Representation Unmatching: The pre-trained multi-modal model is always supervised by the classic NLP/CV tasks, while the recommendation models are supervised by real user-item interaction. As a result, the two fundamentally different tasks' goals were relatively separate, and there was a lack of consistent objective on their representations; (2) Representation Unlearning: The generated multi-modal representations are always stored in cache store and serve as extra fixed input of recommendation model, thus could not be updated by recommendation model gradient, further unfriendly for downstream training. Inspired by the two difficulties challenges in downstream tasks usage, we introduce a quantitative multi-modal framework to customize the specialized and trainable multi-modal information for different downstream models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Building a high-performance JIT-capable VM for a dynamic language has traditionally required a tremendous amount of time, money, and expertise. We present Deegen, a meta-compiler that allows users to generate a high-performance JIT-capable VM for their own language at an engineering cost similar to writing a simple interpreter. Deegen takes in the execution semantics of the bytecodes implemented as C++ functions, and automatically generates a two-tier VM execution engine with a state-of-the-art interpreter, a state-of-the-art baseline JIT, and the tier-switching logic that connects them into a self-adaptive system.   We are the first to demonstrate the automatic generation of a JIT compiler, and the automatic generation of an interpreter that outperforms the state of the art. Our performance comes from a long list of optimizations supported by Deegen, including bytecode specialization and quickening, register pinning, tag register optimization, call inline caching, generic inline caching, JIT polymorphic IC, JIT IC inline slab, type-check removal and strength reduction, type-based slow-path extraction and outlining, JIT hot-cold code splitting, and JIT OSR-entry. These optimizations are either employed automatically, or guided by the language implementer through intuitive APIs. As a result, the disassembly of the Deegen-generated interpreter, baseline JIT, and the generated JIT code rivals the assembly code hand-written by experts in state-of-the-art VMs.   We implement LuaJIT Remake (LJR), a standard-compliant Lua 5.1 VM, using Deegen. Across 44 benchmarks, LJR's interpreter is on average 179% faster than the official PUC Lua interpreter, and 31% faster than LuaJIT's interpreter. LJR's baseline JIT has negligible startup delay, and its execution performance is on average 360% faster than PUC Lua and only 33% slower (but faster on 13/44 benchmarks) than LuaJIT's optimizing JIT.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents an accelerated spherical K-means clustering algorithm for large-scale and high-dimensional sparse document data sets. We design an algorithm working in an architecture-friendly manner (AFM), which is a procedure of suppressing performance-degradation factors such as the numbers of instructions, branch mispredictions, and cache misses in CPUs of a modern computer system. For the AFM operation, we leverage unique universal characteristics (UCs) of a data-object and a cluster's mean set, which are skewed distributions on data relationships such as Zipf's law and a feature-value concentration phenomenon. The UCs indicate that the most part of the number of multiplications for similarity calculations is executed regarding terms with high document frequencies (df) and the most part of a similarity between an object- and a mean-feature vector is obtained by the multiplications regarding a few high mean-feature values. Our proposed algorithm applies an inverted-index data structure to a mean set, extracts the specific region with high-df terms and high mean-feature values in the mean-inverted index by newly introduced two structural parameters, and exploits the index divided into three parts for efficient pruning. The algorithm determines the two structural parameters by minimizing the approximate number of multiplications related to that of instructions, reduces the branch mispredictions by sharing the index structure including the two parameters with all the objects, and suppressing the cache misses by keeping in the caches the frequently used data in the foregoing specific region, resulting in working in the AFM. We experimentally demonstrate that our algorithm efficiently achieves superior speed performance in large-scale documents compared with algorithms using the state-of-the-art techniques.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The growing volume of graph data may exhaust the main memory. It is crucial to design a disk-based graph storage system to ingest updates and analyze graphs efficiently. However, existing dynamic graph storage systems suffer from read or write amplification and face the challenge of optimizing both read and write performance simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose LSMGraph, a novel dynamic graph storage system that combines the write-friendly LSM-tree and the read-friendly CSR. It leverages the multi-level structure of LSM-trees to optimize write performance while utilizing the compact CSR structures embedded in the LSM-trees to boost read performance. LSMGraph uses a new memory structure, MemGraph, to efficiently cache graph updates and uses a multi-level index to speed up reads within the multi-level structure. Furthermore, LSMGraph incorporates a vertex-grained version control mechanism to mitigate the impact of LSM-tree compaction on read performance and ensure the correctness of concurrent read and write operations. Our evaluation shows that LSMGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (graph) storage systems on both graph update and graph analytical workloads.

Central to KV-Tandem is~\emph{LSM bypass} -- a novel algorithm that offers a fast path to basic operations while ensuring the correctness of advanced APIs.   We implement KV-Tandem in \emph{XDP-Rocks}, a RocksDB-compatible storage engine that leverages the XDP KVS and incorporates practical design optimizations for real-world deployment. Through extensive microbenchmark and system-level comparisons, we demonstrate that XDP-Rocks achieves 3x to 4x performance improvements over RocksDB across various workloads. XDP-Rocks is already deployed in production, delivering significant operator cost savings consistent with these performance gains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Softmax attention mechanism in Transformer models is notoriously computationally expensive, particularly due to its quadratic complexity, posing significant challenges in vision applications. In contrast, linear attention provides a far more efficient solution by reducing the complexity to linear levels. However, compared to Softmax attention, linear attention often experiences significant performance degradation. Our experiments indicate that this performance drop is due to the low-rank nature of linear attention's feature map, which hinders its ability to adequately model complex spatial information. In this paper, to break the low-rank dilemma of linear attention, we conduct rank analysis from two perspectives: the KV buffer and the output features. Consequently, we introduce Rank-Augmented Linear Attention (RALA), which rivals the performance of Softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity and high efficiency. Based on RALA, we construct the Rank-Augmented Vision Linear Transformer (RAVLT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAVLT achieves excellent performance across various vision tasks. Specifically, without using any additional labels, data, or supervision during training, RAVLT achieves an 84.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k with only 26M parameters and 4.6G FLOPs. This result significantly surpasses previous linear attention mechanisms, fully illustrating the potential of RALA. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/RALA.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Operating Systems enforce logical isolation using abstractions such as processes, containers, and isolation technologies to protect a system from malicious or buggy code. In this paper, we show new types of side channels through the file system that break this logical isolation. The file system plays a critical role in the operating system, managing all I/O activities between the application layer and the physical storage device. We observe that the file system implementation is shared, leading to timing leakage when using common I/O system calls. Specifically, we found that modern operating systems take advantage of any flush operation (which saves cached blocks in memory to the SSD or disk) to flush all of the I/O buffers, even those used by other isolation domains. Thus, by measuring the delay of syncfs, the attacker can infer the I/O behavior of victim programs. We then demonstrate a syncfs covert channel attack on multiple file systems, including both Linux native file systems and the Windows file system, achieving a maximum bandwidth of 5 Kbps with an error rate of 0.15% on Linux and 7.6 Kbps with an error rate of 1.9% on Windows. In addition, we construct three side-channel attacks targeting both Linux and Android devices. On Linux devices, we implement a website fingerprinting attack and a video fingerprinting attack by tracking the write patterns of temporary buffering files. On Android devices, we design an application fingerprinting attack that leaks application write patterns during boot-up. The attacks achieve over 90% F1 score, precision, and recall. Finally, we demonstrate that these attacks can be exploited across containers implementing a container detection technique and a cross-container covert channel attack.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based NLP models are powerful but have high computational costs that limit deployment. Finetuned encoder-decoder models are popular in specialized domains and can outperform larger more generalized decoder-only models, such as GPT-4. We introduce a new configuration for encoder-decoder models that improves efficiency on structured output and decomposable tasks where multiple outputs are required for a single shared input. Our method, prompt-in-decoder (PiD), encodes the input once and decodes the output in parallel, boosting both training and inference efficiency by avoiding duplicate input encoding and increasing the operational intensity (ratio of numbers of arithmetic operation to memory access) of decoding process by sharing the input key-value cache. We achieve computation reduction that roughly scales with the number of subtasks, gaining up to 4.6x speed-up over state-of-the-art models for dialogue state tracking, summarization, and question-answering tasks, with comparable or better performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The vision tokens in multimodal large language models usually exhibit significant spatial and temporal redundancy and take up most of the input tokens, which harms their inference efficiency. To solve this problem, some recent works were introduced to drop the unimportant tokens during inference where the importance of each token is decided only by the information in either the vision encoding stage or the prefilling stage. In this paper, we propose Multi-stage Token Dropping (MustDrop) to measure the importance of each token from the whole lifecycle, including the vision encoding stage, prefilling stage, and decoding stage. Concretely, in the visual encoding stage, MustDrop merges spatially adjacent tokens with high similarity, and establishes a key token set to retain the most vision-critical tokens, preventing them from being discarded in later stages. In the prefilling stage, MustDrop further compresses vision tokens by the guidance of text semantics, with a dual-attention filtering strategy. In the decoding stage, an output-aware cache policy is proposed to further reduce the size of the KV cache. By leveraging tailored strategies in the multi-stage process, MustDrop can more precisely recognize the important and redundant tokens, thus achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency. For instance, MustDrop reduces about 88.5\% FLOPs on LLaVA with a compression ratio of 92.2\% while maintaining comparable accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Transformers have recently demonstrated unprecedented generative capabilities for various tasks. The encouraging results, however, come with the cost of slow inference, since each denoising step requires inference on a transformer model with a large scale of parameters. In this study, we make an interesting and somehow surprising observation: the computation of a large proportion of layers in the diffusion transformer, through introducing a caching mechanism, can be readily removed even without updating the model parameters. In the case of U-ViT-H/2, for example, we may remove up to 93.68% of the computation in the cache steps (46.84% for all steps), with less than 0.01 drop in FID. To achieve this, we introduce a novel scheme, named Learning-to-Cache (L2C), that learns to conduct caching in a dynamic manner for diffusion transformers. Specifically, by leveraging the identical structure of layers in transformers and the sequential nature of diffusion, we explore redundant computations between timesteps by treating each layer as the fundamental unit for caching. To address the challenge of the exponential search space in deep models for identifying layers to cache and remove, we propose a novel differentiable optimization objective. An input-invariant yet timestep-variant router is then optimized, which can finally produce a static computation graph. Experimental results show that L2C largely outperforms samplers such as DDIM and DPM-Solver, alongside prior cache-based methods at the same inference speed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Latency is a major concern for web rendering engines like those in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. These engines reduce latency by using an incremental layout algorithm to redraw the page when the user interacts with it. In such an algorithm, elements that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty; only the dirty elements need be processed to draw the next frame, dramatically reducing latency. However, the standard incremental layout algorithm must search the page for dirty elements, accessing a number of auxiliary elements in the process. These auxiliary elements add cache misses and stalled cycles, and are responsible for a sizable fraction of all layout latency. We introduce a new, faster incremental layout algorithm called Spineless Traversal. Spineless Traversal uses a more computationally demanding priority queue algorithm to avoid the need to access auxiliary nodes and thus reduces cache traffic and stalls. This leads to dramatic speedups on the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, or animations. Moreover, thanks to numerous low-level optimizations, we are able to make Spineless Traversal competitive across the whole spectrum of incremental layout workloads. As a result, across 2216 benchmarks, Spineless Traversal is faster on 78.2% of the benchmark, with a mean speedup of 3.23x concentrated in the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, and animations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Software caches are an intrinsic component of almost every computer system. Consequently, caching algorithms, particularly eviction policies, are the topic of many papers. Almost all these prior papers evaluate the caching algorithm based on its hit ratio, namely the fraction of requests that are found in the cache, as opposed to disk. The hit ratio is viewed as a proxy for traditional performance metrics like system throughput or response time. Intuitively it makes sense that higher hit ratio should lead to higher throughput (and lower response time), since more requests are found in the cache (low access time) as opposed to the disk (high access time).   This paper challenges this intuition. We show that increasing the hit ratio can actually hurt the throughput (and response time) for many caching algorithms. Our investigation follows a three-pronged approach involving (i) queueing modeling and analysis, (ii) implementation and measurement, and (iii) simulation to validate the accuracy of the queueing model. We also show that the phenomenon of throughput decreasing at higher hit ratios is likely to be more pronounced in future systems, where the trend is towards faster disks and higher numbers of cores per CPU.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep learning kernels exhibit predictable memory accesses and compute patterns, making GPUs' parallel architecture well-suited for their execution. Software and runtime systems for GPUs are optimized to better utilize the stream multiprocessors, on-chip cache, and off-chip high-bandwidth memory. As deep learning models and GPUs evolve, access to newer GPUs is often limited, raising questions about the performance of new model architectures on existing GPUs, existing models on new GPUs, and new model architectures on new GPUs. To address these questions, we introduce NeuSight, a framework to predict the performance of various deep learning models, for both training and inference, on unseen GPUs without requiring actual execution. The framework leverages both GPU hardware behavior and software library optimizations to estimate end-to-end performance. Previous work uses regression models that capture linear trends or multilayer perceptrons to predict the overall latency of deep learning kernels on GPUs. These approaches suffer from higher error percentages when forecasting performance on unseen models and new GPUs. Instead, NeuSight decomposes the prediction problem into smaller problems, bounding the prediction through fundamental performance laws. NeuSight decomposes a single deep learning kernel prediction into smaller working sets called tiles, which are executed independently on the GPU. Tile-granularity predictions are determined using a machine learning approach and aggregated to estimate end-to-end latency. NeuSight outperforms prior work across various deep learning workloads and the latest GPUs. It reduces the percentage error from 198% and 19.7% to 3.8% in predicting the latency of GPT3 model for training and inference on H100, compared to state-of-the-art prior works, where both GPT3 and H100 were not used to train the framework.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have emerged as powerful generative models for various tasks, including image, video, and speech synthesis. However, their inference process remains computationally expensive due to the repeated evaluation of resource-intensive attention and feed-forward modules. To address this, we introduce SmoothCache, a model-agnostic inference acceleration technique for DiT architectures. SmoothCache leverages the observed high similarity between layer outputs across adjacent diffusion timesteps. By analyzing layer-wise representation errors from a small calibration set, SmoothCache adaptively caches and reuses key features during inference. Our experiments demonstrate that SmoothCache achieves 8% to 71% speed up while maintaining or even improving generation quality across diverse modalities. We showcase its effectiveness on DiT-XL for image generation, Open-Sora for text-to-video, and Stable Audio Open for text-to-audio, highlighting its potential to enable real-time applications and broaden the accessibility of powerful DiT models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As a core component in modern data centers, key-value cache provides high-throughput and low-latency services for high-speed data processing. The effectiveness of a key-value cache relies on its ability of accommodating the needed data. However, expanding the cache capacity is often more difficult than commonly expected because of many practical constraints, such as server costs, cooling issues, rack space, and even human resource expenses. A potential solution is compression, which virtually extends the cache capacity by condensing data in cache. In practice, this seemingly simple idea has not gained much traction in key-value cache system design, due to several critical issues: the compression-unfriendly index structure, severe read/write amplification, wasteful decompression operations, and heavy computing cost. This paper presents a hybrid DRAM-SSD cache design to realize a systematic integration of data compression in key-value cache. By treating compression as an essential component, we have redesigned the indexing structure, data management, and leveraged the emerging computational SSD hardware for collaborative optimizations. We have developed a prototype, called ZipCache. Our experimental results show that ZipCache can achieve up to 72.4% higher throughput and 42.4% lower latency, while reducing the write amplification by up to 26.2 times.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The factorization of skew-symmetric matrices is a critically understudied area of dense linear algebra (DLA), particularly in comparison to that of symmetric matrices. While some algorithms can be adapted from the symmetric case, the cost of algorithms can be reduced by exploiting skew-symmetry. A motivating example is the factorization $X=LTL^T$ of a skew-symmetric matrix $X$, which is used in practical applications as a means of determining the determinant of $X$ as the square of the (cheaply-computed) Pfaffian of the skew-symmetric tridiagonal matrix $T$, for example in fields such as quantum electronic structure and machine learning. Such applications also often require pivoting in order to improve numerical stability. In this work we explore a combination of known literature algorithms and new algorithms recently derived using formal methods. High-performance parallel CPU implementations are created, leveraging the concept of fusion at multiple levels in order to reduce memory traffic overhead, as well as the BLIS framework which provides high-performance GEMM kernels, hierarchical parallelism, and cache blocking. We find that operation fusion and improved use of available bandwidth via parallelization of bandwidth-bound (level-2 BLAS) operations are essential for obtaining high performance, while a concise C++ implementation provides a clear and close connection to the formal derivation process without sacrificing performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper addresses the challenge of edge caching in dynamic environments, where rising traffic loads strain backhaul links and core networks. We propose a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based caching strategy that fully incorporates key file attributes such as size, lifetime, importance, and popularity, while also considering random file request arrivals, reflecting more realistic edge caching scenarios. In dynamic environments, changes such as shifts in content popularity and variations in request rates frequently occur, making previously learned policies less effective as they were optimized for earlier conditions. Without adaptation, caching efficiency and response times can degrade. While learning a new policy from scratch in a new environment is an option, it is highly inefficient and computationally expensive. Thus, adapting an existing policy to these changes is critical. To address this, we develop a mechanism that detects changes in content popularity and request rates, ensuring timely adjustments to the caching strategy. We also propose a transfer learning-based PPO algorithm that accelerates convergence in new environments by leveraging prior knowledge. Simulation results demonstrate the significant effectiveness of our approach, outperforming a recent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based method.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Emerging Large Language Model (LLM) applications require long input prompts to perform complex downstream tasks like document analysis and code generation. For these long context length applications, the length of the input prompt poses a significant challenge in terms of inference efficiency since the inference costs increase linearly with sequence length. However, for many of these applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different user inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations to process user inputs quickly, as they are received. In this work, we propose Squeezed Attention as a mechanism to accelerate LLM applications where a large portion of the input prompt is fixed. We first leverage K-means clustering offline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity and represent each cluster with a single centroid value. During inference, we compare query tokens from the user input with the centroids to predict which of the keys from the fixed context are semantically relevant and need to be loaded during inference. We then compute exact attention using only these important keys from the fixed context, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational costs. We also extend our method to use a hierarchical centroid lookup to identify important keys, which can reduce the complexity of attention from linear to logarithmic with respect to the context length. We implement optimized Triton kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with important keys, achieving more than 4x speedups during both the prefill and generation phases for long-context inference. Furthermore, we have extensively evaluated our method on various long-context benchmarks including LongBench, where it achieves a 3x reduction in KV cache budget without accuracy loss and up to an 8x reduction with <0.5 point accuracy gap for various models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformers can capture long-range dependencies using self-attention, allowing tokens to attend to all others directly. However, stacking multiple attention layers leads to attention concentration. One natural way to address this issue is to use cross-layer attention, allowing information from earlier layers to be directly accessible to later layers. However, this approach is computationally expensive. To address this problem, we propose Transformer with residual value (ResFormer) which approximates cross-layer attention through adding a residual connection from the values of the the first layer to all subsequent layers. Based on this method, one variant is the Transformer with single layer value (SVFormer), where all layers share the same value embedding from first layer, reducing the $KV$ cache by nearly 50\%. Comprehensive empirical evidence demonstrates that ResFormer mitigates attention concentration problem in deeper layers and enhances representation across most layers, outperforming the vanilla Transformer, DenseFormer, and NeuTRENO in training error as well as downstream tasks. Further visualization results suggest that Resformer alleviates attention sinks through avoiding value-state drains. SVFormer trains significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer and performs better than other methods like GQA and CLA, with performance influenced by sequence length and cumulative learning rate.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While general-purpose computing follows Von Neumann's architecture, the data movement between memory and processor elements dictates the processor's performance. The evolving compute-in-memory (CiM) paradigm tackles this issue by facilitating simultaneous processing and storage within static random-access memory (SRAM) elements. Numerous design decisions taken at different levels of hierarchy affect the figure of merits (FoMs) of SRAM, such as power, performance, area, and yield. The absence of a rapid assessment mechanism for the impact of changes at different hierarchy levels on global FoMs poses a challenge to accurately evaluating innovative SRAM designs. This paper presents an automation tool designed to optimize the energy and latency of SRAM designs incorporating diverse implementation strategies for executing logic operations within the SRAM. The tool structure allows easy comparison across different array topologies and various design strategies to result in energy-efficient implementations. Our study involves a comprehensive comparison of over 6900+ distinct design implementation strategies for EPFL combinational benchmark circuits on the energy-recycling resonant compute-in-memory (rCiM) architecture designed using TSMC 28 nm technology. When provided with a combinational circuit, the tool aims to generate an energy-efficient implementation strategy tailored to the specified input memory and latency constraints. The tool reduces 80.9% of energy consumption on average across all benchmarks while using the six-topology implementation compared to baseline implementation of single-macro topology by considering the parallel processing capability of rCiM cache size ranging from 4KB to 192KB.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Influence Maximization (IM) is vital in viral marketing and biological network analysis for identifying key influencers. Given its NP-hard nature, approximate solutions are employed. This paper addresses scalability challenges in scale-out shared memory system by focusing on the state-of-the-art Influence Maximization via Martingales (IMM) benchmark. To enhance the work efficiency of the current IMM implementation, we propose EFFICIENTIMM with key strategies, including new parallelization scheme, NUMA-aware memory usage, dynamic load balancing and fine-grained adaptive data structures. Benchmarking on a 128-core CPU system with 8 NUMA nodes, EFFICIENTIMM demonstrated significant performance improvements, achieving an average 5.9x speedup over Ripples across 8 diverse SNAP datasets, when compared to the best execution times of the original Ripples framework. Additionally, on the Youtube graph, EFFICIENTIMM demonstrates a better memory access pattern with 357.4x reduction in L1+L2 cache misses as compared to Ripples.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scaling-law has guided the language model designing for past years, however, it is worth noting that the scaling laws of NLP cannot be directly applied to RecSys due to the following reasons: (1) The amount of training samples and model parameters is typically not the bottleneck for the model. Our recommendation system can generate over 50 billion user samples daily, and such a massive amount of training data can easily allow our model parameters to exceed 200 billion, surpassing many LLMs (about 100B). (2) To ensure the stability and robustness of the recommendation system, it is essential to control computational complexity FLOPs carefully. Considering the above differences with LLM, we can draw a conclusion that: for a RecSys model, compared to model parameters, the computational complexity FLOPs is a more expensive factor that requires careful control. In this paper, we propose our milestone work, MARM (Memory Augmented Recommendation Model), which explores a new cache scaling-laws successfully.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid growth of LLMs has revolutionized natural language processing and AI analysis, but their increasing size and memory demands present significant challenges. A common solution is to spill over to CPU memory; however, traditional GPU-CPU memory swapping often results in higher latency and lower throughput.   This paper introduces Pie, an LLM inference framework that addresses these challenges with performance-transparent swapping and adaptive expansion. By leveraging predictable memory access patterns and the high bandwidth of modern hardware like the NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, Pie enables concurrent data swapping without affecting foreground computation, expanding effective memory without added latency. Adaptive expansion dynamically adjusts CPU memory allocation based on real-time information, optimizing memory usage and performance under varying conditions.   Pie maintains low computation latency, high throughput, and high elasticity. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that Pie achieves optimal swapping policy during cache warmup and effectively balances increased memory capacity with negligible impact on computation. With its extended capacity, Pie outperforms vLLM by up to 1.9X in throughput and 2X in latency. Additionally, Pie can reduce GPU memory usage by up to 1.67X while maintaining the same performance. Compared to FlexGen, an offline profiling-based swapping solution, Pie achieves magnitudes lower latency and 9.4X higher throughput.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The $k$d-tree is one of the most widely used data structures to manage multi-dimensional data. Due to the ever-growing data volume, it is imperative to consider parallelism in $k$d-trees. However, we observed challenges in existing parallel kd-tree implementations, for both constructions and updates.   The goal of this paper is to develop efficient in-memory $k$d-trees by supporting high parallelism and cache-efficiency. We propose the Pkd-tree (Parallel $k$d-tree), a parallel $k$d-tree that is efficient both in theory and in practice. The Pkd-tree supports parallel tree construction, batch update (insertion and deletion), and various queries including k-nearest neighbor search, range query, and range count. We proved that our algorithms have strong theoretical bounds in work (sequential time complexity), span (parallelism), and cache complexity. Our key techniques include 1) an efficient construction algorithm that optimizes work, span, and cache complexity simultaneously, and 2) reconstruction-based update algorithms that guarantee the tree to be weight-balanced. With the new algorithmic insights and careful engineering effort, we achieved a highly optimized implementation of the Pkd-tree.   We tested Pkd-tree with various synthetic and real-world datasets, including both uniform and highly skewed data. We compare the Pkd-tree with state-of-the-art parallel $k$d-tree implementations. In all tests, with better or competitive query performance, Pkd-tree is much faster in construction and updates consistently than all baselines. We released our code.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Key-Value (KV) caching is a common technique to enhance the computational efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs), but its memory overhead grows rapidly with input length. Prior work has shown that not all tokens are equally important for text generation, proposing layer-level KV cache compression to selectively retain key information. Recognizing the distinct roles of attention heads in generation, we propose HeadKV, a head-level KV cache compression method, and HeadKV-R2, which leverages a novel contextual reasoning ability estimation for compression. Our approach operates at the level of individual heads, estimating their importance for contextual QA tasks that require both retrieval and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks (LongBench, LooGLE), model architectures (e.g., Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct), and long-context abilities tests demonstrate that our head-level KV cache compression significantly outperforms strong baselines, particularly in low-resource settings (KV size = 64 & 128). Notably, our method retains just 1.5% of the KV cache while achieving 97% of the performance of the full KV cache on the contextual question answering benchmark.Codes are available at https://github.com/FYYFU/HeadKV

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The personalized recommendation system's continuous size growth poses new challenges for model inference. Although weight-sharing algorithms have been proposed to reduce embedding table capacity, they increase memory access. Recent advancements in processing-in-memory (PIM) successfully enhance the recommendation system's throughput by exploiting memory parallelism, but our analysis shows that those algorithms introduce CPU-PIM communication overhead into prior PIM systems, compromising the PIM throughput. We propose ProactivePIM, a specialized memory architecture integrated with PIM technology tailored to accelerate the weight-sharing algorithms. ProacitvePIM integrates an SRAM cache within the PIM with an efficient prefetching scheme to leverage a unique locality of the algorithm and eliminate CPU-PIM communication.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative tool, enabling customized and personalized AI-generated content (AIGC) services. However, GenAI models with billions of parameters require substantial memory capacity and computational power for deployment and execution, presenting significant challenges to resource-limited edge networks. In this paper, we address the joint model caching and resource allocation problem in GenAI-enabled wireless edge networks. Our objective is to balance the trade-off between delivering high-quality AIGC and minimizing the delay in AIGC service provisioning. To tackle this problem, we employ a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based reinforcement learning approach, capable of efficiently determining optimal model caching and resource allocation decisions for AIGC services in response to user mobility and time-varying channel conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that DDPG achieves a higher model hit ratio and provides superior-quality, lower-latency AIGC services compared to other benchmark solutions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Compute Express Link (CXL) serves as a rising industry standard, delivering high-speed cache-coherent links to a variety of devices, including host CPUs, computational accelerators, and memory devices. It is designed to promote system scalability, enable peer-to-peer exchanges, and accelerate data transmissions. To achieve these objectives, the most recent CXL protocol has brought forth several innovative features, such as port-focused routing, device-handled coherence, and PCIe 6.0 compatibility. However, due to the limited availability of hardware prototypes and simulators compatible with CXL, earlier CXL research has largely depended on emulating CXL devices using remote NUMA nodes. Unfortunately, these NUMA-based emulators have difficulties in accurately representing the new features due to fundamental differences in hardware and protocols. Moreover, the absence of support for non-tree topology and PCIe links makes it complex to merely adapt existing simulators for CXL simulation. To overcome these problems, we introduce ESF, a simulation framework specifically designed for CXL systems. ESF has been developed to accurately reflect the unique features of the latest CXL protocol from the ground up. It uses a specialized interconnect layer to facilitate connections within a wide range of system topologies and also includes key components to carry out specific functions required by these features. By utilizing ESF, we thoroughly investigate various aspects of CXL systems, including system topology, device-handled coherence, and the effects of PCIe characteristics, leading to important findings that can guide the creation of high-performance CXL systems. The ESF source codes are fully open-source and can be accessed at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ESF-1CE3.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) can now handle longer sequences of tokens, enabling complex tasks like book understanding and generating lengthy novels. However, the key-value (KV) cache required for LLMs consumes substantial memory as context length increasing, becoming the bottleneck for deployment. In this paper, we present a strategy called SKVQ, which stands for sliding-window KV cache quantization, to address the issue of extremely low bitwidth KV cache quantization. To achieve this, SKVQ rearranges the channels of the KV cache in order to improve the similarity of channels in quantization groups, and applies clipped dynamic quantization at the group level. Additionally, SKVQ ensures that the most recent window tokens in the KV cache are preserved with high precision. This helps maintain the accuracy of a small but important portion of the KV cache.SKVQ achieves high compression ratios while maintaining accuracy. Our evaluation on LLMs demonstrates that SKVQ surpasses previous quantization approaches, allowing for quantization of the KV cache to 2-bit keys and 1.5-bit values with minimal loss of accuracy. With SKVQ, it is possible to process context lengths of up to 1M on an 80GB memory GPU for a 7b model and up to 7 times faster decoding.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Flow diffusion models (FDMs) have recently shown potential in generation tasks due to the high generation quality. However, the current ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver for FDMs, e.g., the Euler solver, still suffers from slow generation since ODE solvers need many number function evaluations (NFE) to keep high-quality generation. In this paper, we propose a novel training-free flow-solver to reduce NFE while maintaining high-quality generation. The key insight for the flow-solver is to leverage the previous steps to reduce the NFE, where a cache is created to reuse these results from the previous steps. Specifically, the Taylor expansion is first used to approximate the ODE. To calculate the high-order derivatives of Taylor expansion, the flow-solver proposes to use the previous steps and a polynomial interpolation to approximate it, where the number of orders we could approximate equals the number of previous steps we cached. We also prove that the flow-solver has a more minor approximation error and faster generation speed. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ, LSUN-Bedroom, LSUN-Church, ImageNet, and real text-to-image generation prove the efficiency of the flow-solver. Specifically, the flow-solver improves the FID-30K from 13.79 to 6.75, from 46.64 to 19.49 with $\text{NFE}=10$ on CIFAR-10 and LSUN-Church, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in various natural language processing tasks, but the role of wireless networks in supporting LLMs has not been thoroughly explored. In this paper, we propose a wireless distributed Mixture of Experts (WDMoE) architecture to enable collaborative deployment of LLMs across edge servers at the base station (BS) and mobile devices in wireless networks. Specifically, we decompose the MoE layer in LLMs by placing the gating network and the preceding neural network layer at BS, while distributing the expert networks among the devices. This deployment leverages the parallel inference capabilities of expert networks on mobile devices, effectively utilizing the limited computing and caching resources of these devices. Accordingly, we develop a performance metric for WDMoE-based LLMs, which accounts for both model capability and latency. To minimize the latency while maintaining accuracy, we jointly optimize expert selection and bandwidth allocation based on the performance metric. Moreover, we build a hardware testbed using NVIDIA Jetson kits to validate the effectiveness of WDMoE. Both theoretical simulations and practical hardware experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly reduce the latency without compromising LLM performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The development of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized automated code generation. However, their high demand of computation resources has hindered a broader deployment and raised environmental concerns. A common strategy for diminishing computational demands is to cache Key-Value (KV) states from the attention mechanism which is adopted predominately by mainstream LLMs. It can mitigate the need of repeated attention computations, but brings significant memory overhead. Current practices in NLP often use sparse attention which may, unfortunately, lead to substantial inaccuracies, or hallucinations, in code generation tasks. In this paper, we analyze the attention weights distribution within code generation models via an empirical study, uncovering a sparsity pattern, i.e., the aggregation of information at specific anchor points. Based on this observation, we propose a novel approach, AnchorCoder, which features token-wise anchor attention designed to extract and compress the contextual information, and layer-wise anchor attention enabling cross-layer communication to mitigate the issue of excessive superposition caused by the compression. The extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of AnchorCoder, which can consistently achieve a significant (at least 70%) reduction in KV cache requirements, while preserving the majority of model's performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Incremental graph learning has gained significant attention for its ability to address the catastrophic forgetting problem in graph representation learning. However, traditional methods often rely on a large number of labels for node classification, which is impractical in real-world applications. This makes few-shot incremental learning on graphs a pressing need. Current methods typically require extensive training samples from meta-learning to build memory and perform intensive fine-tuning of GNN parameters, leading to high memory consumption and potential loss of previously learned knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Mecoin, an efficient method for building and maintaining memory. Mecoin employs Structured Memory Units to cache prototypes of learned categories, as well as Memory Construction Modules to update these prototypes for new categories through interactions between the nodes and the cached prototypes. Additionally, we have designed a Memory Representation Adaptation Module to store probabilities associated with each class prototype, reducing the need for parameter fine-tuning and lowering the forgetting rate. When a sample matches its corresponding class prototype, the relevant probabilities are retrieved from the MRaM. Knowledge is then distilled back into the GNN through a Graph Knowledge Distillation Module, preserving the model's memory. We analyze the effectiveness of Mecoin in terms of generalization error and explore the impact of different distillation strategies on model performance through experiments and VC-dimension analysis. Compared to other related works, Mecoin shows superior performance in accuracy and forgetting rate. Our code is publicly available on the https://github.com/Arvin0313/Mecoin-GFSCIL.git .

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present context parallelism for long-context large language model inference, which achieves near-linear scaling for long-context prefill latency with up to 128 H100 GPUs across 16 nodes. Particularly, our method achieves 1M context prefill with Llama3 405B model in 77s (93% parallelization efficiency, 63% FLOPS utilization) and 128K context prefill in 3.8s. We develop two lossless exact ring attention variants: pass-KV and pass-Q to cover a wide range of use cases with the state-of-the-art performance: full prefill, persistent KV prefill and decode. Benchmarks on H100 GPU hosts inter-connected with RDMA and TCP both show similar scalability for long-context prefill, demonstrating that our method scales well using common commercial data center with medium-to-low inter-host bandwidth.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> An efficient data structure is fundamental to meeting the growing demands in dynamic graph processing. However, the dual requirements for graph computation efficiency (with contiguous structures) and graph update efficiency (with linked list-like structures) present a conflict in the design principles of graph structures. After experimental studies of existing state-of-the-art dynamic graph structures, we observe that the overhead of cache misses accounts for a major portion of the graph computation time. This paper presents GastCoCo, a system with graph storage and coroutine-based prefetch co-design. By employing software prefetching via stackless coroutines and introducing a prefetch-friendly data structure CBList, GastCoCo significantly alleviates the performance degradation caused by cache misses. Our results show that GastCoCo outperforms state-of-the-art graph storage systems by 1.3x - 180x in graph updates and 1.4x - 41.1x in graph computation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video-to-video synthesis poses significant challenges in maintaining character consistency, smooth temporal transitions, and preserving visual quality during fast motion. While recent fully cross-frame self-attention mechanisms have improved character consistency across multiple frames, they come with high computational costs and often include redundant operations, especially for videos with higher frame rates. To address these inefficiencies, we propose an adaptive motion-guided cross-frame attention mechanism that selectively reduces redundant computations. This enables a greater number of cross-frame attentions over more frames within the same computational budget, thereby enhancing both video quality and temporal coherence. Our method leverages optical flow to focus on moving regions while sparsely attending to stationary areas, allowing for the joint editing of more frames without increasing computational demands. Traditional frame interpolation techniques struggle with motion blur and flickering in intermediate frames, which compromises visual fidelity. To mitigate this, we introduce KV-caching for jointly edited frames, reusing keys and values across intermediate frames to preserve visual quality and maintain temporal consistency throughout the video. With our adaptive cross-frame self-attention approach, we achieve a threefold increase in the number of keyframes processed compared to existing methods, all within the same computational budget as fully cross-frame attention baselines. This results in significant improvements in prediction accuracy and temporal consistency, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to grow, reducing costs and alleviating GPU demands has become increasingly critical. However, existing schedulers primarily target either GPU compute or Key-Value Cache (KVC) utilization, failing to fully optimize both GPU compute and KVC usage during each iteration or guarantee timely KVC allocations when needed. To address these challenges, we conducted a trace-based experimental analysis and made insightful observations, leading to the design of a system called EcoServe. EcoServe maximizes multi-resource utilization while ensuring service-level objective (SLO) guarantees in LLM serving. To enable adding prompts to a batch to maximize GPU utilization in each iteration, EcoServe maintains separate waiting queues for prompt processing tasks (PTs) and generation tasks (GTs). It batches GTs with the same predicted response lengths (RL) to save scheduling time and allocates KVC space for the predicted RL to avoid KVC allocation failures. It further has a novel KVC pipelining method, allowing sharing allocated but unused KVC space to enhance KVC utilization. In addition, it prioritizes queued requests that occupy more KVC to release KVC earlier and satisfy request service-level-objective (SLO). Experimental results demonstrate that EcoServe increases throughput by up to 4$\times$ with the same level of latency, generates up to 91\% lower job completion time and up to 91\% higher SLO satisfaction ratio compared to vLLM. It also reduces the number of GPUs used in DistServe by up to 78\% while maintaining the same level of goodput.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) represent a groundbreaking advancement in the domain of natural language processing due to their impressive reasoning abilities. Recently, there has been considerable interest in increasing the context lengths for these models to enhance their applicability to complex tasks. However, at long context lengths and large batch sizes, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores the attention keys and values, emerges as the new bottleneck in memory usage during inference. To address this, we propose Eigen Attention, which performs the attention operation in a low-rank space, thereby reducing the KV cache memory overhead. Our proposed approach is orthogonal to existing KV cache compression techniques and can be used synergistically with them. Through extensive experiments over OPT, MPT, and Llama model families, we demonstrate that Eigen Attention results in up to 40% reduction in KV cache sizes and up to 60% reduction in attention operation latency with minimal drop in performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Model (LLM) inference on large-scale systems is expected to dominate future cloud infrastructures. Efficient LLM inference in cloud environments with numerous AI accelerators is challenging, necessitating extensive optimizations for optimal performance. Current systems batch prefill and decoding to boost throughput but encounter latency issues, while others disaggregate these phases, leading to resource underutilization. We propose AcceLLM, a novel method addressing latency and load balancing, inspired by the cache data management. It strategically utilizes redundant data to enhance inference via load balancing and optimal hardware use. Simulated evaluations on Nvidia H100 GPU and Huawei Ascend 910B2 show AcceLLM surpasses state-of-the-art systems up to 30% in latency and efficiency, handling diverse workloads effectively.

However, the high computational and financial costs associated with frequent API calls to these models present a substantial bottleneck, especially for applications like customer service chatbots that handle repetitive queries. In this paper, we introduce GPT Semantic Cache, a method that leverages semantic caching of query embeddings in in-memory storage (Redis). By storing embeddings of user queries, our approach efficiently identifies semantically similar questions, allowing for the retrieval of pre-generated responses without redundant API calls to the LLM. This technique reduces operational costs and improves response times, enhancing the efficiency of LLM-powered applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Inference on large language models (LLMs) can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in LLM inference contributes significantly to these costs, which has sparked an interest in approximating the self-attention computation to reduce such costs. In this work, we propose to approximate self-attention by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to speed up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs while maintaining the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.

In this work, we introduce BitNet a4.8, enabling 4-bit activations for 1-bit LLMs. BitNet a4.8 employs a hybrid quantization and sparsification strategy to mitigate the quantization errors introduced by the outlier channels. Specifically, we utilize 4-bit activations for inputs to the attention and feed-forward network layers, while sparsifying intermediate states followed with 8-bit quantization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BitNet a4.8 achieves performance comparable to BitNet b1.58 with equivalent training costs, while being faster in inference with enabling 4-bit (INT4/FP4) kernels. Additionally, BitNet a4.8 activates only 55% of parameters and supports 3-bit KV cache, further enhancing the efficiency of large-scale LLM deployment and inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generating temporally-consistent high-fidelity videos can be computationally expensive, especially over longer temporal spans. More-recent Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) -- despite making significant headway in this context -- have only heightened such challenges as they rely on larger models and heavier attention mechanisms, resulting in slower inference speeds. In this paper, we introduce a training-free method to accelerate video DiTs, termed Adaptive Caching (AdaCache), which is motivated by the fact that "not all videos are created equal": meaning, some videos require fewer denoising steps to attain a reasonable quality than others. Building on this, we not only cache computations through the diffusion process, but also devise a caching schedule tailored to each video generation, maximizing the quality-latency trade-off. We further introduce a Motion Regularization (MoReg) scheme to utilize video information within AdaCache, essentially controlling the compute allocation based on motion content. Altogether, our plug-and-play contributions grant significant inference speedups (e.g. up to 4.7x on Open-Sora 720p - 2s video generation) without sacrificing the generation quality, across multiple video DiT baselines.

To address the limited resources of IIoT sensor devices, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising solution, providing flexible and cost-effective services in close proximity of IIoT sensor devices (ISDs). However, leveraging aerial MEC to meet the delay-sensitive and computation-intensive requirements of the ISDs could face several challenges, including the limited communication, computation and caching (3C) resources, stringent offloading requirements for 3C services, and constrained on-board energy of UAVs. To address these issues, we first present a collaborative aerial MEC-assisted ICPS architecture by incorporating the computing capabilities of the macro base station (MBS) and UAVs. We then formulate a service delay minimization optimization problem (SDMOP). Since the SDMOP is proved to be an NP-hard problem, we propose a joint computation offloading, caching, communication resource allocation, computation resource allocation, and UAV trajectory control approach (JC5A). Specifically, JC5A consists of a block successive upper bound minimization method of multipliers (BSUMM) for computation offloading and service caching, a convex optimization-based method for communication and computation resource allocation, and a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based method for UAV trajectory control. Moreover, we theoretically prove the convergence and polynomial complexity of JC5A. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve superior system performance compared to the benchmark approaches and algorithms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in vision-language foundational models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated significant strides in zero-shot classification. However, the extensive parameterization of models like CLIP necessitates a resource-intensive fine-tuning process. In response, TIP-Adapter and SuS-X have introduced training-free methods aimed at bolstering the efficacy of downstream tasks. While these approaches incorporate support sets to maintain data distribution consistency between knowledge cache and test sets, they often fall short in terms of generalization on the test set, particularly when faced with test data exhibiting substantial distributional variations. In this work, we present CapS-Adapter, an innovative method that employs a caption-based support set, effectively harnessing both image and caption features to exceed existing state-of-the-art techniques in training-free scenarios. CapS-Adapter adeptly constructs support sets that closely mirror target distributions, utilizing instance-level distribution features extracted from multimodal large models. By leveraging CLIP's single and cross-modal strengths, CapS-Adapter enhances predictive accuracy through the use of multimodal support sets. Our method achieves outstanding zero-shot classification results across 19 benchmark datasets, improving accuracy by 2.19\% over the previous leading method. Our contributions are substantiated through extensive validation on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance and robust generalization capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a practical approach to scale up parameters for the Transformer model to achieve better generalization while maintaining a sub-linear increase in computation overhead. Current MoE models are mainly built with expert parallelism on distributed devices. However, it usually depends on homogeneous devices to deploy and suffers from heavy communication overhead and computation redundancy. In this paper, we explore developing a \texttt{H}eterogeneous-aware \texttt{EX}pert \texttt{A}llocation framework, \textbf{\texttt{HEXA-MoE}}, with significantly enhanced computing efficiency. It contains two components: ($1$) \textit{Expert-Specific Operators}. We replace the typical general matrix multiplication or grouped matrix multiplication interfaces with our operators, which allows the computing to be performed in an in-place manner with \textbf{ZERO} redundancy. ($2$) \textit{Adaptive Data- and Model-Centric Configurations} for different workload scales. Specifically, we introduce a pipeline-shared cache on each device to tackle the heavy memory consumption in the existing data-centric MoE library. Comprehensive experiments on the Swin-MoE benchmark consistently reveal the effectiveness of our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} framework, i.e., reducing $10\%\sim48\%$ memory consumption and achieving $0.5\sim4.3\times$ speed up compared to current state-of-the-art MoE libraries. Furthermore, we examine our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} with heterogeneous devices for both data- and model-centric settings. Promising results show that employing optimal parallel configuration with \texttt{HEXA-MoE} on heterogeneous devices can substantially minimize overall latency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The training or fine-tuning of machine learning, vision, and language models is often implemented as a pipeline: a sequence of stages encompassing data preparation, model training and evaluation. In this paper, we exploit pipeline structures to reduce the cost of hyperparameter tuning for model training/fine-tuning, which is particularly valuable for language models given their high costs in GPU-days. We propose a "memoization-aware" Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm, EEIPU, that works in tandem with a pipeline caching system, allowing it to evaluate significantly more hyperparameter candidates per GPU-day than other tuning algorithms. The result is better-quality hyperparameters in the same amount of search time, or equivalently, reduced search time to reach the same hyperparameter quality. In our benchmarks on machine learning (model ensembles), vision (convolutional architecture) and language (T5 architecture) pipelines, we compare EEIPU against recent BO algorithms: EEIPU produces an average of $103\%$ more hyperparameter candidates (within the same budget), and increases the validation metric by an average of $108\%$ more than other algorithms (where the increase is measured starting from the end of warm-up iterations).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The wide deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to strong demands for optimizing their inference performance. Today's techniques serving this purpose primarily focus on reducing latency and improving throughput through algorithmic and hardware enhancements, while largely overlooking their privacy side effects, particularly in a multi-user environment. In our research, for the first time, we discovered a set of new timing side channels in LLM systems, arising from shared caches and GPU memory allocations, which can be exploited to infer both confidential system prompts and those issued by other users. These vulnerabilities echo security challenges observed in traditional computing systems, highlighting an urgent need to address potential information leakage in LLM serving infrastructures. In this paper, we report novel attack strategies designed to exploit such timing side channels inherent in LLM deployments, specifically targeting the Key-Value (KV) cache and semantic cache widely used to enhance LLM inference performance. Our approach leverages timing measurements and classification models to detect cache hits, allowing an adversary to infer private prompts with high accuracy. We also propose a token-by-token search algorithm to efficiently recover shared prompt prefixes in the caches, showing the feasibility of stealing system prompts and those produced by peer users. Our experimental studies on black-box testing of popular online LLM services demonstrate that such privacy risks are completely realistic, with significant consequences. Our findings underscore the need for robust mitigation to protect LLM systems against such emerging threats.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has demonstrated significant advantages in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), offering enhanced capabilities with reduced inference costs. However, deploying MoE-based LLMs on memoryconstrained edge devices remains challenging due to their substantial memory requirements. While existing expertoffloading methods alleviate the memory requirements, they often incur significant expert-loading costs or compromise model accuracy. We present HOBBIT, a mixed precision expert offloading system to enable flexible and efficient MoE inference. Our key insight is that dynamically replacing less critical cache-miss experts with low precision versions can substantially reduce expert-loading latency while preserving model accuracy. HOBBIT introduces three innovative techniques that map the natural hierarchy of MoE computation: (1) a token-level dynamic expert loading mechanism, (2) a layer-level adaptive expert prefetching technique, and (3) a sequence-level multidimensional expert caching policy. These innovations fully leverage the benefits of mixedprecision expert inference. By implementing HOBBIT on top of the renowned LLM inference framework Llama.cpp, we evaluate its performance across different edge devices with representative MoE models. The results demonstrate that HOBBIT achieves up to a 9.93x speedup in decoding compared to state-of-the-art MoE offloading systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Non-terrestrial networks (NTN) have emerged as a transformative solution to bridge the digital divide and deliver essential services to remote and underserved areas. In this context, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations offer remarkable potential for efficient cache content broadcast in remote regions, thereby extending the reach of digital services. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content placement using NTN. Despite wide coverage, the varying NTN transmission capabilities must be carefully aligned with each content placement to maximize broadcast efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content placement using NTN, positioning NTN as a complement to TN for achieving optimal content broadcasting. Specifically, we dynamically select content for placement via NTN links. This selection is based on popularity and suitability for delivery through NTN, while considering the orbital motion of LEO satellites. Our system-level case studies, based on a practical LEO constellation, demonstrate the significant improvement in placement speed compared to existing methods, which neglect network mobility. We also demonstrate that NTN links significantly outperform standalone wireless TN solutions, particularly in the early stages of content delivery. This advantage is amplified when there is a higher correlation of content popularity across geographical regions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the development of large language models (LLMs), the ability to handle longer contexts has become a key capability for Web applications such as cross-document understanding and LLM-powered search systems. However, this progress faces two major challenges: performance degradation due to sequence lengths out-of-distribution, and excessively long inference times caused by the quadratic computational complexity of attention. These issues hinder the application of LLMs in long-context scenarios. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection (TokenSelect), a model-agnostic, training-free method for efficient and accurate long-context inference. TokenSelect builds upon the observation of non-contiguous attention sparsity, using Query-Key dot products to measure per-head KV Cache criticality at token-level. By per-head soft voting mechanism, TokenSelect selectively involves a small number of critical KV cache tokens in the attention calculation without sacrificing accuracy. To further accelerate TokenSelect, we designed the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query similarity and implemented efficient dot product kernel, significantly reducing the overhead of token selection. A comprehensive evaluation of TokenSelect demonstrates up to 23.84x speedup in attention computation and up to 2.28x acceleration in end-to-end latency, while providing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art long-context inference methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In multi-agent systems utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), communication between agents traditionally relies on natural language. This communication often includes the full context of the query so far, which can introduce significant prefill-phase latency, especially with long contexts.   We introduce DroidSpeak, a novel framework to target this cross-LLM communication by leveraging the reuse of intermediate data, such as input embeddings (E-cache) and key-value caches (KV-cache). We efficiently bypass the need to reprocess entire contexts for fine-tuned versions of the same foundational model. This approach allows faster context integration while maintaining the quality of task performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate DroidSpeak's ability to significantly accelerate inter-agent communication, achieving up to a 2.78x speedup in prefill latency with negligible loss in accuracy. Our findings underscore the potential to create more efficient and scalable multi-agent systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Integrated micro power generators are crucial components for micro robotic platforms to demonstrate untethered operation and to achieve autonomy. Current micro robotic electrostatic actuators typically require hundreds to thousands of voltages to output sufficient work. Pyroelectricity is one such source of high voltages that can be scaled to small form factors. This paper demonstrates a distributed pyroelectric high voltage generation mechanism to power kV actuators using alternating exposure of crystals to hot and cold water (300C to 900C water temperature). Using this fluidic temperature control, a pyroelectrically generated voltage of 2470 V was delivered to a 2 pF storage capacitor yielding a 6.10 {\mu}J stored energy. A maximum energy of 17.46 {\mu}J was delivered to a 47 pF capacitor at 861 V. The recirculating water can be used to heat a distributed array of converters to generate electricity in distant robotic actuator sections. The development of this distributed system would enable untethered micro-robot to be operated with a flexible body and free of battery recharging, which advances its applications in the real world.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficient cloud computing relies on in-process isolation to optimize performance by running workloads within a single process. Without heavy-weight process isolation, memory safety errors pose a significant security threat by allowing an adversary to extract or corrupt the private data of other co-located tenants. Existing in-process isolation mechanisms are not suitable for modern cloud requirements, e.g., MPK's 16 protection domains are insufficient to isolate thousands of cloud workers per process. Consequently, cloud service providers have a strong need for lightweight in-process isolation on commodity x86 machines.   This paper presents TME-Box, a novel isolation technique that enables fine-grained and scalable sandboxing on commodity x86 CPUs. By repurposing Intel TME-MK, which is intended for the encryption of virtual machines, TME-Box offers lightweight and efficient in-process isolation. TME-Box enforces that sandboxes use their designated encryption keys for memory interactions through compiler instrumentation. This cryptographic isolation enables fine-grained access control, from single cache lines to full pages, and supports flexible data relocation. In addition, the design of TME-Box allows the efficient isolation of up to 32K concurrent sandboxes. We present a performance-optimized TME-Box prototype, utilizing x86 segment-based addressing, that showcases geomean performance overheads of 5.2 % for data isolation and 9.7 % for code and data isolation, evaluated with the SPEC CPU2017 benchmark suite.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, the Internet has been dominated by content-rich platforms, employing recommendation systems to provide users with more appealing content (e.g., videos in YouTube, movies in Netflix). While traditional content recommendations are oblivious to network conditions, the paradigm of Network-Friendly Recommendations (NFR) has recently emerged, favoring content that improves network performance (e.g. cached near the user), while still being appealing to the user. However, NFR algorithms sometimes achieve their goal by shrinking the pool of content recommended to users. The undesirable side-effect is reduced content diversity, a phenomenon known as ``content/filter bubble''. This reduced diversity is problematic for both users, who are prevented from exploring a broader range of content, and content creators (e.g. YouTubers) whose content may be recommended less frequently, leading to perceived unfairness. In this paper, we first investigate - using real data and state-of-the-art NFR schemes - the extent of this phenomenon. We then formulate a ``Diverse-NFR'' optimization problem (i.e., network-friendly recommendations with - sufficient - content diversity), and through a series of transformation steps, we manage to reduce it to a linear program that can be solved fast and optimally. Our findings show that Diverse-NFR can achieve high network gains (comparable to non-diverse NFR) while maintaining diversity constraints. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that incorporates diversity issues into network-friendly recommendation algorithms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The room temperature continuous wave (CW) very-high-frequency (VHF) gun is one of the candidates for the electron gun of the high-repetition-rate free-electron lasers (FELs). The VHF gun operates with a cathode gradient of ~ 20 MV/m and an accelerating voltage of ~ 750 kV. The gun dark current emission leads to beam loss along the FEL machine, therefore is a critical parameter for the performance of the CW gun. In this paper, we presents a systematic study of the dark current reduction of the VHF gun, including cathode region optimizations, dark current tracking simulations and measurements. Over-inserted cathode plugs were tested in two VHF guns of different acceleration gap sizes, and both demonstrated significant dark current reduction ratios of more than two orders of magnitude.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Post-training KV-Cache compression methods typically either sample a subset of effectual tokens or quantize the data into lower numerical bit width. However, these methods cannot exploit redundancy in the hidden dimension of the KV tensors. This paper presents a hidden dimension compression approach called Palu, a KV-Cache compression framework that utilizes low-rank projection to reduce inference-time LLM memory usage. Palu decomposes the linear layers into low-rank matrices, caches compressed intermediate states, and reconstructs the full keys and values on the fly. To improve accuracy, compression rate, and efficiency, Palu further encompasses (1) a medium-grained low-rank decomposition scheme, (2) an efficient rank search algorithm, (3) low-rank-aware quantization compatibility enhancements, and (4) optimized GPU kernels with operators fusion. Extensive experiments with popular LLMs show that Palu compresses KV-Cache by 50% while maintaining strong accuracy and delivering up to 1.89x on the RoPE-based attention module. When combined with quantization, Palu's inherent quantization-friendly design yields small to negligible extra accuracy degradation while saving additional memory than quantization-only methods and achieving up to 2.91x speedup for the RoPE-based attention. Moreover, it maintains comparable or even better accuracy (up to 1.19 lower perplexity) compared to quantization-only methods. These results demonstrate Palu's superior capability to effectively address the efficiency and memory challenges of LLM inference posed by KV-Cache.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is often hindered by the extensive memory requirements of the Key-Value (KV) cache, especially as context lengths increase. Existing approaches to reduce the KV cache size involve either fine-tuning the model to learn a compression strategy or leveraging attention scores to reduce the sequence length. We analyse the attention distributions in decoder-only Transformers-based models and observe that attention allocation patterns stay consistent across most layers. Surprisingly, we find a clear correlation between the $L_2$ and the attention scores over cached KV pairs, where a low $L_2$ of a key embedding usually leads to a high attention score during decoding. This finding indicates that the influence of a KV pair is potentially determined by the key embedding itself before being queried. Based on this observation, we compress the KV cache based on the $L_2$ of key embeddings. Our experimental results show that this simple strategy can reduce the KV cache size by 50% on language modelling and needle-in-a-haystack tasks and 90% on passkey retrieval tasks without losing accuracy. Moreover, without relying on the attention scores, this approach remains compatible with FlashAttention, enabling broader applicability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative technology, enabling customized and personalized AI-generated content (AIGC) services. In this paper, we address challenges of edge-enabled AIGC service provisioning, which remain underexplored in the literature. These services require executing GenAI models with billions of parameters, posing significant obstacles to resource-limited wireless edge. We subsequently introduce the formulation of joint model caching and resource allocation for AIGC services to balance a trade-off between AIGC quality and latency metrics. We obtain mathematical relationships of these metrics with the computational resources required by GenAI models via experimentation. Afterward, we decompose the formulation into a model caching subproblem on a long-timescale and a resource allocation subproblem on a short-timescale. Since the variables to be solved are discrete and continuous, respectively, we leverage a double deep Q-network (DDQN) algorithm to solve the former subproblem and propose a diffusion-based deep deterministic policy gradient (D3PG) algorithm to solve the latter. The proposed D3PG algorithm makes an innovative use of diffusion models as the actor network to determine optimal resource allocation decisions. Consequently, we integrate these two learning methods within the overarching two-timescale deep reinforcement learning (T2DRL) algorithm, the performance of which is studied through comparative numerical simulations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern applications demand high performance and cost efficient database management systems (DBMSs). Their workloads may be diverse, ranging from online transaction processing to analytics and decision support. The cloud infrastructure enables disaggregation of monolithic DBMSs into components that facilitate software-hardware co-design. This is realized using pools of hardware resources, i.e., CPUs, GPUs, memory, FPGA, NVM, etc., connected using high-speed networks. This disaggregation trend is being adopted by cloud DBMSs because hardware re-provisioning can be achieved by simply invoking software APIs. Disaggregated DBMSs separate processing from storage, enabling each to scale elastically and independently. They may disaggregate compute usage based on functionality, e.g., compute needed for writes from compute needed for queries and compute needed for compaction. They may also use disaggregated memory, e.g., for intermediate results in a shuffle or for remote caching. The DBMS monitors the characteristics of a workload and dynamically assembles its components that are most efficient and cost effective for the workload. This paper is a summary of a panel session that discussed the capability, challenges, and opportunities of these emerging DBMSs and disaggregated hardware systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cost Adaptive Multi-queue eviction Policy (CAMP) is an algorithm for a general purpose key-value store (KVS) that manages key-value pairs computed by applications with different access patterns, key-value sizes, and varying costs for each key-value pair. CAMP is an approximation of the Greedy Dual Size (GDS) algorithm that can be implemented as efficiently as LRU. In particular, CAMP's eviction policies are as effective as those of GDS but require only a small fraction of the updates to an internal data structure in order to make those decisions. Similar to an implementation of LRU using queues, it adapts to changing workload patterns based on the history of requests for different key-value pairs. It is superior to LRU because it considers both the size and cost of key-value pairs to maximize the utility of the available memory across competing applications. We compare CAMP with both LRU and an alternative that requires human intervention to partition memory into pools and assign grouping of key-value pairs to different pools. The results demonstrate CAMP is as fast as LRU while outperforming both LRU and the pooled alternative. We also present results from an implementation of CAMP using Twitter's version of memcached.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Online LLM inference powers many exciting applications such as intelligent chatbots and autonomous agents. Modern LLM inference engines widely rely on request batching to improve inference throughput, aiming to make it cost-efficient when running on expensive GPU accelerators. However, the limited GPU memory has largely limited the batch size achieved in practice, leaving significant GPU compute resources wasted.   We present NEO, an online LLM inference system that offloads part of attention compute and KV cache states from the GPU to the local host CPU, effectively increasing the GPU batch size and thus inference throughput. To this end, NEO proposes asymmetric GPU-CPU pipelining and load-aware scheduling to balance GPU and CPU loads and fully utilize their compute and memory resources. We evaluate NEO on a wide range of workloads (i.e., code generation, text summarization), GPUs (i.e., T4, A10G, H100), and LLM models (i.e., 7B, 8B, 70B). NEO achieves up to 7.5$\times$, 26%, and 14% higher throughput compared to GPU-only approach on T4, A10G, and H100 GPUs, respectively, while maintaining the same latency; with more powerful CPUs, NEO achieves up to 79.3% throughput gain on A10G GPU.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In-context learning (ICL) approaches typically leverage prompting to condition decoder-only language model generation on reference information. Just-in-time processing of a context is inefficient due to the quadratic cost of self-attention operations, and caching is desirable. However, caching transformer states can easily require almost as much space as the model parameters. When the right context isn't known in advance, caching ICL can be challenging. This work addresses these limitations by introducing models that, inspired by the encoder-decoder architecture, use cross-attention to condition generation on reference text without the prompt. More precisely, we leverage pre-trained decoder-only models and only train a small number of added layers. We use Question-Answering (QA) as a testbed to evaluate the ability of our models to perform conditional generation and observe that they outperform ICL, are comparable to fine-tuned prompted LLMs, and drastically reduce the space footprint relative to standard KV caching by two orders of magnitude.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce the Block Transformer which adopts hierarchical global-to-local modeling to autoregressive transformers to mitigate the inference bottlenecks associated with self-attention. Self-attention requires the key-value (KV) cache of all previous sequences to be retrieved from memory at every decoding step to retrieve context information, leading to two primary bottlenecks during batch inference. First, there is a significant delay in obtaining the first token, as the information of the entire prompt must first be processed to prefill the KV cache. Second, computation of subsequent tokens is bottlenecked by the high memory I/O demand of fetching the entire KV cache, which grows linearly with sequence length, incurring quadratic memory reads overall. We design the Block Transformer to strategically mitigate these costs, by incorporating coarsity and locality into an integrated global-to-local architecture. At the lower layers, we aggregate tokens into fixed size blocks to apply attention across the entire sequence at coarse-grained detail, to capture the global context while minimizing KV cache overhead. At upper layers, we apply attention within each block to decode individual tokens, to model fine-grained details with a lightweight local KV cache. We pretrain vanilla and Block Transformers from scratch and demonstrate that Block Transformers reach 10--20x inference throughput compared to vanilla transformers with equivalent perplexity and zero-shot task performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We describe a hidden surface removal algorithm for two-dimensional layered scenes built from arbitrary primitives, particularly suited to interaction and animation in rich scenes (for example, in illustration). The method makes use of a set-based raster representation to implement a front-to-back rendering model which analyses and dramatically reduces the amount of rasterization and composition required to render a scene. The method is extended to add frame-to-frame coherence analysis and caching for interactive or animated scenes. A powerful system of primitive-combiners called filters is described, which preserves the efficiencies of the algorithm in highly complicated scenes. The set representation is extended to solve the problem of correlated mattes, leading to an efficient solution for high quality antialiasing. A prototype implementation has been prepared.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces a microservices architecture for the purpose of enhancing the flexibility and performance of an airline reservation system. The architectural design incorporates Redis cache technologies, two different messaging systems (Kafka and RabbitMQ), two types of storages (MongoDB, and PostgreSQL). It also introduces authorization techniques, including secure communication through OAuth2 and JWT which is essential with the management of high-demand travel services. According to selected indicators, the architecture provides an impressive level of data consistency at 99.5% and a latency of data propagation of less than 75 ms allowing rapid and reliable intercommunication between microservices. A system throughput of 1050 events per second was achieved so that the acceptability level was maintained even during peak time. Redis caching reduced a 92% cache hit ratio on the database thereby lowering the burden on the database and increasing the speed of response. Further improvement of the systems scalability was done through the use of Docker and Kubernetes which enabled services to be expanded horizontally to cope with the changes in demand. The error rates were very low, at 0.2% further enhancing the efficiency of the system in handling real-time data integration. This approach is suggested to meet the specific needs of the airline reservation system. It is secure, fast, scalable, all serving to improve the user experience as well as the efficiency of operations. The low latency and high data integration levels and prevaiing efficient usage of the resources demonstrates the architecture ability to offer continued support in the ever growing high demand situations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In numerous production environments, Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) plays an indispensable role, particularly when dealing with massive datasets that can contain billions of entries. The necessity for rapid response times in these applications makes the efficiency of ANNS algorithms crucial. However, traditional ANNS approaches encounter substantial challenges at the billion-scale level. CPU-based methods are hindered by the limitations of memory bandwidth, while GPU-based methods struggle with memory capacity and resource utilization efficiency. This paper introduces MemANNS, an innovative framework that utilizes UPMEM PIM architecture to address the memory bottlenecks in ANNS algorithms at scale. We concentrate on optimizing a well-known ANNS algorithm, IVFPQ, for PIM hardware through several techniques. First, we introduce an architecture-aware strategy for data placement and query scheduling that ensures an even distribution of workload across PIM chips, thereby maximizing the use of aggregated memory bandwidth. Additionally, we have developed an efficient thread scheduling mechanism that capitalizes on PIM's multi-threading capabilities and enhances memory management to boost cache efficiency. Moreover, we have recognized that real-world datasets often feature vectors with frequently co-occurring items. To address this, we propose a novel encoding method for IVFPQ that minimizes memory accesses during query processing. Our comprehensive evaluation using actual PIM hardware and real-world datasets at the billion-scale, show that MemANNS offers a significant 4.3x increase in QPS over CPU-based Faiss, and it matches the performance of GPU-based Faiss implementations. Additionally, MemANNS improves energy efficiency, with a 2.3x enhancement in QPS/Watt compared to GPU solutions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a revolutionary advancement in the contemporary landscape of artificial general intelligence (AGI). As exemplified by ChatGPT, LLM-based applications necessitate minimal response latency and maximal throughput for inference serving. However, due to the unpredictability of LLM execution, the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) scheduling policy employed by current LLM serving systems suffers from head-of-line (HoL) blocking issues and long job response times.   In this paper, we propose a new efficient LLM inference serving framework, named ALISE. The key design paradigm of ALISE is to leverage a novel speculative scheduler by estimating the execution time for each job and exploiting such prior knowledge to assign appropriate job priority orders, thus minimizing potential queuing delays for heterogeneous workloads. Furthermore, to mitigate the memory overhead of the intermediate key-value (KV) cache, we employ a priority-based adaptive memory management protocol and quantization-based compression techniques. Evaluations demonstrate that in comparison to the state-of-the-art solution vLLM, ALISE improves the throughput of inference serving by up to 1.8x and 2.1x under the same latency constraint on the Alpaca and ShareGPT datasets, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Many applications today provide users with multiple auto-complete drafts as they type, including GitHub's code completion, Gmail's smart compose, and Apple's messaging auto-suggestions. Under the hood, language models support this by running an autoregressive inference pass to provide a draft. Consequently, providing $k$ drafts to the user requires running an expensive language model $k$ times. To alleviate the computation cost of running $k$ inference passes, we propose Superposed Decoding, a new decoding algorithm that generates $k$ drafts at the computation cost of one autoregressive inference pass. We achieve this by feeding a superposition of the most recent token embeddings from the $k$ drafts as input to the next decoding step of the language model. At every inference step we combine the $k$ drafts with the top-$k$ tokens to get $k^2$ new drafts and cache the $k$ most likely options, using an n-gram interpolation with minimal compute overhead to filter out incoherent generations. Our experiments show that $k$ drafts from Superposed Decoding are at least as coherent and factual as Nucleus Sampling and Greedy Decoding respectively, while being at least $2.44\times$ faster for $k\ge3$. In a compute-normalized setting, user evaluations demonstrably favor text generated by Superposed Decoding over Nucleus Sampling. Superposed Decoding can also be combined with other decoding strategies, resulting in universal coverage gains when scaling inference time compute.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper tackles the growing issue of excessive data transmission in networks. With increasing traffic, backhaul links and core networks are under significant traffic, leading to the investigation of caching solutions at edge routers. Many existing studies utilize Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to tackle caching problems, often assuming decision points at fixed intervals; however, real-world environments are characterized by random request arrivals. Additionally, critical file attributes such as lifetime, size, and priority significantly impact the effectiveness of caching policies, yet existing research fails to integrate all these attributes in policy design. In this work, we model the caching problem using a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) to better capture the continuous-time nature of real-world applications, enabling caching decisions to be triggered by random file requests. We then introduce a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)--based caching strategy that fully considers file attributes like lifetime, size, and priority. Simulations show that our method outperforms a recent Deep Reinforcement Learning-based technique. To further advance our research, we improved the convergence rate of PPO by prioritizing transitions within the replay buffer through an attention mechanism. This mechanism evaluates the similarity between the current state and all stored transitions, assigning higher priorities to transitions that exhibit greater similarity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are essential in natural language processing but often struggle with inference speed and computational efficiency, limiting real-time deployment. The key-value (KV) cache mechanism reduces computational overhead in transformer models, but challenges in maintaining contextual understanding remain. In this paper, we propose BUZZ, a novel KV caching algorithm that leverages structured contextual information to minimize cache memory usage while enhancing inference speed. BUZZ employs a beehive-structured sparse cache, incorporating a sliding window to capture recent information and dynamically segmenting historical tokens into chunks to prioritize important tokens in local neighborhoods. We evaluate BUZZ on four real-world datasets: CNN/Daily Mail, XSUM, Wikitext, and 10-QA. Our results demonstrate that BUZZ (1) reduces cache memory usage by $\textbf{2.5}\times$ in LLM inference while maintaining over 99% accuracy in long-text summarization, and (2) surpasses state-of-the-art performance in multi-document question answering by $\textbf{7.69%}$ under the same memory limit, where full cache methods encounter out-of-memory issues. Additionally, BUZZ achieves significant inference speedup with a $\log{n}$ time complexity. The code is available at https://github.com/JunqiZhao888/buzz-llm.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The transformer's context window is vital for tasks such as few-shot learning and conditional generation as it preserves previous tokens for active memory. However, as the context lengths increase, the computational costs grow quadratically, hindering the deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world, long sequence scenarios. Although some recent key-value caching (KV Cache) methods offer linear inference complexity, they naively manage the stored context, prematurely evicting tokens and losing valuable information. Moreover, they lack an optimized prefill/prompt stage strategy, resulting in higher latency than even quadratic attention for realistic context sizes. In response, we introduce a novel mechanism that leverages cascading sub-cache buffers to selectively retain the most relevant tokens, enabling the model to maintain longer context histories without increasing the cache size. Our approach outperforms linear caching baselines across key benchmarks, including streaming perplexity, question answering, book summarization, and passkey retrieval, where it retains better retrieval accuracy at 1M tokens after four doublings of the cache size of 65K. Additionally, our method reduces prefill stage latency by a factor of 6.8 when compared to flash attention on 1M tokens. These innovations not only enhance the computational efficiency of LLMs but also pave the way for their effective deployment in resource-constrained environments, enabling large-scale, real-time applications with significantly reduced latency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, Transformer-based models (Transformers) have achieved significant success in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). However, previous works focus on extracting features either from the time domain or the frequency domain, which inadequately captures the trends and periodic characteristics. To address this issue, we propose a wavelet learning framework to model complex temporal dependencies of the time series data. The wavelet domain integrates both time and frequency information, allowing for the analysis of local characteristics of signals at different scales. Additionally, the Softmax self-attention mechanism used by Transformers has quadratic complexity, which leads to excessive computational costs when capturing long-term dependencies. Therefore, we propose a novel attention mechanism: Rotary Route Attention (RoRA). Unlike Softmax attention, RoRA utilizes rotary position embeddings to inject relative positional information to sequence tokens and introduces a small number of routing tokens $r$ to aggregate information from the $KV$ matrices and redistribute it to the $Q$ matrix, offering linear complexity. We further propose WaveRoRA, which leverages RoRA to capture inter-series dependencies in the wavelet domain. We conduct extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets. The results indicate that WaveRoRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models while maintaining lower computational costs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Geomagnetically Induced Current (GIC) refers to the electromagnetic response of the Earth and its conductive modern infrastructures to space weather and would pose a significant threat to high-voltage power grids designed for the alternative current operation. To assess the impact of space weather on the power grid, one needs to calculate the GIC on a national or continental scale. In this study, we developed a smart and parallelized GIC modelling algorithm, Graph GIC. This algorithm deploys a graph representing a power grid in a single-line diagram, in which substations/transformers act as nodes and transmission lines as edges. With these denotations, a power grid and its electric parameters are mathematically represented with an adjacency matrix and an admittance matrix. We used sparse matrix and parallelisation techniques to expedite the intensive computation in cases of large-scale power grids. The Graph GIC was validated with a benchmark grid, applied to the GIC calculation of the 500 kV power grid of Guangdong, China, and conducted preliminary analysis on the grid's susceptibility to geomagnetic storms. The Graph GIC algorithm has the advantage of an intuitive and highly scalable graph representation of a power grid at any scale. It achieves high-accuracy calculation and a speedup of about 18 times after parallelisation. This algorithm could be applied to assess the impact of space weather on a power grid up to continental scales and could be incorporated into global space weather modelling frameworks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a versatile set of tasks. A key challenge in accelerating VLMs is storing and accessing the large Key-Value (KV) cache that encodes long visual contexts, such as images or videos. While existing KV cache compression methods are effective for Large Language Models (LLMs), directly migrating them to VLMs yields suboptimal accuracy and speedup. To bridge the gap, we propose VL-Cache, a novel KV cache compression recipe tailored for accelerating VLM inference. In this paper, we first investigate the unique sparsity pattern of VLM attention by distinguishing visual and text tokens in prefill and decoding phases. Based on these observations, we introduce a layer-adaptive sparsity-aware cache budget allocation method that effectively distributes the limited cache budget across different layers, further reducing KV cache size without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we develop a modality-aware token scoring policy to better evaluate the token importance. Empirical results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that retaining only 10% of KV cache achieves accuracy comparable to that with full cache. In a speed benchmark, our method accelerates end-to-end latency of generating 100 tokens by up to 2.33x and speeds up decoding by up to 7.08x, while reducing the memory footprint of KV cache in GPU by 90%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this study, we introduce adaptive KV cache compression, a plug-and-play method that reduces the memory footprint of generative inference for Large Language Models (LLMs). Different from the conventional KV cache that retains key and value vectors for all context tokens, we conduct targeted profiling to discern the intrinsic structure of attention modules. Based on the recognized structure, we then construct the KV cache in an adaptive manner: evicting long-range contexts on attention heads emphasizing local contexts, discarding non-special tokens on attention heads centered on special tokens, and only employing the standard KV cache for attention heads that broadly attend to all tokens. Moreover, with the lightweight attention profiling used to guide the construction of the adaptive KV cache, FastGen can be deployed without resource-intensive fine-tuning or re-training. In our experiments across various asks, FastGen demonstrates substantial reduction on GPU memory consumption with negligible generation quality loss. We will release our code and the compatible CUDA kernel for reproducibility.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet deploying them on mobile devices remains an arduous challenge due to their extensive computational and memory demands. While lightweight LLMs have been developed to fit mobile environments, they suffer from degraded model accuracy. In contrast, sparsity-based techniques minimize DRAM usage by selectively transferring only relevant neurons to DRAM while retaining the full model in external storage, such as flash. However, such approaches are critically limited by numerous I/O operations, particularly on smartphones with severe IOPS constraints.   In this paper, we propose Ripple, a novel approach that accelerates LLM inference on smartphones by optimizing neuron placement in flash memory. Ripple leverages the concept of Neuron Co-Activation, where neurons frequently activated together are linked to facilitate continuous read access and optimize data transfer efficiency. Our approach incorporates a two-stage solution: an offline stage that reorganizes neuron placement based on co-activation patterns, and an online stage that employs tailored data access and caching strategies to align well with hardware characteristics. Evaluations conducted on a variety of smartphones and LLMs demonstrate that Ripple achieves up to 5.93x improvements in I/O latency compared to the state-of-the-art. As the first solution to optimize storage placement under sparsity, Ripple explores a new optimization space at the intersection of sparsity-driven algorithm and storage-level system co-design in LLM inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In large venues like shopping malls and airports, knowledge on the indoor populations fuels applications such as business analytics, venue management, and safety control. In this work, we provide means of modeling populations in partitions of indoor space offline and of monitoring indoor populations continuously, by using indoor positioning data. However, the low-sampling rates of indoor positioning render the data temporally and spatially sparse, which in turn renders the offline capture of indoor populations challenging. It is even more challenging to continuously monitor indoor populations, as positioning data may be missing or not ready yet at the current moment. To address these challenges, we first enable probabilistic modeling of populations in indoor space partitions as Normal distributions. Based on that, we propose two learning-based estimators for on-the-fly prediction of population distributions. Leveraging the prediction-based schemes, we provide a unified continuous query processing framework for a type of query that enables continuous monitoring of populated partitions. The framework encompasses caching and result validity mechanisms to reduce cost and maintain monitoring effectiveness. Extensive experiments on two real data sets show that the proposed estimators are able to outperform the state-of-the-art alternatives and that the query processing framework is effective and efficient.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The promising applications of large language models are often constrained by the limited GPU memory capacity available on edge devices. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models help mitigate this issue by activating only a subset of the model's parameters during computation, allowing the unused parameters to be offloaded to host memory and reducing overall GPU memory demand. However, existing cache-based offloading solutions handle cache misses reactively and significantly impact system performance. In this paper, we propose ProMoE, a novel proactive caching system that leverages intermediate model results to predict subsequent parameter usage. By proactively fetching experts in advance, ProMoE removes the loading time from the critical path and diminishes the performance overhead of offloading. Our evaluations demonstrate that ProMoE achieves an average speedup of 2.13x and 2.84x in the prefill and decode stages respectively, compared to existing offloading solutions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Last few years have seen unprecedented advances in capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). These advancements promise to deeply benefit a vast array of application domains. However, due to their immense size, performing inference with LLMs is both costly and slow. Consequently, a plethora of recent work has proposed strategies to enhance inference efficiency, e.g., quantization, pruning, and caching. These acceleration strategies reduce the inference cost and latency, often by several factors, while maintaining much of the predictive performance measured via common benchmarks. In this work, we explore another critical aspect of LLM performance: demographic bias in model generations due to inference acceleration optimizations. Using a wide range of metrics, we probe bias in model outputs from a number of angles. Analysis of outputs before and after inference acceleration shows significant change in bias. Worryingly, these bias effects are complex and unpredictable. A combination of an acceleration strategy and bias type may show little bias change in one model but may lead to a large effect in another. Our results highlight a need for in-depth and case-by-case evaluation of model bias after it has been modified to accelerate inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The context window of large language models (LLMs) is rapidly increasing, leading to a huge variance in resource usage between different requests as well as between different phases of the same request. Restricted by static parallelism strategies, existing LLM serving systems cannot efficiently utilize the underlying resources to serve variable-length requests in different phases. To address this problem, we propose a new parallelism paradigm, elastic sequence parallelism (ESP), to elastically adapt to the variance between different requests and phases. Based on ESP, we design and build LoongServe, an LLM serving system that (1) improves computation efficiency by elastically adjusting the degree of parallelism in real-time, (2) improves communication efficiency by reducing key-value cache migration overhead and overlapping partial decoding communication with computation, and (3) improves GPU memory efficiency by reducing key-value cache fragmentation across instances. Our evaluation under diverse real-world datasets shows that LoongServe improves the maximum throughput by up to 3.85$\times$ compared to the chunked prefill and 5.81$\times$ compared to the prefill-decoding disaggregation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we introduce a new post-training compression paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate their wider adoption. We delve into LLM weight low-rank decomposition, and find that the challenges of this task stem from the distribution variance in the LLM activations and the sensitivity difference among various kinds of layers. To address these issues, we propose a training-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition (ASVD). Specifically, ASVD manages activation outliers by transforming the weight matrix based on the activation distribution. This transformation allows the outliers in the activation matrix to be absorbed into the transformed weight matrix, thereby enhancing decomposition accuracy. Additionally, we propose an efficient iterative calibration process to optimize layer-specific decomposition by addressing the varying sensitivity of different LLM layers. In this way, ASVD can compress a network by 10%-30%. Based on the success of the low-rank decomposition of projection matrices in the self-attention module, we further introduce ASVD to compress the KV cache. By reducing the channel dimension of KV activations, memory requirements for KV cache can be largely reduced. ASVD can further achieve 50% KV cache reductions without performance drop in a training-free manner. Code is anonymously available in supplementary materials.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We consider a system with a local cache connected to a backend server and an end user population. A set of contents are stored at the the server where they continuously get updated. The local cache keeps copies, potentially stale, of a subset of the contents. The users make content requests to the local cache which either can serve the local version if available or can fetch a fresh version or can wait for additional requests before fetching and serving a fresh version. Serving a stale version of a content incurs an age-of-version(AoV) dependent ageing cost, fetching it from the server incurs a fetching cost, and making a request wait incurs a per unit time waiting cost. We focus on the optimal actions subject to the cache capacity constraint at each decision epoch, aiming at minimizing the long term average cost. We pose the problem as a Restless Multi-armed Bandit(RMAB) Problem and propose a Whittle index based policy which is known to be asymptotically optimal. We explicitly characterize the Whittle indices. We numerically evaluate the proposed policy and also compare it to a greedy policy. We show that it is close to the optimal policy and substantially outperforms the greedy policy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce QuaRot, a new Quantization scheme based on Rotations, which is able to quantize LLMs end-to-end, including all weights, activations, and KV cache in 4 bits. QuaRot rotates LLMs in a way that removes outliers from the hidden state without changing the output, making quantization easier. This computational invariance is applied to the hidden state (residual) of the LLM, as well as to the activations of the feed-forward components, aspects of the attention mechanism, and to the KV cache. The result is a quantized model where all matrix multiplications are performed in 4 bits, without any channels identified for retention in higher precision. Our 4-bit quantized LLaMa2-70B model has losses of at most 0.47 WikiText-2 perplexity and retains 99% of the zero-shot performance. We also show that QuaRot can provide lossless 6 and 8 bit LLaMa2 models without any calibration data using round-to-nearest quantization. Code is available at: https://github.com/spcl/QuaRot.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Diffusion Model has not only garnered noteworthy achievements in the realm of image generation but has also demonstrated its potential as an effective pretraining method utilizing unlabeled data. Drawing from the extensive potential unveiled by the Diffusion Model in both semantic correspondence and open vocabulary segmentation, our work initiates an investigation into employing the Latent Diffusion Model for Few-shot Semantic Segmentation. Recently, inspired by the in-context learning ability of large language models, Few-shot Semantic Segmentation has evolved into In-context Segmentation tasks, morphing into a crucial element in assessing generalist segmentation models. In this context, we concentrate on Few-shot Semantic Segmentation, establishing a solid foundation for the future development of a Diffusion-based generalist model for segmentation. Our initial focus lies in understanding how to facilitate interaction between the query image and the support image, resulting in the proposal of a KV fusion method within the self-attention framework. Subsequently, we delve deeper into optimizing the infusion of information from the support mask and simultaneously re-evaluating how to provide reasonable supervision from the query mask. Based on our analysis, we establish a simple and effective framework named DiffewS, maximally retaining the original Latent Diffusion Model's generative framework and effectively utilizing the pre-training prior. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the previous SOTA models in multiple settings.

In designing algorithms, compilers, and systems, data movement is a common bottleneck in high-performance computation, in which we improve cache and memory performance. We study a special type of data reuse in the form of repeated traversals, or re-traversals, which are based on the symmetric group. The cyclic and sawtooth traces are previously known results in symmetric locality, and in this work, we would like to generalize this result for any re-traversal. Then, we also provide an abstract framework for applications in compiler design and machine learning models to improve the memory performance of certain programs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the widespread deployment of long-context large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing demand for efficient support of high-throughput inference. However, as the key-value (KV) cache expands with the sequence length, the increasing memory footprint and the need to access it for each token generation both result in low throughput when serving long-context LLMs. While various dynamic sparse attention methods have been proposed to speed up inference while maintaining generation quality, they either fail to sufficiently reduce GPU memory consumption or introduce significant decoding latency by offloading the KV cache to the CPU. We present ShadowKV, a high-throughput long-context LLM inference system that stores the low-rank key cache and offloads the value cache to reduce the memory footprint for larger batch sizes and longer sequences. To minimize decoding latency, ShadowKV employs an accurate KV selection strategy that reconstructs minimal sparse KV pairs on-the-fly. By evaluating ShadowKV on a broad range of benchmarks, including RULER, LongBench, and Needle In A Haystack, and models like Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3-8B-1M, GLM-4-9B-1M, Yi-9B-200K, Phi-3-Mini-128K, and Qwen2-7B-128K, we demonstrate that it can support up to 6$\times$ larger batch sizes and boost throughput by up to 3.04$\times$ on an A100 GPU without sacrificing accuracy, even surpassing the performance achievable with infinite batch size under the assumption of infinite GPU memory.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Online paging is a fundamental problem in the field of online algorithms, in which one maintains a cache of $k$ slots as requests for fetching pages arrive online. In the weighted variant of this problem, each page has its own fetching cost; a substantial line of work on this problem culminated in an (optimal) $O(\log k)$-competitive randomized algorithm, due to Bansal, Buchbinder and Naor (FOCS'07).   Existing work for weighted paging assumes that page weights are known in advance, which is not always the case in practice. For example, in multi-level caching architectures, the expected cost of fetching a memory block is a function of its probability of being in a mid-level cache rather than the main memory. This complex property cannot be predicted in advance; over time, however, one may glean information about page weights through sampling their fetching cost multiple times.   We present the first algorithm for online weighted paging that does not know page weights in advance, but rather learns from weight samples. In terms of techniques, this requires providing (integral) samples to a fractional solver, requiring a delicate interface between this solver and the randomized rounding scheme; we believe that our work can inspire online algorithms to other problems that involve cost sampling.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Conventional wisdom holds that an efficient interface between an OS running on a CPU and a high-bandwidth I/O device should be based on Direct Memory Access (DMA), descriptor rings, and interrupts: DMA offloads transfers from the CPU, descriptor rings provide buffering and queuing, and interrupts facilitate asynchronous interaction between cores and device with a lightweight notification mechanism. In this paper we question this wisdom in the light of modern hardware and workloads, particularly in cloud servers. Like others before us, we argue that the assumptions that led to this model are obsolete, and in many use-cases use of Programmed I/O (PIO), where the CPU explicitly transfers data and control information to and from a device via loads and stores, actually results in a more efficient system. However, unlike others to date, we push this idea further and show, in a real implementation, the gains in average and tail latency for fine-grained communication achievable using an open cache-coherence protocol which exposes cache transitions to a smart device. We show this using three use-cases: fine-grained RPC-style invocation of functions on an accelerator, offloading of operators in a streaming dataflow engine, and a network interface targeting for serverless functions, comparing our use of coherence with both traditional DMA-style interaction and a highly-optimized implementation using PIO over PCI Express (PCIe).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) with long context windows have gained significant attention. However, the KV cache, stored to avoid re-computation, becomes a bottleneck. Various dynamic sparse or TopK-based attention approximation methods have been proposed to leverage the common insight that attention is sparse. In this paper, we first show that TopK attention itself suffers from quality degradation in certain downstream tasks because attention is not always as sparse as expected. Rather than selecting the keys and values with the highest attention scores, sampling with theoretical guarantees can provide a better estimation for attention output. To make the sampling-based approximation practical in LLM generation, we propose MagicPIG, a heterogeneous system based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). MagicPIG significantly reduces the workload of attention computation while preserving high accuracy for diverse tasks. MagicPIG stores the LSH hash tables and runs the attention computation on the CPU, which allows it to serve longer contexts and larger batch sizes with high approximation accuracy. MagicPIG can improve decoding throughput by $1.9\sim3.9\times$ across various GPU hardware and achieve 110ms decoding latency on a single RTX 4090 for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model with a context of 96k tokens.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper proposes Skip2-LoRA as a lightweight fine-tuning method for deep neural networks to address the gap between pre-trained and deployed models. In our approach, trainable LoRA (low-rank adaptation) adapters are inserted between the last layer and every other layer to enhance the network expressive power while keeping the backward computation cost low. This architecture is well-suited to cache intermediate computation results of the forward pass and then can skip the forward computation of seen samples as training epochs progress. We implemented the combination of the proposed architecture and cache, denoted as Skip2-LoRA, and tested it on a $15 single board computer. Our results show that Skip2-LoRA reduces the fine-tuning time by 90.0% on average compared to the counterpart that has the same number of trainable parameters while preserving the accuracy, while taking only a few seconds on the microcontroller board.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Autoregressive (AR) Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success across numerous tasks. However, the AR modeling paradigm presents certain limitations; for instance, contemporary autoregressive LLMs are trained to generate one token at a time, which can result in noticeable latency. Recent advances have indicated that search and repeated sampling can enhance performance in various applications, such as theorem proving, code generation, and alignment, by utilizing greater computational resources during inference. In this study, we demonstrate that diffusion language models are capable of generating at least 32 tokens simultaneously, while exceeding the performance of AR models in text quality and on the LAMBADA natural language understanding benchmark. This outcome is achieved through a novel distillation method for discrete diffusion models, which reduces the number of inference steps by a factor of 32-64. Practically, our models, even without caching, can generate tokens at a rate that is up to 8 times faster than AR models employing KV caching, and we anticipate further improvements with the inclusion of caching. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for diffusion language models with up to 860M parameters.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep learning models have become pivotal in the field of video processing and is increasingly critical in practical applications such as autonomous driving and object detection. Although Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated their power, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain a highly efficient and high-performance choice for feature extraction and encoding. However, the intensive computational demands of convolution operations hinder its broader adoption as a video encoder. Given the inherent temporal continuity in video frames, changes between consecutive frames are minimal, allowing for the skipping of redundant computations. This technique, which we term as Diff Computation, presents two primary challenges. First, Diff Computation requires to cache intermediate feature maps to ensure the correctness of non-linear computations, leading to significant memory consumption. Second, the imbalance of sparsity among layers, introduced by Diff Computation, incurs accuracy degradation. To address these issues, we propose a memory-efficient scheduling method to eliminate memory overhead and an online adjustment mechanism to minimize accuracy degradation. We integrate these techniques into our framework, SparseTem, to seamlessly support various CNN-based video encoders. SparseTem achieves speedup of 1.79x for EfficientDet and 4.72x for CRNN, with minimal accuracy drop and no additional memory overhead. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SparseTem sets a new state-of-the-art by effectively utilizing temporal continuity to accelerate CNN-based video encoders.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Training large transformers is slow, but recent innovations on GPU architecture give us an advantage. NVIDIA Ampere GPUs can execute a fine-grained 2:4 sparse matrix multiplication twice as fast as its dense equivalent. In the light of this property, we comprehensively investigate the feasibility of accelerating feed-forward networks (FFNs) of transformers in pre-training. First, we define a ``flip rate'' to monitor the stability of a 2:4 training process. Utilizing this metric, we propose three techniques to preserve accuracy: to modify the sparse-refined straight-through estimator by applying the masked decay term on gradients, to determine a feasible decay factor in warm-up stage, and to enhance the model's quality by a dense fine-tuning procedure near the end of pre-training. Besides, we devise two techniques to practically accelerate training: to calculate transposable 2:4 masks by convolution, and to accelerate gated activation functions by reducing GPU L2 cache miss. Experiments show that our 2:4 sparse training algorithm achieves similar convergence to dense training algorithms on several transformer pre-training tasks, while actual acceleration can be observed on different shapes of transformer block apparently.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Planning with partial observation is a central challenge in embodied AI. A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state. In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent works have challenged our canonical view of RR Lyrae (RRL) stars as tracers of exclusively old populations ($\gtrsim10$~Gyr) by proposing a fraction of these stars to be of intermediate ages ($\sim$2-5~Gyr). Since it is currently not possible to infer stellar ages directly for individual RRL stars, our goal in this work is to search for these in association to intermediate-age clusters whose reliable ages can then be safely be attributed to the RRL. We used the Gaia DR3 Specific Object Study and OGLE IV public catalogues to search for RRL stars around stellar clusters older than 1~Gyr in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. Modelling membership probabilities based on proper motion and photometric distance we obtained a list of 302 RRL stars associated with Magellanic clusters. Of these, 23 RRL are likely members of 10 intermediate-age clusters: 3 and 7 in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds, respectively. By modelling the inferred expectation values of the number of RRL stars per cluster, we inferred the delay time distribution of the RRL in three age ranges. For the old population ($>8$~Gyr) we find $2.6^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ RRL$/10^5 M_\odot$. For the young (1-2 Gyr) and intermediate age (2-8 Gyr) populations we find rates of $0.9^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ and $0.27^{+0.1}_{-0.09}$ RRL$/10^5 M_\odot$, respectively. While radial velocities are necessary for definitively confirming cluster memberships, the high-probability list of intermediate-age RRL stars presented here offers a promising opportunity for the first direct confirmation of these enigmatic stars.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving tasks vastly depends on the quality of the instructions, which often require fine-tuning through extensive human effort. This highlights the need for automated instruction optimization; however, this optimization is particularly challenging when dealing with black-box LLMs, where model parameters and gradients remain inaccessible. We propose ACING, a task-specific prompt optimization approach framed as a stateless continuous-action Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem, known as the continuum bandit setting. ACING leverages an actor-critic-based method to optimize prompts, learning from non-differentiable reward signals. We validate ACING by optimizing prompts for ChatGPT on 30 instruction-based tasks. ACING consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving a median score improvement of 10 percentage points. Furthermore, ACING not only recovers but also surpasses human-crafted expert instructions, achieving up to a 39 percentage point improvement against human benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present LazyDINO, a transport map variational inference method for fast, scalable, and efficiently amortized solutions of high-dimensional nonlinear Bayesian inverse problems with expensive parameter-to-observable (PtO) maps. Our method consists of an offline phase in which we construct a derivative-informed neural surrogate of the PtO map using joint samples of the PtO map and its Jacobian. During the online phase, when given observational data, we seek rapid posterior approximation using surrogate-driven training of a lazy map [Brennan et al., NeurIPS, (2020)], i.e., a structure-exploiting transport map with low-dimensional nonlinearity. The trained lazy map then produces approximate posterior samples or density evaluations. Our surrogate construction is optimized for amortized Bayesian inversion using lazy map variational inference. We show that (i) the derivative-based reduced basis architecture [O'Leary-Roseberry et al., Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Eng., 388 (2022)] minimizes the upper bound on the expected error in surrogate posterior approximation, and (ii) the derivative-informed training formulation [O'Leary-Roseberry et al., J. Comput. Phys., 496 (2024)] minimizes the expected error due to surrogate-driven transport map optimization. Our numerical results demonstrate that LazyDINO is highly efficient in cost amortization for Bayesian inversion. We observe one to two orders of magnitude reduction of offline cost for accurate posterior approximation, compared to simulation-based amortized inference via conditional transport and conventional surrogate-driven transport. In particular, LazyDINO outperforms Laplace approximation consistently using fewer than 1000 offline samples, while other amortized inference methods struggle and sometimes fail at 16,000 offline samples.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Secure aggregation is concerned with the task of securely uploading the inputs of multiple users to an aggregation server without letting the server know the inputs beyond their summation. It finds broad applications in distributed machine learning paradigms such as federated learning (FL) where multiple clients, each having access to a proprietary dataset, periodically upload their locally trained models (abstracted as inputs) to a parameter server which then generates an aggregate (e.g., averaged) model that is sent back to the clients as an initializing point for a new round of local training. To enhance the data privacy of the clients, secure aggregation protocols are developed using techniques from cryptography to ensure that the server infers no more information of the users' inputs beyond the desired aggregated input, even if the server can collude with some users. Although laying the ground for understanding the fundamental utility-security trade-off in secure aggregation, the simple star client-server architecture cannot capture more complex network architectures used in practical systems. Motivated by hierarchical federated learning, we investigate the secure aggregation problem in a $3$-layer hierarchical network consisting of clustered users connecting to an aggregation server through an intermediate layer of relays. Besides the conventional server security which requires that the server learns nothing beyond the desired sum of inputs, relay security is also imposed so that the relays infer nothing about the users' inputs and remain oblivious. For such a hierarchical secure aggregation (HSA) problem, we characterize the optimal multifaceted trade-off between communication (in terms of user-to-relay and relay-to-server communication rates) and secret key generation efficiency (in terms of individual key and source key rates).

BioBERT, which was pre-trained on medical data, demonstrated superior performance in medical text classification (97% accuracy). Surprisingly, XLNet followed closely (96% accuracy), demonstrating its generalizability across domains even though it was not pre-trained on medical data. LastBERT, a custom model based on the lighter version of BERT, also proved competitive with 87.10% accuracy (just under BERT's 89.33%). Our findings confirm the importance of specialized models such as BioBERT and also support impressions around more general solutions like XLNet and well-tuned transformer architectures with fewer parameters (in this case, LastBERT) in medical domain tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Kahneman & Tversky's $\textit{prospect theory}$ tells us that humans perceive random variables in a biased but well-defined manner (1992); for example, humans are famously loss-averse. We show that objectives for aligning LLMs with human feedback implicitly incorporate many of these biases -- the success of these objectives (e.g., DPO) over cross-entropy minimization can partly be ascribed to them belonging to a family of loss functions that we call $\textit{human-aware losses}$ (HALOs). However, the utility functions these methods attribute to humans still differ from those in the prospect theory literature. Using a Kahneman-Tversky model of human utility, we propose a HALO that directly maximizes the utility of generations instead of maximizing the log-likelihood of preferences, as current methods do. We call this approach KTO, and it matches or exceeds the performance of preference-based methods at scales from 1B to 30B, despite only learning from a binary signal of whether an output is desirable. More broadly, our work suggests that there is no one HALO that is universally superior; the best loss depends on the inductive biases most appropriate for a given setting, an oft-overlooked consideration.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where hidden triggers can maliciously manipulate model behavior. While several backdoor attack methods have been proposed, the mechanisms by which backdoor functions operate in LLMs remain underexplored. In this paper, we move beyond attacking LLMs and investigate backdoor functionality through the novel lens of natural language explanations. Specifically, we leverage LLMs' generative capabilities to produce human-understandable explanations for their decisions, allowing us to compare explanations for clean and poisoned samples. We explore various backdoor attacks and embed the backdoor into LLaMA models for multiple tasks. Our experiments show that backdoored models produce higher-quality explanations for clean data compared to poisoned data, while generating significantly more consistent explanations for poisoned data than for clean data. We further analyze the explanation generation process, revealing that at the token level, the explanation token of poisoned samples only appears in the final few transformer layers of the LLM. At the sentence level, attention dynamics indicate that poisoned inputs shift attention from the input context when generating the explanation. These findings deepen our understanding of backdoor attack mechanisms in LLMs and offer a framework for detecting such vulnerabilities through explainability techniques, contributing to the development of more secure LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple clients, such as mobile phones and IoT devices, to collaboratively train a global machine learning model while keeping their data localized. However, recent studies have revealed that the training phase of FL is vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, such as attribute inference attacks (AIA), where adversaries exploit exchanged messages and auxiliary public information to uncover sensitive attributes of targeted clients. While these attacks have been extensively studied in the context of classification tasks, their impact on regression tasks remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing novel model-based AIAs specifically designed for regression tasks in FL environments. Our approach considers scenarios where adversaries can either eavesdrop on exchanged messages or directly interfere with the training process. We benchmark our proposed attacks against state-of-the-art methods using real-world datasets. The results demonstrate a significant increase in reconstruction accuracy, particularly in heterogeneous client datasets, a common scenario in FL. The efficacy of our model-based AIAs makes them better candidates for empirically quantifying privacy leakage for federated regression tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The advancements in large language models (LLMs) have propelled the improvement of video understanding tasks by incorporating LLMs with visual models. However, most existing LLM-based models (e.g., VideoLLaMA, VideoChat) are constrained to processing short-duration videos. Recent attempts to understand long-term videos by extracting and compressing visual features into a fixed memory size. Nevertheless, those methods leverage only visual modality to merge video tokens and overlook the correlation between visual and textual queries, leading to difficulties in effectively handling complex question-answering tasks. To address the challenges of long videos and complex prompts, we propose AdaCM$^2$, which, for the first time, introduces an adaptive cross-modality memory reduction approach to video-text alignment in an auto-regressive manner on video streams. Our extensive experiments on various video understanding tasks, such as video captioning, video question answering, and video classification, demonstrate that AdaCM$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets while significantly reducing memory usage. Notably, it achieves a 4.5% improvement across multiple tasks in the LVU dataset with a GPU memory consumption reduction of up to 65%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Leveraging sparsity is crucial for optimizing large language model inference. however, modern LLMs employing SiLU as their activation function exhibit minimal activation sparsity. Recent research has proposed replacing SiLU with ReLU to induce significant activation sparsity and showed no downstream task accuracy degradation through fine tuning. However, taking full advantage of it required training a predictor to estimate this sparsity. In this paper, we introduce SparseInfer, a simple, light weight, and training free predictor for activation sparsity of ReLU field LLMs, in which activation sparsity is predicted by comparing only the sign bits of inputs and weights. To compensate for possible prediction inaccuracy, an adaptive tuning of the predictor's conservativeness is enabled, which can also serve as a control knob for optimizing LLM inference. The proposed method achieves approximately faster inference speed over the state of the art, with negligible accuracy loss of within 1%p.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Programming-by-Examples (PBE) aims to generate an algorithm from input-output examples. Such systems are practically and theoretically important: from an end-user perspective, they are deployed to millions of people, and from an AI perspective, PBE corresponds to a very general form of few-shot inductive inference. Given the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code-generation tasks, we investigate here the extent to which LLMs can be said to have "solved" PBE. We experiment on classic domains such as lists and strings, and an uncommon graphics programming domain not well represented in typical pretraining data. We find that pretrained models are not effective at PBE, but that they can be fine-tuned for much higher performance, provided the test problems are in-distribution. We analyze empirically what causes these models to succeed and fail, and take steps toward understanding how to achieve better out-of-distribution generalization. Collectively these results suggest that LLMs make strong progress toward solving the typical suite of PBE tasks, potentially increasing the flexibility and applicability of PBE systems, while also identifying ways in which LLMs still fall short.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Medical Decision-Making (MDM) is a multi-faceted process that requires clinicians to assess complex multi-modal patient data patient, often collaboratively. Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to streamline this process by synthesizing vast medical knowledge and multi-modal health data. However, single-agent are often ill-suited for nuanced medical contexts requiring adaptable, collaborative problem-solving. Our MDAgents addresses this need by dynamically assigning collaboration structures to LLMs based on task complexity, mimicking real-world clinical collaboration and decision-making. This framework improves diagnostic accuracy and supports adaptive responses in complex, real-world medical scenarios, making it a valuable tool for clinicians in various healthcare settings, and at the same time, being more efficient in terms of computing cost than static multi-agent decision making methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We have come up with a research that hopes to provide a bridge between the users of American Sign Language and the users of spoken language and Indian Sign Language (ISL). The research enabled us to create a novel framework that we have developed for Learner Systems. Leveraging art of Large models to create key features including: - Real-time translation between these two sign languages in an efficient manner. Making LLM's capability available for seamless translations to ISL. Here is the full study showing its implementation in this paper. The core of the system is a sophisticated pipeline that begins with reclassification and recognition of ASL gestures based on a strong Random Forest Classifier. By recognizing the ASL, it is translated into text which can be more easily processed. Highly evolved natural language NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques come in handy as they play a role in our LLM integration where you then use LLMs to be able to convert the ASL text to ISL which provides you with the intent of sentence or phrase. The final step is to synthesize the translated text back into ISL gestures, creating an end-to-end translation experience using RIFE-Net. This framework is tasked with key challenges such as automatically dealing with gesture variability and overcoming the linguistic differences between ASL and ISL. By automating the translation process, we hope to vastly improve accessibility for sign language users. No longer will the communication gap between ASL and ISL create barriers; this totally cool innovation aims to bring our communities closer together. And we believe, with full confidence in our framework, that we're able to apply the same principles across a wide variety of sign language dialects.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) can yield capable agents and control policies in several domains but is commonly plagued by prohibitively long training times. Additionally, in the case of continuous control problems, the applicability of learned policies on real-world embedded devices is limited due to the lack of real-time guarantees and portability of existing libraries. To address these challenges, we present RLtools, a dependency-free, header-only, pure C++ library for deep supervised and reinforcement learning. Its novel architecture allows RLtools to be used on a wide variety of platforms, from HPC clusters over workstations and laptops to smartphones, smartwatches, and microcontrollers. Specifically, due to the tight integration of the RL algorithms with simulation environments, RLtools can solve popular RL problems up to 76 times faster than other popular RL frameworks. We also benchmark the inference on a diverse set of microcontrollers and show that in most cases our optimized implementation is by far the fastest. Finally, RLtools enables the first-ever demonstration of training a deep RL algorithm directly on a microcontroller, giving rise to the field of TinyRL. The source code as well as documentation and live demos are available through our project page at https://rl.tools.

We study this question on ARC, a highly diverse dataset of abstract reasoning tasks. We train neural models for induction (inferring latent functions) and transduction (directly predicting the test output for a given test input). Our models are trained on synthetic data generated by prompting LLMs to produce Python code specifying a function to be inferred, plus a stochastic subroutine for generating inputs to that function. We find inductive and transductive models solve very different problems, despite training on the same problems, and despite sharing the same neural architecture.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We emulate the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, including tidal deformability, for neutron stars using a novel hybrid method based upon the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) for the first time. This new method, which we call Star Log-extended eMulation (SLM), utilizes the underlying logarithmic behavior of the differential equations to enable accurate emulation of the nonlinear system. We show predictions for well-known phenomenological equations of state (EOS) with fixed parameters and with a freely-varying parametric Quarkyonic EOS. Our results produce a significant computational speed-up of $\approx 3 \times 10^4$ compared to high fidelity (HF) calculations using standard Runge-Kutta methods, providing an efficient emulator for the numerous TOV evaluations required by multi-messenger astrophysical frameworks that infer constraints on the EOS from neutron star mergers. The ability of the SLM algorithm to learn a mapping between parameters of the EOS and subsequent neutron star properties also opens up potential extensions for assisting in computationally prohibitive uncertainty quantification (UQ) for any type of EOS. The source code for the methods developed in this work will be openly available in a public GitHub repository for community modification and use.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The development of artificial intelligence systems capable of understanding and reasoning about complex real-world scenarios is a significant challenge. In this work we present a novel approach to enhance and exploit LLM reactive capability to address complex problems and interpret deeply contextual real-world meaning. We introduce a method and a tool for creating a multimodal, knowledge-augmented formal representation of meaning that combines the strengths of large language models with structured semantic representations. Our method begins with an image input, utilizing state-of-the-art large language models to generate a natural language description. This description is then transformed into an Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graph, which is formalized and enriched with logical design patterns, and layered semantics derived from linguistic and factual knowledge bases. The resulting graph is then fed back into the LLM to be extended with implicit knowledge activated by complex heuristic learning, including semantic implicatures, moral values, embodied cognition, and metaphorical representations. By bridging the gap between unstructured language models and formal semantic structures, our method opens new avenues for tackling intricate problems in natural language understanding and reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Continually evaluating large generative models provides a unique challenge. Often, human annotations are necessary to evaluate high-level properties of these models (e.g. in text or images). However, collecting human annotations of samples can be resource intensive, and using other machine learning systems to provide the annotations, or automatic evaluation, can introduce systematic errors into the evaluation. The Prediction Powered Inference (PPI) framework provides a way of leveraging both the statistical power of automatic evaluation and a small pool of labelled data to produce a low-variance, unbiased estimate of the quantity being evaluated for. However, most work on PPI considers a relatively sizable set of labelled samples, which is not always practical to obtain. To this end, we present two new PPI-based techniques that leverage robust regressors to produce even lower variance estimators in the few-label regime.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper investigates non-intrusive Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) Reduced-Order Models (ROMs) for plasma turbulence simulations. In particular, we focus on Operator Inference (OpInf) to build low-cost physics-based ROMs from data for such simulations. As a representative example, we consider the (classical) Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) equations used for modeling two-dimensional electrostatic drift-wave turbulence. For a comprehensive perspective of the potential of OpInf to construct predictive ROMs, we consider three setups for the HW equations by varying a key parameter, namely the adiabaticity coefficient. These setups lead to the formation of complex and nonlinear dynamics, which makes the construction of predictive ROMs of any kind challenging. We generate the training datasets by performing direct numerical simulations of the HW equations and recording the computed state data and outputs the over a time horizon of $100$ time units in the turbulent phase. We then use these datasets to construct OpInf ROMs for predictions over $400$ additional time units, that is, $400\%$ more than the training horizon. Our results show that the OpInf ROMs capture important statistical features of the turbulent dynamics and generalize beyond the training time horizon while reducing the computational effort of the high-fidelity simulation by up to five orders of magnitude. In the broader context of fusion research, this shows that non-intrusive SciML ROMs have the potential to drastically accelerate numerical studies, which can ultimately enable tasks such as the design of optimized fusion devices.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Backgrounds: Information extraction (IE) is critical in clinical natural language processing (NLP). While large language models (LLMs) excel on generative tasks, their performance on extractive tasks remains debated. Methods: We investigated Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) using 1,588 clinical notes from four sources (UT Physicians, MTSamples, MIMIC-III, and i2b2). We developed an annotated corpus covering 4 clinical entities and 16 modifiers, and compared instruction-tuned LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 against BiomedBERT in terms of performance, generalizability, computational resources, and throughput to BiomedBERT. Results: LLaMA models outperformed BiomedBERT across datasets. With sufficient training data, LLaMA showed modest improvements (1% on NER, 1.5-3.7% on RE); improvements were larger with limited training data. On unseen i2b2 data, LLaMA-3-70B outperformed BiomedBERT by 7% (F1) on NER and 4% on RE. However, LLaMA models required more computing resources and ran up to 28 times slower. We implemented "Kiwi," a clinical IE package featuring both models, available at https://kiwi.clinicalnlp.org/. Conclusion: This study is among the first to develop and evaluate a comprehensive clinical IE system using open-source LLMs. Results indicate that LLaMA models outperform BiomedBERT for clinical NER and RE but with higher computational costs and lower throughputs. These findings highlight that choosing between LLMs and traditional deep learning methods for clinical IE applications should remain task-specific, taking into account both performance metrics and practical considerations such as available computing resources and the intended use case scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Model mis-specification (e.g. the presence of outliers) is commonly encountered in astronomical analyses, often requiring the use of ad hoc algorithms (e.g. sigma-clipping). We develop and implement a generic Bayesian approach to linear regression, based on Student's t-distributions, that is robust to outliers and mis-specification of the noise model. Our method is validated using simulated datasets with various degrees of model mis-specification; the derived constraints are shown to be systematically less biased than those from a similar model using normal distributions. We demonstrate that, for a dataset without outliers, a worst-case inference using t-distributions would give unbiased results with $\lesssim\!10$ per cent increase in the reported parameter uncertainties. We also compare with existing analyses of real-world datasets, finding qualitatively different results where normal distributions have been used and agreement where more robust methods have been applied. A Python implementation of this model, t-cup, is made available for others to use.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has led to increasingly sophisticated deep learning models, which frequently operate as opaque 'black boxes' with limited transparency in their decision-making processes. This lack of interpretability presents considerable challenges, especially in high-stakes applications where understanding the rationale behind a model's outputs is as essential as the outputs themselves. This study addresses the pressing need for interpretability in AI systems, emphasizing its role in fostering trust, ensuring accountability, and promoting responsible deployment in mission-critical fields. To address the interpretability challenge in deep learning, we introduce DLBacktrace, an innovative technique developed by the AryaXAI team to illuminate model decisions across a wide array of domains, including simple Multi Layer Perceptron (MLPs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Large Language Models (LLMs), Computer Vision Models, and more.   We provide a comprehensive overview of the DLBacktrace algorithm and present benchmarking results, comparing its performance against established interpretability methods, such as SHAP, LIME, GradCAM, Integrated Gradients, SmoothGrad, and Attention Rollout, using diverse task-based metrics. The proposed DLBacktrace technique is compatible with various model architectures built in PyTorch and TensorFlow, supporting models like Llama 3.2, other NLP architectures such as BERT and LSTMs, computer vision models like ResNet and U-Net, as well as custom deep neural network (DNN) models for tabular data. This flexibility underscores DLBacktrace's adaptability and effectiveness in enhancing model transparency across a broad spectrum of applications. The library is open-sourced and available at https://github.com/AryaXAI/DLBacktrace .

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The field of AI-assisted music creation has made significant strides, yet existing systems often struggle to meet the demands of iterative and nuanced music production. These challenges include providing sufficient control over the generated content and allowing for flexible, precise edits. This thesis tackles these issues by introducing a series of advancements that progressively build upon each other, enhancing the controllability and editability of text-to-music generation models.   First, we introduce Loop Copilot, a system that tries to address the need for iterative refinement in music creation. Loop Copilot leverages a large language model (LLM) to coordinate multiple specialised AI models, enabling users to generate and refine music interactively through a conversational interface. Central to this system is the Global Attribute Table, which records and maintains key musical attributes throughout the iterative process, ensuring that modifications at any stage preserve the overall coherence of the music. While Loop Copilot excels in orchestrating the music creation process, it does not directly address the need for detailed edits to the generated content.   To overcome this limitation, MusicMagus is presented as a further solution for editing AI-generated music. MusicMagus introduces a zero-shot text-to-music editing approach that allows for the modification of specific musical attributes, such as genre, mood, and instrumentation, without the need for retraining. By manipulating the latent space within pre-trained diffusion models, MusicMagus ensures that these edits are stylistically coherent and that non-targeted attributes remain unchanged. This system is particularly effective in maintaining the structural integrity of the music during edits, but it encounters challenges with more complex and real-world audio scenarios.   ...

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Galaxies grow and evolve in dark matter halos. Because dark matter is not visible, galaxies' halo masses ($\rm{M}_{\rm{halo}}$) must be inferred indirectly. We present a graph neural network (GNN) model for predicting $\rm{M}_{\rm{halo}}$ from stellar mass ($\rm{M}_{*}$) in simulated galaxy clusters using data from the IllustrisTNG simulation suite. Unlike traditional machine learning models like random forests, our GNN captures the information-rich substructure of galaxy clusters by using spatial and kinematic relationships between galaxy neighbour. A GNN model trained on the TNG-Cluster dataset and independently tested on the TNG300 simulation achieves superior predictive performance compared to other baseline models we tested. Future work will extend this approach to different simulations and real observational datasets to further validate the GNN model's ability to generalise.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Stereotypes are generalised assumptions about societal groups, and even state-of-the-art LLMs using in-context learning struggle to identify them accurately. Due to the subjective nature of stereotypes, where what constitutes a stereotype can vary widely depending on cultural, social, and individual perspectives, robust explainability is crucial. Explainable models ensure that these nuanced judgments can be understood and validated by human users, promoting trust and accountability. We address these challenges by introducing HEARTS (Holistic Framework for Explainable, Sustainable, and Robust Text Stereotype Detection), a framework that enhances model performance, minimises carbon footprint, and provides transparent, interpretable explanations. We establish the Expanded Multi-Grain Stereotype Dataset (EMGSD), comprising 57,201 labelled texts across six groups, including under-represented demographics like LGBTQ+ and regional stereotypes. Ablation studies confirm that BERT models fine-tuned on EMGSD outperform those trained on individual components. We then analyse a fine-tuned, carbon-efficient ALBERT-V2 model using SHAP to generate token-level importance values, ensuring alignment with human understanding, and calculate explainability confidence scores by comparing SHAP and LIME outputs...

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Neutron stars provide a powerful probe of axion dark matter, especially in higher frequency ranges where there remain fewer laboratory constraints. Populations of neutron stars near the Galactic Centre have been proposed as a means to place strong constraints on axion dark matter. One downside of this approach is that there are very few direct observations of neutron stars in this region, introducing uncertainties in the total number of neutron stars in this ``invisible" population at the Galactic Centre, whose size must be inferred through birth rate modelling. We suggest this number could also be reduced due to stellar dynamics carrying stars away from the Galactic Centre via large kick velocities at birth. We attempt to circumvent the uncertainty on the Galactic Centre population size by modelling the axion signal from better understood populations outside the Galactic Centre using {\tt PsrPopPy} which is normalised against pulsar observations. We consider lower-frequency, wider-angle searches for this signal via a range of instruments including MeerKAT and SKA-low but find that the sensitivity is not competitive with existing constraints. Finally, returning to the Galactic Centre, we compare populations to single objects as targets for axion detection. Using the latest modelling of axion-photon conversion in the Galactic Centre magnetar, we conclude that within astrophysical uncertainties, the Galactic Centre population and the magnetar could give comparable sensitivities to axion dark matter, suggesting one should continue to search for both signals in future surveys.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Handling sparse and unstructured geometric data, such as point clouds or event-based vision, is a pressing challenge in the field of machine vision. Recently, sequence models such as Transformers and state-space models entered the domain of geometric data. These methods require specialized preprocessing to create a sequential view of a set of points. Furthermore, prior works involving sequence models iterate geometric data with either uniform or learned step sizes, implicitly relying on the model to infer the underlying geometric structure. In this work, we propose to encode geometric structure explicitly into the parameterization of a state-space model. State-space models are based on linear dynamics governed by a one-dimensional variable such as time or a spatial coordinate. We exploit this dynamic variable to inject relative differences of coordinates into the step size of the state-space model. The resulting geometric operation computes interactions between all pairs of N points in O(N) steps. Our model deploys the Mamba selective state-space model with a modified CUDA kernel to efficiently map sparse geometric data to modern hardware. The resulting sequence model, which we call STREAM, achieves competitive results on a range of benchmarks from point-cloud classification to event-based vision and audio classification. STREAM demonstrates a powerful inductive bias for sparse geometric data by improving the PointMamba baseline when trained from scratch on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN point cloud analysis datasets. It further achieves, for the first time, 100% test accuracy on all 11 classes of the DVS128 Gestures dataset.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In industrial anomaly detection, model efficiency and mobile-friendliness become the primary concerns in real-world applications. Simultaneously, the impressive generalization capabilities of Segment Anything (SAM) have garnered broad academic attention, making it an ideal choice for localizing unseen anomalies and diverse real-world patterns. In this paper, considering these two critical factors, we propose a SAM-guided Two-stream Lightweight Model for unsupervised anomaly detection (STLM) that not only aligns with the two practical application requirements but also harnesses the robust generalization capabilities of SAM. We employ two lightweight image encoders, i.e., our two-stream lightweight module, guided by SAM's knowledge. To be specific, one stream is trained to generate discriminative and general feature representations in both normal and anomalous regions, while the other stream reconstructs the same images without anomalies, which effectively enhances the differentiation of two-stream representations when facing anomalous regions. Furthermore, we employ a shared mask decoder and a feature aggregation module to generate anomaly maps. Our experiments conducted on MVTec AD benchmark show that STLM, with about 16M parameters and achieving an inference time in 20ms, competes effectively with state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance, 98.26% on pixel-level AUC and 94.92% on PRO. We further experiment on more difficult datasets, e.g., VisA and DAGM, to demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of STLM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sepsis is a life-threatening condition defined by end-organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection. Although the Surviving Sepsis Campaign has launched and has been releasing sepsis treatment guidelines to unify and normalize the care for sepsis patients, it has been reported in numerous studies that disparities in care exist across the trajectory of patient stay in the emergency department and intensive care unit. Here, we apply a number of reinforcement learning techniques including behavioral cloning, imitation learning, and inverse reinforcement learning, to learn the optimal policy in the management of septic patient subgroups using expert demonstrations. Then we estimate the counterfactual optimal policies by applying the model to another subset of unseen medical populations and identify the difference in cure by comparing it to the real policy. Our data comes from the sepsis cohort of MIMIC-IV and the clinical data warehouses of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system. The ultimate objective of this work is to use the optimal learned policy function to estimate the counterfactual treatment policy and identify deviations across sub-populations of interest. We hope this approach would help us identify any disparities in care and also changes in cure in response to the publication of national sepsis treatment guidelines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper develops a formal econometric framework and tools for the identification and inference of a structural parameter in general bunching designs. We present both point and partial identification results, which generalize previous approaches in the literature. The key assumption for point identification is the analyticity of the counterfactual density, which defines a broader class of distributions than many well-known parametric families. In the partial identification approach, the analyticity condition is relaxed and various shape restrictions can be incorporated, including those found in the literature. Both of our identification results account for observable heterogeneity in the model, which has previously been permitted only in limited ways. We provide a suite of counterfactual estimation and inference methods, termed the generalized polynomial strategy. Our method restores the merits of the original polynomial strategy proposed by Chetty et al. (2011) while addressing several weaknesses in the widespread practice. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated compared to a version of the polynomial estimator in a series of Monte Carlo studies within the augmented isoelastic model. We revisit the data used in Saez (2010) and find substantially different results relative to those from the polynomial strategy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The capabilities and limitations of Large Language Models have been sketched out in great detail in recent years, providing an intriguing yet conflicting picture. On the one hand, LLMs demonstrate a general ability to solve problems. On the other hand, they show surprising reasoning gaps when compared to humans, casting doubt on the robustness of their generalisation strategies. The sheer volume of data used in the design of LLMs has precluded us from applying the method traditionally used to measure generalisation: train-test set separation. To overcome this, we study what kind of generalisation strategies LLMs employ when performing reasoning tasks by investigating the pretraining data they rely on. For two models of different sizes (7B and 35B) and 2.5B of their pretraining tokens, we identify what documents influence the model outputs for three simple mathematical reasoning tasks and contrast this to the data that are influential for answering factual questions. We find that, while the models rely on mostly distinct sets of data for each factual question, a document often has a similar influence across different reasoning questions within the same task, indicating the presence of procedural knowledge. We further find that the answers to factual questions often show up in the most influential data. However, for reasoning questions the answers usually do not show up as highly influential, nor do the answers to the intermediate reasoning steps. When we characterise the top ranked documents for the reasoning questions qualitatively, we confirm that the influential documents often contain procedural knowledge, like demonstrating how to obtain a solution using formulae or code. Our findings indicate that the approach to reasoning the models use is unlike retrieval, and more like a generalisable strategy that synthesises procedural knowledge from documents doing a similar form of reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces the partial Gini covariance, a novel dependence measure that addresses the challenges of high-dimensional inference with heavy-tailed errors, often encountered in fields like finance, insurance, climate, and biology. Conventional high-dimensional regression inference methods suffer from inaccurate type I errors and reduced power in heavy-tailed contexts, limiting their effectiveness. Our proposed approach leverages the partial Gini covariance to construct a robust statistical inference framework that requires minimal tuning and does not impose restrictive moment conditions on error distributions. Unlike traditional methods, it circumvents the need for estimating the density of random errors and enhances the computational feasibility and robustness. Extensive simulations demonstrate the proposed method's superior power and robustness over standard high-dimensional inference approaches, such as those based on the debiased Lasso. The asymptotic relative efficiency analysis provides additional theoretical insight on the improved efficiency of the new approach in the heavy-tailed setting. Additionally, the partial Gini covariance extends to the multivariate setting, enabling chi-square testing for a group of coefficients. We illustrate the method's practical application with a real-world data example.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Combinatorial optimization (CO) is essential for improving efficiency and performance in engineering applications. As complexity increases with larger problem sizes and more intricate dependencies, identifying the optimal solution become challenging. When it comes to real-world engineering problems, algorithms based on pure mathematical reasoning are limited and incapable to capture the contextual nuances necessary for optimization. This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving engineering CO problems by leveraging their reasoning power and contextual knowledge. We propose a novel LLM-based framework that integrates network topology and domain knowledge to optimize the sequencing of Design Structure Matrix (DSM)-a common CO problem. Our experiments on various DSM cases demonstrate that the proposed method achieves faster convergence and higher solution quality than benchmark methods. Moreover, results show that incorporating contextual domain knowledge significantly improves performance despite the choice of LLMs. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs in tackling complex real-world CO problems by combining semantic and mathematical reasoning. This approach paves the way for a new paradigm in in real-world combinatorial optimization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent debates raised concerns that language models may favor certain viewpoints. But what if the solution is not to aim for a 'view from nowhere' but rather to leverage different viewpoints? We introduce Plurals, a system and Python library for pluralistic AI deliberation. Plurals consists of Agents (LLMs, optionally with personas) which deliberate within customizable Structures, with Moderators overseeing deliberation. Plurals is a generator of simulated social ensembles. Plurals integrates with government datasets to create nationally representative personas, includes deliberation templates inspired by deliberative democracy, and allows users to customize both information-sharing structures and deliberation behavior within Structures. Six case studies demonstrate fidelity to theoretical constructs and efficacy. Three randomized experiments show simulated focus groups produced output resonant with an online sample of the relevant audiences (chosen over zero-shot generation in 75% of trials). Plurals is both a paradigm and a concrete system for pluralistic AI. The Plurals library is available at https://github.com/josh-ashkinaze/plurals and will be continually updated.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (LRNNs) such as Mamba, RWKV, GLA, mLSTM, and DeltaNet have emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformers in large language modeling, offering linear scaling with sequence length and improved training efficiency. However, LRNNs struggle to perform state-tracking which may impair performance in tasks such as code evaluation or tracking a chess game. Even parity, the simplest state-tracking task, which non-linear RNNs like LSTM handle effectively, cannot be solved by current LRNNs. Recently, Sarrof et al. (2024) demonstrated that the failure of LRNNs like Mamba to solve parity stems from restricting the value range of their diagonal state-transition matrices to $[0, 1]$ and that incorporating negative values can resolve this issue. We extend this result to non-diagonal LRNNs, which have recently shown promise in models such as DeltaNet. We prove that finite precision LRNNs with state-transition matrices having only positive eigenvalues cannot solve parity, while complex eigenvalues are needed to count modulo $3$. Notably, we also prove that LRNNs can learn any regular language when their state-transition matrices are products of identity minus vector outer product matrices, each with eigenvalues in the range $[-1, 1]$. Our empirical results confirm that extending the eigenvalue range of models like Mamba and DeltaNet to include negative values not only enables them to solve parity but consistently improves their performance on state-tracking tasks. Furthermore, pre-training LRNNs with an extended eigenvalue range for language modeling achieves comparable performance and stability while showing promise on code and math data. Our work enhances the expressivity of modern LRNNs, broadening their applicability without changing the cost of training or inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The fast development of location-based social networks (LBSNs) has led to significant changes in society, resulting in popular studies of using LBSN data for socioeconomic prediction, e.g., regional population and commercial activity estimation. Existing studies design various graphs to model heterogeneous LBSN data, and further apply graph representation learning methods for socioeconomic prediction. However, these approaches heavily rely on heuristic ideas and expertise to extract task-relevant knowledge from diverse data, which may not be optimal for specific tasks. Additionally, they tend to overlook the inherent relationships between different indicators, limiting the prediction accuracy. Motivated by the remarkable abilities of large language models (LLMs) in commonsense reasoning, embedding, and multi-agent collaboration, in this work, we synergize LLM agents and knowledge graph for socioeconomic prediction. We first construct a location-based knowledge graph (LBKG) to integrate multi-sourced LBSN data. Then we leverage the reasoning power of LLM agent to identify relevant meta-paths in the LBKG for each type of socioeconomic prediction task, and design a semantic-guided attention module for knowledge fusion with meta-paths. Moreover, we introduce a cross-task communication mechanism to further enhance performance by enabling knowledge sharing across tasks at both LLM agent and KG levels. On the one hand, the LLM agents for different tasks collaborate to generate more diverse and comprehensive meta-paths. On the other hand, the embeddings from different tasks are adaptively merged for better socioeconomic prediction. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the synergistic design between LLM and KG, providing insights for information sharing across socioeconomic prediction tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While deep learning-based robotic grasping technology has demonstrated strong adaptability, its computational complexity has also significantly increased, making it unsuitable for scenarios with high real-time requirements. Therefore, we propose a low computational complexity and high accuracy model named VMGNet for robotic grasping. For the first time, we introduce the Visual State Space into the robotic grasping field to achieve linear computational complexity, thereby greatly reducing the model's computational cost. Meanwhile, to improve the accuracy of the model, we propose an efficient and lightweight multi-scale feature fusion module, named Fusion Bridge Module, to extract and fuse information at different scales. We also present a new loss function calculation method to enhance the importance differences between subtasks, improving the model's fitting ability. Experiments show that VMGNet has only 8.7G Floating Point Operations and an inference time of 8.1 ms on our devices. VMGNet also achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Cornell and Jacquard public datasets. To validate VMGNet's effectiveness in practical applications, we conducted real grasping experiments in multi-object scenarios, and VMGNet achieved an excellent performance with a 94.4% success rate in real-world grasping tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable capabilities in various software engineering tasks, spurring the rapid growth of the Large Language Models for Software Engineering (LLM4SE) area. However, limited attention has been paid to developing efficient LLM4SE techniques that demand minimal computational cost, time, and memory resources, as well as green LLM4SE solutions that reduce energy consumption, water usage, and carbon emissions.   This paper aims to redirect the focus of the research community towards the efficiency and greenness of LLM4SE, while also sharing potential research directions to achieve this goal. It commences with a brief overview of the significance of LLM4SE and highlights the need for efficient and green LLM4SE solutions. Subsequently, the paper presents a vision for a future where efficient and green LLM4SE revolutionizes the LLM-based software engineering tool landscape, benefiting various stakeholders, including industry, individual practitioners, and society. The paper then delineates a roadmap for future research, outlining specific research paths and potential solutions for the research community to pursue. While not intended to be a definitive guide, the paper aims to inspire further progress, with the ultimate goal of establishing efficient and green LLM4SE as a central element in the future of software engineering.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are capable of solving a wide range of tasks, yet they have struggled with reasoning. To address this, we propose $\textbf{Additional Logic Training (ALT)}$, which aims to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities by program-generated logical reasoning samples. We first establish principles for designing high-quality samples by integrating symbolic logic theory and previous empirical insights. Then, based on these principles, we construct a synthetic corpus named $\textbf{Formal Logic Deduction Diverse}$ ($\textbf{FLD}$$^{\times 2}$), comprising numerous samples of multi-step deduction with unknown facts, diverse reasoning rules, diverse linguistic expressions, and challenging distractors. Finally, we empirically show that ALT on FLD$^{\times2}$ substantially enhances the reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, including LLaMA-3.1-70B. Improvements include gains of up to 30 points on logical reasoning benchmarks, up to 10 points on math and coding benchmarks, and 5 points on the benchmark suite BBH.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite the dominant role of deep models in machine learning, limitations persist, including overconfident predictions, susceptibility to adversarial attacks, and underestimation of variability in predictions. The Bayesian paradigm provides a natural framework to overcome such issues and has become the gold standard for uncertainty estimation with deep models, also providing improved accuracy and a framework for tuning critical hyperparameters. However, exact Bayesian inference is challenging, typically involving variational algorithms that impose strong independence and distributional assumptions. Moreover, existing methods are sensitive to the architectural choice of the network. We address these issues by constructing a relaxed version of the standard feed-forward rectified neural network, and employing Polya-Gamma data augmentation tricks to render a conditionally linear and Gaussian model. Additionally, we use sparsity-promoting priors on the weights of the neural network for data-driven architectural design. To approximate the posterior, we derive a variational inference algorithm that avoids distributional assumptions and independence across layers and is a faster alternative to the usual Markov Chain Monte Carlo schemes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) are a common model component for sequence labeling tasks when modeling the interactions between different labels is important. However, the Markov assumption limits linear-chain CRFs to only directly modeling interactions between adjacent labels. Weighted finite-state transducers (FSTs) are a related approach which can be made to model distant label-label interactions, but exact label inference is intractable for these models in the general case, and the task of selecting an appropriate automaton structure for the desired interaction types poses a practical challenge. In this work, we present regular-pattern-sensitive CRFs (RPCRFs), a method of enriching standard linear-chain CRFs with the ability to learn long-distance label interactions which occur in user-specified patterns. This approach allows users to write regular-expression label patterns concisely specifying which types of interactions the model should take into account, allowing the model to learn from data whether and in which contexts these patterns occur. The result can be interpreted alternatively as a CRF augmented with additional, non-local potentials, or as a finite-state transducer whose structure is defined by a set of easily-interpretable patterns. Critically, unlike the general case for FSTs (and for non-chain CRFs), exact training and inference are tractable for many pattern sets. In this work, we detail how a RPCRF can be automatically constructed from a set of user-specified patterns, and demonstrate the model's effectiveness on synthetic data, showing how different types of patterns can capture different nonlocal dependency structures in label sequences.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Causal effect estimation is a critical task in statistical learning that aims to find the causal effect on subjects by identifying causal links between a number of predictor (or, explanatory) variables and the outcome of a treatment. In a regressional framework, we assign a treatment and outcome model to estimate the average causal effect. Additionally, for high dimensional regression problems, variable selection methods are also used to find a subset of predictor variables that maximises the predictive performance of the underlying model for better estimation of the causal effect. In this paper, we propose a different approach. We focus on the variable selection aspects of high dimensional causal estimation problem. We suggest a cautious Bayesian group LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) framework for variable selection using prior sensitivity analysis. We argue that in some cases, abstaining from selecting (or, rejecting) a predictor is beneficial and we should gather more information to obtain a more decisive result. We also show that for problems with very limited information, expert elicited variable selection can give us a more stable causal effect estimation as it avoids overfitting. Lastly, we carry a comparative study with synthetic dataset and show the applicability of our method in real-life situations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants have led to remarkable progress across various domains, demonstrating impressive capabilities and unprecedented potential. In the era of ubiquitous connectivity, leveraging communication networks to distribute intelligence is a transformative concept, envisioning AI-powered services accessible at the network edge. However, pushing large models from the cloud to resource-constrained environments faces critical challenges. Model inference on low-end devices leads to excessive latency and performance bottlenecks, while raw data transmission over limited bandwidth networks causes high communication overhead. This article presents AI Flow, a framework that streamlines the inference process by jointly leveraging the heterogeneous resources available across devices, edge nodes, and cloud servers, making intelligence flow across networks. To facilitate cooperation among multiple computational nodes, the proposed framework explores a paradigm shift in the design of communication network systems from transmitting information flow to intelligence flow, where the goal of communications is task-oriented and folded into the inference process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through an image captioning use case, showcasing the ability to reduce response latency while maintaining high-quality captions. This article serves as a position paper for identifying the motivation, challenges, and principles of AI Flow.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has marked a significant breakthrough in natural language processing (NLP), fueling a paradigm shift in information acquisition. Nevertheless, LLMs are prone to hallucination, generating plausible yet nonfactual content. This phenomenon raises significant concerns over the reliability of LLMs in real-world information retrieval (IR) systems and has attracted intensive research to detect and mitigate such hallucinations. Given the open-ended general-purpose attributes inherent to LLMs, LLM hallucinations present distinct challenges that diverge from prior task-specific models. This divergence highlights the urgency for a nuanced understanding and comprehensive overview of recent advances in LLM hallucinations. In this survey, we begin with an innovative taxonomy of hallucination in the era of LLM and then delve into the factors contributing to hallucinations. Subsequently, we present a thorough overview of hallucination detection methods and benchmarks. Our discussion then transfers to representative methodologies for mitigating LLM hallucinations. Additionally, we delve into the current limitations faced by retrieval-augmented LLMs in combating hallucinations, offering insights for developing more robust IR systems. Finally, we highlight the promising research directions on LLM hallucinations, including hallucination in large vision-language models and understanding of knowledge boundaries in LLM hallucinations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Remarkable advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled high-quality text summarization. However, this capability is currently accessible only through LLMs of substantial size or proprietary LLMs with usage fees. In response, smaller-scale LLMs (sLLMs) of easy accessibility and low costs have been extensively studied, yet they often suffer from missing key information and entities, i.e., low relevance, in particular, when input documents are long. We hence propose a key-element-informed instruction tuning for summarization, so-called KEITSum, which identifies key elements in documents and instructs sLLM to generate summaries capturing these key elements. Experimental results on dialogue and news datasets demonstrate that sLLM with KEITSum indeed provides high-quality summarization with higher relevance and less hallucinations, competitive to proprietary LLM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in abstractive summarization tasks. However, controllable summarization with LLMs remains underexplored, limiting their ability to generate summaries that align with specific user preferences. In this paper, we first investigate the capability of LLMs to control diverse attributes, revealing that they encounter greater challenges with numerical attributes, such as length and extractiveness, compared to linguistic attributes. To address this challenge, we propose a guide-to-explain framework (GTE) for controllable summarization. Our GTE framework enables the model to identify misaligned attributes in the initial draft and guides it in explaining errors in the previous output. Based on this reflection, the model generates a well-adjusted summary. As a result, by allowing the model to reflect on its misalignment, we generate summaries that satisfy the desired attributes in surprisingly fewer iterations than other iterative methods solely using LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern AI- and Data-intensive software systems rely heavily on data science and machine learning libraries that provide essential algorithmic implementations and computational frameworks. These libraries expose complex APIs whose correct usage has to follow constraints among multiple interdependent parameters. Developers using these APIs are expected to learn about the constraints through the provided documentations and any discrepancy may lead to unexpected behaviors. However, maintaining correct and consistent multi-parameter constraints in API documentations remains a significant challenge for API compatibility and reliability. To address this challenge, we propose MPDetector, for detecting inconsistencies between code and documentation, specifically focusing on multi-parameter constraints. MPDetector identifies these constraints at the code level by exploring execution paths through symbolic execution and further extracts corresponding constraints from documentation using large language models (LLMs). We propose a customized fuzzy constraint logic to reconcile the unpredictability of LLM outputs and detects logical inconsistencies between the code and documentation constraints. We collected and constructed two datasets from four popular data science libraries and evaluated MPDetector on them. The results demonstrate that MPDetector can effectively detect inconsistency issues with the precision of 92.8%. We further reported 14 detected inconsistency issues to the library developers, who have confirmed 11 issues at the time of writing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Capturing fresh information in near real-time and using it to augment existing large language models (LLMs) is essential to generate up-to-date, grounded, and reliable output. This problem becomes particularly challenging when LLMs are used for informational tasks in rapidly evolving fields, such as Web search related to recent or unfolding events involving entities, where generating temporally relevant responses requires access to up-to-the-hour news sources. However, the information modeled by the parametric memory of LLMs is often outdated, and Web results from prototypical retrieval systems may fail to capture the latest relevant information and struggle to handle conflicting reports in evolving news. To address this challenge, we present the NEON framework, designed to extract emerging entity interactions -- such as events or activities -- as described in news articles. NEON constructs an entity-centric timestamped knowledge graph that captures such interactions, thereby facilitating enhanced QA capabilities related to news events. Our framework innovates by integrating open Information Extraction (openIE) style tuples into LLMs to enable in-context retrieval-augmented generation. This integration demonstrates substantial improvements in QA performance when tackling temporal, entity-centric search queries. Through NEON, LLMs can deliver more accurate, reliable, and up-to-date responses.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We have recently witnessed that ``Intelligence" and `` Compression" are the two sides of the same coin, where the language large model (LLM) with unprecedented intelligence is a general-purpose lossless compressor for various data modalities. This attribute particularly appeals to the lossless image compression community, given the increasing need to compress high-resolution images in the current streaming media era. Consequently, a spontaneous envision emerges: Can the compression performance of the LLM elevate lossless image compression to new heights? However, our findings indicate that the naive application of LLM-based lossless image compressors suffers from a considerable performance gap compared with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) codecs on common benchmark datasets. In light of this, we are dedicated to fulfilling the unprecedented intelligence (compression) capacity of the LLM for lossless image compression tasks, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical and practical compression performance. Specifically, we propose P$^{2}$-LLM, a next-pixel prediction-based LLM, which integrates various elaborated insights and methodologies, \textit{e.g.,} pixel-level priors, the in-context ability of LLM, and a pixel-level semantic preservation strategy, to enhance the understanding capacity of pixel sequences for better next-pixel predictions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that P$^{2}$-LLM can beat SOTA classical and learned codecs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With over 3 billion users globally, mobile instant messaging apps have become indispensable for both personal and professional communication. Besides plain messaging, many services implement additional features such as delivery and read receipts informing a user when a message has successfully reached its target. This paper highlights that delivery receipts can pose significant privacy risks to users. We use specifically crafted messages that trigger delivery receipts allowing any user to be pinged without their knowledge or consent. By using this technique at high frequency, we demonstrate how an attacker could extract private information such as the online and activity status of a victim, e.g., screen on/off. Moreover, we can infer the number of currently active user devices and their operating system, as well as launch resource exhaustion attacks, such as draining a user's battery or data allowance, all without generating any notification on the target side. Due to the widespread adoption of vulnerable messengers (WhatsApp and Signal) and the fact that any user can be targeted simply by knowing their phone number, we argue for a design change to address this issue.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the development and proliferation of large, complex, black-box models for solving many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, there is also an increasing necessity of methods to stress-test these models and provide some degree of interpretability or explainability. While counterfactual examples are useful in this regard, automated generation of counterfactuals is a data and resource intensive process. such methods depend on models such as pre-trained language models that are then fine-tuned on auxiliary, often task-specific datasets, that may be infeasible to build in practice, especially for new tasks and data domains. Therefore, in this work we explore the possibility of leveraging large language models (LLMs) for zero-shot counterfactual generation in order to stress-test NLP models. We propose a structured pipeline to facilitate this generation, and we hypothesize that the instruction-following and textual understanding capabilities of recent LLMs can be effectively leveraged for generating high quality counterfactuals in a zero-shot manner, without requiring any training or fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on a variety of propreitary and open-source LLMs, along with various downstream tasks in NLP, we explore the efficacy of LLMs as zero-shot counterfactual generators in evaluating and explaining black-box NLP models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we propose SpikingNeRF, which aligns the temporal dimension of spiking neural networks (SNNs) with the radiance rays, to seamlessly accommodate SNNs to the reconstruction of neural radiance fields (NeRF). Thus, the computation turns into a spike-based, multiplication-free manner, reducing energy consumption and making high-quality 3D rendering, for the first time, accessible to neuromorphic hardware. In SpikingNeRF, each sampled point on the ray is matched to a particular time step and represented in a hybrid manner where the voxel grids are maintained as well. Based on the voxel grids, sampled points are determined whether to be masked out for faster training and inference. However, this masking operation also incurs irregular temporal length, making it intractable for hardware processors, e.g., GPUs, to conduct parallel training. To address this problem, we develop the temporal padding strategy to tackle the masked samples to maintain regular temporal length, i.e., regular tensors, and further propose the temporal condensing strategy to form a denser data structure for hardware-friendly computation. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that our method can reduce energy consumption by an average of 70.79\% and obtain comparable synthesis quality with the ANN baseline. Verification on the neuromorphic hardware accelerator also shows that SpikingNeRF can further benefit from neuromorphic computing over the ANN baselines on energy efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Wall-modeled large-eddy simulation (WMLES) is widely recognized as a useful method for simulation of turbulent flows at high Reynolds numbers. Nevertheless, a continual issue in different wall models is the shift of the mean velocity profile from the wall-model/RANS (Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes) region to the LES region. This phenomenon, referred to as logarithmic layer mismatch (LLM), occurs in both wall shear stress models and hybrid RANS/LES models. Many efforts have been made to explain and resolve this mismatch, including decreasing the high correlation between the wall shear stress and the velocity at the matching layer, modifying the subgrid-scale (SGS) eddy viscosity, and adding a stochastic forcing. It is widely believed that the inclusion of the resolved Reynolds shear stress (or the convection term) is essential to elliminate the LLM, as it prevents the overseimation of the modeled Reynolds shear stress and promotes the generation of the small-scale flow structures in the near-wall region. In this work, by comparing three different SGS eddy viscosity models, we demonstrate that ensuring the total shear stress conservation (TSSC) conservation is key to resolving the LLM. Under the TSSC framework, the effect of the convection term on LLM can be quantitatively assessed. Furthermore, a modified SGS eddy viscosity modfication model that adheres to the TSSC constraint is tested at different Reynolds numbers ($Re_\tau=1000, 2000, 4200$). Our results demonstrate the robust performance of the present model in predicting skin friction and low-order turbulence statistics, even under a relatively low grid resolution ($\Delta x^+, \Delta z^+ \lesssim 500$, $2\leq \Delta_x/\Delta_{y,mat} \leq 4$, where $\Delta_{y,mat}$ is the wall-normal grid spacing in the wall-model region).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Inferring the coupling of different atmospheric layers requires observing spectral lines sensitive to the atmospheric parameters, particularly the magnetic field vector, at various heights. The best way to tackle this goal is to perform multi-line observations simultaneously. For instance, the new version of the Gregor Infrared Spectrograph instrument offers the possibility to observe the spectral lines at 8542 and 10830 A simultaneously for the first time. The first spectral window contains the Ca II 8542 A spectral line, while the Si I 10827 A transition and He I 10830 A triplet infrared lines can be found in the second spectral window. As the sensitivity to the atmospheric parameters and the height of formation of those transitions is different, combining them can help understand the properties of the solar photosphere and chromosphere and how they are magnetically coupled. Traditionally, the analysis of the Si I 10827 A transition assumes local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), which is not the best approximation to model this transition. Hence, in this work, we examine the potential of performing non-LTE (NLTE) inversions of the full Stokes vector of the Si I 10827 A spectral line. The results indicate that we properly infer the atmospheric parameters through an extended range of atmospheric layers in comparison with the LTE case (only valid for the spectral line wings, i.e., the low photosphere), with no impact on the robustness of the solution and just a minor increase in computational time. Thus, the NLTE assumption will help to accurately constrain the photospheric physical parameters when performing combined inversions with, e.g., the Ca II 8542 A spectral line.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Ambiguity in natural language poses significant challenges to Large Language Models (LLMs) used for open-domain question answering. LLMs often struggle with the inherent uncertainties of human communication, leading to misinterpretations, miscommunications, hallucinations, and biased responses. This significantly weakens their ability to be used for tasks like fact-checking, question answering, feature extraction, and sentiment analysis. Using open-domain question answering as a test case, we compare off-the-shelf and few-shot LLM performance, focusing on measuring the impact of explicit disambiguation strategies. We demonstrate how simple, training-free, token-level disambiguation methods may be effectively used to improve LLM performance for ambiguous question answering tasks. We empirically show our findings and discuss best practices and broader impacts regarding ambiguity in LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large-scale multiple testing under static factor models is commonly used to select skilled funds in financial market. However, static factor models are arguably too stringent as it ignores the serial correlation, which severely distorts error rate control in large-scale inference. In this manuscript, we propose a new multiple testing procedure under dynamic factor models that is robust to the nonlinear serial dependence (e.g., GARCH). The idea is to integrate a new sample-splitting strategy based on chronological order and a two-pass Fama-Macbeth regression to form a series of statistics with marginal symmetry properties and then to utilize the symmetry properties to obtain a data-driven threshold. We show that our procedure is able to control the false discovery rate (FDR) asymptotically under high-dimensional dynamic factor models. As a byproduct that is of independent interest, we establish a new exponential-type deviation inequality for the sum of random variables on a variety of functionals of linear and non-linear processes. Numerical results including a case study on hedge fund selection demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method over several state-of-the-art methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using large language models (LLMs) often generate inaccurate responses due to the retrieval of irrelevant or loosely related information. Existing methods, which operate at the document level, fail to effectively filter out such content. We propose LLM-driven chunk filtering, ChunkRAG, a framework that enhances RAG systems by evaluating and filtering retrieved information at the chunk level. Our approach employs semantic chunking to divide documents into coherent sections and utilizes LLM-based relevance scoring to assess each chunk's alignment with the user's query. By filtering out less pertinent chunks before the generation phase, we significantly reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing RAG models, achieving higher accuracy on tasks requiring precise information retrieval. This advancement enhances the reliability of RAG systems, making them particularly beneficial for applications like fact-checking and multi-hop reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Machine Learning and AI have the potential to transform data-driven scientific discovery, enabling accurate predictions for several scientific phenomena. As many scientific questions are inherently causal, this paper looks at the causal inference task of treatment effect estimation, where the outcome of interest is recorded in high-dimensional observations in a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). Despite being the simplest possible causal setting and a perfect fit for deep learning, we theoretically find that many common choices in the literature may lead to biased estimates. To test the practical impact of these considerations, we recorded ISTAnt, the first real-world benchmark for causal inference downstream tasks on high-dimensional observations as an RCT studying how garden ants (Lasius neglectus) respond to microparticles applied onto their colony members by hygienic grooming. Comparing 6 480 models fine-tuned from state-of-the-art visual backbones, we find that the sampling and modeling choices significantly affect the accuracy of the causal estimate, and that classification accuracy is not a proxy thereof. We further validated the analysis, repeating it on a synthetically generated visual data set controlling the causal model. Our results suggest that future benchmarks should carefully consider real downstream scientific questions, especially causal ones. Further, we highlight guidelines for representation learning methods to help answer causal questions in the sciences.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> It is widely acknowledged that the performance of Transformer models is exponentially related to their number of parameters and computational complexity. While approaches like Mixture of Experts (MoE) decouple parameter count from computational complexity, they still face challenges in inference due to high memory access costs. This work introduces UltraMem, incorporating large-scale, ultra-sparse memory layer to address these limitations. Our approach significantly reduces inference latency while maintaining model performance. We also investigate the scaling laws of this new architecture, demonstrating that it not only exhibits favorable scaling properties but outperforms traditional models. In our experiments, we train networks with up to 20 million memory slots. The results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art inference speed and model performance within a given computational budget.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Significant efforts has been made to expand the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) beyond basic language tasks. While the generalizability and versatility of LLMs have enabled widespread adoption, evolving demands in application development often exceed their native capabilities. Meeting these demands may involve a diverse set of methods, such as enhancing creativity through either inference temperature adjustments or creativity-provoking prompts. Selecting the right approach is critical, as different methods lead to trade-offs in engineering complexity, scalability, and operational costs. This paper introduces a layered architecture that organizes LLM software system development into distinct layers, each characterized by specific attributes. By aligning capabilities with these layers, the framework encourages the systematic implementation of capabilities in effective and efficient ways that ultimately supports desired functionalities and qualities. Through practical case studies, we illustrate the utility of the framework. This work offers developers actionable insights for selecting suitable technologies in LLM-based software system development, promoting robustness and scalability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The challenge in LLM-based video understanding lies in preserving visual and semantic information in long videos while maintaining a memory-affordable token count. However, redundancy and correspondence in videos have hindered the performance potential of existing methods. Through statistical learning on current datasets, we observe that redundancy occurs in both repeated and answer-irrelevant frames, and the corresponding frames vary with different questions. This suggests the possibility of adopting dynamic encoding to balance detailed video information preservation with token budget reduction. To this end, we propose a dynamic cooperative network, DynFocus, for memory-efficient video encoding in this paper. Specifically, i) a Dynamic Event Prototype Estimation (DPE) module to dynamically select meaningful frames for question answering; (ii) a Compact Cooperative Encoding (CCE) module that encodes meaningful frames with detailed visual appearance and the remaining frames with sketchy perception separately. We evaluate our method on five publicly available benchmarks, and experimental results consistently demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose a novel generalized framework for grant-free random-access (GFRA) in cell-free massive multiple input multiple-output systems where multiple geographically separated access points (APs) or base stations (BSs) aim to detect sporadically active user-equipment (UEs). Unlike a conventional architecture in which all the active UEs transmit their signature or pilot sequences of equal length, we admit a flexible pilot length for each UE, which also enables a seamless integration into conventional grant-based wireless systems. We formulate the joint UE activity detection and the distributed channel estimation as a sparse support and signal recovery problem, and describe a Bayesian learning procedure to solve it. We develop a scheme to fuse the posterior statistics of the latent variables inferred by each AP to jointly detect the UEs' activities, and utilize them to further refine the channel estimates. In addition, we allude to an interesting point which enables this flexible GFRA framework to encode the information bits from the active UEs. We numerically evaluate the normalized mean square error and the probability of miss-detection performances obtained by the Bayesian algorithm and show that the latent-variable fusion enhances the detection and the channel estimation performances by a large margin. We also benchmark against a genie-aided algorithm which has a prior knowledge of the UEs' activities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multi-modal sensor fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation has become the leading approach in 3D object detection. However, existing methods often rely on depth estimators or transformer encoders for view transformation, incurring substantial computational overhead. Furthermore, the lack of precise geometric correspondence between 2D and 3D spaces leads to spatial and ray-directional misalignments, restricting the effectiveness of BEV representations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 3D object detector via efficient view transformation (EVT), which leverages a well-structured BEV representation to enhance accuracy and efficiency. EVT focuses on two main areas. First, it employs Adaptive Sampling and Adaptive Projection (ASAP), using LiDAR guidance to generate 3D sampling points and adaptive kernels. The generated points and kernels are then used to facilitate the transformation of image features into BEV space and refine the BEV features. Second, EVT includes an improved transformer-based detection framework, which contains a group-wise query initialization method and an enhanced query update framework. It is designed to effectively utilize the obtained multi-modal BEV features within the transformer decoder. By leveraging the geometric properties of object queries, this framework significantly enhances detection performance, especially in a multi-layer transformer decoder structure. EVT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes test set with real-time inference speed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To enhance the reasoning capabilities of off-the-shelf Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce a simple, yet general and effective prompting method, Re2, i.e., \textbf{Re}-\textbf{Re}ading the question as input. Unlike most thought-eliciting prompting methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which aim to elicit the reasoning process in the output, Re2 shifts the focus to the input by processing questions twice, thereby enhancing the understanding process. Consequently, Re2 demonstrates strong generality and compatibility with most thought-eliciting prompting methods, including CoT. Crucially, Re2 facilitates a "bidirectional" encoding in unidirectional decoder-only LLMs because the first pass could provide global information for the second pass. We begin with a preliminary empirical study as the foundation of Re2, illustrating its potential to enable "bidirectional" attention mechanisms. We then evaluate Re2 on extensive reasoning benchmarks across 14 datasets, spanning 112 experiments, to validate its effectiveness and generality. Our findings indicate that, with the exception of a few scenarios on vanilla ChatGPT, Re2 consistently enhances the reasoning performance of LLMs through a simple re-reading strategy. Further analyses reveal Re2's adaptability, showing how it can be effectively integrated with different LLMs, thought-eliciting prompting, and ensemble strategies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Context. HD140283, or the Methuselah star, is a well-known reference object in stellar evolution. Its peculiar chemical composition, proximity and absence of reddening makes it an interesting case-study of Pop II stars. Thanks to recent observational efforts, we now have precise interferometric and spectroscopic constraints, as well as revised astrometric parallaxes from the Gaia mission. Aims. We aim at determining the age of HD140283 with these lastest constraints, as well as quantifying the impact of systematics from physical inaccuracies in the stellar evolution models. Methods. Using recent spectroscopic abundances from the literature, including 3D non-LTE values for C, O, and Fe, we compute opacity tables specific to HD140283. We then use them in grids of stellar evolution models coupled to a Markov Chain Monte Carlo tool to determine the age of HD140283. Results. With our tailored models we find an age of 12.3Gy. Using a solar-scaled mixture instead results in an age value of 14Gy, in tension with the age of the universe ($13.77\pm0.06$Gy). We also find that reducing the mixing length parameter from its solar calibrated value will lead to an even lower age, in agreement with other recent studies. However, we find no direct evidence to favour a lower mixing length parameter value from our modelling. Conclusions. Taking into account the specific elemental abundances is crucial for the modelling of HD140283, as it leads to significant differences in the inferred age. However, this effect is degenerate with a lowering of the mixing length parameter. In this respect, asteroseismic constraints might play a key role in accurately deriving the mass of HD140283, therefore strongly constraining its age.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling the retrieval of documents into the LLM context to provide more accurate and relevant responses. Existing RAG solutions do not focus on queries that may require fetching multiple documents with substantially different contents. Such queries occur frequently, but are challenging because the embeddings of these documents may be distant in the embedding space, making it hard to retrieve them all. This paper introduces Multi-Head RAG (MRAG), a novel scheme designed to address this gap with a simple yet powerful idea: leveraging activations of Transformer's multi-head attention layer, instead of the decoder layer, as keys for fetching multi-aspect documents. The driving motivation is that different attention heads can learn to capture different data aspects. Harnessing the corresponding activations results in embeddings that represent various facets of data items and queries, improving the retrieval accuracy for complex queries. We provide an evaluation methodology and metrics, multi-aspect datasets that we release online, and real-world use cases to demonstrate MRAG's effectiveness, showing improvements of up to 20% in relevance over standard RAG baselines. MRAG can be seamlessly integrated with existing RAG frameworks and benchmarking tools like RAGAS as well as different classes of data stores.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The black-box nature of large language models (LLMs) poses challenges in interpreting results, impacting issues such as data intellectual property protection and hallucination tracing. Training data attribution (TDA) methods are considered effective solutions to address these challenges. Most recent TDA methods rely on influence functions, assuming the model achieves minimized empirical risk. However, achieving this criterion is difficult, and sourcing accuracy can be compromised by fitting errors during model training. In this paper, we introduce a novel TDA method called Debias and Denoise Attribution (DDA), which enhances influence functions by addressing fitting errors. Specifically, the debias strategy seeks to improve the performance of influence functions by eliminating the knowledge bias present in the base model before fine-tuning, while the denoise strategy aims to reduce discrepancies in influence scores arising from varying degrees of fitting during the training process through smoothing techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an averaged AUC of 91.64%. Moreover, DDA exhibits strong generality and scalability across various sources and different-scale models like LLaMA2, QWEN2, and Mistral.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present a detailed exposition of a statistical method for estimating cosmological parameters from the observation of a large number of strongly lensed binary-black-hole (BBH) mergers observable by next (third) generation (XG) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. This method, first presented in Jana (2023 Phys. Rev. Lett. 130 261401), compares the observed number of strongly lensed GW events and their time delay distribution (between lensed images) with observed events to infer cosmological parameters. We show that the precision of the estimation of the cosmological parameters does not have a strong dependance on the assumed BBH redshift distribution model. Using the large number of unlensed mergers, XG detectors are expected to measure the BBH redshift distribution with sufficient precision for the cosmological inference. However, a biased inference of the BBH redshift distribution will bias the estimation of cosmological parameters. An incorrect model for the distribution of lens properties can also lead to a biased cosmological inference. However, Bayesian model selection can assist in selecting the right model from a set of available parametric models for the lens distribution. We also present a way to incorporate the effect of contamination in the data due to the limited efficiency of lensing identification methods, so that it will not bias the cosmological inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Trajectory prediction for multi-agents in complex scenarios is crucial for applications like autonomous driving. However, existing methods often overlook environmental biases, which leads to poor generalization. Additionally, hardware constraints limit the use of large-scale data across environments, and continual learning settings exacerbate the challenge of catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose the Continual Causal Intervention (C$^{2}$INet) method for generalizable multi-agent trajectory prediction within a continual learning framework. Using variational inference, we align environment-related prior with posterior estimator of confounding factors in the latent space, thereby intervening in causal correlations that affect trajectory representation. Furthermore, we store optimal variational priors across various scenarios using a memory queue, ensuring continuous debiasing during incremental task training. The proposed C$^{2}$INet enhances adaptability to diverse tasks while preserving previous task information to prevent catastrophic forgetting. It also incorporates pruning strategies to mitigate overfitting. Comparative evaluations on three real and synthetic complex datasets against state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our proposed method consistently achieves reliable prediction performance, effectively mitigating confounding factors unique to different scenarios. This highlights the practical value of our method for real-world applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> High-dimensional count data poses significant challenges for statistical analysis, necessitating effective methods that also preserve explainability. We focus on a low rank constrained variant of the Poisson log-normal model, which relates the observed data to a latent low-dimensional multivariate Gaussian variable via a Poisson distribution. Variational inference methods have become a golden standard solution to infer such a model. While computationally efficient, they usually lack theoretical statistical properties with respect to the model. To address this issue we propose a projected stochastic gradient scheme that directly maximizes the log-likelihood. We prove the convergence of the proposed method when using importance sampling for estimating the gradient. Specifically, we obtain a rate of convergence of $O(T^{\nicefrac{-1}{2}} + N^{-1})$ with $T$ the number of iterations and $N$ the number of Monte Carlo draws. The latter follows from a novel descent lemma for non convex $L$-smooth objective functions, and random biased gradient estimate. We also demonstrate numerically the efficiency of our solution compared to its variational competitor. Our method not only scales with respect to the number of observed samples but also provides access to the desirable properties of the maximum likelihood estimator.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurate multi-turn intent classification is essential for advancing conversational AI systems. However, challenges such as the scarcity of comprehensive datasets and the complexity of contextual dependencies across dialogue turns hinder progress. This paper presents two novel approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance scalability and reduce latency in production dialogue systems. First, we introduce Symbol Tuning, which simplifies intent labels to reduce task complexity and improve performance in multi-turn dialogues. Second, we propose C-LARA (Consistency-aware, Linguistics Adaptive Retrieval Augmentation), a framework that employs LLMs for data augmentation and pseudo-labeling to generate synthetic multi-turn dialogues. These enriched datasets are used to fine-tune a small, efficient model suitable for deployment. Experiments conducted on multilingual dialogue datasets demonstrate significant improvements in classification accuracy and resource efficiency. Our methods enhance multi-turn intent classification accuracy by 5.09%, reduce annotation costs by 40%, and enable scalable deployment in low-resource multilingual industrial systems, highlighting their practicality and impact.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent methods have demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve reasoning tasks better when they are encouraged to solve subtasks of the main task first. In this paper we devise a similar strategy that breaks down reasoning tasks into a problem decomposition phase and a problem solving phase and show that the strategy is able to outperform a single stage solution. Further, we hypothesize that the decomposition should be easier to distill into a smaller model compared to the problem solving because the latter requires large amounts of domain knowledge while the former only requires learning general problem solving strategies. We propose methods to distill these two capabilities and evaluate their impact on reasoning outcomes and inference cost. We find that we can distill the problem decomposition phase and at the same time achieve good generalization across tasks, datasets, and models. However, it is harder to distill the problem solving capability without losing performance and the resulting distilled model struggles with generalization. These results indicate that by using smaller, distilled problem decomposition models in combination with problem solving LLMs we can achieve reasoning with cost-efficient inference and local adaptation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid evolution of LLMs represents an impactful paradigm shift in digital interaction and content engagement. While they encode vast amounts of human-generated knowledge and excel in processing diverse data types, they often face the challenge of accurately responding to specific user intents, leading to user dissatisfaction. Based on a fine-grained intent taxonomy and intent-based prompt reformulations, we analyze the quality of intent recognition and user satisfaction with answers from intent-based prompt reformulations of GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 Turbo models. Our study highlights the importance of human-AI interaction and underscores the need for interdisciplinary approaches to improve conversational AI systems. We show that GPT-4 outperforms GPT-3.5 in recognizing common intents but is often outperformed by GPT-3.5 in recognizing less frequent intents. Moreover, whenever the user intent is correctly recognized, while users are more satisfied with the intent-based reformulations of GPT-4 compared to GPT-3.5, they tend to be more satisfied with the models' answers to their original prompts compared to the reformulated ones. The collected data from our study has been made publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/ConcealedIDentity/UserIntentStudy) for further research.

While previous research has viewed deviations from rational analysis as problematic, we hypothesize that human reliance on non-normative heuristics may be advantageous in certain situations. In this study, we investigate scenarios where human intuition might outperform idealized statistical rationality. Our experiment assesses participants' accuracy in characterizing the parameters of known data-generating models from bivariate visualizations. Our findings show that, while participants generally demonstrated lower accuracy than statistical models, they often outperformed Bayesian agents, particularly when dealing with extreme samples. These results suggest that, even when deviating from rationality, human gut reactions to visualizations can provide an advantage. Our findings offer insights into how analyst intuition and statistical models can be integrated to improve inference and decision-making, with important implications for the design of visual analytics tools.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved automated code translation, often achieving over 80% accuracy on existing benchmarks. However, most of these benchmarks consist of short, standalone, algorithmic samples that do not reflect practical coding tasks. To address this gap, we introduce ClassEval-T, a class-level code translation benchmark designed to assess LLM performance on real-world coding scenarios. Built upon ClassEval, a class-level Python code generation benchmark covering topics such as database operations and game design, ClassEval-T extends into Java and C++ with complete code samples and test suites, requiring 360 person-hours for manual migration. We propose three translation strategies (holistic, min-dependency, and standalone) and evaluate six recent LLMs across various families and sizes on ClassEval-T. Results reveal a significant performance drop compared to method-level benchmarks, highlighting discrepancies among LLMs and demonstrating ClassEval-T's effectiveness. We further analyze LLMs' dependency awareness in translating class samples and categorize 1,397 failure cases by the best-performing LLM for practical insights and future improvement.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Inferring affordable (i.e., graspable) parts of arbitrary objects based on human specifications is essential for robots advancing toward open-vocabulary manipulation. Current grasp planners, however, are hindered by limited vision-language comprehension and time-consuming 3D radiance modeling, restricting real-time, open-vocabulary interactions with objects. To address these limitations, we propose GLOVER, a unified Generalizable Open-Vocabulary Affordance Reasoning framework, which fine-tunes the Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict visual affordance of graspable object parts within RGB feature space. We compile a dataset of over 10,000 images from human-object interactions, annotated with unified visual and linguistic affordance labels, to enable multi-modal fine-tuning. GLOVER inherits world knowledge and common-sense reasoning from LLMs, facilitating more fine-grained object understanding and sophisticated tool-use reasoning. To enable effective real-world deployment, we present Affordance-Aware Grasping Estimation (AGE), a non-parametric grasp planner that aligns the gripper pose with a superquadric surface derived from affordance data. In evaluations across 30 real-world scenes, GLOVER achieves success rates of 86.0% in part identification and 76.3% in grasping, with speeds approximately 330 times faster in affordance reasoning and 40 times faster in grasping pose estimation than the previous state-of-the-art.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The past two decades have witnessed significant success in applying columnar storage to data warehousing and analytics. However, the rapid growth of machine learning poses new challenges. This paper presents Bullion, a columnar storage system tailored for machine learning workloads. Bullion addresses the complexities of data compliance, optimizes the encoding of long sequence sparse features, efficiently manages wide-table projections, introduces feature quantization in storage, enables quality-aware sequential reads for multimodal training data, and provides a comprehensive cascading encoding framework that unifies diverse encoding schemes through modular, composable interfaces. By aligning with the evolving requirements of ML applications, Bullion facilitates the application of columnar storage and processing to modern application scenarios such as those within advertising, recommendation systems, and Generative AI.   Preliminary experimental results and theoretical analysis demonstrate Bullion's improved ability to deliver strong performance in the face of the unique demands of machine learning workloads compared to existing columnar storage solutions. Bullion significantly reduces I/O costs for deletion compliance, achieves substantial storage savings with its optimized encoding scheme for sparse features, and improves metadata parsing speed for wide-table projections. These advancements enable Bullion to become an important component in the future of machine learning infrastructure, enabling organizations to efficiently manage and process the massive volumes of data required for training and inference in modern AI applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficient and accurate prediction of material properties is critical for advancing materials design and applications. The rapid-evolution of large language models (LLMs) presents a new opportunity for material property predictions, complementing experimental measurements and multi-scale computational methods. We focus on predicting the elastic constant tensor, as a case study, and develop domain-specific LLMs for predicting elastic constants and for materials discovery. The proposed ElaTBot LLM enables simultaneous prediction of elastic constant tensors, bulk modulus at finite temperatures, and the generation of new materials with targeted properties. Moreover, the capabilities of ElaTBot are further enhanced by integrating with general LLMs (GPT-4o) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for prediction. A specialized variant, ElaTBot-DFT, designed for 0 K elastic constant tensor prediction, reduces the prediction errors by 33.1% compared with domain-specific, material science LLMs (Darwin) trained on the same dataset. This natural language-based approach lowers the barriers to computational materials science and highlights the broader potential of LLMs for material property predictions and inverse design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper proposes a two-phase text-to-floorplan generation method, which guides a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate an initial layout (Layout-LLM) and refines them into the final floorplans through conditional diffusion model. We incorporate a Chain-of-Thought approach to prompt the LLM based on user text specifications, enabling a more user-friendly and intuitive house layout design. This method allows users to describe their needs in natural language, enhancing accessibility and providing clearer geometric constraints. The final floorplans generated by Layout-LLM through conditional diffusion refinement are more accurate and better meet user requirements. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics, validating its effectiveness in practical home design applications. We plan to release our code for public use.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The capture of changes in dynamic systems, especially ordinary differential equations (ODEs), is an important and challenging task, with multiple applications in biomedical research and other scientific areas. This article proposes a fast and mathematically rigorous online method, called ODE-informed MAnifold-constrained Gaussian process Inference for Change point detection(O-MAGIC), to detect changes of parameters in the ODE system using noisy and sparse observation data. O-MAGIC imposes a Gaussian process prior to the time series of system components with a latent manifold constraint, induced by restricting the derivative process to satisfy ODE conditions. To detect the parameter changes from the observation, we propose a procedure based on a two-sample generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) test that can detect multiple change points in the dynamic system automatically. O-MAGIC bypasses conventional numerical integration and achieves substantial savings in computation time. By incorporating the ODE structures through manifold constraints, O-MAGIC enjoys a significant advantage in detection delay, while following principled statistical construction under the Bayesian paradigm, which further enables it to handle systems with missing data or unobserved components. O-MAGIC can also be applied to general nonlinear systems. Simulation studies on three challenging examples: SEIRD model, Lotka-Volterra model and Lorenz model are provided to illustrate the robustness and efficiency of O-MAGIC, compared with numerical integration and other popular time-series-based change point detection benchmark methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the latest research on multilingual large language models (MLLMs). MLLMs not only are able to understand and generate language across linguistic boundaries, but also represent an important advancement in artificial intelligence. We first discuss the architecture and pre-training objectives of MLLMs, highlighting the key components and methodologies that contribute to their multilingual capabilities. We then discuss the construction of multilingual pre-training and alignment datasets, underscoring the importance of data quality and diversity in enhancing MLLM performance. An important focus of this survey is on the evaluation of MLLMs. We present a detailed taxonomy and roadmap covering the assessment of MLLMs' cross-lingual knowledge, reasoning, alignment with human values, safety, interpretability and specialized applications. Specifically, we extensively discuss multilingual evaluation benchmarks and datasets, and explore the use of LLMs themselves as multilingual evaluators. To enhance MLLMs from black to white boxes, we also address the interpretability of multilingual capabilities, cross-lingual transfer and language bias within these models. Finally, we provide a comprehensive review of real-world applications of MLLMs across diverse domains, including biology, medicine, computer science, mathematics and law. We showcase how these models have driven innovation and improvements in these specialized fields while also highlighting the challenges and opportunities in deploying MLLMs within diverse language communities and application scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Probabilistic circuits (PCs) is a unifying representation for probabilistic models that support tractable inference. Numerous applications of PCs like controllable text generation depend on the ability to efficiently multiply two circuits. Existing multiplication algorithms require that the circuits respect the same structure, i.e. variable scopes decomposes according to the same vtree. In this work, we propose and study the task of restructuring structured(-decomposable) PCs, that is, transforming a structured PC such that it conforms to a target vtree. We propose a generic approach for this problem and show that it leads to novel polynomial-time algorithms for multiplying circuits respecting different vtrees, as well as a practical depth-reduction algorithm that preserves structured decomposibility. Our work opens up new avenues for tractable PC inference, suggesting the possibility of training with less restrictive PC structures while enabling efficient inference by changing their structures at inference time.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present a study of LLMs' performance in generating and rating example sentences for bilingual dictionaries across languages with varying resource levels: French (high-resource), Indonesian (mid-resource), and Tetun (low-resource), with English as the target language. We evaluate the quality of LLM-generated examples against the GDEX (Good Dictionary EXample) criteria: typicality, informativeness, and intelligibility. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can generate reasonably good dictionary examples, their performance degrades significantly for lower-resourced languages. We also observe high variability in human preferences for example quality, reflected in low inter-annotator agreement rates. To address this, we demonstrate that in-context learning can successfully align LLMs with individual annotator preferences. Additionally, we explore the use of pre-trained language models for automated rating of examples, finding that sentence perplexity serves as a good proxy for typicality and intelligibility in higher-resourced languages. Our study also contributes a novel dataset of 600 ratings for LLM-generated sentence pairs, and provides insights into the potential of LLMs in reducing the cost of lexicographic work, particularly for low-resource languages.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Parameter inference is essential when interpreting observational data using mathematical models. Standard inference methods for differential equation models typically rely on obtaining repeated numerical solutions of the differential equation(s). Recent results have explored how numerical truncation error can have major, detrimental, and sometimes hidden impacts on likelihood-based inference by introducing false local maxima into the log-likelihood function. We present a straightforward approach for inference that eliminates the need for solving the underlying differential equations, thereby completely avoiding the impact of truncation error. Open-access Jupyter notebooks, available on GitHub, allow others to implement this method for a broad class of widely-used models to interpret biological data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) based on transformer architectures have revolutionized a variety of domains, with tokenization playing a pivotal role in their pre-processing and fine-tuning stages. In multilingual models, particularly those tailored for Indic languages, effective tokenization is crucial for optimizing performance. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of tokenizers used by 12 LLMs across all 22 official languages of India, with a focus on comparing the efficiency of their tokenization processes. We employed the Normalized Sequence Length (NSL) as a key metric in our analysis. Our findings reveal that the SUTRA tokenizer outperforms all other models, including several Indic-specific models, excelling in 14 languages. Notable insights include the SUTRA tokenizer's superior handling of Indic languages, GPT-4o's advancement over its predecessor GPT-4 in processing Indian languages, and the limited performance of Project Indus in certain languages. This study underscores the critical importance of developing targeted tokenization strategies for multilingual and Indic-centric models, laying the groundwork for future improvements in tokenizer design to enhance linguistic coverage and model efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive prowess in solving a wide range of tasks with world knowledge. However, it remains unclear how well LLMs are able to perceive their factual knowledge boundaries, particularly under retrieval augmentation settings. In this study, we present the first analysis on the factual knowledge boundaries of LLMs and how retrieval augmentation affects LLMs on open-domain question answering (QA), with a bunch of important findings. Specifically, we focus on three research questions and analyze them by examining QA, priori judgement and posteriori judgement capabilities of LLMs. We show evidence that LLMs possess unwavering confidence in their knowledge and cannot handle the conflict between internal and external knowledge well. Furthermore, retrieval augmentation proves to be an effective approach in enhancing LLMs' awareness of knowledge boundaries. We further conduct thorough experiments to examine how different factors affect LLMs and propose a simple method to dynamically utilize supporting documents with our judgement strategy. Additionally, we find that the relevance between the supporting documents and the questions significantly impacts LLMs' QA and judgemental capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Background: Advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have the potential to enhance technical expertise in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), regardless of operator skill or geographic location.   Methods: We assessed the accuracy of several LLMs in answering 570 technical MRI questions derived from a standardized review book. The questions spanned nine MRI topics, including Basic Principles, Image Production, and Safety. Closed-source models (e.g., OpenAI's o1 Preview, GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, and Claude 3.5 Haiku) and open-source models (e.g., Phi 3.5 Mini, Llama 3.1, smolLM2) were tested. Models were queried using standardized prompts via the LangChain framework, and responses were graded against correct answers using an automated scoring protocol. Accuracy, defined as the proportion of correct answers, was the primary outcome.   Results: The closed-source o1 Preview model achieved the highest accuracy (94%), exceeding the random-guess baseline (26.5%). GPT-4o and o1 Mini scored 88%, and GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3.5 Haiku each scored 84%. Among open-source models, Phi 3.5 Mini performed well, achieving 78% accuracy, comparable to several closed-source models. Accuracy was highest in Basic Principles and Instrumentation categories but lower in Image Weighting and Contrast, History, and Artifacts and Corrections.   Conclusions: LLMs exhibit high accuracy in addressing technical MRI questions, suggesting their potential to standardize and enhance MRI practice. These models may improve image quality and consistency across varied clinical environments. Further studies are needed to refine LLMs for clinical use and integrate them into MRI workflows.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Health modeling of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is crucial for safe and efficient energy management and carries significant socio-economic implications. Although Machine Learning (ML)-based State of Health (SOH) estimation methods have made significant progress in accuracy, the scarcity of high-quality LIB data remains a major obstacle. Existing transfer learning methods for cross-domain LIB SOH estimation have significantly alleviated the labeling burden of target LIB data, however, they still require sufficient unlabeled target data (UTD) for effective adaptation to the target domain. Collecting this UTD is challenging due to the time-consuming nature of degradation experiments. To address this issue, we introduce a practical Test-Time Training framework, BatteryTTT, which adapts the model continually using each UTD collected amidst degradation, thereby significantly reducing data collection time. To fully utilize each UTD, BatteryTTT integrates the inherent physical laws of modern LIBs into self-supervised learning, termed Physcics-Guided Test-Time Training. Additionally, we explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) in battery sequence modeling by evaluating their performance in SOH estimation through model reprogramming and prefix prompt adaptation. The combination of BatteryTTT and LLM modeling, termed GPT4Battery, achieves state-of-the-art generalization results across current LIB benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical value and scalability of our approach by deploying it in our real-world battery management system (BMS) for 300Ah large-scale energy storage LIBs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose affine concept editing (ACE) as an approach for steering language models' behavior by intervening directly in activations. We begin with an affine decomposition of model activation vectors and show that prior methods for steering model behavior correspond to subsets of terms of this decomposition. We then provide a derivation of ACE and use it to control refusal behavior on ten different models, including Llama 3 70B. ACE combines affine subspace projection and activation addition to reliably control the model's refusal responses across prompt types. We evaluate the results using LLM-based scoring on a collection of harmful and harmless prompts. Our experiments demonstrate that ACE consistently achieves more precise control over model behavior than existing methods and generalizes to models where directional ablation via affine subspace projection alone produces incoherent outputs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Utilising quantum computing technology to enhance artificial intelligence systems is expected to improve training and inference times, increase robustness against noise and adversarial attacks, and reduce the number of parameters without compromising accuracy. However, moving beyond proof-of-concept or simulations to develop practical applications of these systems while ensuring high software quality faces significant challenges due to the limitations of quantum hardware and the underdeveloped knowledge base in software engineering for such systems. In this work, we have conducted a systematic mapping study to identify the challenges and solutions associated with the software architecture of quantum-enhanced artificial intelligence systems. Our review uncovered several architectural patterns that describe how quantum components can be integrated into inference engines, as well as middleware patterns that facilitate communication between classical and quantum components. These insights have been compiled into a catalog of architectural patterns. Each pattern realises a trade-off between efficiency, scalability, trainability, simplicity, portability and deployability, and other software quality attributes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recommender systems often rely on large embedding tables that map users and items to dense vectors of uniform size, leading to substantial memory consumption and inefficiencies. This is particularly problematic in memory-constrained environments like mobile and Web of Things (WoT) applications, where scalability and real-time performance are critical. Various research efforts have sought to address these issues. Although embedding pruning methods utilizing Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) stand out due to their low training and inference costs, consistent sparsity, and end-to-end differentiability, they face key challenges. Firstly, they typically initializes the mask matrix, which is used to prune redundant parameters, with random uniform sparse initialization. This strategy often results in suboptimal performance as it creates unstructured and inefficient connections. Secondly, they tend to favor the users/items sampled in the single batch immediately before weight exploration when they reactivate pruned parameters with large gradient magnitudes, which does not necessarily improve the overall performance. Thirdly, while they use sparse weights during forward passes, they still need to compute dense gradients during backward passes. In this paper, we propose SparseRec, an lightweight embedding method based on DST, to address these issues. Specifically, SparseRec initializes the mask matrix using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization. It accumulates gradients to identify the inactive parameters that can better improve the model performance after activation. Furthermore, it avoids dense gradients during backpropagation by sampling a subset of important vectors. Gradients are calculated only for parameters in this subset, thus maintaining sparsity during training in both forward and backward passes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Surgical instrument segmentation (SIS) is an essential task in computer-assisted surgeries, with deep learning-based research improving accuracy in complex environments. Recently, text-promptable segmentation methods have been introduced to generate masks based on text prompts describing target objects. However, these methods assume that the object described by a given text prompt exists in the scene. This results in mask generation whenever a related text prompt is provided, even if the object is absent from the image. Existing methods handle this by using prompts only for objects known to be present in the image, which introduces inaccessible information in a vision-based method setting and results in unfair comparisons. For fair comparison, we redefine existing text-promptable SIS settings to robust conditions, called Robust text-promptable SIS (R-SIS), designed to forward prompts of all classes and determine the existence of an object from a given text prompt for the fair comparison. Furthermore, we propose a novel framework, Robust Surgical Instrument Segmentation (RoSIS), which combines visual and language features for promptable segmentation in the R-SIS setting. RoSIS employs an encoder-decoder architecture with a Multi-Modal Fusion Block (MMFB) and a Selective Gate Block (SGB) to achieve balanced integration of vision and language features. Additionally, we introduce an iterative inference strategy that refines segmentation masks in two steps: an initial pass using name-based prompts, followed by a refinement step using location prompts. Experiments on various datasets and settings demonstrate that RoSIS outperforms existing vision-based and promptable methods under robust conditions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Group polarization is an important research direction in social media content analysis, attracting many researchers to explore this field. Therefore, how to effectively measure group polarization has become a critical topic. Measuring group polarization on social media presents several challenges that have not yet been addressed by existing solutions. First, social media group polarization measurement involves processing vast amounts of text, which poses a significant challenge for information extraction. Second, social media texts often contain hard-to-understand content, including sarcasm, memes, and internet slang. Additionally, group polarization research focuses on holistic analysis, while texts is typically fragmented. To address these challenges, we designed a solution based on a multi-agent system and used a graph-structured Community Sentiment Network (CSN) to represent polarization states. Furthermore, we developed a metric called Community Opposition Index (COI) based on the CSN to quantify polarization. Finally, we tested our multi-agent system through a zero-shot stance detection task and achieved outstanding results. In summary, the proposed approach has significant value in terms of usability, accuracy, and interpretability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and pre-trained vision models have accelerated the development of vision-language large models (VLLMs), enhancing the interaction between visual and linguistic modalities. Despite their notable success across various domains, VLLMs face challenges in modality alignment, which can lead to issues like hallucinations and unsafe content generation. Current alignment techniques often rely on coarse feedback and external datasets, limiting scalability and performance. In this paper, we propose FiSAO (Fine-Grained Self-Alignment Optimization), a novel self-alignment method that utilizes the model's own visual encoder as a fine-grained verifier to improve vision-language alignment without the need for additional data. By leveraging token-level feedback from the vision encoder, FiSAO significantly improves vision-language alignment, even surpassing traditional preference tuning methods that require additional data. Through both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate that FiSAO effectively addresses the misalignment problem in VLLMs, marking the first instance of token-level rewards being applied to such models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Novel View Synthesis (NVS) and 3D generation have recently achieved prominent improvements. However, these works mainly focus on confined categories or synthetic 3D assets, which are discouraged from generalizing to challenging in-the-wild scenes and fail to be employed with 2D synthesis directly. Moreover, these methods heavily depended on camera poses, limiting their real-world applications. To overcome these issues, we propose MVInpainter, re-formulating the 3D editing as a multi-view 2D inpainting task. Specifically, MVInpainter partially inpaints multi-view images with the reference guidance rather than intractably generating an entirely novel view from scratch, which largely simplifies the difficulty of in-the-wild NVS and leverages unmasked clues instead of explicit pose conditions. To ensure cross-view consistency, MVInpainter is enhanced by video priors from motion components and appearance guidance from concatenated reference key&value attention. Furthermore, MVInpainter incorporates slot attention to aggregate high-level optical flow features from unmasked regions to control the camera movement with pose-free training and inference. Sufficient scene-level experiments on both object-centric and forward-facing datasets verify the effectiveness of MVInpainter, including diverse tasks, such as multi-view object removal, synthesis, insertion, and replacement.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Audio-driven portrait animation has made significant advances with diffusion-based models, improving video quality and lipsync accuracy. However, the increasing complexity of these models has led to inefficiencies in training and inference, as well as constraints on video length and inter-frame continuity. In this paper, we propose JoyVASA, a diffusion-based method for generating facial dynamics and head motion in audio-driven facial animation. Specifically, in the first stage, we introduce a decoupled facial representation framework that separates dynamic facial expressions from static 3D facial representations. This decoupling allows the system to generate longer videos by combining any static 3D facial representation with dynamic motion sequences. Then, in the second stage, a diffusion transformer is trained to generate motion sequences directly from audio cues, independent of character identity. Finally, a generator trained in the first stage uses the 3D facial representation and the generated motion sequences as inputs to render high-quality animations. With the decoupled facial representation and the identity-independent motion generation process, JoyVASA extends beyond human portraits to animate animal faces seamlessly. The model is trained on a hybrid dataset of private Chinese and public English data, enabling multilingual support. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach. Future work will focus on improving real-time performance and refining expression control, further expanding the applications in portrait animation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Planning with partial observation is a central challenge in embodied AI. A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state. In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving tasks vastly depends on the quality of the instructions, which often require fine-tuning through extensive human effort. This highlights the need for automated instruction optimization; however, this optimization is particularly challenging when dealing with black-box LLMs, where model parameters and gradients remain inaccessible. We propose ACING, a task-specific prompt optimization approach framed as a stateless continuous-action Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem, known as the continuum bandit setting. ACING leverages an actor-critic-based method to optimize prompts, learning from non-differentiable reward signals. We validate ACING by optimizing prompts for ChatGPT on 30 instruction-based tasks. ACING consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving a median score improvement of 10 percentage points. Furthermore, ACING not only recovers but also surpasses human-crafted expert instructions, achieving up to a 39 percentage point improvement against human benchmarks.

We excluded non-cancer conditions and examined four specific diseases. We assessed four LLMs, BioBERT, XLNet, and BERT, as well as a novel base model (Last-BERT). BioBERT, which was pre-trained on medical data, demonstrated superior performance in medical text classification (97% accuracy). Surprisingly, XLNet followed closely (96% accuracy), demonstrating its generalizability across domains even though it was not pre-trained on medical data. LastBERT, a custom model based on the lighter version of BERT, also proved competitive with 87.10% accuracy (just under BERT's 89.33%). Our findings confirm the importance of specialized models such as BioBERT and also support impressions around more general solutions like XLNet and well-tuned transformer architectures with fewer parameters (in this case, LastBERT) in medical domain tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Kahneman & Tversky's $\textit{prospect theory}$ tells us that humans perceive random variables in a biased but well-defined manner (1992); for example, humans are famously loss-averse. We show that objectives for aligning LLMs with human feedback implicitly incorporate many of these biases -- the success of these objectives (e.g., DPO) over cross-entropy minimization can partly be ascribed to them belonging to a family of loss functions that we call $\textit{human-aware losses}$ (HALOs). However, the utility functions these methods attribute to humans still differ from those in the prospect theory literature. Using a Kahneman-Tversky model of human utility, we propose a HALO that directly maximizes the utility of generations instead of maximizing the log-likelihood of preferences, as current methods do. We call this approach KTO, and it matches or exceeds the performance of preference-based methods at scales from 1B to 30B, despite only learning from a binary signal of whether an output is desirable. More broadly, our work suggests that there is no one HALO that is universally superior; the best loss depends on the inductive biases most appropriate for a given setting, an oft-overlooked consideration.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where hidden triggers can maliciously manipulate model behavior. While several backdoor attack methods have been proposed, the mechanisms by which backdoor functions operate in LLMs remain underexplored. In this paper, we move beyond attacking LLMs and investigate backdoor functionality through the novel lens of natural language explanations. Specifically, we leverage LLMs' generative capabilities to produce human-understandable explanations for their decisions, allowing us to compare explanations for clean and poisoned samples. We explore various backdoor attacks and embed the backdoor into LLaMA models for multiple tasks. Our experiments show that backdoored models produce higher-quality explanations for clean data compared to poisoned data, while generating significantly more consistent explanations for poisoned data than for clean data. We further analyze the explanation generation process, revealing that at the token level, the explanation token of poisoned samples only appears in the final few transformer layers of the LLM. At the sentence level, attention dynamics indicate that poisoned inputs shift attention from the input context when generating the explanation. These findings deepen our understanding of backdoor attack mechanisms in LLMs and offer a framework for detecting such vulnerabilities through explainability techniques, contributing to the development of more secure LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The advancements in large language models (LLMs) have propelled the improvement of video understanding tasks by incorporating LLMs with visual models. However, most existing LLM-based models (e.g., VideoLLaMA, VideoChat) are constrained to processing short-duration videos. Recent attempts to understand long-term videos by extracting and compressing visual features into a fixed memory size. Nevertheless, those methods leverage only visual modality to merge video tokens and overlook the correlation between visual and textual queries, leading to difficulties in effectively handling complex question-answering tasks. To address the challenges of long videos and complex prompts, we propose AdaCM$^2$, which, for the first time, introduces an adaptive cross-modality memory reduction approach to video-text alignment in an auto-regressive manner on video streams. Our extensive experiments on various video understanding tasks, such as video captioning, video question answering, and video classification, demonstrate that AdaCM$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets while significantly reducing memory usage. Notably, it achieves a 4.5% improvement across multiple tasks in the LVU dataset with a GPU memory consumption reduction of up to 65%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Leveraging sparsity is crucial for optimizing large language model inference. however, modern LLMs employing SiLU as their activation function exhibit minimal activation sparsity. Recent research has proposed replacing SiLU with ReLU to induce significant activation sparsity and showed no downstream task accuracy degradation through fine tuning. However, taking full advantage of it required training a predictor to estimate this sparsity. In this paper, we introduce SparseInfer, a simple, light weight, and training free predictor for activation sparsity of ReLU field LLMs, in which activation sparsity is predicted by comparing only the sign bits of inputs and weights. To compensate for possible prediction inaccuracy, an adaptive tuning of the predictor's conservativeness is enabled, which can also serve as a control knob for optimizing LLM inference. The proposed method achieves approximately faster inference speed over the state of the art, with negligible accuracy loss of within 1%p.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Programming-by-Examples (PBE) aims to generate an algorithm from input-output examples. Such systems are practically and theoretically important: from an end-user perspective, they are deployed to millions of people, and from an AI perspective, PBE corresponds to a very general form of few-shot inductive inference. Given the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code-generation tasks, we investigate here the extent to which LLMs can be said to have "solved" PBE. We experiment on classic domains such as lists and strings, and an uncommon graphics programming domain not well represented in typical pretraining data. We find that pretrained models are not effective at PBE, but that they can be fine-tuned for much higher performance, provided the test problems are in-distribution. We analyze empirically what causes these models to succeed and fail, and take steps toward understanding how to achieve better out-of-distribution generalization. Collectively these results suggest that LLMs make strong progress toward solving the typical suite of PBE tasks, potentially increasing the flexibility and applicability of PBE systems, while also identifying ways in which LLMs still fall short.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Medical Decision-Making (MDM) is a multi-faceted process that requires clinicians to assess complex multi-modal patient data patient, often collaboratively. Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to streamline this process by synthesizing vast medical knowledge and multi-modal health data. However, single-agent are often ill-suited for nuanced medical contexts requiring adaptable, collaborative problem-solving. Our MDAgents addresses this need by dynamically assigning collaboration structures to LLMs based on task complexity, mimicking real-world clinical collaboration and decision-making. This framework improves diagnostic accuracy and supports adaptive responses in complex, real-world medical scenarios, making it a valuable tool for clinicians in various healthcare settings, and at the same time, being more efficient in terms of computing cost than static multi-agent decision making methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We have come up with a research that hopes to provide a bridge between the users of American Sign Language and the users of spoken language and Indian Sign Language (ISL). The research enabled us to create a novel framework that we have developed for Learner Systems. Leveraging art of Large models to create key features including: - Real-time translation between these two sign languages in an efficient manner. Making LLM's capability available for seamless translations to ISL. Here is the full study showing its implementation in this paper. The core of the system is a sophisticated pipeline that begins with reclassification and recognition of ASL gestures based on a strong Random Forest Classifier. By recognizing the ASL, it is translated into text which can be more easily processed. Highly evolved natural language NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques come in handy as they play a role in our LLM integration where you then use LLMs to be able to convert the ASL text to ISL which provides you with the intent of sentence or phrase. The final step is to synthesize the translated text back into ISL gestures, creating an end-to-end translation experience using RIFE-Net. This framework is tasked with key challenges such as automatically dealing with gesture variability and overcoming the linguistic differences between ASL and ISL. By automating the translation process, we hope to vastly improve accessibility for sign language users. No longer will the communication gap between ASL and ISL create barriers; this totally cool innovation aims to bring our communities closer together. And we believe, with full confidence in our framework, that we're able to apply the same principles across a wide variety of sign language dialects.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> When learning an input-output mapping from very few examples, is it better to first infer a latent function that explains the examples, or is it better to directly predict new test outputs, e.g. using a neural network? We study this question on ARC, a highly diverse dataset of abstract reasoning tasks. We train neural models for induction (inferring latent functions) and transduction (directly predicting the test output for a given test input). Our models are trained on synthetic data generated by prompting LLMs to produce Python code specifying a function to be inferred, plus a stochastic subroutine for generating inputs to that function. We find inductive and transductive models solve very different problems, despite training on the same problems, and despite sharing the same neural architecture.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The development of artificial intelligence systems capable of understanding and reasoning about complex real-world scenarios is a significant challenge. In this work we present a novel approach to enhance and exploit LLM reactive capability to address complex problems and interpret deeply contextual real-world meaning. We introduce a method and a tool for creating a multimodal, knowledge-augmented formal representation of meaning that combines the strengths of large language models with structured semantic representations. Our method begins with an image input, utilizing state-of-the-art large language models to generate a natural language description. This description is then transformed into an Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graph, which is formalized and enriched with logical design patterns, and layered semantics derived from linguistic and factual knowledge bases. The resulting graph is then fed back into the LLM to be extended with implicit knowledge activated by complex heuristic learning, including semantic implicatures, moral values, embodied cognition, and metaphorical representations. By bridging the gap between unstructured language models and formal semantic structures, our method opens new avenues for tackling intricate problems in natural language understanding and reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Backgrounds: Information extraction (IE) is critical in clinical natural language processing (NLP). While large language models (LLMs) excel on generative tasks, their performance on extractive tasks remains debated. Methods: We investigated Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) using 1,588 clinical notes from four sources (UT Physicians, MTSamples, MIMIC-III, and i2b2). We developed an annotated corpus covering 4 clinical entities and 16 modifiers, and compared instruction-tuned LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 against BiomedBERT in terms of performance, generalizability, computational resources, and throughput to BiomedBERT. Results: LLaMA models outperformed BiomedBERT across datasets. With sufficient training data, LLaMA showed modest improvements (1% on NER, 1.5-3.7% on RE); improvements were larger with limited training data. On unseen i2b2 data, LLaMA-3-70B outperformed BiomedBERT by 7% (F1) on NER and 4% on RE. However, LLaMA models required more computing resources and ran up to 28 times slower. We implemented "Kiwi," a clinical IE package featuring both models, available at https://kiwi.clinicalnlp.org/. Conclusion: This study is among the first to develop and evaluate a comprehensive clinical IE system using open-source LLMs. Results indicate that LLaMA models outperform BiomedBERT for clinical NER and RE but with higher computational costs and lower throughputs. These findings highlight that choosing between LLMs and traditional deep learning methods for clinical IE applications should remain task-specific, taking into account both performance metrics and practical considerations such as available computing resources and the intended use case scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has led to increasingly sophisticated deep learning models, which frequently operate as opaque 'black boxes' with limited transparency in their decision-making processes. This lack of interpretability presents considerable challenges, especially in high-stakes applications where understanding the rationale behind a model's outputs is as essential as the outputs themselves. This study addresses the pressing need for interpretability in AI systems, emphasizing its role in fostering trust, ensuring accountability, and promoting responsible deployment in mission-critical fields. To address the interpretability challenge in deep learning, we introduce DLBacktrace, an innovative technique developed by the AryaXAI team to illuminate model decisions across a wide array of domains, including simple Multi Layer Perceptron (MLPs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Large Language Models (LLMs), Computer Vision Models, and more.   We provide a comprehensive overview of the DLBacktrace algorithm and present benchmarking results, comparing its performance against established interpretability methods, such as SHAP, LIME, GradCAM, Integrated Gradients, SmoothGrad, and Attention Rollout, using diverse task-based metrics. The proposed DLBacktrace technique is compatible with various model architectures built in PyTorch and TensorFlow, supporting models like Llama 3.2, other NLP architectures such as BERT and LSTMs, computer vision models like ResNet and U-Net, as well as custom deep neural network (DNN) models for tabular data. This flexibility underscores DLBacktrace's adaptability and effectiveness in enhancing model transparency across a broad spectrum of applications. The library is open-sourced and available at https://github.com/AryaXAI/DLBacktrace .

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The field of AI-assisted music creation has made significant strides, yet existing systems often struggle to meet the demands of iterative and nuanced music production. These challenges include providing sufficient control over the generated content and allowing for flexible, precise edits. This thesis tackles these issues by introducing a series of advancements that progressively build upon each other, enhancing the controllability and editability of text-to-music generation models.   First, we introduce Loop Copilot, a system that tries to address the need for iterative refinement in music creation. Loop Copilot leverages a large language model (LLM) to coordinate multiple specialised AI models, enabling users to generate and refine music interactively through a conversational interface. Central to this system is the Global Attribute Table, which records and maintains key musical attributes throughout the iterative process, ensuring that modifications at any stage preserve the overall coherence of the music. While Loop Copilot excels in orchestrating the music creation process, it does not directly address the need for detailed edits to the generated content.   To overcome this limitation, MusicMagus is presented as a further solution for editing AI-generated music. MusicMagus introduces a zero-shot text-to-music editing approach that allows for the modification of specific musical attributes, such as genre, mood, and instrumentation, without the need for retraining. By manipulating the latent space within pre-trained diffusion models, MusicMagus ensures that these edits are stylistically coherent and that non-targeted attributes remain unchanged. This system is particularly effective in maintaining the structural integrity of the music during edits, but it encounters challenges with more complex and real-world audio scenarios.   ...

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Stereotypes are generalised assumptions about societal groups, and even state-of-the-art LLMs using in-context learning struggle to identify them accurately. Due to the subjective nature of stereotypes, where what constitutes a stereotype can vary widely depending on cultural, social, and individual perspectives, robust explainability is crucial. Explainable models ensure that these nuanced judgments can be understood and validated by human users, promoting trust and accountability. We address these challenges by introducing HEARTS (Holistic Framework for Explainable, Sustainable, and Robust Text Stereotype Detection), a framework that enhances model performance, minimises carbon footprint, and provides transparent, interpretable explanations. We establish the Expanded Multi-Grain Stereotype Dataset (EMGSD), comprising 57,201 labelled texts across six groups, including under-represented demographics like LGBTQ+ and regional stereotypes. Ablation studies confirm that BERT models fine-tuned on EMGSD outperform those trained on individual components. We then analyse a fine-tuned, carbon-efficient ALBERT-V2 model using SHAP to generate token-level importance values, ensuring alignment with human understanding, and calculate explainability confidence scores by comparing SHAP and LIME outputs...

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The capabilities and limitations of Large Language Models have been sketched out in great detail in recent years, providing an intriguing yet conflicting picture. On the one hand, LLMs demonstrate a general ability to solve problems. On the other hand, they show surprising reasoning gaps when compared to humans, casting doubt on the robustness of their generalisation strategies. The sheer volume of data used in the design of LLMs has precluded us from applying the method traditionally used to measure generalisation: train-test set separation. To overcome this, we study what kind of generalisation strategies LLMs employ when performing reasoning tasks by investigating the pretraining data they rely on. For two models of different sizes (7B and 35B) and 2.5B of their pretraining tokens, we identify what documents influence the model outputs for three simple mathematical reasoning tasks and contrast this to the data that are influential for answering factual questions. We find that, while the models rely on mostly distinct sets of data for each factual question, a document often has a similar influence across different reasoning questions within the same task, indicating the presence of procedural knowledge. We further find that the answers to factual questions often show up in the most influential data. However, for reasoning questions the answers usually do not show up as highly influential, nor do the answers to the intermediate reasoning steps. When we characterise the top ranked documents for the reasoning questions qualitatively, we confirm that the influential documents often contain procedural knowledge, like demonstrating how to obtain a solution using formulae or code. Our findings indicate that the approach to reasoning the models use is unlike retrieval, and more like a generalisable strategy that synthesises procedural knowledge from documents doing a similar form of reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Combinatorial optimization (CO) is essential for improving efficiency and performance in engineering applications. As complexity increases with larger problem sizes and more intricate dependencies, identifying the optimal solution become challenging. When it comes to real-world engineering problems, algorithms based on pure mathematical reasoning are limited and incapable to capture the contextual nuances necessary for optimization. This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving engineering CO problems by leveraging their reasoning power and contextual knowledge. We propose a novel LLM-based framework that integrates network topology and domain knowledge to optimize the sequencing of Design Structure Matrix (DSM)-a common CO problem. Our experiments on various DSM cases demonstrate that the proposed method achieves faster convergence and higher solution quality than benchmark methods. Moreover, results show that incorporating contextual domain knowledge significantly improves performance despite the choice of LLMs. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs in tackling complex real-world CO problems by combining semantic and mathematical reasoning. This approach paves the way for a new paradigm in in real-world combinatorial optimization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent debates raised concerns that language models may favor certain viewpoints. But what if the solution is not to aim for a 'view from nowhere' but rather to leverage different viewpoints? We introduce Plurals, a system and Python library for pluralistic AI deliberation. Plurals consists of Agents (LLMs, optionally with personas) which deliberate within customizable Structures, with Moderators overseeing deliberation. Plurals is a generator of simulated social ensembles. Plurals integrates with government datasets to create nationally representative personas, includes deliberation templates inspired by deliberative democracy, and allows users to customize both information-sharing structures and deliberation behavior within Structures. Six case studies demonstrate fidelity to theoretical constructs and efficacy. Three randomized experiments show simulated focus groups produced output resonant with an online sample of the relevant audiences (chosen over zero-shot generation in 75% of trials). Plurals is both a paradigm and a concrete system for pluralistic AI. The Plurals library is available at https://github.com/josh-ashkinaze/plurals and will be continually updated.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The fast development of location-based social networks (LBSNs) has led to significant changes in society, resulting in popular studies of using LBSN data for socioeconomic prediction, e.g., regional population and commercial activity estimation. Existing studies design various graphs to model heterogeneous LBSN data, and further apply graph representation learning methods for socioeconomic prediction. However, these approaches heavily rely on heuristic ideas and expertise to extract task-relevant knowledge from diverse data, which may not be optimal for specific tasks. Additionally, they tend to overlook the inherent relationships between different indicators, limiting the prediction accuracy. Motivated by the remarkable abilities of large language models (LLMs) in commonsense reasoning, embedding, and multi-agent collaboration, in this work, we synergize LLM agents and knowledge graph for socioeconomic prediction. We first construct a location-based knowledge graph (LBKG) to integrate multi-sourced LBSN data. Then we leverage the reasoning power of LLM agent to identify relevant meta-paths in the LBKG for each type of socioeconomic prediction task, and design a semantic-guided attention module for knowledge fusion with meta-paths. Moreover, we introduce a cross-task communication mechanism to further enhance performance by enabling knowledge sharing across tasks at both LLM agent and KG levels. On the one hand, the LLM agents for different tasks collaborate to generate more diverse and comprehensive meta-paths. On the other hand, the embeddings from different tasks are adaptively merged for better socioeconomic prediction. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the synergistic design between LLM and KG, providing insights for information sharing across socioeconomic prediction tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable capabilities in various software engineering tasks, spurring the rapid growth of the Large Language Models for Software Engineering (LLM4SE) area. However, limited attention has been paid to developing efficient LLM4SE techniques that demand minimal computational cost, time, and memory resources, as well as green LLM4SE solutions that reduce energy consumption, water usage, and carbon emissions.   This paper aims to redirect the focus of the research community towards the efficiency and greenness of LLM4SE, while also sharing potential research directions to achieve this goal. It commences with a brief overview of the significance of LLM4SE and highlights the need for efficient and green LLM4SE solutions. Subsequently, the paper presents a vision for a future where efficient and green LLM4SE revolutionizes the LLM-based software engineering tool landscape, benefiting various stakeholders, including industry, individual practitioners, and society. The paper then delineates a roadmap for future research, outlining specific research paths and potential solutions for the research community to pursue. While not intended to be a definitive guide, the paper aims to inspire further progress, with the ultimate goal of establishing efficient and green LLM4SE as a central element in the future of software engineering.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are capable of solving a wide range of tasks, yet they have struggled with reasoning. To address this, we propose $\textbf{Additional Logic Training (ALT)}$, which aims to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities by program-generated logical reasoning samples. We first establish principles for designing high-quality samples by integrating symbolic logic theory and previous empirical insights. Then, based on these principles, we construct a synthetic corpus named $\textbf{Formal Logic Deduction Diverse}$ ($\textbf{FLD}$$^{\times 2}$), comprising numerous samples of multi-step deduction with unknown facts, diverse reasoning rules, diverse linguistic expressions, and challenging distractors. Finally, we empirically show that ALT on FLD$^{\times2}$ substantially enhances the reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, including LLaMA-3.1-70B. Improvements include gains of up to 30 points on logical reasoning benchmarks, up to 10 points on math and coding benchmarks, and 5 points on the benchmark suite BBH.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The 6th International Symposium on Space Sailing (ISSS 2023) took place on June 5-9, 2023 at the New York City College of Technology, the City University of New York. Since its inauguration in Herrsching (Germany, 2007), the ISSS has been held in New York (USA, 2010), Glasgow (UK, 2013), Kyoto (Japan, 2017) and Aachen (Germany, 2019). During the five-day symposium, participants from 14 countries gathered to discuss recent advances in space sailing, investigating new concepts and designs, describing innovative hardware and enabling technologies, strategies for dynamics and control, and providing updates on testing results for systems under development and future mission applications. As part of the 18 sessions, almost 50 oral presentations were held and, subsequently, 17 papers were submitted for review and publication. This paper aims to give an overview of all the cutting-edge technologies, detailed analysis and promising results shared with the scientific community as part of the event. Following the noteworthy deployment of the world's first solar sail IKAROS in 2010, missions like NanoSail-D2 (2011) and LightSail-2 (2019) have showcased the potential of solar sailing technology through successful demonstrations. Besides highlighting advancements in present and future programs, the symposium was an opportunity to reflect on objectives, design and test results from research centers and universities, as well as illustrate applications for interstellar travel, evaluate degrading performance and suggest alternative solutions for known limitations. The following Symposium is scheduled for early summer 2025 and will be hosted by TU Delft.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants have led to remarkable progress across various domains, demonstrating impressive capabilities and unprecedented potential. In the era of ubiquitous connectivity, leveraging communication networks to distribute intelligence is a transformative concept, envisioning AI-powered services accessible at the network edge. However, pushing large models from the cloud to resource-constrained environments faces critical challenges. Model inference on low-end devices leads to excessive latency and performance bottlenecks, while raw data transmission over limited bandwidth networks causes high communication overhead. This article presents AI Flow, a framework that streamlines the inference process by jointly leveraging the heterogeneous resources available across devices, edge nodes, and cloud servers, making intelligence flow across networks. To facilitate cooperation among multiple computational nodes, the proposed framework explores a paradigm shift in the design of communication network systems from transmitting information flow to intelligence flow, where the goal of communications is task-oriented and folded into the inference process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through an image captioning use case, showcasing the ability to reduce response latency while maintaining high-quality captions. This article serves as a position paper for identifying the motivation, challenges, and principles of AI Flow.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has marked a significant breakthrough in natural language processing (NLP), fueling a paradigm shift in information acquisition. Nevertheless, LLMs are prone to hallucination, generating plausible yet nonfactual content. This phenomenon raises significant concerns over the reliability of LLMs in real-world information retrieval (IR) systems and has attracted intensive research to detect and mitigate such hallucinations. Given the open-ended general-purpose attributes inherent to LLMs, LLM hallucinations present distinct challenges that diverge from prior task-specific models. This divergence highlights the urgency for a nuanced understanding and comprehensive overview of recent advances in LLM hallucinations. In this survey, we begin with an innovative taxonomy of hallucination in the era of LLM and then delve into the factors contributing to hallucinations. Subsequently, we present a thorough overview of hallucination detection methods and benchmarks. Our discussion then transfers to representative methodologies for mitigating LLM hallucinations. Additionally, we delve into the current limitations faced by retrieval-augmented LLMs in combating hallucinations, offering insights for developing more robust IR systems. Finally, we highlight the promising research directions on LLM hallucinations, including hallucination in large vision-language models and understanding of knowledge boundaries in LLM hallucinations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Remarkable advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled high-quality text summarization. However, this capability is currently accessible only through LLMs of substantial size or proprietary LLMs with usage fees. In response, smaller-scale LLMs (sLLMs) of easy accessibility and low costs have been extensively studied, yet they often suffer from missing key information and entities, i.e., low relevance, in particular, when input documents are long. We hence propose a key-element-informed instruction tuning for summarization, so-called KEITSum, which identifies key elements in documents and instructs sLLM to generate summaries capturing these key elements. Experimental results on dialogue and news datasets demonstrate that sLLM with KEITSum indeed provides high-quality summarization with higher relevance and less hallucinations, competitive to proprietary LLM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in abstractive summarization tasks. However, controllable summarization with LLMs remains underexplored, limiting their ability to generate summaries that align with specific user preferences. In this paper, we first investigate the capability of LLMs to control diverse attributes, revealing that they encounter greater challenges with numerical attributes, such as length and extractiveness, compared to linguistic attributes. To address this challenge, we propose a guide-to-explain framework (GTE) for controllable summarization. Our GTE framework enables the model to identify misaligned attributes in the initial draft and guides it in explaining errors in the previous output. Based on this reflection, the model generates a well-adjusted summary. As a result, by allowing the model to reflect on its misalignment, we generate summaries that satisfy the desired attributes in surprisingly fewer iterations than other iterative methods solely using LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern AI- and Data-intensive software systems rely heavily on data science and machine learning libraries that provide essential algorithmic implementations and computational frameworks. These libraries expose complex APIs whose correct usage has to follow constraints among multiple interdependent parameters. Developers using these APIs are expected to learn about the constraints through the provided documentations and any discrepancy may lead to unexpected behaviors. However, maintaining correct and consistent multi-parameter constraints in API documentations remains a significant challenge for API compatibility and reliability. To address this challenge, we propose MPDetector, for detecting inconsistencies between code and documentation, specifically focusing on multi-parameter constraints. MPDetector identifies these constraints at the code level by exploring execution paths through symbolic execution and further extracts corresponding constraints from documentation using large language models (LLMs). We propose a customized fuzzy constraint logic to reconcile the unpredictability of LLM outputs and detects logical inconsistencies between the code and documentation constraints. We collected and constructed two datasets from four popular data science libraries and evaluated MPDetector on them. The results demonstrate that MPDetector can effectively detect inconsistency issues with the precision of 92.8%. We further reported 14 detected inconsistency issues to the library developers, who have confirmed 11 issues at the time of writing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Capturing fresh information in near real-time and using it to augment existing large language models (LLMs) is essential to generate up-to-date, grounded, and reliable output. This problem becomes particularly challenging when LLMs are used for informational tasks in rapidly evolving fields, such as Web search related to recent or unfolding events involving entities, where generating temporally relevant responses requires access to up-to-the-hour news sources. However, the information modeled by the parametric memory of LLMs is often outdated, and Web results from prototypical retrieval systems may fail to capture the latest relevant information and struggle to handle conflicting reports in evolving news. To address this challenge, we present the NEON framework, designed to extract emerging entity interactions -- such as events or activities -- as described in news articles. NEON constructs an entity-centric timestamped knowledge graph that captures such interactions, thereby facilitating enhanced QA capabilities related to news events. Our framework innovates by integrating open Information Extraction (openIE) style tuples into LLMs to enable in-context retrieval-augmented generation. This integration demonstrates substantial improvements in QA performance when tackling temporal, entity-centric search queries. Through NEON, LLMs can deliver more accurate, reliable, and up-to-date responses.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We have recently witnessed that ``Intelligence" and `` Compression" are the two sides of the same coin, where the language large model (LLM) with unprecedented intelligence is a general-purpose lossless compressor for various data modalities. This attribute particularly appeals to the lossless image compression community, given the increasing need to compress high-resolution images in the current streaming media era. Consequently, a spontaneous envision emerges: Can the compression performance of the LLM elevate lossless image compression to new heights? However, our findings indicate that the naive application of LLM-based lossless image compressors suffers from a considerable performance gap compared with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) codecs on common benchmark datasets. In light of this, we are dedicated to fulfilling the unprecedented intelligence (compression) capacity of the LLM for lossless image compression tasks, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical and practical compression performance. Specifically, we propose P$^{2}$-LLM, a next-pixel prediction-based LLM, which integrates various elaborated insights and methodologies, \textit{e.g.,} pixel-level priors, the in-context ability of LLM, and a pixel-level semantic preservation strategy, to enhance the understanding capacity of pixel sequences for better next-pixel predictions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that P$^{2}$-LLM can beat SOTA classical and learned codecs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the development and proliferation of large, complex, black-box models for solving many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, there is also an increasing necessity of methods to stress-test these models and provide some degree of interpretability or explainability. While counterfactual examples are useful in this regard, automated generation of counterfactuals is a data and resource intensive process. such methods depend on models such as pre-trained language models that are then fine-tuned on auxiliary, often task-specific datasets, that may be infeasible to build in practice, especially for new tasks and data domains. Therefore, in this work we explore the possibility of leveraging large language models (LLMs) for zero-shot counterfactual generation in order to stress-test NLP models. We propose a structured pipeline to facilitate this generation, and we hypothesize that the instruction-following and textual understanding capabilities of recent LLMs can be effectively leveraged for generating high quality counterfactuals in a zero-shot manner, without requiring any training or fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on a variety of propreitary and open-source LLMs, along with various downstream tasks in NLP, we explore the efficacy of LLMs as zero-shot counterfactual generators in evaluating and explaining black-box NLP models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Wall-modeled large-eddy simulation (WMLES) is widely recognized as a useful method for simulation of turbulent flows at high Reynolds numbers. Nevertheless, a continual issue in different wall models is the shift of the mean velocity profile from the wall-model/RANS (Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes) region to the LES region. This phenomenon, referred to as logarithmic layer mismatch (LLM), occurs in both wall shear stress models and hybrid RANS/LES models. Many efforts have been made to explain and resolve this mismatch, including decreasing the high correlation between the wall shear stress and the velocity at the matching layer, modifying the subgrid-scale (SGS) eddy viscosity, and adding a stochastic forcing. It is widely believed that the inclusion of the resolved Reynolds shear stress (or the convection term) is essential to elliminate the LLM, as it prevents the overseimation of the modeled Reynolds shear stress and promotes the generation of the small-scale flow structures in the near-wall region. In this work, by comparing three different SGS eddy viscosity models, we demonstrate that ensuring the total shear stress conservation (TSSC) conservation is key to resolving the LLM. Under the TSSC framework, the effect of the convection term on LLM can be quantitatively assessed. Furthermore, a modified SGS eddy viscosity modfication model that adheres to the TSSC constraint is tested at different Reynolds numbers ($Re_\tau=1000, 2000, 4200$). Our results demonstrate the robust performance of the present model in predicting skin friction and low-order turbulence statistics, even under a relatively low grid resolution ($\Delta x^+, \Delta z^+ \lesssim 500$, $2\leq \Delta_x/\Delta_{y,mat} \leq 4$, where $\Delta_{y,mat}$ is the wall-normal grid spacing in the wall-model region).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Ambiguity in natural language poses significant challenges to Large Language Models (LLMs) used for open-domain question answering. LLMs often struggle with the inherent uncertainties of human communication, leading to misinterpretations, miscommunications, hallucinations, and biased responses. This significantly weakens their ability to be used for tasks like fact-checking, question answering, feature extraction, and sentiment analysis. Using open-domain question answering as a test case, we compare off-the-shelf and few-shot LLM performance, focusing on measuring the impact of explicit disambiguation strategies. We demonstrate how simple, training-free, token-level disambiguation methods may be effectively used to improve LLM performance for ambiguous question answering tasks. We empirically show our findings and discuss best practices and broader impacts regarding ambiguity in LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> It is undeniable that we are witnessing an unprecedented digital revolution. However, recent years have been characterized by the explosion of cyberattacks, making cybercrime one of the most profitable businesses on the planet. That is why training in cybersecurity is increasingly essential to protect the assets of cyberspace. One of the most vital tools to train cybersecurity competencies is the Cyber Range, a virtualized environment that simulates realistic networks. The paper at hand introduces SCORPION, a fully functional and virtualized Cyber Range, which manages the authoring and automated deployment of scenarios. In addition, SCORPION includes several elements to improve student motivation, such as a gamification system with medals, points, or rankings, among other elements. Such a gamification system includes an adaptive learning module that is able to adapt the cyberexercise based on the users' performance. Moreover, SCORPION leverages learning analytics that collects and processes telemetric and biometric user data, including heart rate through a smartwatch, which is available through a dashboard for instructors. Finally, we developed a case study where SCORPION obtained 82.10% in usability and 4.57 out of 5 in usefulness from the viewpoint of a student and an instructor. The positive evaluation results are promising, indicating that SCORPION can become an effective, motivating, and advanced cybersecurity training tool to help fill current gaps in this context.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using large language models (LLMs) often generate inaccurate responses due to the retrieval of irrelevant or loosely related information. Existing methods, which operate at the document level, fail to effectively filter out such content. We propose LLM-driven chunk filtering, ChunkRAG, a framework that enhances RAG systems by evaluating and filtering retrieved information at the chunk level. Our approach employs semantic chunking to divide documents into coherent sections and utilizes LLM-based relevance scoring to assess each chunk's alignment with the user's query. By filtering out less pertinent chunks before the generation phase, we significantly reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing RAG models, achieving higher accuracy on tasks requiring precise information retrieval. This advancement enhances the reliability of RAG systems, making them particularly beneficial for applications like fact-checking and multi-hop reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Significant efforts has been made to expand the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) beyond basic language tasks. While the generalizability and versatility of LLMs have enabled widespread adoption, evolving demands in application development often exceed their native capabilities. Meeting these demands may involve a diverse set of methods, such as enhancing creativity through either inference temperature adjustments or creativity-provoking prompts. Selecting the right approach is critical, as different methods lead to trade-offs in engineering complexity, scalability, and operational costs. This paper introduces a layered architecture that organizes LLM software system development into distinct layers, each characterized by specific attributes. By aligning capabilities with these layers, the framework encourages the systematic implementation of capabilities in effective and efficient ways that ultimately supports desired functionalities and qualities. Through practical case studies, we illustrate the utility of the framework. This work offers developers actionable insights for selecting suitable technologies in LLM-based software system development, promoting robustness and scalability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The challenge in LLM-based video understanding lies in preserving visual and semantic information in long videos while maintaining a memory-affordable token count. However, redundancy and correspondence in videos have hindered the performance potential of existing methods. Through statistical learning on current datasets, we observe that redundancy occurs in both repeated and answer-irrelevant frames, and the corresponding frames vary with different questions. This suggests the possibility of adopting dynamic encoding to balance detailed video information preservation with token budget reduction. To this end, we propose a dynamic cooperative network, DynFocus, for memory-efficient video encoding in this paper. Specifically, i) a Dynamic Event Prototype Estimation (DPE) module to dynamically select meaningful frames for question answering; (ii) a Compact Cooperative Encoding (CCE) module that encodes meaningful frames with detailed visual appearance and the remaining frames with sketchy perception separately. We evaluate our method on five publicly available benchmarks, and experimental results consistently demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> AI models are essential in science and engineering, but recent advances are pushing the limits of traditional digital hardware. To address these limitations, physical neural networks (PNNs), which use physical substrates for computation, have gained increasing attention. However, developing effective training methods for PNNs remains a significant challenge. Current approaches, regardless of offline and online training, suffer from significant accuracy loss. Offline training is hindered by imprecise modeling, while online training yields device-specific models that can't be transferred to other devices due to manufacturing variances. Both methods face challenges from perturbations after deployment, such as thermal drift or alignment errors, which make trained models invalid and require retraining. Here, we address the challenges with both offline and online training through a novel technique called Sharpness-Aware Training (SAT), where we innovatively leverage the geometry of the loss landscape to tackle the problems in training physical systems. SAT enables accurate training using efficient backpropagation algorithms, even with imprecise models. PNNs trained by SAT offline even outperform those trained online, despite modeling and fabrication errors. SAT also overcomes online training limitations by enabling reliable transfer of models between devices. Finally, SAT is highly resilient to perturbations after deployment, allowing PNNs to continuously operate accurately under perturbations without retraining. We demonstrate SAT across three types of PNNs, showing it is universally applicable, regardless of whether the models are explicitly known. This work offers a transformative, efficient approach to training PNNs, addressing critical challenges in analog computing and enabling real-world deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To enhance the reasoning capabilities of off-the-shelf Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce a simple, yet general and effective prompting method, Re2, i.e., \textbf{Re}-\textbf{Re}ading the question as input. Unlike most thought-eliciting prompting methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which aim to elicit the reasoning process in the output, Re2 shifts the focus to the input by processing questions twice, thereby enhancing the understanding process. Consequently, Re2 demonstrates strong generality and compatibility with most thought-eliciting prompting methods, including CoT. Crucially, Re2 facilitates a "bidirectional" encoding in unidirectional decoder-only LLMs because the first pass could provide global information for the second pass. We begin with a preliminary empirical study as the foundation of Re2, illustrating its potential to enable "bidirectional" attention mechanisms. We then evaluate Re2 on extensive reasoning benchmarks across 14 datasets, spanning 112 experiments, to validate its effectiveness and generality. Our findings indicate that, with the exception of a few scenarios on vanilla ChatGPT, Re2 consistently enhances the reasoning performance of LLMs through a simple re-reading strategy. Further analyses reveal Re2's adaptability, showing how it can be effectively integrated with different LLMs, thought-eliciting prompting, and ensemble strategies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling the retrieval of documents into the LLM context to provide more accurate and relevant responses. Existing RAG solutions do not focus on queries that may require fetching multiple documents with substantially different contents. Such queries occur frequently, but are challenging because the embeddings of these documents may be distant in the embedding space, making it hard to retrieve them all. This paper introduces Multi-Head RAG (MRAG), a novel scheme designed to address this gap with a simple yet powerful idea: leveraging activations of Transformer's multi-head attention layer, instead of the decoder layer, as keys for fetching multi-aspect documents. The driving motivation is that different attention heads can learn to capture different data aspects. Harnessing the corresponding activations results in embeddings that represent various facets of data items and queries, improving the retrieval accuracy for complex queries. We provide an evaluation methodology and metrics, multi-aspect datasets that we release online, and real-world use cases to demonstrate MRAG's effectiveness, showing improvements of up to 20% in relevance over standard RAG baselines. MRAG can be seamlessly integrated with existing RAG frameworks and benchmarking tools like RAGAS as well as different classes of data stores.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Face recognition is a core task in computer vision designed to identify and authenticate individuals by analyzing facial patterns and features. This field intersects with artificial intelligence image processing and machine learning with applications in security authentication and personalization. Traditional approaches in facial recognition focus on capturing facial features like the eyes, nose and mouth and matching these against a database to verify identities However challenges such as high false positive rates have persisted often due to the similarity among individuals facial features. Recently Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) a model developed by OpenAI has shown promising advancements by linking natural language processing with vision tasks allowing it to generalize across modalities. Using CLIP's vision language correspondence and single-shot finetuning the model can achieve lower false positive rates upon deployment without the need of mass facial features extraction. This integration demonstrating CLIP's potential to address persistent issues in face recognition model performance without complicating our training paradigm.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The black-box nature of large language models (LLMs) poses challenges in interpreting results, impacting issues such as data intellectual property protection and hallucination tracing. Training data attribution (TDA) methods are considered effective solutions to address these challenges. Most recent TDA methods rely on influence functions, assuming the model achieves minimized empirical risk. However, achieving this criterion is difficult, and sourcing accuracy can be compromised by fitting errors during model training. In this paper, we introduce a novel TDA method called Debias and Denoise Attribution (DDA), which enhances influence functions by addressing fitting errors. Specifically, the debias strategy seeks to improve the performance of influence functions by eliminating the knowledge bias present in the base model before fine-tuning, while the denoise strategy aims to reduce discrepancies in influence scores arising from varying degrees of fitting during the training process through smoothing techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an averaged AUC of 91.64%. Moreover, DDA exhibits strong generality and scalability across various sources and different-scale models like LLaMA2, QWEN2, and Mistral.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurate multi-turn intent classification is essential for advancing conversational AI systems. However, challenges such as the scarcity of comprehensive datasets and the complexity of contextual dependencies across dialogue turns hinder progress. This paper presents two novel approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance scalability and reduce latency in production dialogue systems. First, we introduce Symbol Tuning, which simplifies intent labels to reduce task complexity and improve performance in multi-turn dialogues. Second, we propose C-LARA (Consistency-aware, Linguistics Adaptive Retrieval Augmentation), a framework that employs LLMs for data augmentation and pseudo-labeling to generate synthetic multi-turn dialogues. These enriched datasets are used to fine-tune a small, efficient model suitable for deployment. Experiments conducted on multilingual dialogue datasets demonstrate significant improvements in classification accuracy and resource efficiency. Our methods enhance multi-turn intent classification accuracy by 5.09%, reduce annotation costs by 40%, and enable scalable deployment in low-resource multilingual industrial systems, highlighting their practicality and impact.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent methods have demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve reasoning tasks better when they are encouraged to solve subtasks of the main task first. In this paper we devise a similar strategy that breaks down reasoning tasks into a problem decomposition phase and a problem solving phase and show that the strategy is able to outperform a single stage solution. Further, we hypothesize that the decomposition should be easier to distill into a smaller model compared to the problem solving because the latter requires large amounts of domain knowledge while the former only requires learning general problem solving strategies. We propose methods to distill these two capabilities and evaluate their impact on reasoning outcomes and inference cost. We find that we can distill the problem decomposition phase and at the same time achieve good generalization across tasks, datasets, and models. However, it is harder to distill the problem solving capability without losing performance and the resulting distilled model struggles with generalization. These results indicate that by using smaller, distilled problem decomposition models in combination with problem solving LLMs we can achieve reasoning with cost-efficient inference and local adaptation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid evolution of LLMs represents an impactful paradigm shift in digital interaction and content engagement. While they encode vast amounts of human-generated knowledge and excel in processing diverse data types, they often face the challenge of accurately responding to specific user intents, leading to user dissatisfaction. Based on a fine-grained intent taxonomy and intent-based prompt reformulations, we analyze the quality of intent recognition and user satisfaction with answers from intent-based prompt reformulations of GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 Turbo models. Our study highlights the importance of human-AI interaction and underscores the need for interdisciplinary approaches to improve conversational AI systems. We show that GPT-4 outperforms GPT-3.5 in recognizing common intents but is often outperformed by GPT-3.5 in recognizing less frequent intents. Moreover, whenever the user intent is correctly recognized, while users are more satisfied with the intent-based reformulations of GPT-4 compared to GPT-3.5, they tend to be more satisfied with the models' answers to their original prompts compared to the reformulated ones. The collected data from our study has been made publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/ConcealedIDentity/UserIntentStudy) for further research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved automated code translation, often achieving over 80% accuracy on existing benchmarks. However, most of these benchmarks consist of short, standalone, algorithmic samples that do not reflect practical coding tasks. To address this gap, we introduce ClassEval-T, a class-level code translation benchmark designed to assess LLM performance on real-world coding scenarios. Built upon ClassEval, a class-level Python code generation benchmark covering topics such as database operations and game design, ClassEval-T extends into Java and C++ with complete code samples and test suites, requiring 360 person-hours for manual migration. We propose three translation strategies (holistic, min-dependency, and standalone) and evaluate six recent LLMs across various families and sizes on ClassEval-T. Results reveal a significant performance drop compared to method-level benchmarks, highlighting discrepancies among LLMs and demonstrating ClassEval-T's effectiveness. We further analyze LLMs' dependency awareness in translating class samples and categorize 1,397 failure cases by the best-performing LLM for practical insights and future improvement.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Inferring affordable (i.e., graspable) parts of arbitrary objects based on human specifications is essential for robots advancing toward open-vocabulary manipulation. Current grasp planners, however, are hindered by limited vision-language comprehension and time-consuming 3D radiance modeling, restricting real-time, open-vocabulary interactions with objects. To address these limitations, we propose GLOVER, a unified Generalizable Open-Vocabulary Affordance Reasoning framework, which fine-tunes the Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict visual affordance of graspable object parts within RGB feature space. We compile a dataset of over 10,000 images from human-object interactions, annotated with unified visual and linguistic affordance labels, to enable multi-modal fine-tuning. GLOVER inherits world knowledge and common-sense reasoning from LLMs, facilitating more fine-grained object understanding and sophisticated tool-use reasoning. To enable effective real-world deployment, we present Affordance-Aware Grasping Estimation (AGE), a non-parametric grasp planner that aligns the gripper pose with a superquadric surface derived from affordance data. In evaluations across 30 real-world scenes, GLOVER achieves success rates of 86.0% in part identification and 76.3% in grasping, with speeds approximately 330 times faster in affordance reasoning and 40 times faster in grasping pose estimation than the previous state-of-the-art.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficient and accurate prediction of material properties is critical for advancing materials design and applications. The rapid-evolution of large language models (LLMs) presents a new opportunity for material property predictions, complementing experimental measurements and multi-scale computational methods. We focus on predicting the elastic constant tensor, as a case study, and develop domain-specific LLMs for predicting elastic constants and for materials discovery. The proposed ElaTBot LLM enables simultaneous prediction of elastic constant tensors, bulk modulus at finite temperatures, and the generation of new materials with targeted properties. Moreover, the capabilities of ElaTBot are further enhanced by integrating with general LLMs (GPT-4o) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for prediction. A specialized variant, ElaTBot-DFT, designed for 0 K elastic constant tensor prediction, reduces the prediction errors by 33.1% compared with domain-specific, material science LLMs (Darwin) trained on the same dataset. This natural language-based approach lowers the barriers to computational materials science and highlights the broader potential of LLMs for material property predictions and inverse design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper proposes a two-phase text-to-floorplan generation method, which guides a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate an initial layout (Layout-LLM) and refines them into the final floorplans through conditional diffusion model. We incorporate a Chain-of-Thought approach to prompt the LLM based on user text specifications, enabling a more user-friendly and intuitive house layout design. This method allows users to describe their needs in natural language, enhancing accessibility and providing clearer geometric constraints. The final floorplans generated by Layout-LLM through conditional diffusion refinement are more accurate and better meet user requirements. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics, validating its effectiveness in practical home design applications. We plan to release our code for public use.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The retinal fundus images are utilized extensively in the diagnosis, and their quality can directly affect the diagnosis results. However, due to the insufficient dataset and algorithm application, current fundus image quality assessment (FIQA) methods are not powerful enough to meet ophthalmologists` demands. In this paper, we address the limitations of datasets and algorithms in FIQA. First, we establish a new FIQA dataset, Fundus Quality Score(FQS), which includes 2246 fundus images with two labels: a continuous Mean Opinion Score varying from 0 to 100 and a three-level quality label. Then, we propose a FIQA Transformer-based Hypernetwork (FTHNet) to solve these tasks with regression results rather than classification results in conventional FIQA works. The FTHNet is optimized for the FIQA tasks with extensive experiments. Results on our FQS dataset show that the FTHNet can give quality scores for fundus images with PLCC of 0.9423 and SRCC of 0.9488, significantly outperforming other methods with fewer parameters and less computation complexity.We successfully build a dataset and model addressing the problems of current FIQA methods. Furthermore, the model deployment experiments demonstrate its potential in automatic medical image quality control. All experiments are carried out with 10-fold cross-validation to ensure the significance of the results.

MLLMs not only are able to understand and generate language across linguistic boundaries, but also represent an important advancement in artificial intelligence. We first discuss the architecture and pre-training objectives of MLLMs, highlighting the key components and methodologies that contribute to their multilingual capabilities. We then discuss the construction of multilingual pre-training and alignment datasets, underscoring the importance of data quality and diversity in enhancing MLLM performance. An important focus of this survey is on the evaluation of MLLMs. We present a detailed taxonomy and roadmap covering the assessment of MLLMs' cross-lingual knowledge, reasoning, alignment with human values, safety, interpretability and specialized applications. Specifically, we extensively discuss multilingual evaluation benchmarks and datasets, and explore the use of LLMs themselves as multilingual evaluators. To enhance MLLMs from black to white boxes, we also address the interpretability of multilingual capabilities, cross-lingual transfer and language bias within these models. Finally, we provide a comprehensive review of real-world applications of MLLMs across diverse domains, including biology, medicine, computer science, mathematics and law. We showcase how these models have driven innovation and improvements in these specialized fields while also highlighting the challenges and opportunities in deploying MLLMs within diverse language communities and application scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present a study of LLMs' performance in generating and rating example sentences for bilingual dictionaries across languages with varying resource levels: French (high-resource), Indonesian (mid-resource), and Tetun (low-resource), with English as the target language. We evaluate the quality of LLM-generated examples against the GDEX (Good Dictionary EXample) criteria: typicality, informativeness, and intelligibility. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can generate reasonably good dictionary examples, their performance degrades significantly for lower-resourced languages. We also observe high variability in human preferences for example quality, reflected in low inter-annotator agreement rates. To address this, we demonstrate that in-context learning can successfully align LLMs with individual annotator preferences. Additionally, we explore the use of pre-trained language models for automated rating of examples, finding that sentence perplexity serves as a good proxy for typicality and intelligibility in higher-resourced languages. Our study also contributes a novel dataset of 600 ratings for LLM-generated sentence pairs, and provides insights into the potential of LLMs in reducing the cost of lexicographic work, particularly for low-resource languages.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized learning approach that protects sensitive information by utilizing local model parameters rather than sharing clients' raw datasets. While this privacy-preserving method is widely employed across various applications, it still requires significant development and optimization. Automated Machine Learning (Auto-ML) has been adapted for reducing the need for manual adjustments. Previous studies have explored the integration of AutoML with different FL algorithms to evaluate their effectiveness in enhancing FL settings. However, Automated FL (Auto-FL) faces additional challenges due to the involvement of a large cohort of clients and global training rounds between clients and the server, rendering the tuning process time-consuming and nearly impossible on resource-constrained edge devices (e.g., IoT devices). This paper investigates the deployment and integration of two lightweight Hyper-Parameter Optimization (HPO) tools, Raytune and Optuna, within the context of FL settings. A step-wise feedback mechanism has also been designed to accelerate the hyper-parameter tuning process and coordinate AutoML toolkits with the FL server. To this end, both local and global feedback mechanisms are integrated to limit the search space and expedite the HPO process. Further, a novel client selection technique is introduced to mitigate the straggler effect in Auto-FL. The selected hyper-parameter tuning tools are evaluated using two benchmark datasets, FEMNIST, and CIFAR10. Further, the paper discusses the essential properties of successful HPO tools, the integration mechanism with the FL pipeline, and the challenges posed by the distributed and heterogeneous nature of FL environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) based on transformer architectures have revolutionized a variety of domains, with tokenization playing a pivotal role in their pre-processing and fine-tuning stages. In multilingual models, particularly those tailored for Indic languages, effective tokenization is crucial for optimizing performance. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of tokenizers used by 12 LLMs across all 22 official languages of India, with a focus on comparing the efficiency of their tokenization processes. We employed the Normalized Sequence Length (NSL) as a key metric in our analysis. Our findings reveal that the SUTRA tokenizer outperforms all other models, including several Indic-specific models, excelling in 14 languages. Notable insights include the SUTRA tokenizer's superior handling of Indic languages, GPT-4o's advancement over its predecessor GPT-4 in processing Indian languages, and the limited performance of Project Indus in certain languages. This study underscores the critical importance of developing targeted tokenization strategies for multilingual and Indic-centric models, laying the groundwork for future improvements in tokenizer design to enhance linguistic coverage and model efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive prowess in solving a wide range of tasks with world knowledge. However, it remains unclear how well LLMs are able to perceive their factual knowledge boundaries, particularly under retrieval augmentation settings. In this study, we present the first analysis on the factual knowledge boundaries of LLMs and how retrieval augmentation affects LLMs on open-domain question answering (QA), with a bunch of important findings. Specifically, we focus on three research questions and analyze them by examining QA, priori judgement and posteriori judgement capabilities of LLMs. We show evidence that LLMs possess unwavering confidence in their knowledge and cannot handle the conflict between internal and external knowledge well. Furthermore, retrieval augmentation proves to be an effective approach in enhancing LLMs' awareness of knowledge boundaries. We further conduct thorough experiments to examine how different factors affect LLMs and propose a simple method to dynamically utilize supporting documents with our judgement strategy. Additionally, we find that the relevance between the supporting documents and the questions significantly impacts LLMs' QA and judgemental capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Background: Advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have the potential to enhance technical expertise in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), regardless of operator skill or geographic location.   Methods: We assessed the accuracy of several LLMs in answering 570 technical MRI questions derived from a standardized review book. The questions spanned nine MRI topics, including Basic Principles, Image Production, and Safety. Closed-source models (e.g., OpenAI's o1 Preview, GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, and Claude 3.5 Haiku) and open-source models (e.g., Phi 3.5 Mini, Llama 3.1, smolLM2) were tested. Models were queried using standardized prompts via the LangChain framework, and responses were graded against correct answers using an automated scoring protocol. Accuracy, defined as the proportion of correct answers, was the primary outcome.   Results: The closed-source o1 Preview model achieved the highest accuracy (94%), exceeding the random-guess baseline (26.5%). GPT-4o and o1 Mini scored 88%, and GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3.5 Haiku each scored 84%. Among open-source models, Phi 3.5 Mini performed well, achieving 78% accuracy, comparable to several closed-source models. Accuracy was highest in Basic Principles and Instrumentation categories but lower in Image Weighting and Contrast, History, and Artifacts and Corrections.   Conclusions: LLMs exhibit high accuracy in addressing technical MRI questions, suggesting their potential to standardize and enhance MRI practice. These models may improve image quality and consistency across varied clinical environments. Further studies are needed to refine LLMs for clinical use and integrate them into MRI workflows.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Health modeling of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is crucial for safe and efficient energy management and carries significant socio-economic implications. Although Machine Learning (ML)-based State of Health (SOH) estimation methods have made significant progress in accuracy, the scarcity of high-quality LIB data remains a major obstacle. Existing transfer learning methods for cross-domain LIB SOH estimation have significantly alleviated the labeling burden of target LIB data, however, they still require sufficient unlabeled target data (UTD) for effective adaptation to the target domain. Collecting this UTD is challenging due to the time-consuming nature of degradation experiments. To address this issue, we introduce a practical Test-Time Training framework, BatteryTTT, which adapts the model continually using each UTD collected amidst degradation, thereby significantly reducing data collection time. To fully utilize each UTD, BatteryTTT integrates the inherent physical laws of modern LIBs into self-supervised learning, termed Physcics-Guided Test-Time Training. Additionally, we explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) in battery sequence modeling by evaluating their performance in SOH estimation through model reprogramming and prefix prompt adaptation. The combination of BatteryTTT and LLM modeling, termed GPT4Battery, achieves state-of-the-art generalization results across current LIB benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical value and scalability of our approach by deploying it in our real-world battery management system (BMS) for 300Ah large-scale energy storage LIBs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose affine concept editing (ACE) as an approach for steering language models' behavior by intervening directly in activations. We begin with an affine decomposition of model activation vectors and show that prior methods for steering model behavior correspond to subsets of terms of this decomposition. We then provide a derivation of ACE and use it to control refusal behavior on ten different models, including Llama 3 70B. ACE combines affine subspace projection and activation addition to reliably control the model's refusal responses across prompt types. We evaluate the results using LLM-based scoring on a collection of harmful and harmless prompts. Our experiments demonstrate that ACE consistently achieves more precise control over model behavior than existing methods and generalizes to models where directional ablation via affine subspace projection alone produces incoherent outputs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Utilising quantum computing technology to enhance artificial intelligence systems is expected to improve training and inference times, increase robustness against noise and adversarial attacks, and reduce the number of parameters without compromising accuracy. However, moving beyond proof-of-concept or simulations to develop practical applications of these systems while ensuring high software quality faces significant challenges due to the limitations of quantum hardware and the underdeveloped knowledge base in software engineering for such systems. In this work, we have conducted a systematic mapping study to identify the challenges and solutions associated with the software architecture of quantum-enhanced artificial intelligence systems. Our review uncovered several architectural patterns that describe how quantum components can be integrated into inference engines, as well as middleware patterns that facilitate communication between classical and quantum components. These insights have been compiled into a catalog of architectural patterns. Each pattern realises a trade-off between efficiency, scalability, trainability, simplicity, portability and deployability, and other software quality attributes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Group polarization is an important research direction in social media content analysis, attracting many researchers to explore this field. Therefore, how to effectively measure group polarization has become a critical topic. Measuring group polarization on social media presents several challenges that have not yet been addressed by existing solutions. First, social media group polarization measurement involves processing vast amounts of text, which poses a significant challenge for information extraction. Second, social media texts often contain hard-to-understand content, including sarcasm, memes, and internet slang. Additionally, group polarization research focuses on holistic analysis, while texts is typically fragmented. To address these challenges, we designed a solution based on a multi-agent system and used a graph-structured Community Sentiment Network (CSN) to represent polarization states. Furthermore, we developed a metric called Community Opposition Index (COI) based on the CSN to quantify polarization. Finally, we tested our multi-agent system through a zero-shot stance detection task and achieved outstanding results. In summary, the proposed approach has significant value in terms of usability, accuracy, and interpretability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid deployment of distributed energy resources (DER) has introduced significant spatio-temporal uncertainties in power grid management, necessitating accurate multilevel forecasting methods. However, existing approaches often produce overly conservative uncertainty intervals at individual spatial units and fail to properly capture uncertainties when aggregating predictions across different spatial scales. This paper presents a novel hierarchical spatio-temporal model based on the conformal prediction framework to address these challenges. Our approach generates circuit-level DER growth predictions and efficiently aggregates them to the substation level while maintaining statistical validity through a tailored non-conformity score. Applied to a decade of DER installation data from a local utility network, our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches, particularly in reducing prediction interval widths while maintaining coverage.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and pre-trained vision models have accelerated the development of vision-language large models (VLLMs), enhancing the interaction between visual and linguistic modalities. Despite their notable success across various domains, VLLMs face challenges in modality alignment, which can lead to issues like hallucinations and unsafe content generation. Current alignment techniques often rely on coarse feedback and external datasets, limiting scalability and performance. In this paper, we propose FiSAO (Fine-Grained Self-Alignment Optimization), a novel self-alignment method that utilizes the model's own visual encoder as a fine-grained verifier to improve vision-language alignment without the need for additional data. By leveraging token-level feedback from the vision encoder, FiSAO significantly improves vision-language alignment, even surpassing traditional preference tuning methods that require additional data. Through both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate that FiSAO effectively addresses the misalignment problem in VLLMs, marking the first instance of token-level rewards being applied to such models.

However, these systems often exhibit biases, favoring mainstream content while marginalizing non-traditional options due to skewed training data. This study investigates the intricate relationship between bias and LLM-based recommendation systems, with a focus on music, song, and book recommendations across diverse demographic and cultural groups. Through a comprehensive analysis conducted over different LLM-models, this paper evaluates the impact of bias on recommendation outcomes. Our findings highlight that biases are not only deeply embedded but also widely pervasive across these systems, emphasizing the substantial and widespread nature of the issue. Moreover, contextual information, such as socioeconomic status, further amplify these biases, demonstrating the complexity and depth of the challenges faced in creating fair recommendations across different groups.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, researchers have been working on how to utilize the LLMs for better recommendations. However, although LLMs exhibit black-box and probabilistic characteristics (meaning their internal working is not visible), the evaluation framework used for assessing these LLM-based recommender systems (RS) are the same as those used for traditional recommender systems. To address this gap, we introduce the metamorphic testing for the evaluation of GPT-based RS. This testing technique involves defining of metamorphic relations (MRs) between the inputs and checking if the relationship has been satisfied in the outputs. Specifically, we examined the MRs from both RS and LLMs perspectives, including rating multiplication/shifting in RS and adding spaces/randomness in the LLMs prompt via prompt perturbation. Similarity metrics (e.g. Kendall tau and Ranking Biased Overlap(RBO)) are deployed to measure whether the relationship has been satisfied in the outputs of MRs. The experiment results on MovieLens dataset with GPT3.5 show that lower similarity are obtained in terms of Kendall $\tau$ and RBO, which concludes that there is a need of a comprehensive evaluation of the LLM-based RS in addition to the existing evaluation metrics used for traditional recommender systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language model unlearning aims to remove harmful information that LLMs have learnt to prevent their use for malicious purposes. LLMU and RMU have been proposed as two methods for LLM unlearning, achieving impressive results on unlearning benchmarks. We study in detail the efficacy of these methods by evaluating their impact on general model capabilities on the WMDP benchmark as well as a biology benchmark we create. Our experiments show that RMU generally leads to better preservation of model capabilities, for similar or better unlearning. We further test the robustness of these methods and find that doing 5-shot prompting or rephrasing the question in simple ways can lead to an over ten-fold increase in accuracy on unlearning benchmarks. Finally, we show that training on unrelated data can almost completely recover pre-unlearning performance, demonstrating that these methods fail at truly unlearning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose Quantum-informed Tensor Adaptation (QuanTA), a novel, easy-to-implement, fine-tuning method with no inference overhead for large-scale pre-trained language models. By leveraging quantum-inspired methods derived from quantum circuit structures, QuanTA enables efficient high-rank fine-tuning, surpassing the limitations of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)--low-rank approximation may fail for complicated downstream tasks. Our approach is theoretically supported by the universality theorem and the rank representation theorem to achieve efficient high-rank adaptations. Experiments demonstrate that QuanTA significantly enhances commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, and scalability compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, QuanTA shows superior performance with fewer trainable parameters compared to other approaches and can be designed to integrate with existing fine-tuning algorithms for further improvement, providing a scalable and efficient solution for fine-tuning large language models and advancing state-of-the-art in natural language processing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LiDAR is crucial for robust 3D scene perception in autonomous driving. LiDAR perception has the largest body of literature after camera perception. However, multi-task learning across tasks like detection, segmentation, and motion estimation using LiDAR remains relatively unexplored, especially on automotive-grade embedded platforms. We present a real-time multi-task convolutional neural network for LiDAR-based object detection, semantics, and motion segmentation. The unified architecture comprises a shared encoder and task-specific decoders, enabling joint representation learning. We propose a novel Semantic Weighting and Guidance (SWAG) module to transfer semantic features for improved object detection selectively. Our heterogeneous training scheme combines diverse datasets and exploits complementary cues between tasks. The work provides the first embedded implementation unifying these key perception tasks from LiDAR point clouds achieving 3ms latency on the embedded NVIDIA Xavier platform. We achieve state-of-the-art results for two tasks, semantic and motion segmentation, and close to state-of-the-art performance for 3D object detection. By maximizing hardware efficiency and leveraging multi-task synergies, our method delivers an accurate and efficient solution tailored for real-world automated driving deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in foundational Vision Language Models (VLMs) have reshaped the evaluation paradigm in computer vision tasks. These foundational models, especially CLIP, have accelerated research in open-vocabulary computer vision tasks, including Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS). Although the initial results are promising, the dense prediction capabilities of VLMs still require further improvement. In this study, we enhance the semantic segmentation performance of CLIP by introducing new modules and modifications: 1) architectural changes in the last layer of ViT and the incorporation of attention maps from the middle layers with the last layer, 2) Image Engineering: applying data augmentations to enrich input image representations, and 3) using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate definitions and synonyms for each class name to leverage CLIP's open-vocabulary capabilities. Our training-free method, ITACLIP, outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches on segmentation benchmarks such as COCO-Stuff, COCO-Object, Pascal Context, and Pascal VOC.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Introduction: Deep learning models hold great promise for digital pathology, but their opaque decision-making processes undermine trust and hinder clinical adoption. Explainable AI methods are essential to enhance model transparency and reliability. Methods: We developed HIPPO, an explainable AI framework that systematically modifies tissue regions in whole slide images to generate image counterfactuals, enabling quantitative hypothesis testing, bias detection, and model evaluation beyond traditional performance metrics. HIPPO was applied to a variety of clinically important tasks, including breast metastasis detection in axillary lymph nodes, prognostication in breast cancer and melanoma, and IDH mutation classification in gliomas. In computational experiments, HIPPO was compared against traditional metrics and attention-based approaches to assess its ability to identify key tissue elements driving model predictions. Results: In metastasis detection, HIPPO uncovered critical model limitations that were undetectable by standard performance metrics or attention-based methods. For prognostic prediction, HIPPO outperformed attention by providing more nuanced insights into tissue elements influencing outcomes. In a proof-of-concept study, HIPPO facilitated hypothesis generation for identifying melanoma patients who may benefit from immunotherapy. In IDH mutation classification, HIPPO more robustly identified the pathology regions responsible for false negatives compared to attention, suggesting its potential to outperform attention in explaining model decisions. Conclusions: HIPPO expands the explainable AI toolkit for computational pathology by enabling deeper insights into model behavior. This framework supports the trustworthy development, deployment, and regulation of weakly-supervised models in clinical and research settings, promoting their broader adoption in digital pathology.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The scientific ideation process often involves blending salient aspects of existing papers to create new ideas. To see if large language models (LLMs) can assist this process, we contribute Scideator, a novel mixed-initiative tool for scientific ideation. Starting from a user-provided set of papers, Scideator extracts key facets (purposes, mechanisms, and evaluations) from these and relevant papers, allowing users to explore the idea space by interactively recombining facets to synthesize inventive ideas. Scideator also helps users to gauge idea novelty by searching the literature for potential overlaps and showing automated novelty assessments and explanations. To support these tasks, Scideator introduces four LLM-powered retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) modules: Analogous Paper Facet Finder, Faceted Idea Generator, Idea Novelty Checker, and Idea Novelty Iterator. In a within-subjects user study, 19 computer-science researchers identified significantly more interesting ideas using Scideator compared to a strong baseline combining a scientific search engine with LLM interaction.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on language tasks but face challenges when deployed on resource-constrained devices due to their extensive parameters and reliance on dense multiplications, resulting in high memory demands and latency bottlenecks. Shift-and-add reparameterization offers a promising solution by replacing costly multiplications with hardware-friendly primitives in both the attention and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers of an LLM. However, current reparameterization techniques require training from scratch or full parameter fine-tuning to restore accuracy, which is resource-intensive for LLMs. To address this, we propose accelerating pretrained LLMs through post-training shift-and-add reparameterization, creating efficient multiplication-free models, dubbed ShiftAddLLM. Specifically, we quantize each weight matrix into binary matrices paired with group-wise scaling factors. The associated multiplications are reparameterized into (1) shifts between activations and scaling factors and (2) queries and adds according to the binary matrices. To reduce accuracy loss, we present a multi-objective optimization method to minimize both weight and output activation reparameterization errors. Additionally, based on varying sensitivity across layers to reparameterization, we develop an automated bit allocation strategy to further reduce memory usage and latency. Experiments on five LLM families and eight tasks consistently validate the effectiveness of ShiftAddLLM, achieving average perplexity improvements of 5.6 and 22.7 points at comparable or lower latency compared to the most competitive quantized LLMs at 3 and 2 bits, respectively, and more than 80% memory and energy reductions over the original LLMs. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/GATECH-EIC/ShiftAddLLM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Natural Language Processing (NLP) is widely used to supply summarization ability from long context to structured information. However, extracting structured knowledge from scientific text by NLP models remains a challenge because of its domain-specific nature to complex data preprocessing and the granularity of multi-layered device-level information. To address this, we introduce ByteScience, a non-profit cloud-based auto fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) platform, which is designed to extract structured scientific data and synthesize new scientific knowledge from vast scientific corpora. The platform capitalizes on DARWIN, an open-source, fine-tuned LLM dedicated to natural science. The platform was built on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and provides an automated, user-friendly workflow for custom model development and data extraction. The platform achieves remarkable accuracy with only a small amount of well-annotated articles. This innovative tool streamlines the transition from the science literature to structured knowledge and data and benefits the advancements in natural informatics.

However, existing CoT evaluation techniques either require annotated CoT data or fall short in accurately assessing intermediate reasoning steps, leading to high rates of false positives. In this paper, we formalize CoT reasoning in LLMs through an information-theoretic lens. Specifically, our framework quantifies the `information gain' at each reasoning step, enabling the identification of failure modes in LLMs without the need for expensive annotated datasets. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through extensive experiments on toy and GSM-8K data, where it significantly outperforms existing outcome-based methods by providing more accurate insights into model performance on individual tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quadrotors equipped with cable-suspended loads represent a versatile, low-cost, and energy efficient solution for aerial transportation, construction, and manipulation tasks. However, their real-world deployment is hindered by several challenges. The system is difficult to control because it is nonlinear, underactuated, involves hybrid dynamics due to slack-taut cable modes, and evolves on complex configuration spaces. Additionally, it is crucial to estimate the full state and the cable's mode transitions in real-time using on-board sensors and computation. To address these challenges, we present a novel Hybrid Perception-Aware Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (HPA-MPC) control approach for quadrotors with suspended loads. Our method considers the complete hybrid system dynamics and includes a perception-aware cost to ensure the payload remains visible in the robot's camera during navigation. Furthermore, the full state and hybrid dynamics' transitions are estimated using onboard sensors. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables stable load tracking control, even during slack-taut transitions, and operates entirely onboard. The experiments also show that the perception-aware term effectively keeps the payload in the robot's camera field of view when a human operator interacts with the load.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The typical selective state-space model (SSM) of Mamba addresses several limitations of Transformers, such as quadratic computational complexity with sequence length and significant inference-time memory requirements due to the key-value cache. However, the growing size of Mamba models continues to pose training and deployment challenges and raises environmental concerns due to considerable energy consumption. In this work, we introduce Bi-Mamba, a scalable and powerful 1-bit Mamba architecture designed for more efficient large language models with multiple sizes across 780M, 1.3B, and 2.7B. Bi-Mamba models are trained from scratch on data volume as regular LLM pertaining using an autoregressive distillation loss. Extensive experimental results on language modeling demonstrate that Bi-Mamba achieves performance comparable to its full-precision counterparts (e.g., FP16 or BF16) and much better accuracy than post-training-binarization (PTB) Mamba baselines, while significantly reducing memory footprint and energy consumption compared to the original Mamba model. Our study pioneers a new linear computational complexity LLM framework under low-bit representation and facilitates the future design of specialized hardware tailored for efficient 1-bit Mamba-based LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite the remarkable capabilities of modern large language models (LLMs), the mechanisms behind their problem-solving abilities remain elusive. In this work, we aim to better understand how the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning shapes downstream generalization. Our analysis focuses on reasoning tasks, whose problem structure allows us to distinguish between memorization (the exact replication of reasoning steps from the training data) and performance (the correctness of the final solution). We find that a model's generalization behavior can be effectively characterized by a training metric we call pre-memorization train accuracy: the accuracy of model samples on training queries before they begin to copy the exact reasoning steps from the training set. On the dataset level, this metric is able to reliably predict test accuracy, achieving $R^2$ of around or exceeding 0.9 across various models (Llama3 8, Gemma2 9B), datasets (GSM8k, MATH), and training configurations. On a per-example level, this metric is also indicative of whether individual model predictions are robust to perturbations in the training query. By connecting a model's learning behavior to its generalization, pre-memorization train accuracy can guide targeted improvements to training strategies. We focus on data curation as an example, and show that prioritizing examples with low pre-memorization accuracy leads to 1.5-2x improvements in data efficiency compared to i.i.d. data scaling, and outperforms other standard data curation techniques.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Though large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across numerous problems, their application to predictive tasks in relational databases remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address the notion that LLMs cannot yield satisfactory results on relational databases due to their interconnected tables, complex relationships, and heterogeneous data types. Using the recently introduced RelBench benchmark, we demonstrate that even a straightforward application of LLMs achieves competitive performance on these tasks. These findings establish LLMs as a promising new baseline for ML on relational databases and encourage further research in this direction.

This perspective paper aims to discuss the inner workings of building LLM-powered medical AI applications and introduces a comprehensive framework for their development. We review existing literature and outline the unique challenges of applying LLMs in specialized medical contexts. Additionally, we introduce a three-step framework to organize medical LLM research activities: 1) Modeling: breaking down complex medical workflows into manageable steps for developing medical-specific models; 2) Optimization: optimizing the model performance with crafted prompts and integrating external knowledge and tools, and 3) System engineering: decomposing complex tasks into subtasks and leveraging human expertise for building medical AI applications. Furthermore, we offer a detailed use case playbook that describes various LLM-powered medical AI applications, such as optimizing clinical trial design, enhancing clinical decision support, and advancing medical imaging analysis. Finally, we discuss various challenges and considerations for building medical AI applications with LLMs, such as handling hallucination issues, data ownership and compliance, privacy, intellectual property considerations, compute cost, sustainability issues, and responsible AI requirements.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modeling disease progression is crucial for improving the quality and efficacy of clinical diagnosis and prognosis, but it is often hindered by a lack of longitudinal medical image monitoring for individual patients. To address this challenge, we propose the first Medical Video Generation (MVG) framework that enables controlled manipulation of disease-related image and video features, allowing precise, realistic, and personalized simulations of disease progression. Our approach begins by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to recaption prompt for disease trajectory. Next, a controllable multi-round diffusion model simulates the disease progression state for each patient, creating realistic intermediate disease state sequence. Finally, a diffusion-based video transition generation model interpolates disease progression between these states. We validate our framework across three medical imaging domains: chest X-ray, fundus photography, and skin image. Our results demonstrate that MVG significantly outperforms baseline models in generating coherent and clinically plausible disease trajectories. Two user studies by veteran physicians, provide further validation and insights into the clinical utility of the generated sequences. MVG has the potential to assist healthcare providers in modeling disease trajectories, interpolating missing medical image data, and enhancing medical education through realistic, dynamic visualizations of disease progression.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Adversarial robustness of neural networks is an increasingly important area of research, combining studies on computer vision models, large language models (LLMs), and others. With the release of JPEG AI - the first standard for end-to-end neural image compression (NIC) methods - the question of its robustness has become critically significant. JPEG AI is among the first international, real-world applications of neural-network-based models to be embedded in consumer devices. However, research on NIC robustness has been limited to open-source codecs and a narrow range of attacks. This paper proposes a new methodology for measuring NIC robustness to adversarial attacks. We present the first large-scale evaluation of JPEG AI's robustness, comparing it with other NIC models. Our evaluation results and code are publicly available online (link is hidden for a blind review).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Optimizing space vehicle routing is crucial for critical applications such as on-orbit servicing, constellation deployment, and space debris de-orbiting. Multi-target Rendezvous presents a significant challenge in this domain. This problem involves determining the optimal sequence in which to visit a set of targets, and the corresponding optimal trajectories: this results in a demanding NP-hard problem. We introduce a framework for the design and refinement of multi-rendezvous trajectories based on heuristic combinatorial optimization and Sequential Convex Programming. Our framework is both highly modular and capable of leveraging candidate solutions obtained with advanced approaches and handcrafted heuristics. We demonstrate this flexibility by integrating an Attention-based routing policy trained with Reinforcement Learning to improve the performance of the combinatorial optimization process. We show that Reinforcement Learning approaches for combinatorial optimization can be effectively applied to spacecraft routing problems. We apply the proposed framework to the UARX Space OSSIE mission: we are able to thoroughly explore the mission design space, finding optimal tours and trajectories for a wide variety of mission scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Executing drift maneuvers during high-speed cornering presents significant challenges for autonomous vehicles, yet offers the potential to minimize turning time and enhance driving dynamics. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results in simulated environments, discrepancies between simulations and real-world conditions have limited its practical deployment. This study introduces an innovative control framework that integrates trajectory optimization with drift maneuvers, aiming to improve the algorithm's adaptability for real-vehicle implementation. We leveraged Bezier-based pre-trajectory optimization to enhance rewards and optimize the controller through Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) in a simulated environment. For real-world deployment, we implement a hybrid RL-MPC fusion mechanism, , where TD3-derived maneuvers serve as primary inputs for a Model Predictive Controller (MPC). This integration enables precise real-time tracking of the optimal trajectory, with MPC providing corrective inputs to bridge the gap between simulation and reality. The efficacy of this method is validated through real-vehicle tests on consumer-grade electric vehicles, focusing on drift U-turns and drift right-angle turns. The control outcomes of these real-vehicle tests are thoroughly documented in the paper, supported by supplementary video evidence (https://youtu.be/5wp67FcpfL8). Notably, this study is the first to deploy and apply an RL-based transient drift cornering algorithm on consumer-grade electric vehicles.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In mixed reality (MR) environments, understanding space and creating virtual objects is crucial to providing an intuitive and rich user experience. This paper introduces sMoRe (Spatial Mapping and Object Rendering Environment), an MR application that combines Generative AI (GenAI) with large language models (LLMs) to assist users in creating, placing, and managing virtual objects within physical spaces. sMoRe allows users to use voice or typed text commands to create and place virtual objects using GenAI while specifying spatial constraints. The system leverages LLMs to interpret users' commands, analyze the current scene, and identify optimal locations. Additionally, sMoRe integrates text-to-3D generative AI to dynamically create 3D objects based on users' descriptions. Our user study demonstrates the effectiveness of sMoRe in enhancing user comprehension, interaction, and organization of the MR environment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a rapid growth of agentic systems capable of handling a wide range of complex tasks. However, current research largely relies on manual, task-specific design, limiting their adaptability to novel tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new research problem: Modularized LLM Agent Search (MoLAS). We propose a modular design space that abstracts existing LLM agent designs into four fundamental modules with uniform IO interface: Planning, Reasoning, Tool Use, and Memory. Building on this design space, we present a novel LLM agent search framework called AgentSquare, which introduces two core mechanisms, i.e., module evolution and recombination, to efficiently search for optimized LLM agents. To further accelerate the process, we design a performance predictor that uses in-context surrogate models to skip unpromising agent designs. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks, covering the diverse scenarios of web, embodied, tool use and game applications, show that AgentSquare substantially outperforms hand-crafted agents, achieving an average performance gain of 17.2% against best-known human designs. Moreover, AgentSquare can generate interpretable design insights, enabling a deeper understanding of agentic architecture and its impact on task performance. We believe that the modular design space and AgentSquare search framework offer a platform for fully exploiting the potential of prior successful designs and consolidating the collective efforts of research community.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various machine learning tasks. Yet the substantial memory footprint of LLMs significantly hinders their deployment. In this paper, we improve the accessibility of LLMs through BitMoD, an algorithm-hardware co-design solution that enables efficient LLM acceleration at low weight precision. On the algorithm side, BitMoD introduces fine-grained data type adaptation that uses a different numerical data type to quantize a group of (e.g., 128) weights. Through the careful design of these new data types, BitMoD is able to quantize LLM weights to very low precision (e.g., 4 bits and 3 bits) while maintaining high accuracy. On the hardware side, BitMoD employs a bit-serial processing element to easily support multiple numerical precisions and data types; our hardware design includes two key innovations: First, it employs a unified representation to process different weight data types, thus reducing the hardware cost. Second, it adopts a bit-serial dequantization unit to rescale the per-group partial sum with minimal hardware overhead. Our evaluation on six representative LLMs demonstrates that BitMoD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM quantization and acceleration methods. For discriminative tasks, BitMoD can quantize LLM weights to 4-bit with $<\!0.5\%$ accuracy loss on average. For generative tasks, BitMoD is able to quantize LLM weights to 3-bit while achieving better perplexity than prior LLM quantization scheme. Combining the superior model performance with an efficient accelerator design, BitMoD achieves an average of $1.69\times$ and $1.48\times$ speedups compared to prior LLM accelerators ANT and OliVe, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Crypto-ransomware has caused an unprecedented scope of impact in recent years with an evolving level of sophistication. An extensive range of studies have been on defending against ransomware and reviewing the efficacy of various protections. However, for practical defenses, deployability holds equal significance as detection accuracy. Therefore, in this study, we review 117 published ransomware defense works, categorize them by the level they are implemented at, and discuss the deployability. API-based solutions are easy to deploy and most existing works focus on machine learning-based classification. To provide more insights, we quantitively characterize the runtime behaviors of real-world ransomware samples. Based on our experimental findings, we present a possible future detection direction with our consistency analysis and API-contrast-based refinement. Moreover, we experimentally evaluate various commercial defenses and identify the security gaps. Our findings help the field understand the deployability of ransomware defenses and create more effective, practical solutions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Inspired by recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) for Natural Language Processing (NLP), there has been a surge in research focused on developing foundational models for time series forecasting. One approach involves training LLM architectures on tokenized time series data using cross-entropy loss. Although this method has demonstrated promising results, cross-entropy loss is primarily designed for classification tasks and does not account for the distance between classes. To address this limitation, we propose using the Wasserstein loss for such architectures. To validate our approach, we fine-tuned a foundational time series model on $22$ zero-shot datasets, comparing the performance of cross-entropy loss with that of Wasserstein loss. Our results demonstrate that replacing cross-entropy loss with Wasserstein loss significantly improves point estimation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We explore how large language models (LLMs) can be influenced by prompting them to alter their initial decisions and align them with established ethical frameworks. Our study is based on two experiments designed to assess the susceptibility of LLMs to moral persuasion. In the first experiment, we examine the susceptibility to moral ambiguity by evaluating a Base Agent LLM on morally ambiguous scenarios and observing how a Persuader Agent attempts to modify the Base Agent's initial decisions. The second experiment evaluates the susceptibility of LLMs to align with predefined ethical frameworks by prompting them to adopt specific value alignments rooted in established philosophical theories. The results demonstrate that LLMs can indeed be persuaded in morally charged scenarios, with the success of persuasion depending on factors such as the model used, the complexity of the scenario, and the conversation length. Notably, LLMs of distinct sizes but from the same company produced markedly different outcomes, highlighting the variability in their susceptibility to ethical persuasion.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in sRGB-to-RAW de-rendering have increasingly emphasized metadata-driven approaches to reconstruct RAW data from sRGB images, supplemented by partial RAW information. In image-based de-rendering, metadata is commonly obtained through sampling, whereas in video tasks, it is typically derived from the initial frame. The distinct metadata requirements necessitate specialized network architectures, leading to architectural incompatibilities that increase deployment complexity. In this paper, we propose RAWMamba, a Mamba-based unified framework developed for sRGB-to-RAW de-rendering across both image and video domains. The core of RAWMamba is the Unified Metadata Embedding (UME) module, which harmonizes diverse metadata types into a unified representation. In detail, a multi-perspective affinity modeling method is proposed to promote the extraction of reference information. In addition, we introduce the Local Tone-Aware Mamba (LTA-Mamba) module, which captures long-range dependencies to enable effective global propagation of metadata. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RAWMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding high-quality RAW data reconstruction.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deploying robots in open-world environments involves complex tasks characterized by long sequences and rich interactions, necessitating efficient transfer of robotic skills across diverse and complex scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a skill library framework based on knowledge graphs, which endows robots with high-level skill awareness and spatial semantic understanding. The framework hierarchically organizes operational knowledge by constructing a "task graph" and a "scene graph" to represent task and scene semantic information, respectively. We introduce a "state graph" to facilitate interaction between high-level task planning and low-level scene information. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical transfer framework for operational skills. At the task level, the framework integrates contextual learning and chain-of-thought prompting within a four-stage prompt paradigm, leveraging large language models' (LLMs) reasoning and generalization capabilities to achieve task-level subtask sequence transfer. At the motion level, an adaptive trajectory transfer method is developed using the A* algorithm and the skill library, enabling motion-level adaptive trajectory transfer. At the physical level, we introduce an adaptive contour extraction and posture perception method based on tactile perception. This method dynamically obtains high-precision contour and posture information from visual-tactile texture data and adjusts transferred skills, such as contact positions and postures, to ensure effectiveness in new environments. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Project website:https://github.com/MingchaoQi/skill_transfer

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> By adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to domain-specific tasks or enriching them with domain-specific knowledge, we can fully harness the capabilities of LLMs. Nonetheless, a gap persists in achieving simultaneous mutual enhancement between the server's LLM and the downstream clients' Small Language Models (SLMs). To address this, we propose FedCoLLM, a novel and parameter-efficient federated framework designed for co-tuning LLMs and SLMs. This approach is aimed at adaptively transferring server-side LLMs knowledge to clients' SLMs while simultaneously enriching the LLMs with domain insights from the clients. To accomplish this, FedCoLLM utilizes lightweight adapters in conjunction with SLMs, facilitating knowledge exchange between server and clients in a manner that respects data privacy while also minimizing computational and communication overhead. Our evaluation of FedCoLLM, utilizing various public LLMs and SLMs across a range of NLP text generation tasks, reveals that the performance of clients' SLMs experiences notable improvements with the assistance of the LLMs. Simultaneously, the LLMs enhanced via FedCoLLM achieves comparable performance to that obtained through direct fine-tuning on clients' data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, test-time scaling has garnered significant attention from the research community, largely due to the substantial advancements of the o1 model released by OpenAI. By allocating more computational resources during the inference phase, large language models~(LLMs) can extensively explore the solution space by generating more thought tokens or diverse solutions, thereby producing more accurate responses. However, developing an o1-like reasoning approach is challenging, and researchers have been making various attempts to advance this open area of research. In this paper, we present a preliminary exploration into enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs through reward-guided tree search algorithms. This framework is implemented by integrating the policy model, reward model, and search algorithm. It is primarily constructed around a tree search algorithm, where the policy model navigates a dynamically expanding tree guided by a specially trained reward model. We thoroughly explore various design considerations necessary for implementing this framework and provide a detailed report of the technical aspects. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we focus on mathematical reasoning tasks and conduct extensive evaluations on four challenging datasets, significantly enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LLMs are increasingly fine-tuned using RLHF datasets to align them with human preferences and values. However, very limited research has investigated which specific human values are operationalized through these datasets. In this paper, we introduce Value Imprint, a framework for auditing and classifying the human values embedded within RLHF datasets. To investigate the viability of this framework, we conducted three case study experiments by auditing the Anthropic/hh-rlhf, OpenAI WebGPT Comparisons, and Alpaca GPT-4-LLM datasets to examine the human values embedded within them. Our analysis involved a two-phase process. During the first phase, we developed a taxonomy of human values through an integrated review of prior works from philosophy, axiology, and ethics. Then, we applied this taxonomy to annotate 6,501 RLHF preferences. During the second phase, we employed the labels generated from the annotation as ground truth data for training a transformer-based machine learning model to audit and classify the three RLHF datasets. Through this approach, we discovered that information-utility values, including Wisdom/Knowledge and Information Seeking, were the most dominant human values within all three RLHF datasets. In contrast, prosocial and democratic values, including Well-being, Justice, and Human/Animal Rights, were the least represented human values. These findings have significant implications for developing language models that align with societal values and norms. We contribute our datasets to support further research in this area.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Robotic manipulation refers to the autonomous handling and interaction of robots with objects using advanced techniques in robotics and artificial intelligence. The advent of powerful tools such as large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) has significantly enhanced the capabilities of these robots in environmental perception and decision-making. However, the introduction of these intelligent agents has led to security threats such as jailbreak attacks and adversarial attacks.   In this research, we take a further step by proposing a backdoor attack specifically targeting robotic manipulation and, for the first time, implementing backdoor attack in the physical world. By embedding a backdoor visual language model into the visual perception module within the robotic system, we successfully mislead the robotic arm's operation in the physical world, given the presence of common items as triggers. Experimental evaluations in the physical world demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed backdoor attack.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To fully exploit the physics potential of current and future high energy particle colliders, machine learning (ML) can be implemented in detector electronics for intelligent data processing and acquisition. The implementation of ML in real-time at colliders requires very low latencies that are unachievable with a software-based approach, requiring optimization and synthesis of ML algorithms for deployment on hardware. An analysis of neural network inference efficiency is presented, focusing on the application of collider trigger algorithms in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Trade-offs are evaluated between two frameworks, the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL) and hls4ml, in terms of resources and latency for different model sizes. Results highlight the strengths and limitations of each approach, offering valuable insights for optimizing real-time neural network deployments at colliders. This work aims to guide researchers and engineers in selecting the most suitable hardware and software configurations for real-time, resource-constrained environments.
