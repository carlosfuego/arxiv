                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper tackles the growing issue of excessive data transmission in networks. With increasing traffic, backhaul links and core networks are under significant traffic, leading to the investigation of caching solutions at edge routers. Many existing studies utilize Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to tackle caching problems, often assuming decision points at fixed intervals; however, real-world environments are characterized by random request arrivals. Additionally, critical file attributes such as lifetime, size, and priority significantly impact the effectiveness of caching policies, yet existing research fails to integrate all these attributes in policy design. In this work, we model the caching problem using a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) to better capture the continuous-time nature of real-world applications, enabling caching decisions to be triggered by random file requests. We then introduce a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)--based caching strategy that fully considers file attributes like lifetime, size, and priority. Simulations show that our method outperforms a recent Deep Reinforcement Learning-based technique. To further advance our research, we improved the convergence rate of PPO by prioritizing transitions within the replay buffer through an attention mechanism. This mechanism evaluates the similarity between the current state and all stored transitions, assigning higher priorities to transitions that exhibit greater similarity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are essential in natural language processing but often struggle with inference speed and computational efficiency, limiting real-time deployment. The key-value (KV) cache mechanism reduces computational overhead in transformer models, but challenges in maintaining contextual understanding remain. In this paper, we propose BUZZ, a novel KV caching algorithm that leverages structured contextual information to minimize cache memory usage while enhancing inference speed. BUZZ employs a beehive-structured sparse cache, incorporating a sliding window to capture recent information and dynamically segmenting historical tokens into chunks to prioritize important tokens in local neighborhoods. We evaluate BUZZ on four real-world datasets: CNN/Daily Mail, XSUM, Wikitext, and 10-QA. Our results demonstrate that BUZZ (1) reduces cache memory usage by $\textbf{2.5}\times$ in LLM inference while maintaining over 99% accuracy in long-text summarization, and (2) surpasses state-of-the-art performance in multi-document question answering by $\textbf{7.69%}$ under the same memory limit, where full cache methods encounter out-of-memory issues. Additionally, BUZZ achieves significant inference speedup with a $\log{n}$ time complexity. The code is available at https://github.com/JunqiZhao888/buzz-llm.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The transformer's context window is vital for tasks such as few-shot learning and conditional generation as it preserves previous tokens for active memory. However, as the context lengths increase, the computational costs grow quadratically, hindering the deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world, long sequence scenarios. Although some recent key-value caching (KV Cache) methods offer linear inference complexity, they naively manage the stored context, prematurely evicting tokens and losing valuable information. Moreover, they lack an optimized prefill/prompt stage strategy, resulting in higher latency than even quadratic attention for realistic context sizes. In response, we introduce a novel mechanism that leverages cascading sub-cache buffers to selectively retain the most relevant tokens, enabling the model to maintain longer context histories without increasing the cache size. Our approach outperforms linear caching baselines across key benchmarks, including streaming perplexity, question answering, book summarization, and passkey retrieval, where it retains better retrieval accuracy at 1M tokens after four doublings of the cache size of 65K. Additionally, our method reduces prefill stage latency by a factor of 6.8 when compared to flash attention on 1M tokens. These innovations not only enhance the computational efficiency of LLMs but also pave the way for their effective deployment in resource-constrained environments, enabling large-scale, real-time applications with significantly reduced latency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, Transformer-based models (Transformers) have achieved significant success in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). However, previous works focus on extracting features either from the time domain or the frequency domain, which inadequately captures the trends and periodic characteristics. To address this issue, we propose a wavelet learning framework to model complex temporal dependencies of the time series data. The wavelet domain integrates both time and frequency information, allowing for the analysis of local characteristics of signals at different scales. Additionally, the Softmax self-attention mechanism used by Transformers has quadratic complexity, which leads to excessive computational costs when capturing long-term dependencies. Therefore, we propose a novel attention mechanism: Rotary Route Attention (RoRA). Unlike Softmax attention, RoRA utilizes rotary position embeddings to inject relative positional information to sequence tokens and introduces a small number of routing tokens $r$ to aggregate information from the $KV$ matrices and redistribute it to the $Q$ matrix, offering linear complexity. We further propose WaveRoRA, which leverages RoRA to capture inter-series dependencies in the wavelet domain. We conduct extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets. The results indicate that WaveRoRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models while maintaining lower computational costs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this study, we introduce adaptive KV cache compression, a plug-and-play method that reduces the memory footprint of generative inference for Large Language Models (LLMs). Different from the conventional KV cache that retains key and value vectors for all context tokens, we conduct targeted profiling to discern the intrinsic structure of attention modules. Based on the recognized structure, we then construct the KV cache in an adaptive manner: evicting long-range contexts on attention heads emphasizing local contexts, discarding non-special tokens on attention heads centered on special tokens, and only employing the standard KV cache for attention heads that broadly attend to all tokens. Moreover, with the lightweight attention profiling used to guide the construction of the adaptive KV cache, FastGen can be deployed without resource-intensive fine-tuning or re-training. In our experiments across various asks, FastGen demonstrates substantial reduction on GPU memory consumption with negligible generation quality loss. We will release our code and the compatible CUDA kernel for reproducibility.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet deploying them on mobile devices remains an arduous challenge due to their extensive computational and memory demands. While lightweight LLMs have been developed to fit mobile environments, they suffer from degraded model accuracy. In contrast, sparsity-based techniques minimize DRAM usage by selectively transferring only relevant neurons to DRAM while retaining the full model in external storage, such as flash. However, such approaches are critically limited by numerous I/O operations, particularly on smartphones with severe IOPS constraints.   In this paper, we propose Ripple, a novel approach that accelerates LLM inference on smartphones by optimizing neuron placement in flash memory. Ripple leverages the concept of Neuron Co-Activation, where neurons frequently activated together are linked to facilitate continuous read access and optimize data transfer efficiency. Our approach incorporates a two-stage solution: an offline stage that reorganizes neuron placement based on co-activation patterns, and an online stage that employs tailored data access and caching strategies to align well with hardware characteristics. Evaluations conducted on a variety of smartphones and LLMs demonstrate that Ripple achieves up to 5.93x improvements in I/O latency compared to the state-of-the-art. As the first solution to optimize storage placement under sparsity, Ripple explores a new optimization space at the intersection of sparsity-driven algorithm and storage-level system co-design in LLM inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In large venues like shopping malls and airports, knowledge on the indoor populations fuels applications such as business analytics, venue management, and safety control. In this work, we provide means of modeling populations in partitions of indoor space offline and of monitoring indoor populations continuously, by using indoor positioning data. However, the low-sampling rates of indoor positioning render the data temporally and spatially sparse, which in turn renders the offline capture of indoor populations challenging. It is even more challenging to continuously monitor indoor populations, as positioning data may be missing or not ready yet at the current moment. To address these challenges, we first enable probabilistic modeling of populations in indoor space partitions as Normal distributions. Based on that, we propose two learning-based estimators for on-the-fly prediction of population distributions. Leveraging the prediction-based schemes, we provide a unified continuous query processing framework for a type of query that enables continuous monitoring of populated partitions. The framework encompasses caching and result validity mechanisms to reduce cost and maintain monitoring effectiveness. Extensive experiments on two real data sets show that the proposed estimators are able to outperform the state-of-the-art alternatives and that the query processing framework is effective and efficient.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The promising applications of large language models are often constrained by the limited GPU memory capacity available on edge devices. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models help mitigate this issue by activating only a subset of the model's parameters during computation, allowing the unused parameters to be offloaded to host memory and reducing overall GPU memory demand. However, existing cache-based offloading solutions handle cache misses reactively and significantly impact system performance. In this paper, we propose ProMoE, a novel proactive caching system that leverages intermediate model results to predict subsequent parameter usage. By proactively fetching experts in advance, ProMoE removes the loading time from the critical path and diminishes the performance overhead of offloading. Our evaluations demonstrate that ProMoE achieves an average speedup of 2.13x and 2.84x in the prefill and decode stages respectively, compared to existing offloading solutions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Last few years have seen unprecedented advances in capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). These advancements promise to deeply benefit a vast array of application domains. However, due to their immense size, performing inference with LLMs is both costly and slow. Consequently, a plethora of recent work has proposed strategies to enhance inference efficiency, e.g., quantization, pruning, and caching. These acceleration strategies reduce the inference cost and latency, often by several factors, while maintaining much of the predictive performance measured via common benchmarks. In this work, we explore another critical aspect of LLM performance: demographic bias in model generations due to inference acceleration optimizations. Using a wide range of metrics, we probe bias in model outputs from a number of angles. Analysis of outputs before and after inference acceleration shows significant change in bias. Worryingly, these bias effects are complex and unpredictable. A combination of an acceleration strategy and bias type may show little bias change in one model but may lead to a large effect in another. Our results highlight a need for in-depth and case-by-case evaluation of model bias after it has been modified to accelerate inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The context window of large language models (LLMs) is rapidly increasing, leading to a huge variance in resource usage between different requests as well as between different phases of the same request. Restricted by static parallelism strategies, existing LLM serving systems cannot efficiently utilize the underlying resources to serve variable-length requests in different phases. To address this problem, we propose a new parallelism paradigm, elastic sequence parallelism (ESP), to elastically adapt to the variance between different requests and phases. Based on ESP, we design and build LoongServe, an LLM serving system that (1) improves computation efficiency by elastically adjusting the degree of parallelism in real-time, (2) improves communication efficiency by reducing key-value cache migration overhead and overlapping partial decoding communication with computation, and (3) improves GPU memory efficiency by reducing key-value cache fragmentation across instances. Our evaluation under diverse real-world datasets shows that LoongServe improves the maximum throughput by up to 3.85$\times$ compared to the chunked prefill and 5.81$\times$ compared to the prefill-decoding disaggregation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we introduce a new post-training compression paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate their wider adoption. We delve into LLM weight low-rank decomposition, and find that the challenges of this task stem from the distribution variance in the LLM activations and the sensitivity difference among various kinds of layers. To address these issues, we propose a training-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition (ASVD). Specifically, ASVD manages activation outliers by transforming the weight matrix based on the activation distribution. This transformation allows the outliers in the activation matrix to be absorbed into the transformed weight matrix, thereby enhancing decomposition accuracy. Additionally, we propose an efficient iterative calibration process to optimize layer-specific decomposition by addressing the varying sensitivity of different LLM layers. In this way, ASVD can compress a network by 10%-30%. Based on the success of the low-rank decomposition of projection matrices in the self-attention module, we further introduce ASVD to compress the KV cache. By reducing the channel dimension of KV activations, memory requirements for KV cache can be largely reduced. ASVD can further achieve 50% KV cache reductions without performance drop in a training-free manner. Code is anonymously available in supplementary materials.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We consider a system with a local cache connected to a backend server and an end user population. A set of contents are stored at the the server where they continuously get updated. The local cache keeps copies, potentially stale, of a subset of the contents. The users make content requests to the local cache which either can serve the local version if available or can fetch a fresh version or can wait for additional requests before fetching and serving a fresh version. Serving a stale version of a content incurs an age-of-version(AoV) dependent ageing cost, fetching it from the server incurs a fetching cost, and making a request wait incurs a per unit time waiting cost. We focus on the optimal actions subject to the cache capacity constraint at each decision epoch, aiming at minimizing the long term average cost. We pose the problem as a Restless Multi-armed Bandit(RMAB) Problem and propose a Whittle index based policy which is known to be asymptotically optimal. We explicitly characterize the Whittle indices. We numerically evaluate the proposed policy and also compare it to a greedy policy. We show that it is close to the optimal policy and substantially outperforms the greedy policy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce QuaRot, a new Quantization scheme based on Rotations, which is able to quantize LLMs end-to-end, including all weights, activations, and KV cache in 4 bits. QuaRot rotates LLMs in a way that removes outliers from the hidden state without changing the output, making quantization easier. This computational invariance is applied to the hidden state (residual) of the LLM, as well as to the activations of the feed-forward components, aspects of the attention mechanism, and to the KV cache. The result is a quantized model where all matrix multiplications are performed in 4 bits, without any channels identified for retention in higher precision. Our 4-bit quantized LLaMa2-70B model has losses of at most 0.47 WikiText-2 perplexity and retains 99% of the zero-shot performance. We also show that QuaRot can provide lossless 6 and 8 bit LLaMa2 models without any calibration data using round-to-nearest quantization. Code is available at: https://github.com/spcl/QuaRot.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is often hindered by the extensive memory requirements of the Key-Value (KV) cache, especially as context lengths increase. Existing approaches to reduce the KV cache size involve either fine-tuning the model to learn a compression strategy or leveraging attention scores to reduce the sequence length. We analyse the attention distributions in decoder-only Transformers-based models and observe that attention allocation patterns stay consistent across most layers. Surprisingly, we find a clear correlation between the $L_2$ and the attention scores over cached KV pairs, where a low $L_2$ of a key embedding usually leads to a high attention score during decoding. This finding indicates that the influence of a KV pair is potentially determined by the key embedding itself before being queried. Based on this observation, we compress the KV cache based on the $L_2$ of key embeddings. Our experimental results show that this simple strategy can reduce the KV cache size by 50% on language modelling and needle-in-a-haystack tasks and 90% on passkey retrieval tasks without losing accuracy. Moreover, without relying on the attention scores, this approach remains compatible with FlashAttention, enabling broader applicability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Diffusion Model has not only garnered noteworthy achievements in the realm of image generation but has also demonstrated its potential as an effective pretraining method utilizing unlabeled data. Drawing from the extensive potential unveiled by the Diffusion Model in both semantic correspondence and open vocabulary segmentation, our work initiates an investigation into employing the Latent Diffusion Model for Few-shot Semantic Segmentation. Recently, inspired by the in-context learning ability of large language models, Few-shot Semantic Segmentation has evolved into In-context Segmentation tasks, morphing into a crucial element in assessing generalist segmentation models. In this context, we concentrate on Few-shot Semantic Segmentation, establishing a solid foundation for the future development of a Diffusion-based generalist model for segmentation. Our initial focus lies in understanding how to facilitate interaction between the query image and the support image, resulting in the proposal of a KV fusion method within the self-attention framework. Subsequently, we delve deeper into optimizing the infusion of information from the support mask and simultaneously re-evaluating how to provide reasonable supervision from the query mask. Based on our analysis, we establish a simple and effective framework named DiffewS, maximally retaining the original Latent Diffusion Model's generative framework and effectively utilizing the pre-training prior. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the previous SOTA models in multiple settings.

In designing algorithms, compilers, and systems, data movement is a common bottleneck in high-performance computation, in which we improve cache and memory performance. We study a special type of data reuse in the form of repeated traversals, or re-traversals, which are based on the symmetric group. The cyclic and sawtooth traces are previously known results in symmetric locality, and in this work, we would like to generalize this result for any re-traversal. Then, we also provide an abstract framework for applications in compiler design and machine learning models to improve the memory performance of certain programs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Key-Value (KV) caching is a common technique to enhance the computational efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs), but its memory overhead grows rapidly with input length. Prior work has shown that not all tokens are equally important for text generation, proposing layer-level KV cache compression to selectively retain key information. Recognizing the distinct roles of attention heads in generation, we propose HeadKV, a head-level KV cache compression method, and HeadKV-R2, which leverages a novel contextual reasoning ability estimation for compression. Our approach operates at the level of individual heads, estimating their importance for contextual QA tasks that require both retrieval and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks (LongBench, LooGLE), model architectures (e.g., Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct), and long-context abilities tests demonstrate that our head-level KV cache compression significantly outperforms strong baselines, particularly in low-resource settings (KV size = 64 & 128). Notably, our method retains just 1.5% of the KV cache while achieving 97% of the performance of the full KV cache on the contextual question answering benchmark.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the widespread deployment of long-context large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing demand for efficient support of high-throughput inference. However, as the key-value (KV) cache expands with the sequence length, the increasing memory footprint and the need to access it for each token generation both result in low throughput when serving long-context LLMs. While various dynamic sparse attention methods have been proposed to speed up inference while maintaining generation quality, they either fail to sufficiently reduce GPU memory consumption or introduce significant decoding latency by offloading the KV cache to the CPU. We present ShadowKV, a high-throughput long-context LLM inference system that stores the low-rank key cache and offloads the value cache to reduce the memory footprint for larger batch sizes and longer sequences. To minimize decoding latency, ShadowKV employs an accurate KV selection strategy that reconstructs minimal sparse KV pairs on-the-fly. By evaluating ShadowKV on a broad range of benchmarks, including RULER, LongBench, and Needle In A Haystack, and models like Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3-8B-1M, GLM-4-9B-1M, Yi-9B-200K, Phi-3-Mini-128K, and Qwen2-7B-128K, we demonstrate that it can support up to 6$\times$ larger batch sizes and boost throughput by up to 3.04$\times$ on an A100 GPU without sacrificing accuracy, even surpassing the performance achievable with infinite batch size under the assumption of infinite GPU memory.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Online paging is a fundamental problem in the field of online algorithms, in which one maintains a cache of $k$ slots as requests for fetching pages arrive online. In the weighted variant of this problem, each page has its own fetching cost; a substantial line of work on this problem culminated in an (optimal) $O(\log k)$-competitive randomized algorithm, due to Bansal, Buchbinder and Naor (FOCS'07).   Existing work for weighted paging assumes that page weights are known in advance, which is not always the case in practice. For example, in multi-level caching architectures, the expected cost of fetching a memory block is a function of its probability of being in a mid-level cache rather than the main memory. This complex property cannot be predicted in advance; over time, however, one may glean information about page weights through sampling their fetching cost multiple times.   We present the first algorithm for online weighted paging that does not know page weights in advance, but rather learns from weight samples. In terms of techniques, this requires providing (integral) samples to a fractional solver, requiring a delicate interface between this solver and the randomized rounding scheme; we believe that our work can inspire online algorithms to other problems that involve cost sampling.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Conventional wisdom holds that an efficient interface between an OS running on a CPU and a high-bandwidth I/O device should be based on Direct Memory Access (DMA), descriptor rings, and interrupts: DMA offloads transfers from the CPU, descriptor rings provide buffering and queuing, and interrupts facilitate asynchronous interaction between cores and device with a lightweight notification mechanism. In this paper we question this wisdom in the light of modern hardware and workloads, particularly in cloud servers. Like others before us, we argue that the assumptions that led to this model are obsolete, and in many use-cases use of Programmed I/O (PIO), where the CPU explicitly transfers data and control information to and from a device via loads and stores, actually results in a more efficient system. However, unlike others to date, we push this idea further and show, in a real implementation, the gains in average and tail latency for fine-grained communication achievable using an open cache-coherence protocol which exposes cache transitions to a smart device. We show this using three use-cases: fine-grained RPC-style invocation of functions on an accelerator, offloading of operators in a streaming dataflow engine, and a network interface targeting for serverless functions, comparing our use of coherence with both traditional DMA-style interaction and a highly-optimized implementation using PIO over PCI Express (PCIe).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) with long context windows have gained significant attention. However, the KV cache, stored to avoid re-computation, becomes a bottleneck. Various dynamic sparse or TopK-based attention approximation methods have been proposed to leverage the common insight that attention is sparse. In this paper, we first show that TopK attention itself suffers from quality degradation in certain downstream tasks because attention is not always as sparse as expected. Rather than selecting the keys and values with the highest attention scores, sampling with theoretical guarantees can provide a better estimation for attention output. To make the sampling-based approximation practical in LLM generation, we propose MagicPIG, a heterogeneous system based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). MagicPIG significantly reduces the workload of attention computation while preserving high accuracy for diverse tasks. MagicPIG stores the LSH hash tables and runs the attention computation on the CPU, which allows it to serve longer contexts and larger batch sizes with high approximation accuracy. MagicPIG can improve decoding throughput by $1.9\sim3.9\times$ across various GPU hardware and achieve 110ms decoding latency on a single RTX 4090 for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model with a context of 96k tokens.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper proposes Skip2-LoRA as a lightweight fine-tuning method for deep neural networks to address the gap between pre-trained and deployed models. In our approach, trainable LoRA (low-rank adaptation) adapters are inserted between the last layer and every other layer to enhance the network expressive power while keeping the backward computation cost low. This architecture is well-suited to cache intermediate computation results of the forward pass and then can skip the forward computation of seen samples as training epochs progress. We implemented the combination of the proposed architecture and cache, denoted as Skip2-LoRA, and tested it on a $15 single board computer. Our results show that Skip2-LoRA reduces the fine-tuning time by 90.0% on average compared to the counterpart that has the same number of trainable parameters while preserving the accuracy, while taking only a few seconds on the microcontroller board.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Autoregressive (AR) Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success across numerous tasks. However, the AR modeling paradigm presents certain limitations; for instance, contemporary autoregressive LLMs are trained to generate one token at a time, which can result in noticeable latency. Recent advances have indicated that search and repeated sampling can enhance performance in various applications, such as theorem proving, code generation, and alignment, by utilizing greater computational resources during inference. In this study, we demonstrate that diffusion language models are capable of generating at least 32 tokens simultaneously, while exceeding the performance of AR models in text quality and on the LAMBADA natural language understanding benchmark. This outcome is achieved through a novel distillation method for discrete diffusion models, which reduces the number of inference steps by a factor of 32-64. Practically, our models, even without caching, can generate tokens at a rate that is up to 8 times faster than AR models employing KV caching, and we anticipate further improvements with the inclusion of caching. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for diffusion language models with up to 860M parameters.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep learning models have become pivotal in the field of video processing and is increasingly critical in practical applications such as autonomous driving and object detection. Although Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated their power, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain a highly efficient and high-performance choice for feature extraction and encoding. However, the intensive computational demands of convolution operations hinder its broader adoption as a video encoder. Given the inherent temporal continuity in video frames, changes between consecutive frames are minimal, allowing for the skipping of redundant computations. This technique, which we term as Diff Computation, presents two primary challenges. First, Diff Computation requires to cache intermediate feature maps to ensure the correctness of non-linear computations, leading to significant memory consumption. Second, the imbalance of sparsity among layers, introduced by Diff Computation, incurs accuracy degradation. To address these issues, we propose a memory-efficient scheduling method to eliminate memory overhead and an online adjustment mechanism to minimize accuracy degradation. We integrate these techniques into our framework, SparseTem, to seamlessly support various CNN-based video encoders. SparseTem achieves speedup of 1.79x for EfficientDet and 4.72x for CRNN, with minimal accuracy drop and no additional memory overhead. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SparseTem sets a new state-of-the-art by effectively utilizing temporal continuity to accelerate CNN-based video encoders.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Training large transformers is slow, but recent innovations on GPU architecture give us an advantage. NVIDIA Ampere GPUs can execute a fine-grained 2:4 sparse matrix multiplication twice as fast as its dense equivalent. In the light of this property, we comprehensively investigate the feasibility of accelerating feed-forward networks (FFNs) of transformers in pre-training. First, we define a ``flip rate'' to monitor the stability of a 2:4 training process. Utilizing this metric, we propose three techniques to preserve accuracy: to modify the sparse-refined straight-through estimator by applying the masked decay term on gradients, to determine a feasible decay factor in warm-up stage, and to enhance the model's quality by a dense fine-tuning procedure near the end of pre-training. Besides, we devise two techniques to practically accelerate training: to calculate transposable 2:4 masks by convolution, and to accelerate gated activation functions by reducing GPU L2 cache miss. Experiments show that our 2:4 sparse training algorithm achieves similar convergence to dense training algorithms on several transformer pre-training tasks, while actual acceleration can be observed on different shapes of transformer block apparently.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Asymptotically tight lower bounds are derived for the Input/Output (I/O) complexity of a class of dynamic programming algorithms including matrix chain multiplication, optimal polygon triangulation, and the construction of optimal binary search trees. Assuming no recomputation of intermediate values, we establish an $\Omega\left(\frac{n^3}{\sqrt{M}B}\right)$ I/O lower bound, where $n$ denotes the size of the input and $M$ denotes the size of the available fast memory (cache). When recomputation is allowed, we show the same bound holds for $M < cn$, where $c$ is a positive constant. In the case where $M \ge 2n$, we show an $\Omega\left(n/B\right)$ I/O lower bound. We also discuss algorithms for which the number of executed I/O operations matches asymptotically each of the presented lower bounds, which are thus asymptotically tight.   Additionally, we refine our general method to obtain a lower bound for the I/O complexity of the Cocke-Younger-Kasami algorithm, where the size of the grammar impacts the I/O complexity. An upper bound with asymptotically matching performance in many cases is also provided.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Backhaul traffic congestion caused by the video traffic of a few popular files can be alleviated by storing the to-be-requested content at various levels in wireless video caching networks. Typically, content service providers (CSPs) own the content, and the users request their preferred content from the CSPs using their (wireless) internet service providers (ISPs). As these parties do not reveal their private information and business secrets, traditional techniques may not be readily used to predict the dynamic changes in users' future demands. Motivated by this, we propose a novel resource-aware hierarchical federated learning (RawHFL) solution for predicting user's future content requests. A practical data acquisition technique is used that allows the user to update its local training dataset based on its requested content. Besides, since networking and other computational resources are limited, considering that only a subset of the users participate in the model training, we derive the convergence bound of the proposed algorithm. Based on this bound, we minimize a weighted utility function for jointly configuring the controllable parameters to train the RawHFL energy efficiently under practical resource constraints. Our extensive simulation results validate the proposed algorithm's superiority, in terms of test accuracy and energy cost, over existing baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent research has shown that pre-trained vision-language models are effective at identifying out-of-distribution (OOD) samples by using negative labels as guidance. However, employing consistent negative labels across different OOD datasets often results in semantic misalignments, as these text labels may not accurately reflect the actual space of OOD images. To overcome this issue, we introduce \textit{adaptive negative proxies}, which are dynamically generated during testing by exploring actual OOD images, to align more closely with the underlying OOD label space and enhance the efficacy of negative proxy guidance. Specifically, our approach utilizes a feature memory bank to selectively cache discriminative features from test images, representing the targeted OOD distribution. This facilitates the creation of proxies that can better align with specific OOD datasets. While task-adaptive proxies average features to reflect the unique characteristics of each dataset, the sample-adaptive proxies weight features based on their similarity to individual test samples, exploring detailed sample-level nuances. The final score for identifying OOD samples integrates static negative labels with our proposed adaptive proxies, effectively combining textual and visual knowledge for enhanced performance. Our method is training-free and annotation-free, and it maintains fast testing speed. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, abbreviated as AdaNeg. Notably, on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark, our AdaNeg significantly outperforms existing methods, with a 2.45\% increase in AUROC and a 6.48\% reduction in FPR95.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present PSL, a lightweight, secure and stateful Function-as-a-Serivce (FaaS) framework for Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). The framework provides rich programming language support on heterogeneous TEE hardware for statically compiled binaries and/or WebAssembly (WASM) bytecodes, with a familiar Key-Value Store (KVS) interface to secure, performant, network-embedded storage. It achieves near-native execution speeds by utilizing the dynamic memory mapping capabilities of Intel SGX2 to create an in-enclave WASM runtime with Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. PSL is designed to efficiently operate within an asynchronous environment with a distributed tamper-proof confidential storage system, assuming minority failures. The system exchanges eventually-consistent state updates across nodes while utilizing release-consistent locking mechanisms to enhance transactional capabilities. The execution of PSL is up to 3.7x faster than the state-of-the-art SGX WASM runtime. PSL reaches 95k ops/s with YCSB 100% read workload and 89k ops/s with 50% read/write workload. We demonstrate the scalability and adaptivity of PSL through a case study of secure and distributed training of deep neural networks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper tackles the memory hurdle of processing long context sequences in Large Language Models (LLMs), by presenting a novel approach, Dropping In Convolutions for Long Context Compression (LoCoCo). LoCoCo employs only a fixed-size Key-Value (KV) cache, and can enhance efficiency in both inference and fine-tuning stages. Diverging from prior methods that selectively drop KV pairs based on heuristics, LoCoCo leverages a data-driven adaptive fusion technique, blending previous KV pairs with incoming tokens to minimize the loss of contextual information and ensure accurate attention modeling. This token integration is achieved through injecting one-dimensional convolutional kernels that dynamically calculate mixing weights for each KV cache slot. Designed for broad compatibility with existing LLM frameworks, LoCoCo allows for straightforward "drop-in" integration without needing architectural modifications, while incurring minimal tuning overhead. Experiments demonstrate that LoCoCo maintains consistently outstanding performance across various context lengths and can achieve a high context compression rate during both inference and fine-tuning phases. During inference, we successfully compressed up to 3482 tokens into a 128-size KV cache, while retaining comparable performance to the full sequence - an accuracy improvement of up to 0.2791 compared to baselines at the same cache size. During post-training tuning, we also effectively extended the context length from 4K to 32K using a KV cache of fixed size 512, achieving performance similar to fine-tuning with entire sequences.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Jailbreak attacks circumvent LLMs' built-in safeguards by concealing harmful queries within jailbreak prompts. While existing defenses primarily focus on mitigating the effects of jailbreak prompts, they often prove inadequate as jailbreak prompts can take arbitrary, adaptive forms. This paper presents RobustKV, a novel defense that adopts a fundamentally different approach by selectively removing critical tokens of harmful queries from key-value (KV) caches. Intuitively, for a jailbreak prompt to be effective, its tokens must achieve sufficient `importance' (as measured by attention scores), which inevitably lowers the importance of tokens in the concealed harmful query. Thus, by strategically evicting the KVs of the lowest-ranked tokens, RobustKV diminishes the presence of the harmful query in the KV cache, thus preventing the LLM from generating malicious responses. Extensive evaluation using benchmark datasets and models demonstrates that RobustKV effectively counters state-of-the-art jailbreak attacks while maintaining the LLM's general performance on benign queries. Moreover, RobustKV creates an intriguing evasiveness dilemma for adversaries, forcing them to balance between evading RobustKV and bypassing the LLM's built-in safeguards. This trade-off contributes to RobustKV's robustness against adaptive attacks. (warning: this paper contains potentially harmful content generated by LLMs.)

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) enhance the capabilities of standalone LLMs by integrating external data sources through API calls. In interactive LLM applications, efficient scheduling is crucial for maintaining low request completion times, directly impacting user engagement. However, these augmentations introduce scheduling challenges due to the need to manage limited memory for cached information (KV caches). As a result, traditional size-based scheduling algorithms, such as Shortest Job First (SJF), become less effective at minimizing completion times. Existing work focuses only on handling requests during API calls by preserving, discarding, or swapping memory without considering how to schedule requests with API calls. In this paper, we propose LAMPS, a novel LLM inference framework for augmented LLMs. LAMPS minimizes request completion time through a unified scheduling approach that considers the total length of requests and their handling strategies during API calls. Recognizing that LLM inference is memory-bound, our approach ranks requests based on their consumption of memory over time, which depends on both the output sizes and how a request is managed during its API calls. To implement our scheduling, LAMPS predicts the strategy that minimizes memory waste of a request during its API calls, aligning with but improving upon existing approaches. We also propose starvation prevention techniques and optimizations to mitigate the overhead of our scheduling. We implement LAMPS on top of vLLM and evaluate its performance against baseline LLM inference systems, demonstrating improvements in end-to-end latency by 27%-85% and reductions in TTFT by 4%-96% compared to the existing augmented-LLM system, with even greater gains over vLLM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LLMs are seeing growing use for applications which require large context windows, and with these large context windows KV cache activations surface as the dominant contributor to memory consumption during inference. Quantization is a promising approach for compressing KV cache activations; however, existing solutions fail to represent activations accurately in sub-4-bit precision. Our work, KVQuant, facilitates low precision KV cache quantization by incorporating several novel methods: (i) Per-Channel Key Quantization, where we adjust the dimension along which we quantize the Key activations to better match the distribution; (ii) Pre-RoPE Key Quantization, where we quantize Key activations before the rotary positional embedding to mitigate its impact on quantization; (iii) Non-Uniform KV Cache Quantization, where we derive per-layer sensitivity-weighted non-uniform datatypes that better represent the distributions; and (iv) Per-Vector Dense-and-Sparse Quantization, where we isolate outliers separately for each vector to minimize skews in quantization ranges. By applying our method to the LLaMA, Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral models, we achieve < 0.1 perplexity degradation with 3-bit quantization on both Wikitext-2 and C4, outperforming existing approaches. Our method enables serving LLaMA-7B with a context length of up to 1 million on a single A100-80GB GPU and up to 10 million on an 8-GPU system. We develop custom CUDA kernels for KVQuant, showing that we can achieve up to ~1.7x speedups, compared to baseline fp16 matrix-vector multiplications, for the LLaMA-7B model.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we present \textbf{\textit{FasterCache}}, a novel training-free strategy designed to accelerate the inference of video diffusion models with high-quality generation. By analyzing existing cache-based methods, we observe that \textit{directly reusing adjacent-step features degrades video quality due to the loss of subtle variations}. We further perform a pioneering investigation of the acceleration potential of classifier-free guidance (CFG) and reveal significant redundancy between conditional and unconditional features within the same timestep. Capitalizing on these observations, we introduce FasterCache to substantially accelerate diffusion-based video generation. Our key contributions include a dynamic feature reuse strategy that preserves both feature distinction and temporal continuity, and CFG-Cache which optimizes the reuse of conditional and unconditional outputs to further enhance inference speed without compromising video quality. We empirically evaluate FasterCache on recent video diffusion models. Experimental results show that FasterCache can significantly accelerate video generation (\eg 1.67$\times$ speedup on Vchitect-2.0) while keeping video quality comparable to the baseline, and consistently outperform existing methods in both inference speed and video quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has led to the adoption of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures that dynamically leverage specialized subnetworks for improved efficiency and performance. Despite their benefits, MoE models face significant challenges during inference, including inefficient memory management and suboptimal batching, due to misaligned design choices between the model architecture and the system policies. Furthermore, the conventional approach of training MoEs from scratch is increasingly prohibitive in terms of cost. In this paper, we propose a novel framework Read-ME that transforms pre-trained dense LLMs into smaller MoE models (in contrast to "upcycling" generalist MoEs), avoiding the high costs of ground-up training. Our approach employs activation sparsity to extract experts. To compose experts, we examine the widely-adopted layer-wise router design and show its redundancy, and thus we introduce the pre-gating router decoupled from the MoE backbone that facilitates system-friendly pre-computing and lookahead scheduling, enhancing expert-aware batching and caching. Our codesign therefore addresses critical gaps on both the algorithmic and system fronts, establishing a scalable and efficient alternative for LLM inference in resource-constrained settings. Read-ME outperforms other popular open-source dense models of similar scales, achieving improvements of up to 10.1% on MMLU, and improving mean end-to-end latency up to 6.1%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In-context learning (ICL) approaches typically leverage prompting to condition decoder-only language model generation on reference information. Just-in-time processing of a context is inefficient due to the quadratic cost of self-attention operations, and caching is desirable. However, caching transformer states can easily require almost as much space as the model parameters. When the right context isn't known in advance, caching ICL can be challenging. This work addresses these limitations by introducing models that, inspired by the encoder-decoder architecture, use cross-attention to condition generation on reference text without the prompt. More precisely, we leverage pre-trained decoder-only models and only train a small number of added layers. We use Question-Answering (QA) as a testbed to evaluate the ability of our models to perform conditional generation and observe that they outperform ICL, are comparable to fine-tuned prompted LLMs, and drastically reduce the space footprint relative to standard KV caching by two orders of magnitude.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly expanded model sizes, resulting in substantial GPU memory requirements during inference. The key and value storage of the attention map in the KV (key-value) cache accounts for more than 80\% of this memory consumption. Nowadays, most existing KV cache compression methods focus on intra-layer compression within a single Transformer layer but few works consider layer-wise compression. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play method called \textit{KVSharer}, which shares the KV cache between layers to achieve layer-wise compression. Rather than intuitively sharing based on higher similarity, we discover a counterintuitive phenomenon: sharing dissimilar KV caches better preserves the model performance. Experiments show that \textit{KVSharer} can reduce KV cache computation by 30\%, thereby lowering memory consumption without significantly impacting model performance and it can also achieve at least 1.3 times generation acceleration. Additionally, we verify that \textit{KVSharer} is compatible with existing intra-layer KV cache compression methods, and combining both can further save memory.

We explore and discuss some potential further enhancement for current state of the art methods for some key underlying technologies of generative AI models from algorithmic and probabilistic optimization perspective. In particular, we present an optimal solution for sub-word encoding (SWE) based on similar initial settings as that of byte-pair encoding (BPE) algorithm in [9] with similar objectives as that of WordPiece approach in [28, 31] to maximize the likelihood of the training data. We also present cross entropy optimization method to optimize hyperparameters for word2vec model [17]. In addition, we propose a factored combination of rotary positional encoding (RoPE) [32] and attention with linear biases (ALiBi) [23] with a harmonic series. We also present a probabilistic FlashAttention [6, 7] (PrFlashAttention) method with a probability distribution over block distances in the matrix to decide which block is likely to participate in a given round of attention computation while maintaining the lower triangle shape of the tensor for autoregressive language models by re-shaping the tensors. Finally, we present staircase adaptive quantization (SAQ) of key-value (KV) cache for multi-query attention (MQA) based on the framework presented in [16] to have gradual quantization degradation while achieving reasonable model quality and cost savings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Digital network twins (DNTs), by representing a physical network using a virtual model, offer significant benefits such as streamlined network development, enhanced productivity, and cost reduction for next-generation (nextG) communication infrastructure. Existing works mainly describe the deployment of DNT technologies in various service sections.The full life cycle of DNTs for telecommunication has not yet been comprehensively studied, particularly in the aspects of fine-grained creation, real-time adaptation, resource-efficient deployment, and security protection. This article presents an in-depth overview of DNTs, exploring their concrete integration into networks and communication, covering the fundamental designs, the emergent applications, and critical challenges in multiple dimensions. We also include two detailed case studies to illustrate how DNTs can be applied in real-world scenarios such as wireless traffic forecasting and edge caching. Additionally, a forward-looking vision of the research opportunities in tackling the challenges of DNTs is provided, aiming to fully maximize the benefits of DNTs in nextG networks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, academics and the corporate sector have paid attention to serverless computing, which enables dynamic scalability and an economic model. In serverless computing, users only pay for the time they actually use resources, enabling zero scaling to optimise cost and resource utilisation. However, this approach also introduces the serverless cold start problem. Researchers have developed various solutions to address the cold start problem, yet it remains an unresolved research area. In this article, we propose a systematic literature review on clod start latency in serverless computing. Furthermore, we create a detailed taxonomy of approaches to cold start latency, which we use to investigate existing techniques for reducing the cold start time and frequency. We have classified the current studies on cold start latency into several categories such as caching and application-level optimisation-based solutions, as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML)-based solutions. Moreover, we have analyzed the impact of cold start latency on quality of service, explored current cold start latency mitigation methods, datasets, and implementation platforms, and classified them into categories based on their common characteristics and features. Finally, we outline the open challenges and highlight the possible future directions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, while outperforming dense Large Language Models (LLMs) in terms of performance, face significant deployment challenges during inference due to their high memory demands. Existing offloading techniques, which involve swapping activated and idle experts between the GPU and CPU, often suffer from rigid expert caching mechanisms. These mechanisms fail to adapt to dynamic routing, leading to inefficient cache utilization, or incur prohibitive costs for prediction training. To tackle these inference-specific challenges, we introduce ExpertFlow, a comprehensive system specifically designed to enhance inference efficiency by accommodating flexible routing and enabling efficient expert scheduling between CPU and GPU. This reduces overhead and boosts system performance. Central to our approach is a predictive routing path-based offloading mechanism that utilizes a lightweight predictor to accurately forecast routing paths before computation begins. This proactive strategy allows for real-time error correction in expert caching, significantly increasing cache hit ratios and reducing the frequency of expert transfers, thereby minimizing I/O overhead. Additionally, we implement a dynamic token scheduling strategy that optimizes MoE inference by rearranging input tokens across different batches. This method not only reduces the number of activated experts per batch but also improves computational efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ExpertFlow achieves up to 93.72\% GPU memory savings and enhances inference speed by 2 to 10 times compared to baseline methods, highlighting its effectiveness and utility as a robust solution for resource-constrained inference scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformers can capture long-range dependencies using self-attention, allowing tokens to attend to all others directly. However, stacking multiple attention layers leads to attention concentration. One natural way to address this issue is to use cross-layer attention, allowing information from earlier layers to be directly accessible to later layers. However, this approach is computationally expensive. To address this problem, we propose Transformer with residual value (ResFormer) which approximates cross-layer attention through adding a residual connection from the values of the the first layer to all subsequent layers. Based on this method, one variant is the Transformer with single layer value (SVFormer), where all layers share the same value embedding from first layer, reducing the KV cache by nearly 50%. Comprehensive empirical evidence demonstrates that ResFormer mitigates attention concentration problem in deeper layers and enhances representation across most layers, outperforming the vanilla Transformer, DenseFormer, and NeuTRENO in training error as well as downstream tasks. SVFormer trains significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer and performs better than other methods like GQA and CLA, with performance influenced by sequence length and cumulative learning rate.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We formally introduce a systematic (de/re)-composition approach, based on the algebraic formalism of "Multi-Dimensional Homomorphisms (MDHs)". Our approach is designed as general enough to be applicable to a wide range of data-parallel computations and for various kinds of target parallel architectures. To efficiently target the deep and complex memory and core hierarchies of contemporary architectures, we exploit our introduced (de/re)-composition approach for a correct-by-construction, parametrized cache blocking and parallelization strategy. We show that our approach is powerful enough to express, in the same formalism, the (de/re)-composition strategies of different classes of state-of-the-art approaches (scheduling-based, polyhedral, etc), and we demonstrate that the parameters of our strategies enable systematically generating code that can be fully automatically optimized (auto-tuned) for the particular target architecture and characteristics of the input and output data (e.g., their sizes and memory layouts). Particularly, our experiments confirm that via auto-tuning, we achieve higher performance than state-of-the-art approaches, including hand-optimized solutions provided by vendors (such as NVIDIA cuBLAS/cuDNN and Intel oneMKL/oneDNN), on real-world data sets and for a variety of data-parallel computations, including: linear algebra routines, stencil and quantum chemistry computations, data mining algorithms, and computations that recently gained high attention due to their relevance for deep learning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Chain of Thought (CoT) of multi-step benefits from the logical structure of the reasoning steps and task-specific actions, significantly enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models. As the prevalence of long CoT, the number of reasoning steps exceeds manageable token limits and leads to higher computational demands. Inspired by the fundamental logic of human cognition, ``derive, then reduce'', we conceptualize the standard multi-step CoT as a novel Markov Chain of Thought (MCoT). In this study, we consider the mathematical reasoning task, defining each reasoning step as text accompanied by a Python code snippet. To facilitate a longer reasoning path, self-correction is enabled through interactions with the code interpreter. Our MCoT aims to compress previous reasoning steps into a simplified question, enabling efficient next-step inference without relying on a lengthy KV cache. In our experiments, we curate the \texttt{MCoTInstruct} dataset, and the empirical results indicate that MCoT not only significantly enhances efficiency but also maintains comparable accuracy. While much remains to be explored, this work paves the way for exploring the long CoT reasoning abilities of LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a process where a large language model (LLM) retrieves useful information from a database and then generates the responses. It is becoming popular in enterprise settings for daily business operations. For example, Copilot for Microsoft 365 has accumulated millions of businesses. However, the security implications of adopting such RAG-based systems are unclear.   In this paper, we introduce ConfusedPilot, a class of security vulnerabilities of RAG systems that confuse Copilot and cause integrity and confidentiality violations in its responses. First, we investigate a vulnerability that embeds malicious text in the modified prompt in RAG, corrupting the responses generated by the LLM. Second, we demonstrate a vulnerability that leaks secret data, which leverages the caching mechanism during retrieval. Third, we investigate how both vulnerabilities can be exploited to propagate misinformation within the enterprise and ultimately impact its operations, such as sales and manufacturing. We also discuss the root cause of these attacks by investigating the architecture of a RAG-based system. This study highlights the security vulnerabilities in today's RAG-based systems and proposes design guidelines to secure future RAG-based systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, their massive parameter counts and associated extensive computing make LLMs' deployment the main part of carbon emission from nowadays AI applications. Compared to modern GPUs like H$100$, it would be significantly carbon-sustainable if we could leverage old-fashioned GPUs such as M$40$ (as shown in Figure 1, M$40$ only has one third carbon emission of H$100$'s) for LLM servings. However, the limited High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) available on such GPU often cannot support the loading of LLMs due to the gigantic model size and intermediate activation data, making their serving challenging. For instance, a LLaMA2 model with $70$B parameters typically requires $128$GB for inference, which substantially surpasses $24$GB HBM in a $3090$ GPU and remains infeasible even considering the additional $64$GB DRAM. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a mixed-precision with a model modularization algorithm to enable LLM inference on outdated hardware with resource constraints. (The precision denotes the numerical precision like FP16, INT8, INT4) and multi-level caching (M2Cache).)   Specifically, our M2Cache first modulizes neurons in LLM and creates their importance ranking. Then, it adopts a dynamic sparse mixed-precision quantization mechanism in weight space to reduce computational demands and communication overhead at each decoding step. It collectively lowers the operational carbon emissions associated with LLM inference. Moreover, M2Cache introduces a three-level cache management system with HBM, DRAM, and SSDs that complements the dynamic sparse mixed-precision inference. To enhance communication efficiency, M2Cache maintains a neuron-level mixed-precision LRU cache in HBM, a larger layer-aware cache in DRAM, and a full model in SSD.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Given a Large Language Model (LLM) generation, how can we identify which training data led to this generation? In this paper, we proposed RapidIn, a scalable framework adapting to LLMs for estimating the influence of each training data. The proposed framework consists of two stages: caching and retrieval. First, we compress the gradient vectors by over 200,000x, allowing them to be cached on disk or in GPU/CPU memory. Then, given a generation, RapidIn efficiently traverses the cached gradients to estimate the influence within minutes, achieving over a 6,326x speedup. Moreover, RapidIn supports multi-GPU parallelization to substantially accelerate caching and retrieval. Our empirical result confirms the efficiency and effectiveness of RapidIn.

Under the hood, language models support this by running an autoregressive inference pass to provide a draft. Consequently, providing $k$ drafts to the user requires running an expensive language model $k$ times. To alleviate the computation cost of running $k$ inference passes, we propose Superposed Decoding, a new decoding algorithm that generates $k$ drafts at the computation cost of one autoregressive inference pass. We achieve this by feeding a superposition of the most recent token embeddings from the $k$ drafts as input to the next decoding step of the language model. At every inference step we combine the $k$ drafts with the top-$k$ tokens to get $k^2$ new drafts and cache the $k$ most likely options, using an n-gram interpolation with minimal compute overhead to filter out incoherent generations. Our experiments show that $k$ drafts from Superposed Decoding are at least as coherent and factual as Nucleus Sampling and Greedy Decoding respectively, while being at least $2.44\times$ faster for $k\ge3$. In a compute-normalized setting, user evaluations demonstrably favor text generated by Superposed Decoding over Nucleus Sampling. Superposed Decoding can also be combined with other decoding strategies, resulting in universal coverage gains when scaling inference time compute.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> More than 3 kV breakdown voltage was demonstrated in monolithic bidirectional GaN HEMTs for the first time having potential applications in 1200V or 1700V-class novel power converters. The on resistance of the fabricated transistors was ~20 ohm.mm or ~11 mili ohm.cm^2. Breakdown voltage was optimized by utilizing two field plates in either side of the transistor and optimizing their geometry. Shorter first field plate lengths (less than 2 micron) resulted in higher breakdown voltage and the possible reason for this was discussed. The transistors had a steep subthreshold swing of 92 mV / dec. The on/off ratio was greater than 10^5 and it was limited by the tool capacity. The fabricated 3 kV transistor was benchmarked against the state-of-the-art monolithic bidirectional GaN HEMTs in the performance matrices of breakdown voltage and on resistance, that showed crucial progress.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As the use of large language models (LLMs) expands rapidly, so does the range of knowledge needed to supplement various LLM queries. Thus, enabling flexible and efficient injection of new knowledge in LLM inference is critical. Three high-level options exist: (i) embedding the knowledge in LLM's weights (i.e., fine-tuning), (ii) including the knowledge as a part of LLM's text input (i.e., in-context learning), or (iii) injecting the KV caches of the new knowledge to LLM during prefill. This paper argues that, although fine-tuning and in-context learning are popular, using KV caches as the medium of knowledge could simultaneously enable more modular management of knowledge injection and more efficient LLM serving with low cost and fast response. To realize these benefits, we envision a Knowledge Delivery Network (KDN), a new system component in LLM services that dynamically optimizes the storage, transfer, and composition of KV cache across LLM engines and other compute and storage resources. We believe that, just like content delivery networks (CDNs), such as Akamai, enabled the success of the Internet ecosystem through their efficient data delivery, KDNs will be critical to the success of LLM applications through their efficient knowledge delivery. We have open-sourced a KDN prototype at https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We report our experience formally modelling and verifying CXL.cache, the inter-device cache coherence protocol of the Compute Express Link standard. We have used the Isabelle proof assistant to create a formal model for CXL.cache based on the prose English specification. This led to us identifying and proposing fixes to several problems we identified as unclear, ambiguous or inaccurate, some of which could lead to incoherence if left unfixed. Nearly all our issues and proposed fixes have been confirmed and tentatively accepted by the CXL consortium for adoption, save for one which is still under discussion. To validate the faithfulness of our model we performed scenario verification of essential restrictions such as "Snoop-pushes-GO", and produced a fully mechanised proof of a coherence property of the model. The considerable size of this proof, comprising tens of thousands of lemmas, prompted us to develop new proof automation tools, which we have made available for other Isabelle users working with similarly cumbersome proofs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cache-assisted ultra-dense mobile edge computing (MEC) networks are a promising solution for meeting the increasing demands of numerous Internet-of-Things mobile devices (IMDs). To address the complex interferences caused by small base stations (SBSs) deployed densely in such networks, this paper explores the combination of orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and base station (BS) clustering. Additionally, security measures are introduced to protect IMDs' tasks offloaded to BSs from potential eavesdropping and malicious attacks. As for such a network framework, a computation offloading scheme is proposed to minimize IMDs' energy consumption while considering constraints such as delay, power, computing resources, and security costs, optimizing channel selections, task execution decisions, device associations, power controls, security service assignments, and computing resource allocations. To solve the formulated problem efficiently, we develop a further improved hierarchical adaptive search (FIHAS) algorithm, giving some insights into its parallel implementation, computation complexity, and convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can achieve lower total energy consumption and delay compared to other algorithms when strict latency and cost constraints are imposed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> KV cache compression methods have mainly relied on scalar quantization techniques to reduce the memory requirements during decoding. In this work, we apply residual vector quantization, which has been widely used for high fidelity audio compression, to compress KV cache in large language models (LLM). We adapt the standard recipe with minimal changes to compress the output of any key or value projection matrix in a pretrained LLM: we scale the vector by its standard deviation, divide channels into groups and then quantize each group with the same residual vector quantizer. We learn the codebook using exponential moving average and there are no other learnable parameters including the input and output projections normally used in a vector quantization set up. We find that a residual depth of 8 recovers most of the performance of the unquantized model. We also find that grouping non-contiguous channels together works better than grouping contiguous channels for compressing key matrix and the method further benefits from a light weight finetuning of LLM together with the quantization. Overall, the proposed technique is competitive with existing quantization methods while being much simpler and results in 5.5x compression compared to half precision.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Model quantization has become a crucial technique to address the issues of large memory consumption and long inference times associated with LLMs. Mixed-precision quantization, which distinguishes between important and unimportant parameters, stands out among numerous quantization schemes as it achieves a balance between precision and compression rate. However, existing approaches can only identify important parameters through qualitative analysis and manual experiments without quantitatively analyzing how their importance is determined. We propose a new criterion, so-called 'precision alignment', to build a quantitative framework to holistically evaluate the importance of parameters in mixed-precision quantization. Our observations on floating point addition under various real-world scenarios suggest that two addends should have identical precision, otherwise the information in the higher-precision number will be wasted. Such an observation offers an essential principle to determine the precision of each parameter in matrix multiplication operation. As the first step towards applying the above discovery to large model inference, we develop a dynamic KV-Cache quantization technique to effectively reduce memory access latency. Different from existing quantization approaches that focus on memory saving, this work directly aims to accelerate LLM inference through quantifying floating numbers. The proposed technique attains a 25% saving of memory access and delivers up to 1.3x speedup in the computation of attention in the decoding phase of LLM, with almost no loss of precision.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work presents WarmSwap, a novel provider-side cold-start optimization for serverless computing. This optimization reduces cold-start time when booting and loading dependencies at runtime inside a function container. Previous approaches to the optimization of cold starts tend to fall into two categories: optimizing the infrastructure of serverless computing to benefit all serverless functions; or function-specific tuning for individual serverless functions. In contrast, WarmSwap offers a broad middle ground, which optimizes entire categories of serverless functions. WarmSwap eliminates the need to initialize middleware or software dependencies when launching a new serverless container, by migrating a pre-initialized live dependency image to the new function instance. WarmSwap respects the provider's cache constraints, as a single pre-warmed dependency image in the cache is shared among all serverless functions requiring that software dependency image. WarmSwap has been tested on seven representative functions from FunctionBench. In those tests, WarmSwap accelerates dependency loading for serverless functions with large dependency requirements by a factor ranging from 2.2 to 3.2. Simulation experiments using Azure traces indicate that WarmSwap can save 88\% of optimization space when sharing a dependency image among ten different functions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing use of Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) in computer architecture has brought about new challenges, one of which is the write endurance problem. Frequent writes to a particular cache cell in NVM can lead to degradation of the memory cell and reduce its lifespan. To solve this problem, we propose a sample-based blocking technique for the Last Level Cache (LLC). Our approach involves defining a threshold value and sampling a subset of cache sets. If the number of writes to a way in a sampled set exceeds the threshold, the way is blocked, and writes are redirected to other ways. We also maintain a history structure to record the number of writes in a set and a PC-Table to use for blocking in unsampled sets. Based on blocking on sampled sets, variance of values stored in history is used to determine whether blocking had a positive impact or not, and on this basis, value corresponding to instruction pointer is incremented or decremented. This value is later used for blocking in unsampled sets. Our results show that our approach significantly balances write traffic to the cache and improves the overall lifespan of the memory cells while having better performance to the base-line system. Our approach can also be applied to other cache hierarchies and NVM technologies to mitigate the problem of write endurance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are critical for a wide range of applications, but serving them efficiently becomes increasingly challenging as inputs become more complex. Context caching improves serving performance by exploiting inter-request dependency and reusing key-value (KV) cache across requests, thus improving time-to-first-token (TTFT). However, existing prefix-based context caching requires exact token prefix matches, limiting cache reuse in few-shot learning, multi-document QA, or retrieval-augmented generation, where prefixes may vary. In this paper, we present EPIC, an LLM serving system that introduces position-independent context caching (PIC), enabling modular KV cache reuse regardless of token chunk position (or prefix). EPIC features two key designs: AttnLink, which leverages static attention sparsity to minimize recomputation for accuracy recovery, and KVSplit, a customizable chunking method that preserves semantic coherence. Our experiments demonstrate that Epic delivers up to 8x improvements in TTFT and 7x throughput over existing systems, with negligible or no accuracy loss. By addressing the limitations of traditional caching approaches, Epic enables more scalable and efficient LLM inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models have revolutionized data processing in numerous domains, with their ability to handle extended context reasoning receiving notable recognition. To speed up inference, maintaining a key-value (KV) cache memory is essential. Nonetheless, the growing demands for KV cache memory create significant hurdles for efficient implementation. This work introduces a novel architecture, Cross-Layer Latent Attention (CLLA), aimed at compressing the KV cache to less than 2% of its original size while maintaining comparable performance levels. CLLA integrates multiple aspects of KV cache compression, including attention head/dimension reduction, layer sharing, and quantization techniques, into a cohesive framework. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CLLA achieves lossless performance on most tasks while utilizing minimal KV cache, marking a significant advancement in practical KV cache compression.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> It is natural to generalize the online $k$-Server problem by allowing each request to specify not only a point $p$, but also a subset $S$ of servers that may serve it. For uniform metrics, the problem is equivalent to a generalization of Paging in which each request specifies not only a page $p$, but also a subset $S$ of cache slots, and is satisfied by having a copy of $p$ in some slot in $S$. We call this problem Slot-Heterogenous Paging.   We parameterize the problem by specifying a family $\mathcal S \subseteq 2^{[k]}$ of requestable slot sets, and we establish bounds on the competitive ratio as a function of the cache size $k$ and family $\mathcal S$:   - If all request sets are allowed ($\mathcal S=2^{[k]}\setminus\{\emptyset\}$), the optimal deterministic and randomized competitive ratios are exponentially worse than for standard \Paging ($\mathcal S=\{[k]\}$).   - As a function of $|\mathcal S|$ and $k$, the optimal deterministic ratio is polynomial: at most $O(k^2|\mathcal S|)$ and at least $\Omega(\sqrt{|\mathcal S|})$.   - For any laminar family $\mathcal S$ of height $h$, the optimal ratios are $O(hk)$ (deterministic) and $O(h^2\log k)$ (randomized).   - The special case of laminar $\mathcal S$ that we call All-or-One Paging extends standard Paging by allowing each request to specify a specific slot to put the requested page in. The optimal deterministic ratio for weighted All-or-One Paging is $\Theta(k)$. Offline All-or-One Paging is NP-hard.   Some results for the laminar case are shown via a reduction to the generalization of Paging in which each request specifies a set $\mathcal P of pages, and is satisfied by fetching any page from $\mathcal P into the cache. The optimal ratios for the latter problem (with laminar family of height $h$) are at most $hk$ (deterministic) and $h\,H_k$ (randomized).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The KV-Cache technique has become the standard for the inference of large language models (LLMs). It caches states of self-attention to avoid recomputation. Yet, it is widely criticized that KV-Cache can become a bottleneck of the LLM inference system, especially when confronted with ultra-large models and long-context queries. A natural remedy is to discard the KV-Cache for less important tokens, with StreamingLLM as an example, but the used static eviction strategies cannot flexibly adapt to varying contexts. Remedies like H2O leverage accumulative attention scores to perform dynamic eviction but suffer from the attention bias issue in capturing contextual information. This paper bridges this gap by devising a parameterized KV-Cache eviction mechanism, dubbed as Attention-Gate, which accepts the whole context as input and yields eviction flags for each token to realize in-context eviction. The subsequent self-attention module proceeds according to the flags and only the KV states for the remaining tokens need to be cached. The Attention-Gates can vary among different heads and layers and be trivially plugged into pre-trained LLMs, tuned by cost-effective continual pre-training or supervised fine-tuning objectives to acquire what to discard. The computational and memory overhead introduced by Attention-Gates is minimal. Our method is validated across multiple tasks, demonstrating both efficiency and adaptability. After a highly efficient continual pre-training, it achieves higher average accuracy and evicts more tokens compared to traditional training-free methods. In supervised fine-tuning, it not only evicts many tokens but also outperforms LoRA-finetuned LLMs on some datasets, such as RTE, where it improves accuracy by 13.9% while evicting 62.8% of tokens, showing that effective eviction of redundant tokens can even enhance performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to process long-context tasks. However, the large memory overhead of the key-value (KV) cache poses significant challenges in long-context scenarios. Existing training-free KV cache compression methods typically focus on quantization and token pruning, which have compression limits, and excessive sparsity can lead to severe performance degradation. Other methods design new architectures with less KV overhead but require significant training overhead. To address the above two drawbacks, we further explore the redundancy in the channel dimension and apply an architecture-level design with minor training costs. Therefore, we introduce CSKV, a training-efficient Channel Shrinking technique for KV cache compression: (1) We first analyze the singular value distribution of the KV cache, revealing significant redundancy and compression potential along the channel dimension. Based on this observation, we propose using low-rank decomposition for key and value layers and storing the low-dimension features. (2) To preserve model performance, we introduce a bi-branch KV cache, including a window-based full-precision KV cache and a low-precision compressed KV cache. (3) To reduce the training costs, we minimize the layer-wise reconstruction loss for the compressed KV cache instead of retraining the entire LLMs. Extensive experiments show that CSKV can reduce the memory overhead of the KV cache by 80% while maintaining the model's long-context capability. Moreover, we show that our method can be seamlessly combined with quantization to further reduce the memory overhead, achieving a compression ratio of up to 95%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurately retrieving relevant bid keywords for user queries is critical in Sponsored Search but remains challenging, particularly for short, ambiguous queries. Existing dense and generative retrieval models often fail to capture nuanced user intent in these cases. To address this, we propose an approach to enhance query understanding by augmenting queries with rich contextual signals derived from web search results and large language models, stored in an online cache. Specifically, we use web search titles and snippets to ground queries in real-world information and utilize GPT-4 to generate query rewrites and explanations that clarify user intent. These signals are efficiently integrated through a Fusion-in-Decoder based Unity architecture, enabling both dense and generative retrieval with serving costs on par with traditional context-free models. To address scenarios where context is unavailable in the cache, we introduce context glancing, a curriculum learning strategy that improves model robustness and performance even without contextual signals during inference. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that our context-aware approach substantially outperforms context-free models. Furthermore, online A/B testing on a prominent search engine across 160+ countries shows significant improvements in user engagement and revenue.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, sharing key-value (KV) cache across layers has been found effective in efficient inference of large language models (LLMs). To systematically investigate different techniques of cross-layer KV sharing, we propose a unified framework that covers several recent methods and their novel variants. We conduct comprehensive experiments on all the configurations of the framework, evaluating their generation throughput and performance in language modeling and downstream tasks. We find that when reducing the size of the KV cache by 2x, most configurations can achieve competitive performance to and higher throughput than standard transformers, but when further reducing the size of the KV cache, pairing queries of all layers with KVs of upper layers can better maintain performance, although it also introduces additional training cost and prefilling latency. We hope that this work will help users choose the appropriate approach according to their requirements and facilitate research on the acceleration of LLM inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) embed extensive knowledge and utilize it to perform exceptionally well across various tasks. Nevertheless, outdated knowledge or factual errors within LLMs can lead to misleading or incorrect responses, causing significant issues in practical applications. To rectify the fatal flaw without the necessity for costly model retraining, various model editing approaches have been proposed to correct inaccurate knowledge within LLMs in a cost-efficient way. To evaluate these model editing methods, previous work introduced a series of datasets. However, most of the previous datasets only contain fabricated data in a single format, which diverges from real-world model editing scenarios, raising doubts about their usability in practice. To facilitate the application of model editing in real-world scenarios, we propose the challenge of practicality. To resolve such challenges and effectively enhance the capabilities of LLMs, we present FAME, an factual, comprehensive, and multi-task dataset, which is designed to enhance the practicality of model editing. We then propose SKEME, a model editing method that uses a novel caching mechanism to ensure synchronization with the real world. The experiments demonstrate that SKEME performs excellently across various tasks and scenarios, confirming its practicality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) multicore processors have advanced memory hierarchies that enhance memory-level parallelism (MLP), which is crucial for high performance. To support high MLP, shared last-level caches (LLCs) are divided into multiple banks, allowing parallel access. However, uneven distribution of cache requests from the cores, especially when requests from multiple cores are concentrated on a single bank, can result in significant contention affecting all cores that access the cache. Such cache bank contention can even be maliciously induced -- known as cache bank-aware denial-of-service (DoS) attacks -- in order to jeopardize the system's timing predictability.   In this paper, we propose a per-bank bandwidth regulation approach for multi-banked shared LLC based multicore real-time systems. By regulating bandwidth on a per-bank basis, the approach aims to prevent unnecessary throttling of cache accesses to non-contended banks, thus improving overall performance (throughput) without compromising isolation benefits of throttling. We implement our approach on a RISC-V system-on-chip (SoC) platform using FireSim and evaluate extensively using both synthetic and real-world workloads. Our evaluation results show that the proposed per-bank regulation approach effectively protects real-time tasks from co-running cache bank-aware DoS attacks, and offers up to a 3.66$\times$ performance improvement for the throttled benign best-effort tasks compared to prior bank-oblivious bandwidth throttling approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have extended their capabilities to handle long contexts. However, increasing the number of model layers and the length of input sequences significantly escalates the memory required to store key-value (KV) cache, posing challenges for efficient inference. To mitigate this issue, we present SimLayerKV, a simple yet effective method that reduces inter-layer KV cache redundancies by selectively dropping cache in identified lazy layers. Our approach is based on the observation that certain layers in long-context LLMs exhibit "lazy" behavior, contributing less to modeling long-range dependencies compared to non-lazy layers. By analyzing attention weight patterns, we find that the behavior of these lazy layers is consistent across tokens during generation for a given input. This insight motivates our SimLayerKV, which identifies lazy layers and reduces their KV cache accordingly. SimLayerKV is training-free, generalizable, and can be implemented with only seven lines of code. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative LLMs, e.g., LLaMA2-7B, LLaMA3-8B, and Mistral-7B across 16 tasks from the LongBench benchmark. The results demonstrate that SimLayerKV achieves a KV cache compression ratio of 5$\times$ with only a 1.2% performance drop when combined with 4-bit quantization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce Block-Attention, an attention mechanism designed to address the increased inference latency and cost in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios. Traditional approaches often encode the entire context. Instead, Block-Attention divides retrieved documents into discrete blocks, with each block independently calculating key-value (KV) states except for the final block. In RAG scenarios, by defining each passage as a block, Block-Attention enables us to reuse the KV states of passages that have been seen before, thereby significantly reducing the latency and the computation overhead during inference. The implementation of Block-Attention involves block segmentation, position re-encoding, and fine-tuning the LLM to adapt to the Block-Attention mechanism. Experiments on four RAG benchmarks demonstrate that after block fine-tuning, the Block-Attention model achieves performance comparable to self-attention models (68.4\% vs 67.9\% on Llama3) or even superior performance (62.8\% vs 59.6\% on Mistral). Notably, Block-Attention significantly reduces the time to first token (TTFT) and floating point operations (FLOPs) to a very low level. It only takes 45 ms to output the first token for an input sequence with a total length of 32K. Compared to the self-attention models, the time consumption and corresponding FLOPs are reduced by 98.7\% and 99.8\%, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Processing long contexts remains a challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to the quadratic computational and memory overhead of the self-attention mechanism and the substantial KV cache sizes during generation. We propose LLoCO, a novel approach to address this problem by learning contexts offline through context compression and in-domain parameter-efficient finetuning with LoRA. Our method enables an LLM to create a concise representation of the original context and efficiently retrieve relevant information to answer questions accurately. Our approach extends the effective context window of a 4k token LLaMA2-7B model to handle up to 128k tokens. We evaluate our approach on several long-context question-answering datasets, demonstrating that LLoCO significantly outperforms in-context learning while using $30\times$ fewer tokens during inference. LLoCO achieves up to $7.62\times$ speed-up during inference and $11.52\times$ higher throughput during finetuning, substantially reduces the cost of long document question answering. This makes it a promising solution for efficient long context processing. Our code is publicly available on https://github.com/jeffreysijuntan/lloco.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the rapidly evolving domain of high-performance computing (HPC), heterogeneous architectures such as the SX-Aurora TSUBASA (SX-AT) system architecture, which integrate diverse processor types, present both opportunities and challenges for optimizing resource utilization. This paper investigates workload interference within an SX-AT system, with a specific focus on resource contention between Vector Hosts (VHs) and Vector Engines (VEs). Through comprehensive empirical analysis, the study identifies key factors contributing to performance degradation, such as cache and memory bandwidth contention, when jobs with varying computational demands share resources. To address these issues, we develop a predictive model that leverages hardware performance counters (HCs) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to classify and predict workload interference. Our results demonstrate that the model accurately forecasts performance degradation, offering valuable insights for future research on optimizing job scheduling and resource allocation. This approach highlights the importance of adaptive resource management strategies in maintaining system efficiency and provides a foundation for future enhancements in heterogeneous supercomputing environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models have shown exceptional capabilities in a wide range of tasks, such as text generation and video generation, among others. However, due to their massive parameter count, these models often require substantial storage space, imposing significant constraints on the machines deploying LLMs. To overcome this limitation, one research direction proposes to compress the models using integer replacements for floating-point numbers, in a process known as Quantization. Some recent studies suggest quantizing the key and value cache (KV Cache) of LLMs, and designing quantization techniques that treat the key and value matrices equivalently.   This work delves deeper into the asymmetric structural roles of KV Cache, a phenomenon where the transformer's output loss is more sensitive to the quantization of key matrices. We conduct a systematic examination of the attention output error resulting from key and value quantization. The phenomenon inspires us to propose an asymmetric quantization strategy. Our approach allows for 1-bit quantization of the KV cache by implementing distinct configurations for key and value matrices. We carry out experiments across a variety of datasets, demonstrating that our proposed model allows for the quantization of up to 75% decoder layers with 1 bit, while simultaneously maintaining performance levels comparable to those of the models with floating parameters.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The input data pipeline is an essential component of each machine learning (ML) training job. It is responsible for reading massive amounts of training data, processing batches of samples using complex transformations, and loading them onto training nodes at low latency and high throughput. Performant input data systems are becoming increasingly critical, driven by skyrocketing data volumes and training throughput demands. Unfortunately, current input data systems cannot fully leverage key performance optimizations, resulting in hugely inefficient infrastructures that require significant resources - or worse - underutilize expensive accelerators.   To address these demands, we present cedar, an optimized and unified programming framework for ML input data pipelines. cedar allows users to define input data pipelines using composable operators that support arbitrary ML frameworks and libraries. cedar introduces an extensible optimizer that systematically applies a complex combination of optimizations (e.g., offloading, caching, prefetching, fusion, and reordering). It orchestrates processing across a customizable set of local and distributed compute resources in order to improve processing performance and efficiency, all without user input. Across eight pipelines, cedar improves performance by up to 1.87x to 10.65x compared to state-of-the-art input data systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Trusted hardware's freshness guarantee ensures that an adversary cannot replay an old value in response to a memory read request. They rely on maintaining a version number for each cache block and ensuring their integrity using a Merkle tree. However, these existing solutions protect only a small amount of main memory (few MBs), as the extraneous memory accesses to the Merkle tree increase prohibitively with the protected memory size. We present Toleo, which uses trusted smart memory connected through a secure CXL IDE network to safely store version numbers. Toleo eliminates the need for an unscalable Merkle tree to protect the integrity of version numbers by instead using smart memory as the root of trust. Additionally, Toleo ensures version confidentiality which enables stealth versions that reduce the version storage overhead in half.   Furthermore, in the absence of Merkle tree imposed constraints, we effectively exploit version locality at page granularity to compress version number by a factor of 240. These space optimizations make it feasible for one 168 GB Toleo smart memory device to provide freshness to a 28 TB CXL-expanded main memory pool in a rack server for a negligible performance overhead. We analyze the benefits of Toleo using several privacy-sensitive genomics, graph, generative AI, and database workloads.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As the use of web browsers continues to grow, the potential for cybercrime and web-related criminal activities also increases. Digital forensic investigators must understand how different browsers function and the critical areas to consider during web forensic analysis. Web forensics, a subfield of digital forensics, involves collecting and analyzing browser artifacts, such as browser history, search keywords, and downloads, which serve as potential evidence. While existing research has provided valuable insights, many studies focus on individual browsing modes or limited forensic scenarios, leaving gaps in understanding the full scope of data retention and recovery across different modes and browsers. This paper addresses these gaps by defining four browsing scenarios and critically analyzing browser artifacts across normal, private, and portable modes using various forensic tools. We define four browsing scenarios to perform a comprehensive evaluation of popular browsers -- Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Brave, Tor, and Microsoft Edge -- by monitoring changes in key data storage areas such as cache files, cookies, browsing history, and local storage across different browsing modes. Overall, this paper contributes to a deeper understanding of browser forensic analysis and identifies key areas for enhancing privacy protection and forensic methodologies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Auto-regressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across domanins such as vision and language processing. However, due to sequential processing through a stack of transformer layers, autoregressive decoding faces significant computation/latency challenges, particularly in resource constrained environments like mobile and edge devices. Existing approaches in literature that aim to improve latency via skipping layers have two distinct flavors - 1) Early exit 2) Input-agnostic heuristics where tokens exit at pre-determined layers irrespective of input sequence. Both the above strategies have limitations - the former cannot be applied to handle KV Caching necessary for speed-ups in modern framework and the latter does not capture the variation in layer importance across tasks or more generally, across input sequences. To address both limitations, we propose FIRST, an algorithm that reduces inference latency by using layer-specific routers to select a subset of transformer layers adaptively for each input sequence - the prompt (during prefill stage) decides which layers will be skipped during decoding. FIRST preserves compatibility with KV caching enabling faster inference while being quality-aware. FIRST is model-agnostic and can be easily enabled on any pre-trained LLM. We further improve performance by incorporating LoRA adapters for fine-tuning on external datasets, enhancing task-specific accuracy while maintaining latency benefits. Our approach reveals that input adaptivity is critical - indeed, different task-specific middle layers play a crucial role in evolving hidden representations depending on task. Extensive experiments show that FIRST significantly reduces latency while retaining competitive performance (as compared to baselines), making our approach an efficient solution for LLM deployment in low-resource environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Dynamic vision sensor (DVS) is novel neuromorphic imaging device that generates asynchronous events. Despite the high temporal resolution and high dynamic range features, DVS is faced with background noise problem. Spatiotemporal filter is an effective and hardware-friendly solution for DVS denoising but previous designs have large memory overhead or degraded performance issues. In this paper, we present a lightweight and real-time spatiotemporal denoising filter with set-associative cache-like memories, which has low space complexity of \text{O(m+n)} for DVS of $m\times n$ resolution. A two-stage pipeline for memory access with read cancellation feature is proposed to reduce power consumption. Further the bitwidth redundancy for event storage is exploited to minimize the memory footprint. We implemented our design on FPGA and experimental results show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with previous spatiotemporal filters while maintaining low resource utilization and low power consumption of about 125mW to 210mW at 100MHz clock frequency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> KV cache has become a de facto technique for the inference of large language models (LLMs), where tensors of shape (layer number, head number, sequence length, feature dimension) are introduced to cache historical information for self-attention. As the size of the model and data grows, the KV cache can quickly become a bottleneck within the system in both storage and memory transfer. To address this, prior studies usually focus on the first three axes of the cache tensors for compression. This paper supplements them, focusing on the feature dimension axis, by utilizing low-rank projection matrices to transform the cache features into spaces with reduced dimensions. We begin by investigating the canonical orthogonal projection method for data compression through principal component analysis (PCA). We observe the issue with PCA projection where significant performance degradation is observed at low compression rates. To bridge the gap, we propose to directly tune the orthogonal projection matrices with a distillation objective using an elaborate Matryoshka training strategy. After training, we adaptively search for the optimal compression rates for various layers and heads given varying compression budgets. Compared to previous works, our method can easily embrace pre-trained LLMs and hold a smooth tradeoff between performance and compression rate. We empirically witness the high data efficiency of our training procedure and find that our method can sustain over 90% performance with an average KV cache compression rate of 60% (and up to 75% in certain extreme scenarios) for popular LLMs like LLaMA2-7B-base and Mistral-7B-v0.3-base.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantization is a widely-used compression technology to reduce the overhead of serving large language models (LLMs) on terminal devices and in cloud data centers. However, prevalent quantization methods, such as 8-bit weight-activation or 4-bit weight-only quantization, achieve limited performance improvements due to poor support for low-precision (e.g., 4-bit) activation. This work, for the first time, realizes practical W4A4KV4 serving for LLMs, fully utilizing the INT4 tensor cores on modern GPUs and reducing the memory bottleneck caused by the KV cache. Specifically, we propose a novel fine-grained mixed-precision quantization algorithm (FMPQ) that compresses most activations into 4-bit with negligible accuracy loss. To support mixed-precision matrix multiplication for W4A4 and W4A8, we develop a highly optimized W4Ax kernel. Our approach introduces a novel mixed-precision data layout to facilitate access and fast dequantization for activation and weight tensors, utilizing the GPU's software pipeline to hide the overhead of data loading and conversion. Additionally, we propose fine-grained streaming multiprocessor (SM) scheduling to achieve load balance across different SMs. We integrate the optimized W4Ax kernel into our inference framework, COMET, and provide efficient management to support popular LLMs such as LLaMA-3-70B. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that, when running LLaMA family models on a single A100-80G-SMX4, COMET achieves a kernel-level speedup of \textbf{$2.88\times$} over cuBLAS and a \textbf{$2.02 \times$} throughput improvement compared to TensorRT-LLM from an end-to-end framework perspective.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in various real-world scenarios due to their excellent generalization capabilities and robust generative abilities. However, they exhibit position bias, also known as "lost in the middle", a phenomenon that is especially pronounced in long-context scenarios, which indicates the placement of the key information in different positions of a prompt can significantly affect accuracy. This paper first explores the micro-level manifestations of position bias, concluding that attention weights are a micro-level expression of position bias. It further identifies that, in addition to position embeddings, causal attention mask also contributes to position bias by creating position-specific hidden states. Based on these insights, we propose a method to mitigate position bias by scaling this positional hidden states. Experiments on the NaturalQuestions Multi-document QA, KV retrieval, LongBench and timeline reorder tasks, using various models including RoPE models, context windowextended models, and Alibi models, demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach. Our method can improve performance by up to 15.2% by modifying just one dimension of hidden states. Our code is available at https://aka.ms/PositionalHidden.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video-based multimodal large language models (Video-LLMs) possess significant potential for video understanding tasks. However, most Video-LLMs treat videos as a sequential set of individual frames, which results in insufficient temporal-spatial interaction that hinders fine-grained comprehension and difficulty in processing longer videos due to limited visual token capacity. To address these challenges, we propose VidCompress, a novel Video-LLM featuring memory-enhanced temporal compression. VidCompress employs a dual-compressor approach: a memory-enhanced compressor captures both short-term and long-term temporal relationships in videos and compresses the visual tokens using a multiscale transformer with a memory-cache mechanism, while a text-perceived compressor generates condensed visual tokens by utilizing Q-Former and integrating temporal contexts into query embeddings with cross attention. Experiments on several VideoQA datasets and comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate that VidCompress efficiently models complex temporal-spatial relations and significantly outperforms existing Video-LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Auto-regressive inference of transformers benefit greatly from Key-Value (KV) caching, but can lead to major memory bottlenecks as model size, batch size, and sequence length grow at scale. We introduce Multi-Layer Key-Value (MLKV) sharing, a novel approach extending KV sharing across transformer layers to reduce memory usage beyond what was possible with Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA). Evaluations on various NLP benchmarks and inference metrics using uptrained Pythia-160M variants demonstrate that MLKV significantly reduces memory usage with minimal performance loss, reducing KV cache size down to a factor of 6x compared to MQA. These results highlight MLKV's potential for efficient deployment of transformer models at scale. We provide code at https://github.com/zaydzuhri/pythia-mlkv

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In modern large language models (LLMs), increasing the context length is crucial for improving comprehension and coherence in long-context, multi-modal, and retrieval-augmented language generation. While many recent transformer models attempt to extend their context length over a million tokens, they remain impractical due to the quadratic time and space complexities. Although recent works on linear and sparse attention mechanisms can achieve this goal, their real-world applicability is often limited by the need to re-train from scratch and significantly worse performance. In response, we propose a novel approach, Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP), which reduces the time complexity of the attention mechanism to $O(T \log T)$ and the space complexity to $O(T)$, where $T$ is the sequence length. We notice a pattern in the attention scores of pretrained LLMs where tokens close together tend to have similar scores, which we call ``attention locality''. Based on this observation, we utilize a novel tree-search-like algorithm that estimates the top-$k$ key tokens for a given query on the fly, which is mathematically guaranteed to have better performance than random attention pruning. In addition to improving the time complexity of the attention mechanism, we further optimize GPU memory usage by implementing KV cache offloading, which stores only $O(\log T)$ tokens on the GPU while maintaining similar decoding throughput. Experiments on benchmarks show that HiP, with its training-free nature, significantly reduces both prefill and decoding latencies, as well as memory usage, while maintaining high-quality generation with minimal degradation. HiP enables pretrained LLMs to scale up to millions of tokens on commodity GPUs, potentially unlocking long-context LLM applications previously deemed infeasible.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantization has been substantially adopted to accelerate inference and reduce memory consumption of large language models (LLMs). While activation-weight joint quantization speeds up the inference process through low-precision kernels, we demonstrate that it suffers severe performance degradation on multi-step reasoning tasks, rendering it ineffective. We propose a novel quantization paradigm called QSPEC, which seamlessly integrates two complementary quantization schemes for speculative decoding. Leveraging nearly cost-free execution switching, QSPEC drafts tokens with low-precision, fast activation-weight quantization, and verifies them with high-precision weight-only quantization, effectively combining the strengths of both quantization schemes. Compared to high-precision quantization methods, QSPEC empirically boosts token generation throughput by up to 1.80x without any quality compromise, distinguishing it from other low-precision quantization approaches. This enhancement is also consistent across various serving tasks, model sizes, quantization methods, and batch sizes. Unlike existing speculative decoding techniques, our approach reuses weights and the KV cache, avoiding additional memory overhead. Furthermore, QSPEC offers a plug-and-play advantage without requiring any training. We believe that QSPEC demonstrates unique strengths for future deployment of high-fidelity quantization schemes, particularly in memory-constrained scenarios (e.g., edge devices).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We study content caching with recommendations in a wireless network where the users are connected through a base station equipped with a finite-capacity cache. We assume a fixed set of contents with unknown user preferences and content popularities. The base station can cache a subset of the contents and can also recommend subsets of the contents to different users in order to encourage them to request the recommended contents. Recommendations, depending on their acceptability, can thus be used to increase cache hits. We first assume that the users' recommendation acceptabilities are known and formulate the cache hit optimization problem as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB). We propose a UCB-based algorithm to decide which contents to cache and recommend and provide an upper bound on the regret of this algorithm. Subsequently, we consider a more general scenario where the users' recommendation acceptabilities are also unknown and propose another UCB-based algorithm that learns these as well. We numerically demonstrate the performance of our algorithms and compare these to state-of-the-art algorithms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Zoned Namespace SSDs (ZNS) are introduced recently to mitigate the block interface penalties of flash-based SSDs. It is a good opportunity for flash cache to address cache throughput and write amplification (WA) issues by fully controlling data allocation and garbage collection via zone-based interfaces. However, there are several critical challenges that need to be addressed including zone-interface compatibility, data management of large zone size, and a better tradeoff between throughput, cache hit ratio, and WA.   In this paper, we present Z-CacheLib, a zoned storage optimized flash cache on ZNS SSDs. In Z-CacheLib, we propose: 1) a new zStorage Engine for ZNS SSDs with low mapping and operational overhead, and 2) a novel zCache Engine with cross-layer optimizations to resolve the throughput regression and WA issues of garbage collection, which consists of delayed data eviction with virtual over-provisioning (vOP), a top-down eviction policy (zLRU) optimized from LRU, and a bottom-up drop mechanism (zDrop) for low WA. Our evaluation shows that Z-CacheLib can achieve up to 2X throughput, 5% improvement hit ratio, and almost no WA compared to CacheLib with compatible regular SSDs, demonstrating benefits of using ZNS SSDs for cache. Moreover, Z-CacheLib can achieve up to 6X throughput and 92% WA reduction compared with F2FS-based scheme.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> High-level synthesis, source-to-source compilers, and various Design Space Exploration techniques for pragma insertion have significantly improved the Quality of Results of generated designs. These tools offer benefits such as reduced development time and enhanced performance. However, achieving high-quality results often requires additional manual code transformations and tiling selections, which are typically performed separately or as pre-processing steps. Although DSE techniques enable code transformation upfront, the vastness of the search space often limits the exploration of all possible code transformations, making it challenging to determine which transformations are necessary. Additionally, ensuring correctness remains challenging, especially for complex transformations and optimizations.   To tackle this obstacle, we first propose a comprehensive framework leveraging HLS compilers. Our system streamlines code transformation, pragma insertion, and tiles size selection for on-chip data caching through a unified optimization problem, aiming to enhance parallelization, particularly beneficial for computation-bound kernels. Them employing a novel Non-Linear Programming (NLP) approach, we simultaneously ascertain transformations, pragmas, and tile sizes, focusing on regular loop-based kernels. Our evaluation demonstrates that our framework adeptly identifies the appropriate transformations, including scenarios where no transformation is necessary, and inserts pragmas to achieve a favorable Quality of Results.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deploying long-context large language models (LLMs) is essential but poses significant computational and memory challenges. Caching all Key and Value (KV) states across all attention heads consumes substantial memory. Existing KV cache pruning methods either damage the long-context capabilities of LLMs or offer only limited efficiency improvements. In this paper, we identify that only a fraction of attention heads, a.k.a, Retrieval Heads, are critical for processing long contexts and require full attention across all tokens. In contrast, all other heads, which primarily focus on recent tokens and attention sinks--referred to as Streaming Heads--do not require full attention. Based on this insight, we introduce DuoAttention, a framework that only applies a full KV cache to retrieval heads while using a light-weight, constant-length KV cache for streaming heads, which reduces both LLM's decoding and pre-filling memory and latency without compromising its long-context abilities. DuoAttention uses a lightweight, optimization-based algorithm with synthetic data to identify retrieval heads accurately. Our method significantly reduces long-context inference memory by up to 2.55x for MHA and 1.67x for GQA models while speeding up decoding by up to 2.18x and 1.50x and accelerating pre-filling by up to 1.73x and 1.63x for MHA and GQA models, respectively, with minimal accuracy loss compared to full attention. Notably, combined with quantization, DuoAttention enables Llama-3-8B decoding with 3.3 million context length on a single A100 GPU. Code is provided in https://github.com/mit-han-lab/duo-attention.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Language Models (LMs) assign significant attention to the first token, even if it is not semantically important, which is known as attention sink. This phenomenon has been widely adopted in applications such as streaming/long context generation, KV cache optimization, inference acceleration, model quantization, and others. Despite its widespread use, a deep understanding of attention sink in LMs is still lacking. In this work, we first demonstrate that attention sinks exist universally in LMs with various inputs, even in small models. Furthermore, attention sink is observed to emerge during the LM pre-training, motivating us to investigate how optimization, data distribution, loss function, and model architecture in LM pre-training influence its emergence. We highlight that attention sink emerges after effective optimization on sufficient training data. The sink position is highly correlated with the loss function and data distribution. Most importantly, we find that attention sink acts more like key biases, storing extra attention scores, which could be non-informative and not contribute to the value computation. We also observe that this phenomenon (at least partially) stems from tokens' inner dependence on attention scores as a result of softmax normalization. After relaxing such dependence by replacing softmax attention with other attention operations, such as sigmoid attention without normalization, attention sinks do not emerge in LMs up to 1B parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/Attention-Sink.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce a new paradigm for AutoRegressive (AR) image generation, termed Set AutoRegressive Modeling (SAR). SAR generalizes the conventional AR to the next-set setting, i.e., splitting the sequence into arbitrary sets containing multiple tokens, rather than outputting each token in a fixed raster order. To accommodate SAR, we develop a straightforward architecture termed Fully Masked Transformer. We reveal that existing AR variants correspond to specific design choices of sequence order and output intervals within the SAR framework, with AR and Masked AR (MAR) as two extreme instances. Notably, SAR facilitates a seamless transition from AR to MAR, where intermediate states allow for training a causal model that benefits from both few-step inference and KV cache acceleration, thus leveraging the advantages of both AR and MAR. On the ImageNet benchmark, we carefully explore the properties of SAR by analyzing the impact of sequence order and output intervals on performance, as well as the generalization ability regarding inference order and steps. We further validate the potential of SAR by training a 900M text-to-image model capable of synthesizing photo-realistic images with any resolution. We hope our work may inspire more exploration and application of AR-based modeling across diverse modalities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion transformers have shown significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis at the expense of huge computation costs. To address this problem, feature caching methods have been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by caching the features in previous timesteps and reusing them in the following timesteps. However, previous caching methods ignore that different tokens exhibit different sensitivities to feature caching, and feature caching on some tokens may lead to 10$\times$ more destruction to the overall generation quality compared with other tokens. In this paper, we introduce token-wise feature caching, allowing us to adaptively select the most suitable tokens for caching, and further enable us to apply different caching ratios to neural layers in different types and depths. Extensive experiments on PixArt-$\alpha$, OpenSora, and DiT demonstrate our effectiveness in both image and video generation with no requirements for training. For instance, 2.36$\times$ and 1.93$\times$ acceleration are achieved on OpenSora and PixArt-$\alpha$ with almost no drop in generation quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated Edge Learning (FEL) has emerged as a promising approach for enabling edge devices to collaboratively train machine learning models while preserving data privacy. Despite its advantages, practical FEL deployment faces significant challenges related to device constraints and device-server interactions, necessitating heterogeneous, user-adaptive model training with limited and uncertain communication. In this paper, we introduce FedCache 2.0, a novel personalized FEL architecture that simultaneously addresses these challenges. FedCache 2.0 incorporates the benefits of both dataset distillation and knowledge cache-driven federated learning by storing and organizing distilled data as knowledge in the server-side knowledge cache. Moreover, a device-centric cache sampling strategy is introduced to tailor transferred knowledge for individual devices within controlled communication bandwidth. Extensive experiments on five datasets covering image recognition, audio understanding, and mobile sensor data mining tasks demonstrate that (1) FedCache 2.0 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods regardless of model structures, data distributions, and modalities. (2) FedCache 2.0 can train splendid personalized on-device models with at least $\times$28.6 improvement in communication efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> When offloading links encounter deep fading and obstruction, edge caching cannot fully enhance wireless network performance and improve the QoS of edge nodes, as it fails to effectively reduce backhaul burden. The emerging technology of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) compensates for this disadvantage by creating a smart and reconfigurable wireless environment. Subsequently, we jointly design content placement and active/passive beamforming to minimize network costs under imperfect channel state information (CSI) in the IRS-oriented edge caching system. This minimization problem is decomposed into two subproblems. The content placement subproblem is addressed by applying KKT optimality conditions. We then develop the alternating optimization method to resolve precoder and reflection beamforming. Specifically, we reduce transmission power by first fixing the phase shift, reducing the problem to a convex one relative to the precoder, which is solved through convex optimization. Next, we fix the precoder and resolve the resulting reflection beamforming problem using the penalty convex-concave procedure (CCP) method. Results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms uniform caching and random phase approaches in reducing transmission power and saving network costs. Eventually, the proposed approach offers potential improvements in the caching optimization and transmission robustness of wireless communication with imperfect CSI.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose a simple yet effective neural network-based framework for global illumination rendering. Recently, rendering techniques that learn neural radiance caches by minimizing the difference (i.e., residual) between the left and right sides of the rendering equation have been suggested. Due to their ease of implementation and the advantage of excluding path integral calculations, these techniques have been applied to various fields, such as free-viewpoint rendering, differentiable rendering, and real-time rendering. However, issues of slow training and occasionally darkened renders have been noted. We identify the cause of these issues as the bias and high variance present in the gradient estimates of the existing residual-based objective function. To address this, we introduce a new objective function that maintains the same global optimum as before but allows for unbiased and low-variance gradient estimates, enabling faster and more accurate training of neural networks. In conclusion, this method is simply implemented by ignoring the partial derivatives of the right-hand side, and theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed loss.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Visual correspondence is a crucial step in key computer vision tasks, including camera localization, image registration, and structure from motion. The most effective techniques for matching keypoints currently involve using learned sparse or dense matchers, which need pairs of images. These neural networks have a good general understanding of features from both images, but they often struggle to match points from different semantic areas. This paper presents a new method that uses semantic cues from foundation vision model features (like DINOv2) to enhance local feature matching by incorporating semantic reasoning into existing descriptors. Therefore, the learned descriptors do not require image pairs at inference time, allowing feature caching and fast matching using similarity search, unlike learned matchers. We present adapted versions of six existing descriptors, with an average increase in performance of 29% in camera localization, with comparable accuracy to existing matchers as LightGlue and LoFTR in two existing benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding the hydrodynamics of microswimmers in viscoelastic fluids and confined environments is crucial for interpreting their behaviour in natural settings and designing synthetic microswimmers for practical applications like cargo transport. In this study, we explore the hydrodynamics of a concentric active compound particle - a model microswimmer (a squirmer) positioned at the centre of a viscoelastic fluid droplet (a model cargo) suspended in another viscoelastic medium. We consider the Oldroyd-B constitutive model to characterize the fluids and employ a perturbative approach in the Deborah number to analyze viscoelastic effects analytically, assuming a small Capillary number so that the droplet remains spherical and does not deform. We examine three cases: (i) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in a Newtonian fluid, (ii) a squirmer confined within a Newtonian fluid droplet suspended in a viscoelastic fluid, and (iii) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in another viscoelastic fluid. Our findings reveal that the swimming speeds of the squirmer and the droplet are determined by the complex interplay of viscoelasticity, the size ratio of the droplet to the squirmer (confinement strength), and the viscosity ratio of the surrounding fluid to the droplet fluid. A critical aspect of this interaction is the positioning of stagnation points within the fluid flow, which governs the distribution of polymeric stress. This distribution, in turn, plays a crucial role in determining the influence of viscoelasticity on the squirmer's dynamics. Our analysis suggests that viscoelastic effects can either enhance or hinder the swimming speed of the squirmer when confined in a droplet, depending on the specific configuration of the system.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing long-context information. However, the quadratic complexity of attention computation with respect to sequence length poses significant computational challenges, and I/O aware algorithms have been proposed. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the I/O complexity for attention mechanisms, focusing on backward passes by categorizing into small and large cache scenarios. Using the red-blue pebble game framework, we establish tight bounds on I/O complexity across all cache sizes. We confirm that the de facto standard I/O aware algorithm FlashAttention is optimal for both forward and backward passes for the large cache size scenario. For small cache sizes, we provide an algorithm that improves over existing methods and achieves the tight bounds. Additionally, we extend our analysis to sparse attention, a mainstream speeding-up approach, deriving fine-grained lower bounds for both forward and backward passes and both small and large caches. Our findings complete the theoretical foundation for I/O complexity in attention mechanisms, offering insights for designing efficient algorithms of LLM training and inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, 3D SSDs are widely adopted in PCs, data centers, and cloud storage systems. To increase capacity, high bit-density cells, such as Triple-Level Cell (TLC), are utilized within 3D SSDs. However, due to the inferior performance of TLC, a portion of TLCs is configured to operate as Single-Level Cell (SLC) to provide high performance, with host data initially directed to the SLCs. In SLC/TLC hybrid 3D SSDs, a portion of the TLC space is designated as an SLC cache to achieve high SSD performance by writing host data at the SLC speed. Given the limited size of the SLC cache, block reclamation is necessary to free up the SLC cache during idle periods. However, our preliminary studies indicate that the SLC cache can lead to a performance cliff if filled rapidly and cause significant write amplification when data migration occurs during idle times.   In this work, we propose leveraging a reprogram operation to address these challenges. Specifically, when the SLC cache is full or during idle periods, a reprogram operation is performed to switch used SLC pages to TLC pages in place (termed In-place Switch, IPS). Subsequently, other free TLC space is allocated as the new SLC cache. IPS can continuously provide sufficient SLC cache within SSDs, significantly improving write performance and reducing write amplification. Experimental results demonstrate that IPS can reduce write latency and write amplification by up to 0.75 times and 0.53 times, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art SLC cache technologies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in deep learning for processing point clouds hold increased interest in Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning (FSCIL) for 3D computer vision. This paper introduces a new method to tackle the Few-Shot Continual Incremental Learning (FSCIL) problem in 3D point cloud environments. We leverage a foundational 3D model trained extensively on point cloud data. Drawing from recent improvements in foundation models, known for their ability to work well across different tasks, we propose a novel strategy that does not require additional training to adapt to new tasks. Our approach uses a dual cache system: first, it uses previous test samples based on how confident the model was in its predictions to prevent forgetting, and second, it includes a small number of new task samples to prevent overfitting. This dynamic adaptation ensures strong performance across different learning tasks without needing lots of fine-tuning. We tested our approach on datasets like ModelNet, ShapeNet, ScanObjectNN, and CO3D, showing that it outperforms other FSCIL methods and demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The opacity in developing large language models (LLMs) is raising growing concerns about the potential contamination of public benchmarks in the pre-training data. Existing contamination detection methods are typically based on the text overlap between training and evaluation data, which can be too superficial to reflect deeper forms of contamination. In this paper, we first present a cross-lingual form of contamination that inflates LLMs' performance while evading current detection methods, deliberately injected by overfitting LLMs on the translated versions of benchmark test sets. Then, we propose generalization-based approaches to unmask such deeply concealed contamination. Specifically, we examine the LLM's performance change after modifying the original benchmark by replacing the false answer choices with correct ones from other questions. Contaminated models can hardly generalize to such easier situations, where the false choices can be \emph{not even wrong}, as all choices are correct in their memorization. Experimental results demonstrate that cross-lingual contamination can easily fool existing detection methods, but not ours. In addition, we discuss the potential utilization of cross-lingual contamination in interpreting LLMs' working mechanisms and in post-training LLMs for enhanced multilingual capabilities. The code and dataset we use can be obtained from \url{https://github.com/ShangDataLab/Deep-Contam}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> How can "weak teacher models" such as average human annotators or existing AI systems, effectively supervise LLMs to improve performance on hard reasoning tasks, especially those that challenge and requires expertise or daily practice from the teacher models? In this paper, we seek for empirical answers to this question by investigating various data-driven strategies that offer supervision data at different quality levels upon tasks of varying complexity. Two intuitive strategies emerge for teacher models to provide supervision during alignment training: 1) using lower-quality supervision from complete tasks that match the difficulty of the target reasoning tasks, and 2) leveraging higher-quality supervision from easier subtasks that are less challenging. Interestingly, we find that even when the outcome error rate for hard task supervision is high (e.g., 90\%), training on such data can outperform perfectly correct supervision on easier subtasks on multiple hard math benchmarks. We further identify a more critical factor influencing training performance: step-wise error rates, which indicate the severity of errors in solutions. Specifically, training on hard task supervision with the same outcome error rates but disparate step-wise error rates can lead to a 30\% accuracy gap on MATH benchmark. Our results also reveal that supplementing hard task supervision with the corresponding subtask supervision can yield notable performance improvements than simply combining rephrased hard full task supervision, suggesting new avenues for data augmentation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Human beings are endowed with a complementary learning system, which bridges the slow learning of general world dynamics with fast storage of episodic memory from a new experience. Previous video generation models, however, primarily focus on slow learning by pre-training on vast amounts of data, overlooking the fast learning phase crucial for episodic memory storage. This oversight leads to inconsistencies across temporally distant frames when generating longer videos, as these frames fall beyond the model's context window. To this end, we introduce SlowFast-VGen, a novel dual-speed learning system for action-driven long video generation. Our approach incorporates a masked conditional video diffusion model for the slow learning of world dynamics, alongside an inference-time fast learning strategy based on a temporal LoRA module. Specifically, the fast learning process updates its temporal LoRA parameters based on local inputs and outputs, thereby efficiently storing episodic memory in its parameters. We further propose a slow-fast learning loop algorithm that seamlessly integrates the inner fast learning loop into the outer slow learning loop, enabling the recall of prior multi-episode experiences for context-aware skill learning. To facilitate the slow learning of an approximate world model, we collect a large-scale dataset of 200k videos with language action annotations, covering a wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments show that SlowFast-VGen outperforms baselines across various metrics for action-driven video generation, achieving an FVD score of 514 compared to 782, and maintaining consistency in longer videos, with an average of 0.37 scene cuts versus 0.89. The slow-fast learning loop algorithm significantly enhances performances on long-horizon planning tasks as well. Project Website: https://slowfast-vgen.github.io

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion models achieve high-quality sample generation at the cost of a lengthy multistep inference procedure. To overcome this, diffusion distillation techniques produce student generators capable of matching or surpassing the teacher in a single step. However, the student model's inference speed is limited by the size of the teacher architecture, preventing real-time generation for computationally heavy applications. In this work, we introduce Multi-Student Distillation (MSD), a framework to distill a conditional teacher diffusion model into multiple single-step generators. Each student generator is responsible for a subset of the conditioning data, thereby obtaining higher generation quality for the same capacity. MSD trains multiple distilled students, allowing smaller sizes and, therefore, faster inference. Also, MSD offers a lightweight quality boost over single-student distillation with the same architecture. We demonstrate MSD is effective by training multiple same-sized or smaller students on single-step distillation using distribution matching and adversarial distillation techniques. With smaller students, MSD gets competitive results with faster inference for single-step generation. Using 4 same-sized students, MSD sets a new state-of-the-art for one-step image generation: FID 1.20 on ImageNet-64x64 and 8.20 on zero-shot COCO2014.

Recently, there is a growing interest in extending this success to vision foundation models. In this survey, we review the recent advances and discuss future directions for autoregressive vision foundation models. First, we present the trend for next generation of vision foundation models, i.e., unifying both understanding and generation in vision tasks. We then analyze the limitations of existing vision foundation models, and present a formal definition of autoregression with its advantages. Later, we categorize autoregressive vision foundation models from their vision tokenizers and autoregression backbones. Finally, we discuss several promising research challenges and directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey to comprehensively summarize autoregressive vision foundation models under the trend of unifying understanding and generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models (LLMs) expand into performing as agents for real-world applications beyond traditional NLP tasks, evaluating their robustness becomes increasingly important. However, existing benchmarks often overlook critical dimensions like cultural and social awareness. To address these, we introduce CASA, a benchmark designed to assess LLM agents' sensitivity to cultural and social norms across two web-based tasks: online shopping and social discussion forums. Our approach evaluates LLM agents' ability to detect and appropriately respond to norm-violating user queries and observations. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that measures awareness coverage, helpfulness in managing user queries, and the violation rate when facing misleading web content. Experiments show that current LLMs perform significantly better in non-agent than in web-based agent environments, with agents achieving less than 10% awareness coverage and over 40% violation rates. To improve performance, we explore two methods: prompting and fine-tuning, and find that combining both methods can offer complementary advantages -- fine-tuning on culture-specific datasets significantly enhances the agents' ability to generalize across different regions, while prompting boosts the agents' ability to navigate complex tasks. These findings highlight the importance of constantly benchmarking LLM agents' cultural and social awareness during the development cycle.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As general-purpose tools, Large Language Models (LLMs) must often reason about everyday physical environments. In a question-and-answer capacity, understanding the interactions of physical objects may be necessary to give appropriate responses. Moreover, LLMs are increasingly used as reasoning engines in agentic systems, designing and controlling their action sequences. The vast majority of research has tackled this issue using static benchmarks, comprised of text or image-based questions about the physical world. However, these benchmarks do not capture the complexity and nuance of real-life physical processes. Here we advocate for a second, relatively unexplored, approach: 'embodying' the LLMs by granting them control of an agent within a 3D environment. We present the first embodied and cognitively meaningful evaluation of physical common-sense reasoning in LLMs. Our framework allows direct comparison of LLMs with other embodied agents, such as those based on Deep Reinforcement Learning, and human and non-human animals. We employ the Animal-AI (AAI) environment, a simulated 3D virtual laboratory, to study physical common-sense reasoning in LLMs. For this, we use the AAI Testbed, a suite of experiments that replicate laboratory studies with non-human animals, to study physical reasoning capabilities including distance estimation, tracking out-of-sight objects, and tool use. We demonstrate that state-of-the-art multi-modal models with no finetuning can complete this style of task, allowing meaningful comparison to the entrants of the 2019 Animal-AI Olympics competition and to human children. Our results show that LLMs are currently outperformed by human children on these tasks. We argue that this approach allows the study of physical reasoning using ecologically valid experiments drawn directly from cognitive science, improving the predictability and reliability of LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modeling the interference effect is an important issue in the field of causal inference. Existing studies rely on explicit and often homogeneous assumptions regarding interference structures. In this paper, we introduce a low-rank and sparse treatment effect model that leverages data-driven techniques to identify the locations of interference effects. A profiling algorithm is proposed to estimate the model coefficients, and based on these estimates, global test and local detection methods are established to detect the existence of interference and the interference neighbor locations for each unit. We derive the non-asymptotic bound of the estimation error, and establish theoretical guarantees for the global test and the accuracy of the detection method in terms of Jaccard index. Simulations and real data examples are provided to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents a novel framework for full-waveform seismic source inversion using simulation-based inference (SBI). Traditional probabilistic approaches often rely on simplifying assumptions about data errors, which we show can lead to inaccurate uncertainty quantification. SBI addresses this limitation by building an empirical probabilistic model of the data errors using machine learning models, known as neural density estimators, which can then be integrated into the Bayesian inference framework. We apply the SBI framework to point-source moment tensor inversions as well as joint moment tensor and time-location inversions. We construct a range of synthetic examples to explore the quality of the SBI solutions, as well as to compare the SBI results with standard Gaussian likelihood-based Bayesian inversions. We then demonstrate that under real seismic noise, common Gaussian likelihood assumptions for treating full-waveform data yield overconfident posterior distributions that underestimate the moment tensor component uncertainties by up to a factor of 3. We contrast this with SBI, which produces well-calibrated posteriors that generally agree with the true seismic source parameters, and offers an order-of-magnitude reduction in the number of simulations required to perform inference compared to standard Monte Carlo techniques. Finally, we apply our methodology to a pair of moderate magnitude earthquakes in the North Atlantic. We utilise seismic waveforms recorded by the recent UPFLOW ocean bottom seismometer array as well as by regional land stations in the Azores, comparing full moment tensor and source-time location posteriors between SBI and a Gaussian likelihood approach. We find that our adaptation of SBI can be directly applied to real earthquake sources to efficiently produce high quality posterior distributions that significantly improve upon Gaussian likelihood approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces a framework, called EMOTION, for generating expressive motion sequences in humanoid robots, enhancing their ability to engage in humanlike non-verbal communication. Non-verbal cues such as facial expressions, gestures, and body movements play a crucial role in effective interpersonal interactions. Despite the advancements in robotic behaviors, existing methods often fall short in mimicking the diversity and subtlety of human non-verbal communication. To address this gap, our approach leverages the in-context learning capability of large language models (LLMs) to dynamically generate socially appropriate gesture motion sequences for human-robot interaction. We use this framework to generate 10 different expressive gestures and conduct online user studies comparing the naturalness and understandability of the motions generated by EMOTION and its human-feedback version, EMOTION++, against those by human operators. The results demonstrate that our approach either matches or surpasses human performance in generating understandable and natural robot motions under certain scenarios. We also provide design implications for future research to consider a set of variables when generating expressive robotic gestures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we present an LLM-based code translation method and an associated tool called CoTran, that translates whole-programs from one high-level programming language to another. Existing LLM-based code translation methods lack training to ensure that the translated code reliably compiles or bears substantial functional equivalence to the input code. In our work, we fine-tune an LLM using reinforcement learning, incorporating compiler feedback, and symbolic execution (symexec)-based testing feedback to assess functional equivalence between the input and output programs. The idea is to guide an LLM during fine-tuning, via compiler and symexec-based testing feedback, by letting it know how far it is from producing perfect translations. We conduct extensive experiments comparing CoTran with 14 other code translation tools, including human-written transpilers, LLM-based translation tools, and ChatGPT. Using a benchmark of over \num{57000} code pairs in Java and Python, we demonstrate that CoTran outperforms the other tools on relevant metrics such as compilation accuracy (CompAcc) and functional equivalence accuracy (FEqAcc). For example, in Python-to-Java translation, CoTran achieves 48.68% FEqAcc and 76.98% CompAcc, whereas the nearest competing tool (PLBART-base) gets 38.26% and 75.77% respectively. Additionally, CoTran, built on top of CodeT5, improves FEqAcc by +14.89% and CompAcc by +8.14% for Python-to-Java (resp., +12.94% and +4.30% for Java-to-Python).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Visual content and accompanied audio signals naturally formulate a joint representation to improve audio-visual (AV) related applications. While studies develop various AV representation learning frameworks, the importance of AV data alignment is usually undermined for achieving high-quality representation. We observe that an audio signal may contain background noise interference. Also, non-synchronization may appear between audio and video streams. These non-strict data alignment limits representation quality and downgrade application performance. In this paper, we propose to improve AV joint representations from a data-centric perspective by aligning audio signals to visual data. Our alignment is conducted in an agentic workflow controlled by an LLM-based assistant named AVAgent. For each input AV data pair, our AVAgent uses a multi-modal LLM to convert audio and visual data into language descriptions separately (i.e., tool use). Then, AVAgent reasons whether this paired data is aligned well and plans to edit the audio signal if needed (i.e., planning). The audio editing is executed by predefined actions that filter noise or augment data. Moreover, we use a VLM to evaluate how modified audio signals match the visual content and provide feedback to AVAgent (i.e., reflection). The tool use, planning, and reflection steps operate cyclically to become an agentic workflow where audio signals are gradually aligned to visual content. To this end, existing methods can directly leverage the aligned AV data via our agentic workflow to improve AV joint representations. The experimental results comprehensively demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach against previous baselines in diverse downstream tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vulnerability of Frontier language models to misuse and jailbreaks has prompted the development of safety measures like filters and alignment training in an effort to ensure safety through robustness to adversarially crafted prompts. We assert that robustness is fundamentally insufficient for ensuring safety goals, and current defenses and evaluation methods fail to account for risks of dual-intent queries and their composition for malicious goals. To quantify these risks, we introduce a new safety evaluation framework based on impermissible information leakage of model outputs and demonstrate how our proposed question-decomposition attack can extract dangerous knowledge from a censored LLM more effectively than traditional jailbreaking. Underlying our proposed evaluation method is a novel information-theoretic threat model of inferential adversaries, distinguished from security adversaries, such as jailbreaks, in that success is measured by inferring impermissible knowledge from victim outputs as opposed to forcing explicitly impermissible outputs from the victim. Through our information-theoretic framework, we show that to ensure safety against inferential adversaries, defense mechanisms must ensure information censorship, bounding the leakage of impermissible information. However, we prove that such defenses inevitably incur a safety-utility trade-off.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Many alignment methods, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), rely on the Bradley-Terry reward assumption, which is insufficient to capture the full range of general human preferences. To achieve robust alignment with general preferences, we model the alignment problem as a two-player zero-sum game, where the Nash equilibrium policy guarantees a 50% win rate against any competing policy. However, previous algorithms for finding the Nash policy either diverge or converge to a Nash policy in a modified game, even in a simple synthetic setting, thereby failing to maintain the 50% win rate guarantee against all other policies. We propose a meta-algorithm, Convergent Meta Alignment Algorithm (COMAL), for language model alignment with general preferences, inspired by convergent algorithms in game theory. Theoretically, we prove that our meta-algorithm converges to an exact Nash policy in the last iterate. Additionally, our meta-algorithm is simple and can be integrated with many existing methods designed for RLHF and preference optimization with minimal changes. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework when combined with existing preference policy optimization methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Bandits with preference feedback present a powerful tool for optimizing unknown target functions when only pairwise comparisons are allowed instead of direct value queries. This model allows for incorporating human feedback into online inference and optimization and has been employed in systems for fine-tuning large language models. The problem is well understood in simplified settings with linear target functions or over finite small domains that limit practical interest. Taking the next step, we consider infinite domains and nonlinear (kernelized) rewards. In this setting, selecting a pair of actions is quite challenging and requires balancing exploration and exploitation at two levels: within the pair, and along the iterations of the algorithm. We propose MAXMINLCB, which emulates this trade-off as a zero-sum Stackelberg game, and chooses action pairs that are informative and yield favorable rewards. MAXMINLCB consistently outperforms existing algorithms and satisfies an anytime-valid rate-optimal regret guarantee. This is due to our novel preference-based confidence sequences for kernelized logistic estimators.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The hallucinations of large language models (LLMs) are increasingly mitigated by allowing LLMs to search for information and to ground their answers in real sources. Unfortunately, LLMs often struggle with posing the right search queries, especially when dealing with complex or otherwise indirect topics. Observing that LLMs can learn to search for relevant facts by $\textit{trying}$ different queries and learning to up-weight queries that successfully produce relevant results, we introduce $\underline{Le}$arning to $\underline{Re}$trieve by $\underline{T}$rying (LeReT), a reinforcement learning framework that explores search queries and uses preference-based optimization to improve their quality. LeReT can improve the absolute retrieval accuracy by up to 29% and the downstream generator evaluations by 17%. The simplicity and flexibility of LeReT allows it to be applied to arbitrary off-the-shelf retrievers and makes it a promising technique for improving general LLM pipelines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Biological motion perception (BMP) refers to humans' ability to perceive and recognize the actions of living beings solely from their motion patterns, sometimes as minimal as those depicted on point-light displays. While humans excel at these tasks without any prior training, current AI models struggle with poor generalization performance. To close this research gap, we propose the Motion Perceiver (MP). MP solely relies on patch-level optical flows from video clips as inputs. During training, it learns prototypical flow snapshots through a competitive binding mechanism and integrates invariant motion representations to predict action labels for the given video. During inference, we evaluate the generalization ability of all AI models and humans on 62,656 video stimuli spanning 24 BMP conditions using point-light displays in neuroscience. Remarkably, MP outperforms all existing AI models with a maximum improvement of 29% in top-1 action recognition accuracy on these conditions. Moreover, we benchmark all AI models in point-light displays of two standard video datasets in computer vision. MP also demonstrates superior performance in these cases. More interestingly, via psychophysics experiments, we found that MP recognizes biological movements in a way that aligns with human behaviors.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Run to run variability in parallel programs caused by floating-point non-associativity has been known to significantly affect reproducibility in iterative algorithms, due to accumulating errors. Non-reproducibility can critically affect the efficiency and effectiveness of correctness testing for stochastic programs. Recently, the sensitivity of deep learning training and inference pipelines to floating-point non-associativity has been found to sometimes be extreme. It can prevent certification for commercial applications, accurate assessment of robustness and sensitivity, and bug detection. New approaches in scientific computing applications have coupled deep learning models with high-performance computing, leading to an aggravation of debugging and testing challenges. Here we perform an investigation of the statistical properties of floating-point non-associativity within modern parallel programming models, and analyze performance and productivity impacts of replacing atomic operations with deterministic alternatives on GPUs. We examine the recently-added deterministic options in PyTorch within the context of GPU deployment for deep learning, uncovering and quantifying the impacts of input parameters triggering run to run variability and reporting on the reliability and completeness of the documentation. Finally, we evaluate the strategy of exploiting automatic determinism that could be provided by deterministic hardware, using the Groq accelerator for inference portions of the deep learning pipeline. We demonstrate the benefits that a hardware-based strategy can provide within reproducibility and correctness efforts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces a novel framework combining LLM agents as proxies for human strategic behavior with reinforcement learning (RL) to engage these agents in evolving strategic interactions within team environments. Our approach extends traditional agent-based simulations by using strategic LLM agents (SLA) and introducing dynamic and adaptive governance through a pro-social promoting RL agent (PPA) that modulates information access across agents in a network, optimizing social welfare and promoting pro-social behavior. Through validation in iterative games, including the prisoner dilemma, we demonstrate that SLA agents exhibit nuanced strategic adaptations. The PPA agent effectively learns to adjust information transparency, resulting in enhanced cooperation rates. This framework offers significant insights into AI-mediated social dynamics, contributing to the deployment of AI in real-world team settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We identify $240$ short-period ($P \lesssim 10$ days) binary systems in the TESS data, $180$ of which are heartbeat binaries (HB). The sample is mostly a mix of A and B-type stars and primarily includes eclipsing systems, where over $30\%$ of the sources with primary and secondary eclipses show a secular change in their inter-eclipse timings and relative eclipse depths over a multi-year timescale, likely due to orbital precession. The orbital parameters of the population are estimated by fitting a heartbeat model to their phase curves and Gaia magnitudes, where the model accounts for ellipsoidal variability, Doppler beaming, reflection effects, and eclipses. We construct the sample's period-eccentricity distribution and find an eccentricity cutoff (where $e \rightarrow 0$) at a period $1.7$ days. Additionally, we measure the periastron advance rate for the $12$ of the precessing sources and find that they all exhibit prograde apsidal precession, which is as high as $9^{\circ}$ yr$^{-1}$ for one of the systems. Using the inferred stellar parameters, we estimate the general relativistic precession rate of the argument of periastron for the population and expect over $30$ systems to show a precession in excess of $0.3^{\circ}$ yr$^{-1}$

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based architectures have dominated various areas of machine learning in recent years. In this paper, we introduce a novel robust attention mechanism designed to enhance the resilience of transformer-based architectures. Crucially, this technique can be integrated into existing transformers as a plug-and-play layer, improving their robustness without the need for additional training or fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that our ProTransformer significantly enhances the robustness of transformer models across a variety of prediction tasks, attack mechanisms, backbone architectures, and data domains. Notably, without further fine-tuning, the ProTransformer consistently improves the performance of vanilla transformers by 19.5%, 28.3%, 16.1%, and 11.4% for BERT, ALBERT, DistilBERT, and RoBERTa, respectively, under the classical TextFooler attack. Furthermore, ProTransformer shows promising resilience in large language models (LLMs) against prompting-based attacks, improving the performance of T5 and LLaMA by 24.8% and 17.8%, respectively, and enhancing Vicuna by an average of 10.4% against the Jailbreaking attack. Beyond the language domain, ProTransformer also demonstrates outstanding robustness in both vision and graph domains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents ReasoningRec, a reasoning-based recommendation framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to bridge the gap between recommendations and human-interpretable explanations. In contrast to conventional recommendation systems that rely on implicit user-item interactions, ReasoningRec employs LLMs to model users and items, focusing on preferences, aversions, and explanatory reasoning. The framework utilizes a larger LLM to generate synthetic explanations for user preferences, subsequently used to fine-tune a smaller LLM for enhanced recommendation accuracy and human-interpretable explanation. Our experimental study investigates the impact of reasoning and contextual information on personalized recommendations, revealing that the quality of contextual and personalized data significantly influences the LLM's capacity to generate plausible explanations. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ReasoningRec surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to 12.5\% in recommendation prediction while concurrently providing human-intelligible explanations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite rapid progress in large language models (LLMs), their performance on a vast majority of languages remains unsatisfactory. In this paper, we study building language-specific LLMs by adapting monolingual and multilingual LLMs. We conduct systematic experiments on how design choices (base model selection, vocabulary extension, and continued pretraining) impact the adapted LLM, both in terms of efficiency (how many tokens are needed to encode the same amount of information) and end task performance. We find that (1) the initial performance of LLM does not always correlate with the final performance after the adaptation. Adapting an English-centric models can yield better results than adapting multilingual models despite their worse initial performance on low-resource languages. (2) Efficiency can easily improved with simple vocabulary extension and continued pretraining in most LLMs we study, and (3) The optimal adaptation method (choice of the base model, new vocabulary size, training data, initialization strategy) is highly language-dependent, and the simplest embedding initialization works well across various experimental settings. Together, our work lays foundations on efficiently building language-specific LLMs by adapting existing LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of reproducing human-like inferences, including inferences about emotions and mental states, from text. Whether this capability extends beyond text to other modalities remains unclear. Humans possess a sophisticated ability to read the mind in the eyes of other people. Here we tested whether this ability is also present in GPT-4o, a multimodal LLM. Using two versions of a widely used theory of mind test, the Reading the Mind in Eyes Test and the Multiracial Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, we found that GPT-4o outperformed humans in interpreting mental states from upright faces but underperformed humans when faces were inverted. While humans in our sample showed no difference between White and Non-white faces, GPT-4o's accuracy was higher for White than for Non-white faces. GPT-4o's errors were not random but revealed a highly consistent, yet incorrect, processing of mental-state information across trials, with an orientation-dependent error structure that qualitatively differed from that of humans for inverted faces but not for upright faces. These findings highlight how advanced mental state inference abilities and human-like face processing signatures, such as inversion effects, coexist in GPT-4o alongside substantial differences in information processing compared to humans.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, through a unified gradient flow perspective of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference (VI), particle-based variational inference methods (ParVIs) have been proposed that tend to combine the best of both worlds. While typical ParVIs such as Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) approximate the gradient flow within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), many attempts have been made recently to replace RKHS with more expressive function spaces, such as neural networks. While successful, these methods are mainly designed for sampling from unconstrained domains. In this paper, we offer a general solution to constrained sampling by introducing a boundary condition for the gradient flow which would confine the particles within the specific domain. This allows us to propose a new functional gradient ParVI method for constrained sampling, called constrained functional gradient flow (CFG), with provable continuous-time convergence in total variation (TV). We also present novel numerical strategies to handle the boundary integral term arising from the domain constraints. Our theory and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Stellar evolution modelling is fundamental to many areas of astrophysics including stellar populations in both nearby and distant galaxies. It is heavily influenced by chemical composition. Observations of distant galaxies and nucleosynthesis calculations show that $\alpha$-process elements are enriched faster than iron group elements. We present a dense grid of single-star models calculated using the BPASS stellar evolution code and covering masses ($0.1\le\mathrm{M/M}_\odot\le316$), metallicity mass fractions ($10^{-5} \le Z \le 0.04$) and $\alpha$-to-iron abundance ratios ($-0.2\le[\alpha/\mathrm{Fe}]\le+0.6$). By comparing Solar-scaled models to ones enriched in $\alpha$-process elements, we find that stellar radii, surface temperatures, Main Sequence lifetimes, supernova progenitor properties and supernova rates are all sensitive to changes in [$\alpha$/Fe]. Lifetimes of low-mass stars differ by up to 0.4 dex, while surface temperatures of massive stars at the end of the Main Sequence also differ by around 0.4 dex. Inferred supernova rates when [Fe/H] is unknown can be highly uncertain. Models with different [$\alpha$/Fe] but comparable iron abundances show smaller variations, indicating that while iron primarily defines the course of evolution; $\alpha$-enhancement nonetheless has an impact of up to 0.1 dex on stellar properties. Such changes are small for individual stars, but have a large cumulative effect when considering an entire stellar population as demonstrated by isochrone fitting to nearby clusters. Changes in radii and lifetimes have further consequences for a stellar population including binary stars, as they influence the timing, nature and occurrence rate of mass transfer events.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The exponential growth of knowledge and the increasing complexity of interdisciplinary research pose significant challenges for researchers, including information overload and difficulties in exploring novel ideas. The advancements in large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have shown great potential in enhancing idea proposals, but how to effectively utilize large models for reasonable idea proposal has not been thoroughly explored. This paper proposes a scientific paper idea proposer (SciPIP). Based on a user-provided research background, SciPIP retrieves helpful papers from a literature database while leveraging the capabilities of LLMs to generate more novel and feasible ideas. To this end, 1) we construct a literature retrieval database, extracting lots of papers' multi-dimension information for fast access. Then, a literature retrieval method based on semantics, entity, and citation co-occurrences is proposed to search relevant literature from multiple aspects based on the user-provided background. 2) After literature retrieval, we introduce dual-path idea proposal strategies, where one path infers solutions from the retrieved literature and the other path generates original ideas through model brainstorming. We then combine the two to achieve a good balance between feasibility and originality. Through extensive experiments on the natural language processing (NLP) field, we demonstrate that SciPIP can retrieve citations similar to those of existing top conference papers and generate many ideas consistent with them. Additionally, we evaluate the originality of other ideas generated by SciPIP using large language models, further validating the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code and the database are released at https://github.com/cheerss/SciPIP.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The ability to resolve photon numbers is crucial in quantum information science and technology, driving the development of detectors with intrinsic photon-number resolving (PNR) capabilities. Although transition edge sensors represent the state-of-the-art in PNR performance, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) offer superior efficiency, speed, noise reduction, and timing precision. Directly inferring photon numbers, however, has only recently become feasible due to advances in readout technology. Despite this, photon-number discrimination remains constrained by the nanowire's electrical properties and readout jitter. In this work, we employ waveguide-integrated SNSPDs and time-resolved measurements to explore how the nanowire kinetic inductance and system jitter affect PNR capabilities. By analyzing the latency time of the photon detection, we can resolve changes in the rising edge of the detection pulse. We find that lower jitter as well as increased kinetic inductance enhances the pulse separation for different photon numbers and improves the PNR capability. Enhancing the kinetic inductance from 165 nH to 872 nH improves PNR quality by 12%, 31% and 23% over the first three photon numbers, though at the cost of reducing the detector's count rate from 165 Mcps to 19 Mcps. Our findings highlight the trade-off between PNR resolution and detector speed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Human-Oriented Binary Reverse Engineering (HOBRE) lies at the intersection of binary and source code, aiming to lift binary code to human-readable content relevant to source code, thereby bridging the binary-source semantic gap. Recent advancements in uni-modal code model pre-training, particularly in generative Source Code Foundation Models (SCFMs) and binary understanding models, have laid the groundwork for transfer learning applicable to HOBRE. However, existing approaches for HOBRE rely heavily on uni-modal models like SCFMs for supervised fine-tuning or general LLMs for prompting, resulting in sub-optimal performance. Inspired by recent progress in large multi-modal models, we propose that it is possible to harness the strengths of uni-modal code models from both sides to bridge the semantic gap effectively. In this paper, we introduce a novel probe-and-recover framework that incorporates a binary-source encoder-decoder model and black-box LLMs for binary analysis. Our approach leverages the pre-trained knowledge within SCFMs to synthesize relevant, symbol-rich code fragments as context. This additional context enables black-box LLMs to enhance recovery accuracy. We demonstrate significant improvements in zero-shot binary summarization and binary function name recovery, with a 10.3% relative gain in CHRF and a 16.7% relative gain in a GPT4-based metric for summarization, as well as a 6.7% and 7.4% absolute increase in token-level precision and recall for name recovery, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in automating and improving binary code analysis.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce the concept of a generative infinite game, a video game that transcends the traditional boundaries of finite, hard-coded systems by using generative models. Inspired by James P. Carse's distinction between finite and infinite games, we leverage recent advances in generative AI to create Unbounded: a game of character life simulation that is fully encapsulated in generative models. Specifically, Unbounded draws inspiration from sandbox life simulations and allows you to interact with your autonomous virtual character in a virtual world by feeding, playing with and guiding it - with open-ended mechanics generated by an LLM, some of which can be emergent. In order to develop Unbounded, we propose technical innovations in both the LLM and visual generation domains. Specifically, we present: (1) a specialized, distilled large language model (LLM) that dynamically generates game mechanics, narratives, and character interactions in real-time, and (2) a new dynamic regional image prompt Adapter (IP-Adapter) for vision models that ensures consistent yet flexible visual generation of a character across multiple environments. We evaluate our system through both qualitative and quantitative analysis, showing significant improvements in character life simulation, user instruction following, narrative coherence, and visual consistency for both characters and the environments compared to traditional related approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sea ice plays a crucial role in the climate system, particularly in the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ), a transitional area consisting of fragmented ice between the open ocean and consolidated pack ice. As the MIZ expands, understanding its dynamics becomes essential for predicting climate change impacts. However, the role of clouds in these processes has been largely overlooked. This paper addresses that gap by developing an idealized coupled atmosphere-ocean-ice model incorporating cloud and precipitation effects, tackling both forward (simulation) and inverse (data assimilation) problems. Sea ice dynamics are modeled using the discrete element method, which simulates floes driven by atmospheric and oceanic forces. The ocean is represented by a two-layer quasi-geostrophic (QG) model, capturing mesoscale eddies and ice-ocean drag. The atmosphere is modeled using a two-layer saturated precipitating QG system, accounting for variable evaporation over sea surfaces and ice. Cloud cover affects radiation, influencing ice melting. The idealized coupled modeling framework allows us to study the interactions between atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice floes. Specifically, it focuses on how clouds and precipitation affect energy balance, melting, and freezing processes. It also serves as a testbed for data assimilation, which allows the recovery of unobserved floe trajectories and ocean fields in cloud-induced uncertainties. Numerical results show that appropriate reduced-order models help improve data assimilation efficiency with partial observations, allowing the skillful inference of missing floe trajectories and lower atmospheric winds. These results imply the potential of integrating idealized models with data assimilation to improve our understanding of Arctic dynamics and predictions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work aims to advance sound event detection (SED) research by presenting a new large language model (LLM)-powered dataset namely wild domestic environment sound event detection (WildDESED). It is crafted as an extension to the original DESED dataset to reflect diverse acoustic variability and complex noises in home settings. We leveraged LLMs to generate eight different domestic scenarios based on target sound categories of the DESED dataset. Then we enriched the scenarios with a carefully tailored mixture of noises selected from AudioSet and ensured no overlap with target sound. We consider widely popular convolutional neural recurrent network to study WildDESED dataset, which depicts its challenging nature. We then apply curriculum learning by gradually increasing noise complexity to enhance the model's generalization capabilities across various noise levels. Our results with this approach show improvements within the noisy environment, validating the effectiveness on the WildDESED dataset promoting noise-robust SED advancements.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Frequently updating Large Language Model (LLM)-based recommender systems to adapt to new user interests -- as done for traditional ones -- is impractical due to high training costs, even with acceleration methods. This work explores adapting to dynamic user interests without any model updates by leveraging In-Context Learning (ICL), which allows LLMs to learn new tasks from few-shot examples provided in the input. Using new-interest examples as the ICL few-shot examples, LLMs may learn real-time interest directly, avoiding the need for model updates. However, existing LLM-based recommenders often lose the in-context learning ability during recommendation tuning, while the original LLM's in-context learning lacks recommendation-specific focus. To address this, we propose RecICL, which customizes recommendation-specific in-context learning for real-time recommendations. RecICL organizes training examples in an in-context learning format, ensuring that in-context learning ability is preserved and aligned with the recommendation task during tuning.   Extensive experiments demonstrate RecICL's effectiveness in delivering real-time recommendations without requiring model updates. Our code is available at https://github.com/ym689/rec_icl.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) achieve good performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks, yet could also make basic reasoning mistakes. This contrasting behavior is puzzling when it comes to understanding the mechanisms behind LLMs' reasoning capabilities. One hypothesis is that the increasingly high and nearly saturated performance on common reasoning benchmarks could be due to the memorization of similar problems. In this paper, we systematically investigate this hypothesis with a quantitative measurement of memorization in reasoning tasks, using a dynamically generated logical reasoning benchmark based on Knights and Knaves (K&K) puzzles. We found that LLMs could interpolate the training puzzles (achieving near-perfect accuracy) after fine-tuning, yet fail when those puzzles are slightly perturbed, suggesting that the models heavily rely on memorization to solve those training puzzles. On the other hand, we show that while fine-tuning leads to heavy memorization, it also consistently improves generalization performance. In-depth analyses with perturbation tests, cross difficulty-level transferability, probing model internals, and fine-tuning with wrong answers suggest that the LLMs learn to reason on K&K puzzles despite training data memorization. This phenomenon indicates that LLMs exhibit a complex interplay between memorization and genuine reasoning abilities. Finally, our analysis with per-sample memorization score sheds light on how LLMs switch between reasoning and memorization in solving logical puzzles.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Increasing the size of large language models (LLMs) has been shown to lead to better performance. However, this comes at the cost of slower and more expensive inference. Early-exiting is a promising approach for improving the efficiency of LLM inference by enabling next token prediction at intermediate layers. Yet, the large vocabulary size in modern LLMs makes the confidence estimation required for exit decisions computationally expensive, diminishing the efficiency gains. To address this, we propose dynamically pruning the vocabulary at test time for each token. Specifically, the vocabulary is pruned at one of the initial layers, and the smaller vocabulary is then used throughout the rest of the forward pass. Our experiments demonstrate that such post-hoc dynamic vocabulary pruning improves the efficiency of confidence estimation in early-exit LLMs while maintaining competitive performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, particularly in task generalization for both text and vision data. While fine-tuning these models can significantly enhance their performance on specific downstream tasks, it often requires high-quality data that cannot be shared due to privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution for collaborative training without direct data sharing. However, many parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for LLMs in FL, particularly those based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), face limitations. In this paper, we critically analyze the convergence and performance guarantees of popular FL frameworks utilizing LoRA, highlighting its suboptimal nature due to constrained subspace learning of low-rank matrices. This limitation hinders effective fine-tuning of LLMs in federated settings. Through rigorous analytical and empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that direct weight averaging outperforms LoRA-based strategies, leading to superior performance for fine-tuned models. Our comprehensive comparison exposes inefficiencies in LoRA approaches and underscores the advantages of full-rank weight aggregation. We extend our analysis to low-rank gradient-based optimizers, such as GaLore, used during local training steps. Our findings show that GaLore is a more effective alternative, outperforming federated LoRA methods like FlexLoRA and FFA-LoRA across both text and image modalities. While privacy remains paramount in FL discourse, our focus is on assessing performance outcomes of federated fine-tuned models and evaluating various FL frameworks from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Our findings advocate reassessing the reliance on LoRA within FL contexts, paving the way for more efficient training methodologies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural language questions over large-scale knowledge bases (KBs), which can be summarized into two crucial steps: knowledge retrieval and semantic parsing. However, three core challenges remain: inefficient knowledge retrieval, mistakes of retrieval adversely impacting semantic parsing, and the complexity of previous KBQA methods. To tackle these challenges, we introduce ChatKBQA, a novel and simple generate-then-retrieve KBQA framework, which proposes first generating the logical form with fine-tuned LLMs, then retrieving and replacing entities and relations with an unsupervised retrieval method, to improve both generation and retrieval more directly. Experimental results show that ChatKBQA achieves new state-of-the-art performance on standard KBQA datasets, WebQSP, and CWQ. This work can also be regarded as a new paradigm for combining LLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs) for interpretable and knowledge-required question answering. Our code is publicly available.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In-context learning can help Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt new tasks without additional training. However, this performance heavily depends on the quality of the demonstrations, driving research into effective demonstration selection algorithms to optimize this process. These algorithms assist users in selecting the best $k$ input-label pairs (demonstration examples) based on a given test input, enabling LLMs to in-context learn the relationship between the provided examples and the test inputs. Despite all the proposed demonstration selection algorithms, their efficiency and effectiveness remain unclear. This lack of clarity make it difficult to apply these algorithms in real-world scenarios and poses challenges for future research aimed at developing improved methods. This paper revisits six proposed algorithms, evaluating them on five datasets from both efficiency and effectiveness perspectives. Our experiments reveal significant variations in algorithm performance across different tasks, with some methods struggling to outperform random selection in certain scenarios. We also find that increasing the number of demonstrations does not always lead to better performance, and that there are often trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a powerful paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) through external knowledge retrieval. Despite its widespread attention, existing academic research predominantly focuses on single-turn RAG, leaving a significant gap in addressing the complexities of multi-turn conversations found in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce CORAL, a large-scale benchmark designed to assess RAG systems in realistic multi-turn conversational settings. CORAL includes diverse information-seeking conversations automatically derived from Wikipedia and tackles key challenges such as open-domain coverage, knowledge intensity, free-form responses, and topic shifts. It supports three core tasks of conversational RAG: passage retrieval, response generation, and citation labeling. We propose a unified framework to standardize various conversational RAG methods and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of these methods on CORAL, demonstrating substantial opportunities for improving existing approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have activated the capabilitiesof Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving visual-language tasks by integratingvisual information. The prevailing approach in existing MLLMs involvesemploying an image encoder to extract visual features, converting thesefeatures into visual tokens via an adapter, and then integrating them with theprompt into the LLM. However, because the process of image encoding isprompt-agnostic, the extracted visual features only provide a coarsedescription of the image, impossible to focus on the requirements of theprompt. On one hand, it is easy for image features to lack information aboutthe prompt-specified objects, resulting in unsatisfactory responses. On theother hand, the visual features contain a large amount of irrelevantinformation, which not only increases the burden on memory but also worsens thegeneration effectiveness. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose\textbf{PIP-MM}, a framework that \textbf{P}re-\textbf{I}ntegrates\textbf{P}rompt information into the visual encoding process using existingmodules of MLLMs. Specifically, We utilize the frozen LLM in the MLLM tovectorize the input prompt, which summarizes the requirements of the prompt.Then, we input the prompt vector into our trained Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)to align with the visual input requirements, and subsequently replace the classembedding in the image encoder. Since our model only requires adding atrainable MLP, it can be applied to any MLLM. To validate the effectiveness ofPIP-MM, we conducted experiments on multiple benchmarks. Automated evaluationmetrics and manual assessments demonstrate the strong performance of PIP-MM.Particularly noteworthy is that our model maintains excellent generationresults even when half of the visual tokens are reduced.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Compute-in-memory (CIM) accelerators for spiking neural networks (SNNs) are promising solutions to enable $\mu$s-level inference latency and ultra-low energy in edge vision applications. Yet, their current lack of flexibility at both the circuit and system levels prevents their deployment in a wide range of real-life scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel digital CIM macro that supports arbitrary operand resolution and shape, with a unified CIM storage for weights and membrane potentials. These circuit-level techniques enable a hybrid weight- and output-stationary dataflow at the system level to maximize operand reuse, thereby minimizing costly on- and off-chip data movements during the SNN execution. Measurement results of a fabricated FlexSpIM prototype in 40-nm CMOS demonstrate a 2$\times$ increase in bit-normalized energy efficiency compared to prior fixed-precision digital CIM-SNNs, while providing resolution reconfiguration with bitwise granularity. Our approach can save up to 90% energy in large-scale systems, while reaching a state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 95.8% on the IBM DVS gesture dataset.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Molecule optimization is a critical task in drug discovery to optimize desired properties of a given molecule through chemical modification. Despite Large Language Models (LLMs) holding the potential to efficiently simulate this task by using natural language to direct the optimization, straightforwardly utilizing shows limited performance. In this work, we facilitate utilizing LLMs in an iterative paradigm by proposing a simple yet highly effective domain feedback provider, namely $\text{Re}^3$DF. In detail, $\text{Re}^3$DF harnesses an external toolkit, RDKit, to handle the molecule hallucination, if the modified molecule is chemically invalid. Otherwise, its desired properties are computed and compared to the original one, establishing reliable domain feedback with correct direction and distance towards the objective, followed by a retrieved example, to explicitly guide the LLM to refine the modified molecule. We conduct experiments across both single- and multi-property objectives with 2 thresholds, where $\text{Re}^3$DF shows significant improvements. Particularly, for 20 single-property objectives, $\text{Re}^3$DF enhances Hit ratio by 16.95% and 20.76% under loose and strict thresholds, respectively. For 32 multi-property objectives, $\text{Re}^3$DF enhances Hit ratio by 6.04% and 5.25%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are essential in natural language processing but often struggle with inference speed and computational efficiency, limiting real-time deployment. The key-value (KV) cache mechanism reduces computational overhead in transformer models, but challenges in maintaining contextual understanding remain. In this paper, we propose BUZZ, a novel KV caching algorithm that leverages structured contextual information to minimize cache memory usage while enhancing inference speed. BUZZ employs a beehive-structured sparse cache, incorporating a sliding window to capture recent information and dynamically segmenting historical tokens into chunks to prioritize important tokens in local neighborhoods. We evaluate BUZZ on four real-world datasets: CNN/Daily Mail, XSUM, Wikitext, and 10-QA. Our results demonstrate that BUZZ (1) reduces cache memory usage by $\textbf{2.5}\times$ in LLM inference while maintaining over 99% accuracy in long-text summarization, and (2) surpasses state-of-the-art performance in multi-document question answering by $\textbf{7.69%}$ under the same memory limit, where full cache methods encounter out-of-memory issues. Additionally, BUZZ achieves significant inference speedup with a $\log{n}$ time complexity. The code is available at https://github.com/JunqiZhao888/buzz-llm.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The computational challenges of Large Language Model (LLM) inference remain a significant barrier to their widespread deployment, especially as prompt lengths continue to increase. Due to the quadratic complexity of the attention computation, it takes 30 minutes for an 8B LLM to process a prompt of 1M tokens (i.e., the pre-filling stage) on a single A100 GPU. Existing methods for speeding up prefilling often fail to maintain acceptable accuracy or efficiency when applied to long-context LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce MInference (Milliontokens Inference), a sparse calculation method designed to accelerate pre-filling of long-sequence processing. Specifically, we identify three unique patterns in long-context attention matrices-the A-shape, Vertical-Slash, and Block-Sparsethat can be leveraged for efficient sparse computation on GPUs. We determine the optimal pattern for each attention head offline and dynamically build sparse indices based on the assigned pattern during inference. With the pattern and sparse indices, we perform efficient sparse attention calculations via our optimized GPU kernels to significantly reduce the latency in the pre-filling stage of long-context LLMs. Our proposed technique can be directly applied to existing LLMs without any modifications to the pre-training setup or additional fine-tuning. By evaluating on a wide range of downstream tasks, including InfiniteBench, RULER, PG-19, and Needle In A Haystack, and models including LLaMA-3-1M, GLM4-1M, Yi-200K, Phi-3-128K, and Qwen2-128K, we demonstrate that MInference effectively reduces inference latency by up to 10x for pre-filling on an A100, while maintaining accuracy.

Existing workflow evaluation frameworks either focus solely on holistic performance or suffer from limitations such as restricted scenario coverage, simplistic workflow structures, and lax evaluation standards. To this end, we introduce WorFBench, a unified workflow generation benchmark with multi-faceted scenarios and intricate graph workflow structures. Additionally, we present WorFEval, a systemic evaluation protocol utilizing subsequence and subgraph matching algorithms to accurately quantify the LLM agent's workflow generation capabilities. Through comprehensive evaluations across different types of LLMs, we discover distinct gaps between the sequence planning capabilities and graph planning capabilities of LLM agents, with even GPT-4 exhibiting a gap of around 15%. We also train two open-source models and evaluate their generalization abilities on held-out tasks. Furthermore, we observe that the generated workflows can enhance downstream tasks, enabling them to achieve superior performance with less time during inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce MPLSandbox, an out-of-the-box multi-programming language sandbox designed to provide unified and comprehensive feedback from compiler and analysis tools for Large Language Models (LLMs). It can automatically identify the programming language of the code, compiling and executing it within an isolated sub-sandbox to ensure safety and stability. In addition, MPLSandbox also integrates both traditional and LLM-based code analysis tools, providing a comprehensive analysis of generated code. MPLSandbox can be effortlessly integrated into the training and deployment of LLMs to improve the quality and correctness of their generated code. It also helps researchers streamline their workflows for various LLM-based code-related tasks, reducing the development cost. To validate the effectiveness of MPLSandbox, we integrate it into training and deployment approaches, and also employ it to optimize workflows for a wide range of real-world code-related tasks. Our goal is to enhance researcher productivity on LLM-based code-related tasks by simplifying and automating workflows through delegation to MPLSandbox.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Knowledge distillation (KD) is widely used to train small, high-performing student language models (LMs) using large teacher LMs. While effective in fine-tuning, KD during pre-training faces challenges in efficiency, flexibility, and effectiveness. Existing methods either incur high computational costs due to online teacher inference, require tokenization matching between teacher and student LMs, or risk losing the difficulty and diversity of the teacher-generated training data. To address these issues, we propose MiniPLM, a KD framework for pre-training LMs by refining the training data distribution with the teacher's knowledge. For efficiency, MiniPLM performs offline teacher LM inference, allowing KD for multiple student LMs without adding training-time costs. For flexibility, MiniPLM operates solely on the training corpus, enabling KD across model families. For effectiveness, MiniPLM leverages the differences between large and small LMs to enhance the difficulty and diversity of the training data, helping student LMs acquire versatile and sophisticated knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MiniPLM boosts the student LMs' performance on 9 widely used downstream tasks, improves the language modeling capabilities, and reduces pre-training computation. The benefit of MiniPLM extends to large pre-training scales, evidenced by the extrapolation of the scaling curves. Further analysis reveals that MiniPLM supports KD across model families and enhances the utilization of pre-training data. Our model, code, and data are available at https://github.com/thu-coai/MiniPLM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work takes a pedagogical lens to explore the implications of generative AI (GenAI) models and tools, such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, in a semester-long 2nd-year undergraduate Software Engineering Team Project. Qualitative findings from survey (39 students) and interviews (eight students) provide insights into the students' views on the impact of GenAI use on their coding experience, learning, and self-efficacy. Our results address a particular gap in understanding the role and implications of GenAI on teamwork, team-efficacy, and team dynamics. The analysis of the learning aspects is distinguished by the application of learning and pedagogy informed lenses to discuss the data. We propose a preliminary design space for GenAI-based programming learning tools highlighting the importance of considering the roles that GenAI can play during the learning process, the varying support-ability patterns that can be applied to each role, and the importance of supporting transparency in GenAI for team members and students in addition to educators.

Moreover, current systems frequently rely solely on text input and typically focus on producing complete musical pieces, which is incompatible with existing workflows in music production. To address these issues, we introduce "Diff-A-Riff," a Latent Diffusion Model designed to generate high-quality instrumental accompaniments adaptable to any musical context. This model offers control through either audio references, text prompts, or both, and produces 48kHz pseudo-stereo audio while significantly reducing inference time and memory usage.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Robot swarms are composed of many simple robots that communicate and collaborate to fulfill complex tasks. Robot controllers usually need to be specified by experts on a case-by-case basis via programming code. This process is time-consuming, prone to errors, and unable to take into account all situations that may be encountered during deployment. On the other hand, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated reasoning and planning capabilities, introduced new ways to interact with and program machines, and incorporate both domain-specific and commonsense knowledge. Hence, we propose to address the aforementioned challenges by integrating LLMs with robot swarms and show the potential in proofs of concept (showcases). For this integration, we explore two approaches. The first approach is 'indirect integration,' where LLMs are used to synthesize and validate the robot controllers. This approach may reduce development time and human error before deployment. Moreover, during deployment, it could be used for on-the-fly creation of new robot behaviors. The second approach is 'direct integration,' where each robot locally executes a separate LLM instance during deployment for robot-robot collaboration and human-swarm interaction. These local LLM instances enable each robot to reason, plan, and collaborate using natural language, as demonstrated in our showcases where the robots are able to detect a variety of anomalies, without prior information about the nature of these anomalies. To enable further research on our mainly conceptual contribution, we release the software and videos for our LLM2Swarm system: https://github.com/Pold87/LLM2Swarm.

Existing benchmarks provide general evaluations but do not sufficiently address the practical and applied aspects of LLM performance in cybersecurity-specific tasks. To address this gap, we introduce the SECURE (Security Extraction, Understanding \& Reasoning Evaluation), a benchmark designed to assess LLMs performance in realistic cybersecurity scenarios. SECURE includes six datasets focussed on the Industrial Control System sector to evaluate knowledge extraction, understanding, and reasoning based on industry-standard sources. Our study evaluates seven state-of-the-art models on these tasks, providing insights into their strengths and weaknesses in cybersecurity contexts, and offer recommendations for improving LLMs reliability as cyber advisory tools.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing capabilities of large generative models and their ever more widespread deployment have raised concerns about their reliability, safety, and potential misuse. To address these issues, recent works have proposed to control model generation by steering model activations in order to effectively induce or prevent the emergence of concepts or behaviors in the generated output. In this paper we introduce Activation Transport (AcT), a general framework to steer activations guided by optimal transport theory that generalizes many previous activation-steering works. AcT is modality-agnostic and provides fine-grained control over the model behavior with negligible computational overhead, while minimally impacting model abilities. We experimentally show the effectiveness and versatility of our approach by addressing key challenges in large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image diffusion models (T2Is). For LLMs, we show that AcT can effectively mitigate toxicity, induce arbitrary concepts, and increase their truthfulness. In T2Is, we show how AcT enables fine-grained style control and concept negation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this work we consider Code World Models, world models generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) in the form of Python code for model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). Calling code instead of LLMs for planning has potential to be more precise, reliable, interpretable, and extremely efficient. However, writing appropriate Code World Models requires the ability to understand complex instructions, to generate exact code with non-trivial logic and to self-debug a long program with feedback from unit tests and environment trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose Generate, Improve and Fix with Monte Carlo Tree Search (GIF-MCTS), a new code generation strategy for LLMs. To test our approach in an offline RL setting, we introduce the Code World Models Benchmark (CWMB), a suite of program synthesis and planning tasks comprised of 18 diverse RL environments paired with corresponding textual descriptions and curated trajectories. GIF-MCTS surpasses all baselines on the CWMB and two other benchmarks, and we show that the Code World Models synthesized with it can be successfully used for planning, resulting in model-based RL agents with greatly improved sample efficiency and inference speed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models excel in tasks like natural language understanding and text generation. Prompt engineering plays a critical role in leveraging LLM effectively. However, LLMs black-box nature hinders its interpretability and effective prompting engineering. A wide range of model explanation approaches have been developed for deep learning models, However, these local explanations are designed for single-output tasks like classification and regression,and cannot be directly applied to LLMs, which generate sequences of tokens. Recent efforts in LLM explanation focus on natural language explanations, but they are prone to hallucinations and inaccuracies. To address this, we introduce PromptExp , a framework for multi-granularity prompt explanations by aggregating token-level insights. PromptExp introduces two token-level explanation approaches: 1. an aggregation-based approach combining local explanation techniques, and 2. a perturbation-based approach with novel techniques to evaluate token masking impact. PromptExp supports both white-box and black-box explanations and extends explanations to higher granularity levels, enabling flexible analysis. We evaluate PromptExp in case studies such as sentiment analysis, showing the perturbation-based approach performs best using semantic similarity to assess perturbation impact. Furthermore, we conducted a user study to confirm PromptExp's accuracy and practical value, and demonstrate its potential to enhance LLM interpretability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As LLMs exhibit a high degree of human-like capability, increasing attention has been paid to role-playing research areas in which responses generated by LLMs are expected to mimic human replies. This has promoted the exploration of role-playing agents in various applications, such as chatbots that can engage in natural conversations with users and virtual assistants that can provide personalized support and guidance. The crucial factor in the role-playing task is the effective utilization of character memory, which stores characters' profiles, experiences, and historical dialogues. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technology is used to access the related memory to enhance the response generation of role-playing agents. Most existing studies retrieve related information based on the semantic similarity of memory to maintain characters' personalized traits, and few attempts have been made to incorporate the emotional factor in the retrieval argument generation (RAG) of LLMs. Inspired by the Mood-Dependent Memory theory, which indicates that people recall an event better if they somehow reinstate during recall the original emotion they experienced during learning, we propose a novel emotion-aware memory retrieval framework, termed Emotional RAG, which recalls the related memory with consideration of emotional state in role-playing agents. Specifically, we design two kinds of retrieval strategies, i.e., combination strategy and sequential strategy, to incorporate both memory semantic and emotional states during the retrieval process. Extensive experiments on three representative role-playing datasets demonstrate that our Emotional RAG framework outperforms the method without considering the emotional factor in maintaining the personalities of role-playing agents. This provides evidence to further reinforce the Mood-Dependent Memory theory in psychology.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Instruction-following is crucial for building AI agents with large language models (LLMs), as these models must adhere strictly to user-provided constraints and guidelines. However, LLMs often fail to follow even simple and clear instructions. To improve instruction-following behavior and prevent undesirable outputs, a deeper understanding of how LLMs' internal states relate to these outcomes is required. Our analysis of LLM internal states reveal a dimension in the input embedding space linked to successful instruction-following. We demonstrate that modifying representations along this dimension improves instruction-following success rates compared to random changes, without compromising response quality. Further investigation reveals that this dimension is more closely related to the phrasing of prompts rather than the inherent difficulty of the task or instructions. This discovery also suggests explanations for why LLMs sometimes fail to follow clear instructions and why prompt engineering is often effective, even when the content remains largely unchanged. This work provides insight into the internal workings of LLMs' instruction-following, paving the way for reliable LLM agents.

  Implications for Millimeter-wave Observations of CO Isotopologues</h2>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Observations of CO isotopologue emission from protoplanetary disks at millimeter wavelengths are a powerful tool for probing the CO snowline, an important marker for disk chemistry, and also for estimating total disk gas mass, a key quantity for planet formation. We use simple models to demonstrate that the vertical thickness of an isothermal layer around the disk midplane has important effects on the CO column density radial profile, with a thick layer producing a sharp CO snowline transition. We simulate ngVLA and ALMA images to show that this sharp change in CO column density can be detected in the derivative of the radial profile of emission from optically thin CO isotopologue lines. We apply this method to archival ALMA observations of the disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296 in the C$^{17}$O and C$^{18}$O J=1-0 and J=2-1 lines to identify a sharp CO snowline transition near 80 au (0.8 arcsec at 101 pc), and show the CO column density decreases by more than a factor of 20. This finding is consistent with previous inferences from the steep rise of N$_2$H$^+$ emission, which marks the location where CO depletes. We also demonstrate that the disk's thermal structure introduces a significant systematic uncertainty to estimates of total disk gas mass derived from these lines. The substantial improvement in sensitivity envisioned for the ngVLA over ALMA for observations of ground state lines of CO isotopologues has the potential to extend this approach to a much larger population of disks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Automatically synthesizing dense rewards from natural language descriptions is a promising paradigm in reinforcement learning (RL), with applications to sparse reward problems, open-ended exploration, and hierarchical skill design. Recent works have made promising steps by exploiting the prior knowledge of large language models (LLMs). However, these approaches suffer from important limitations: they are either not scalable to problems requiring billions of environment samples; or are limited to reward functions expressible by compact code, which may require source code and have difficulty capturing nuanced semantics; or require a diverse offline dataset, which may not exist or be impossible to collect. In this work, we address these limitations through a combination of algorithmic and systems-level contributions. We propose ONI, a distributed architecture that simultaneously learns an RL policy and an intrinsic reward function using LLM feedback. Our approach annotates the agent's collected experience via an asynchronous LLM server, which is then distilled into an intrinsic reward model. We explore a range of algorithmic choices for reward modeling with varying complexity, including hashing, classification, and ranking models. By studying their relative tradeoffs, we shed light on questions regarding intrinsic reward design for sparse reward problems. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of challenging, sparse reward tasks from the NetHack Learning Environment in a simple unified process, solely using the agent's gathered experience, without requiring external datasets nor source code. We make our code available at \url{URL} (coming soon).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this work, we introduce a generalized framework for multiscale state-space modeling that incorporates nested nonlinear dynamics, with a specific focus on Bayesian learning under switching regimes. Our framework captures the complex interactions between fast and slow processes within systems, allowing for the analysis of how these dynamics influence each other across various temporal scales. We model these interactions through a hierarchical structure in which finer time-scale dynamics are nested within coarser ones, while facilitating feedback between the scales. To promote the practical application of our framework, we address the problem of identifying switching regimes and transient dynamics. In particular, we develop a Bayesian learning approach to estimate latent states and indicators corresponding to switching dynamics, enabling the model to adapt effectively to regime changes. We employ Sequential Monte Carlo, or particle filtering, for inference. We illustrate the utility of our framework through simulations. The results demonstrate that our Bayesian learning approach effectively tracks state transitions and achieves accurate identification of switching dynamics in multiscale systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the evolving landscape of online communication, moderating hate speech (HS) presents an intricate challenge, compounded by the multimodal nature of digital content. This comprehensive survey delves into the recent strides in HS moderation, spotlighting the burgeoning role of large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs). Our exploration begins with a thorough analysis of current literature, revealing the nuanced interplay between textual, visual, and auditory elements in propagating HS. We uncover a notable trend towards integrating these modalities, primarily due to the complexity and subtlety with which HS is disseminated. A significant emphasis is placed on the advances facilitated by LLMs and LMMs, which have begun to redefine the boundaries of detection and moderation capabilities. We identify existing gaps in research, particularly in the context of underrepresented languages and cultures, and the need for solutions to handle low-resource settings. The survey concludes with a forward-looking perspective, outlining potential avenues for future research, including the exploration of novel AI methodologies, the ethical governance of AI in moderation, and the development of more nuanced, context-aware systems. This comprehensive overview aims to catalyze further research and foster a collaborative effort towards more sophisticated, responsible, and human-centric approaches to HS moderation in the digital era.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present a novel approach for long-term human trajectory prediction in indoor human-centric environments, which is essential for long-horizon robot planning in these environments. State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment. In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged (i.e., evaluated in a zero-shot fashion on the dataset) baselines for a time horizon of 60s.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The advent of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has spurred research into their applications in multi-modal contexts, particularly in video understanding. Traditional VideoQA benchmarks, despite providing quantitative metrics, often fail to encompass the full spectrum of video content and inadequately assess models' temporal comprehension. To address these limitations, we introduce MMBench-Video, a quantitative benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LVLMs' proficiency in video understanding. MMBench-Video incorporates lengthy videos from YouTube and employs free-form questions, mirroring practical use cases. The benchmark is meticulously crafted to probe the models' temporal reasoning skills, with all questions human-annotated according to a carefully constructed ability taxonomy. We employ GPT-4 for automated assessment, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness over earlier LLM-based evaluations. Utilizing MMBench-Video, we have conducted comprehensive evaluations that include both proprietary and open-source LVLMs for images and videos. MMBench-Video stands as a valuable resource for the research community, facilitating improved evaluation of LVLMs and catalyzing progress in the field of video understanding. The evalutation code of MMBench-Video will be integrated into VLMEvalKit: https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Stellar evolution theories predict a gap in the black hole birth mass spectrum as the result of pair instability processes in the cores of massive stars.This gap, however, is not seen in the binary black hole masses inferred from gravitational wave data. One explanation is that black holes form dynamically in dense star clusters where smaller black holes merge to form more massive black holes, populating the mass gap. We show that this model predicts a distribution of the effective and precessing spin parameters, $\chi_{\rm eff}$ and $\chi_{\rm p}$, within the mass gap that is insensitive to assumptions about black hole natal spins and other astrophysical parameters. We analyze the distribution of $\chi_{\rm eff}$ as a function of primary mass for the black hole binaries in the third gravitational wave transient catalog. We infer the presence of a high-mass and isotropically spinning population of black holes that is consistent with hierarchical formation in dense star clusters and a pair-instability mass gap with a lower edge at $44^{+6}_{-4} M_\odot$. We compute a Bayes factor $\mathcal{B}>10^4$ relative to models that do not allow for a high-mass population with a distinct $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution.

First, we upgrade the underlying autoencoder to a stereo-capable model with superior fidelity and replace the latent U-Net with a Diffusion Transformer. Additionally, we refine text prompting by training a cross-modality predictive network to translate text-derived CLAP embeddings to audio-derived CLAP embeddings. Finally, we improve inference speed by training the latent model using a consistency framework, achieving competitive quality with fewer denoising steps. Our model is evaluated against the original Diff-A-Riff variant using objective metrics in ablation experiments, demonstrating promising advancements in all targeted areas.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising approach to address the limitations of fixed knowledge in large language models (LLMs). However, current benchmarks for evaluating RAG systems suffer from two key deficiencies: (1) they fail to adequately measure LLMs' capability in handling long-context retrieval due to a lack of datasets that reflect the characteristics of retrieved documents, and (2) they lack a comprehensive evaluation method for assessing LLMs' ability to generate long-form responses that effectively exploits retrieved information. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the Long$^2$RAG benchmark and the Key Point Recall (KPR) metric. Long$^2$RAG comprises 280 questions spanning 10 domains and across 8 question categories, each associated with 5 retrieved documents with an average length of 2,444 words. KPR evaluates the extent to which LLMs incorporate key points extracted from the retrieved documents into their generated responses, providing a more nuanced assessment of their ability to exploit retrieved information.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To analyze the flow of information online, experts often rely on platform-provided data from social media companies, which typically attribute all resharing actions to an original poster. This obscures the true dynamics of how information spreads online, as users can be exposed to content in various ways. While most researchers analyze data as it is provided by the platform and overlook this issue, some attempt to infer the structure of these information cascades. However, the absence of ground truth about actual diffusion cascades makes verifying the efficacy of these efforts impossible. This study investigates the implications of the common practice of ignoring reconstruction all together. Two case studies involving data from Twitter and Bluesky reveal that reconstructing cascades significantly alters the identification of influential users, therefore affecting downstream analyses in general. We also propose a novel reconstruction approach that allows us to evaluate the effects of different assumptions made during the cascade inference procedure. Analysis of the diffusion of over 40,000 true and false news stories on Twitter reveals that the assumptions made during the reconstruction procedure drastically distort both microscopic and macroscopic properties of cascade networks. This work highlights the challenges of studying information spreading processes on complex networks and has significant implications for the broader study of digital platforms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mammographic density is a dynamic risk factor for breast cancer and affects the sensitivity of mammography-based screening. While automated machine and deep learning-based methods provide more consistent and precise measurements compared to subjective BI-RADS assessments, they often fail to account for the longitudinal evolution of density. Many of these methods assess mammographic density in a cross-sectional manner, overlooking correlations in repeated measures, irregular visit intervals, missing data, and informative dropouts. Joint models, however, are well-suited for capturing the longitudinal relationship between biomarkers and survival outcomes. We present the DeepJoint algorithm, an open-source solution that integrates deep learning for quantitative mammographic density estimation with joint modeling to assess the longitudinal relationship between mammographic density and breast cancer risk. Our method efficiently analyzes processed mammograms from various manufacturers, estimating both dense area and percent density--established risk factors for breast cancer. We utilize a joint model to explore their association with breast cancer risk and provide individualized risk predictions. Bayesian inference and the Monte Carlo consensus algorithm make the approach reliable for large screening datasets. Our method allows for accurate analysis of processed mammograms from multiple manufacturers, offering a comprehensive view of breast cancer risk based on individual longitudinal density profiles. The complete pipeline is publicly available, promoting broader application and comparison with other methods.

Previous works have investigated various prompt engineering techniques for improving the performance of \glspl{LLM} to accomplish tasks, while others have proposed methods that utilize LLMs to plan and execute tasks based on the available functionalities of a given robot platform. In this work, we consider both lines of research by comparing prompt engineering techniques and combinations thereof within the application of high-level task planning and execution in service robotics. We define a diverse set of tasks and a simple set of functionalities in simulation, and measure task completion accuracy and execution time for several state-of-the-art models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Although previous research on large language models (LLMs) and large multi-modal models (LMMs) has systematically explored mathematical problem-solving (MPS) within visual contexts, the analysis of how these models process visual information during problem-solving remains insufficient. To address this gap, we present VisAidMath, a benchmark for evaluating the MPS process related to visual information. We follow a rigorous data curation pipeline involving both automated processes and manual annotations to ensure data quality and reliability. Consequently, this benchmark includes 1,200 challenging problems from various mathematical branches, vision-aid formulations, and difficulty levels, collected from diverse sources such as textbooks, examination papers, and Olympiad problems. Based on the proposed benchmark, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on ten mainstream LLMs and LMMs, highlighting deficiencies in the visual-aided reasoning process. For example, GPT-4V only achieves 45.33% accuracy in the visual-aided reasoning task, even with a drop of 2 points when provided with golden visual aids. In-depth analysis reveals that the main cause of deficiencies lies in hallucination regarding the implicit visual reasoning process, shedding light on future research directions in the visual-aided MPS process.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) enriches the expressiveness of variational families by utilizing a kernel and a mixing distribution to hierarchically define the variational distribution. Existing SIVI methods parameterize the mixing distribution using implicit distributions, leading to intractable variational densities. As a result, directly maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO) is not possible, so they resort to one of the following: optimizing bounds on the ELBO, employing costly inner-loop Markov chain Monte Carlo runs, or solving minimax objectives. In this paper, we propose a novel method for SIVI called Particle Variational Inference (PVI) which employs empirical measures to approximate the optimal mixing distributions characterized as the minimizer of a free energy functional. PVI arises naturally as a particle approximation of a Euclidean--Wasserstein gradient flow and, unlike prior works, it directly optimizes the ELBO whilst making no parametric assumption about the mixing distribution. Our empirical results demonstrate that PVI performs favourably compared to other SIVI methods across various tasks. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis of the behaviour of the gradient flow of a related free energy functional: establishing the existence and uniqueness of solutions as well as propagation of chaos results.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Robust modeling of non-linear scales is critical for accurate cosmological inference in Stage IV surveys. For weak lensing analyses in particular, a key challenge arises from the incomplete understanding of how non-gravitational processes, such as supernovae and active galactic nuclei - collectively known as baryonic feedback - affect the matter distribution. Several existing methods for modeling baryonic feedback treat it independently from the underlying cosmology, an assumption which has been found to be inaccurate by hydrodynamical simulations. In this work, we examine the impact of this coupling between baryonic feedback and cosmology on parameter inference at LSST Y1 precision. We build mock 3$\times$2pt data vectors using the Magneticum suite of hydrodynamical simulations, which span a wide range of cosmologies while keeping subgrid parameters fixed. We perform simulated likelihood analyses for two baryon mitigation techniques: (i) the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method which identifies eigenmodes for capturing the effect baryonic feedback on the data vector and (ii) HMCode2020 (Mead et al. 2021) which analytically models the modification in the matter distribution using a halo model approach. Our results show that the PCA method is robust to the coupling between cosmology and baryonic feedback, whereas, when using HMCode2020 there can be up to $0.5\sigma$ bias in $\Omega_\text{m}$-$S_8$. For HMCode2020, the bias also correlates with the input cosmology while for PCA we find no such correlation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> 6-DoF grasp detection is critically important for the advancement of intelligent embodied systems, as it provides feasible robot poses for object grasping. Various methods have been proposed to detect 6-DoF grasps through the extraction of 3D geometric features from RGBD or point cloud data. However, most of these approaches encounter challenges during real robot deployment due to their significant computational demands, which can be particularly problematic for mobile robot platforms, especially those reliant on edge computing devices. This paper presents an Efficient End-to-End Grasp Detection Network (E3GNet) for 6-DoF grasp detection utilizing hierarchical heatmap representations. E3GNet effectively identifies high-quality and diverse grasps in cluttered real-world environments. Benefiting from our end-to-end methodology and efficient network design, our approach surpasses previous methods in model inference efficiency and achieves real-time 6-Dof grasp detection on edge devices. Furthermore, real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a satisfactory 94% object grasping success rate.

Recent research shows their strengths, with performance reaching that of auto-regressive LLMs. But are they also good in generating synthetic data if the training was under differential privacy? Here the evidence is missing, yet the promises from private image generation look strong. In this paper we address this open question by extensive experiments. At the same time, we critically assess (and reimplement) previous works on synthetic private text generation with LLMs and reveal some unmet assumptions that might have led to violating the differential privacy guarantees. Our results partly contradict previous non-private findings and show that fully open-source LLMs outperform diffusion models in the privacy regime. Our complete source codes, datasets, and experimental setup is publicly available to foster future research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Image restoration has experienced significant advancements due to the development of deep learning. Nevertheless, it encounters challenges related to ill-posed problems, resulting in deviations between single model predictions and ground-truths. Ensemble learning, as a powerful machine learning technique, aims to address these deviations by combining the predictions of multiple base models. Most existing works adopt ensemble learning during the design of restoration models, while only limited research focuses on the inference-stage ensemble of pre-trained restoration models. Regression-based methods fail to enable efficient inference, leading researchers in academia and industry to prefer averaging as their choice for post-training ensemble. To address this, we reformulate the ensemble problem of image restoration into Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and employ an expectation maximization (EM)-based algorithm to estimate ensemble weights for aggregating prediction candidates. We estimate the range-wise ensemble weights on a reference set and store them in a lookup table (LUT) for efficient ensemble inference on the test set. Our algorithm is model-agnostic and training-free, allowing seamless integration and enhancement of various pre-trained image restoration models. It consistently outperforms regression based methods and averaging ensemble approaches on 14 benchmarks across 3 image restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring and deraining. The codes and all estimated weights have been released in Github.

We also discuss "irreproducible research practices", i.e. decisions that make it difficult or impossible for other researchers to reproduce, build on or audit previous research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses key limitations of large language models (LLMs), such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge, by incorporating external databases. These databases typically consult multiple sources to encompass up-to-date and various information. However, standard RAG methods often overlook the heterogeneous source reliability in the multi-source database and retrieve documents solely based on relevance, making them prone to propagating misinformation. To address this, we propose Reliability-Aware RAG (RA-RAG) which estimates the reliability of multiple sources and incorporates this information into both retrieval and aggregation processes. Specifically, it iteratively estimates source reliability and true answers for a set of queries with no labelling. Then, it selectively retrieves relevant documents from a few of reliable sources and aggregates them using weighted majority voting, where the selective retrieval ensures scalability while not compromising the performance. We also introduce a benchmark designed to reflect real-world scenarios with heterogeneous source reliability and demonstrate the effectiveness of RA-RAG compared to a set of baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, Anil et al. (2024) show that many-shot (up to hundreds of) demonstrations can jailbreak state-of-the-art LLMs by exploiting their long-context capability. Nevertheless, is it possible to use few-shot demonstrations to efficiently jailbreak LLMs within limited context sizes? While the vanilla few-shot jailbreaking may be inefficient, we propose improved techniques such as injecting special system tokens like [/INST] and employing demo-level random search from a collected demo pool. These simple techniques result in surprisingly effective jailbreaking against aligned LLMs (even with advanced defenses). For examples, our method achieves >80% (mostly >95%) ASRs on Llama-2-7B and Llama-3-8B without multiple restarts, even if the models are enhanced by strong defenses such as perplexity detection and/or SmoothLLM, which is challenging for suffix-based jailbreaking. In addition, we conduct comprehensive and elaborate (e.g., making sure to use correct system prompts) evaluations against other aligned LLMs and advanced defenses, where our method consistently achieves nearly 100% ASRs. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/I-FSJ.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) [Liu and Wang, 2016] performs approximate Bayesian inference by representing the posterior with a set of particles. However, SVGD suffers from variance collapse, i.e. poor predictions due to underestimating uncertainty [Ba et al., 2021], even for moderately-dimensional models such as small Bayesian neural networks (BNNs). To address this issue, we generalize SVGD by letting each particle parameterize a component distribution in a mixture model. Our method, Stein Mixture Inference (SMI), optimizes a lower bound to the evidence (ELBO) and introduces user-specified guides parameterized by particles. SMI extends the Nonlinear SVGD framework [Wang and Liu, 2019] to the case of variational Bayes. SMI effectively avoids variance collapse, judging by a previously described test developed for this purpose, and performs well on standard data sets. In addition, SMI requires considerably fewer particles than SVGD to accurately estimate uncertainty for small BNNs. The synergistic combination of NSVGD, ELBO optimization and user-specified guides establishes a promising approach towards variational Bayesian inference in the case of tall and wide data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diverse computing paradigms have emerged to meet the growing needs for intelligent energy-efficient systems. The Margin Propagation (MP) framework, being one such initiative in the analog computing domain, stands out due to its scalability across biasing conditions, temperatures, and diminishing process technology nodes. However, the lack of digital-like automation tools for designing analog systems (including that of MP analog) hinders their adoption for designing large systems. The inherent scalability and modularity of MP systems present a unique opportunity in this regard. This paper introduces KALAM (toolKit for Automating high-Level synthesis of Analog computing systeMs), which leverages factor graphs as the foundational paradigm for synthesizing MP-based analog computing systems. Factor graphs are the basis of various signal processing tasks and, when coupled with MP, can be used to design scalable and energy-efficient analog signal processors. Using Python scripting language, the KALAM automation flow translates an input factor graph to its equivalent SPICE-compatible circuit netlist that can be used to validate the intended functionality. KALAM also allows the integration of design optimization strategies such as precision tuning, variable elimination, and mathematical simplification. We demonstrate KALAM's versatility for tasks such as Bayesian inference, Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) decoding, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Simulation results of the netlists align closely with software implementations, affirming the efficacy of our proposed automation tool.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative Agents to enhance time series forecasting by reasoning across both text and time series data. With language as a medium, our method adaptively integrates social events into forecasting models, aligning news content with time series fluctuations to provide richer insights. Specifically, we utilize LLM-based agents to iteratively filter out irrelevant news and employ human-like reasoning to evaluate predictions. This enables the model to analyze complex events, such as unexpected incidents and shifts in social behavior, and continuously refine the selection logic of news and the robustness of the agent's output. By integrating selected news events with time series data, we fine-tune a pre-trained LLM to predict sequences of digits in time series. The results demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting accuracy, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in time series forecasting through the effective utilization of unstructured news data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite the success of Instruction Tuning (IT) in training large language models (LLMs) to perform arbitrary user-specified tasks, these models often still leverage spurious or biased features learned from their training data, leading to undesired behaviours when deploying them in new contexts. In this work, we introduce Focus Instruction Tuning (FIT), which trains LLMs to condition their responses by focusing on specific features whilst ignoring others, leading to different behaviours based on what features are specified. Across several experimental settings, we show that focus-tuned models can be adaptively steered by focusing on different features at inference-time: for instance, robustness can be improved by focusing on task-causal features and ignoring spurious features, and social bias can be mitigated by ignoring demographic categories. Furthermore, FIT can steer behaviour in new contexts, generalising under distribution shift and to new unseen features at inference time, and thereby facilitating more robust, fair, and controllable LLM applications in real-world environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> News headlines often evoke sentiment by intentionally portraying entities in particular ways, making targeted sentiment analysis (TSA) of headlines a worthwhile but difficult task. Due to its subjectivity, creating TSA datasets can involve various annotation paradigms, from descriptive to prescriptive, either encouraging or limiting subjectivity. LLMs are a good fit for TSA due to their broad linguistic and world knowledge and in-context learning abilities, yet their performance depends on prompt design. In this paper, we compare the accuracy of state-of-the-art LLMs and fine-tuned encoder models for TSA of news headlines using descriptive and prescriptive datasets across several languages. Exploring the descriptive--prescriptive continuum, we analyze how performance is affected by prompt prescriptiveness, ranging from plain zero-shot to elaborate few-shot prompts. Finally, we evaluate the ability of LLMs to quantify uncertainty via calibration error and comparison to human label variation. We find that LLMs outperform fine-tuned encoders on descriptive datasets, while calibration and F1-score generally improve with increased prescriptiveness, yet the optimal level varies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multilingual large language models (LLMs) have gained prominence, but concerns arise regarding their reliability beyond English. This study addresses the gap in cross-lingual semantic evaluation by introducing a novel benchmark for cross-lingual sense disambiguation, StingrayBench. In this paper, we demonstrate using false friends -- words that are orthographically similar but have completely different meanings in two languages -- as a possible approach to pinpoint the limitation of cross-lingual sense disambiguation in LLMs. We collect false friends in four language pairs, namely Indonesian-Malay, Indonesian-Tagalog, Chinese-Japanese, and English-German; and challenge LLMs to distinguish the use of them in context. In our analysis of various models, we observe they tend to be biased toward higher-resource languages. We also propose new metrics for quantifying the cross-lingual sense bias and comprehension based on our benchmark. Our work contributes to developing more diverse and inclusive language modeling, promoting fairer access for the wider multilingual community.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Image Signal Processors (ISPs) convert raw sensor signals into digital images, which significantly influence the image quality and the performance of downstream computer vision tasks. Designing ISP pipeline and tuning ISP parameters are two key steps for building an imaging and vision system. To find optimal ISP configurations, recent works use deep neural networks as a proxy to search for ISP parameters or ISP pipelines. However, these methods are primarily designed to maximize the image quality, which are sub-optimal in the performance of high-level computer vision tasks such as detection, recognition, and tracking. Moreover, after training, the learned ISP pipelines are mostly fixed at the inference time, whose performance degrades in dynamic scenes. To jointly optimize ISP structures and parameters, we propose AdaptiveISP, a task-driven and scene-adaptive ISP. One key observation is that for the majority of input images, only a few processing modules are needed to improve the performance of downstream recognition tasks, and only a few inputs require more processing. Based on this, AdaptiveISP utilizes deep reinforcement learning to automatically generate an optimal ISP pipeline and the associated ISP parameters to maximize the detection performance. Experimental results show that AdaptiveISP not only surpasses the prior state-of-the-art methods for object detection but also dynamically manages the trade-off between detection performance and computational cost, especially suitable for scenes with large dynamic range variations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Binarization, which converts weight parameters to binary values, has emerged as an effective strategy to reduce the size of large language models (LLMs). However, typical binarization techniques significantly diminish linguistic effectiveness of LLMs. To address this issue, we introduce a novel binarization technique called Mixture of Scales (BinaryMoS). Unlike conventional methods, BinaryMoS employs multiple scaling experts for binary weights, dynamically merging these experts for each token to adaptively generate scaling factors. This token-adaptive approach boosts the representational power of binarized LLMs by enabling contextual adjustments to the values of binary weights. Moreover, because this adaptive process only involves the scaling factors rather than the entire weight matrix, BinaryMoS maintains compression efficiency similar to traditional static binarization methods. Our experimental results reveal that BinaryMoS surpasses conventional binarization techniques in various natural language processing tasks and even outperforms 2-bit quantization methods, all while maintaining similar model size to static binarization techniques.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In an era where single large language models have dominated the landscape of artificial intelligence for years, multi-agent systems arise as new protagonists in conversational task-solving. While previous studies have showcased their potential in reasoning tasks and creative endeavors, an analysis of their limitations concerning the conversational paradigms and the impact of individual agents is missing. It remains unascertained how multi-agent discussions perform across tasks of varying complexity and how the structure of these conversations influences the process. To fill that gap, this work systematically evaluates multi-agent systems across various discussion paradigms, assessing their strengths and weaknesses in both generative tasks and question-answering tasks. Alongside the experiments, I propose a taxonomy of 20 multi-agent research studies from 2022 to 2024, followed by the introduction of a framework for deploying multi-agent LLMs in conversational task-solving. I demonstrate that while multi-agent systems excel in complex reasoning tasks, outperforming a single model by leveraging expert personas, they fail on basic tasks. Concretely, I identify three challenges that arise: 1) While longer discussions enhance reasoning, agents fail to maintain conformity to strict task requirements, which leads to problem drift, making shorter conversations more effective for basic tasks. 2) Prolonged discussions risk alignment collapse, raising new safety concerns for these systems. 3) I showcase discussion monopolization through long generations, posing the problem of fairness in decision-making for tasks like summarization. This work uncovers both the potential and challenges that arise with multi-agent interaction and varying conversational paradigms, providing insights into how future research could improve the efficiency, performance, and safety of multi-agent LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Fine-tuning large-scale text-to-image diffusion models for various downstream tasks has yielded impressive results. However, the heavy computational burdens of tuning large models prevent personal customization. Recent advances have attempted to employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to adapt the floating-point (FP) or quantized pre-trained weights. Nonetheless, the adaptation parameters in existing works are still restricted to FP arithmetic, hindering hardware-friendly acceleration. In this work, we propose IntLoRA, to further push the efficiency limits by using integer type (INT) low-rank parameters to adapt the quantized diffusion models. By working in the integer arithmetic, our IntLoRA offers three key advantages: (i) for fine-tuning, the pre-trained weights are quantized, reducing memory usage; (ii) for storage, both pre-trained and low-rank weights are in INT which consumes less disk space; (iii) for inference, IntLoRA weights can be naturally merged into quantized pre-trained weights through efficient integer multiplication or bit-shifting, eliminating additional post-training quantization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IntLoRA can achieve performance on par with or even superior to the vanilla LoRA, accompanied by significant efficiency improvements.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Autonomous mobile app interaction has become increasingly important with growing complexity of mobile applications. Developing intelligent agents that can effectively navigate and interact with mobile apps remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose an Explainable Behavior Cloning LLM Agent (EBC-LLMAgent), a novel approach that combines large language models (LLMs) with behavior cloning by learning demonstrations to create intelligent and explainable agents for autonomous mobile app interaction. EBC-LLMAgent consists of three core modules: Demonstration Encoding, Code Generation, and UI Mapping, which work synergistically to capture user demonstrations, generate executable codes, and establish accurate correspondence between code and UI elements. We introduce the Behavior Cloning Chain Fusion technique to enhance the generalization capabilities of the agent. Extensive experiments on five popular mobile applications from diverse domains demonstrate the superior performance of EBC-LLMAgent, achieving high success rates in task completion, efficient generalization to unseen scenarios, and the generation of meaningful explanations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurate vehicle detection is essential for the development of intelligent transportation systems, autonomous driving, and traffic monitoring. This paper presents a detailed analysis of YOLO11, the latest advancement in the YOLO series of deep learning models, focusing exclusively on vehicle detection tasks. Building upon the success of its predecessors, YOLO11 introduces architectural improvements designed to enhance detection speed, accuracy, and robustness in complex environments. Using a comprehensive dataset comprising multiple vehicle types-cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, and bicycles we evaluate YOLO11's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP). Our findings demonstrate that YOLO11 surpasses previous versions (YOLOv8 and YOLOv10) in detecting smaller and more occluded vehicles while maintaining a competitive inference time, making it well-suited for real-time applications. Comparative analysis shows significant improvements in the detection of complex vehicle geometries, further contributing to the development of efficient and scalable vehicle detection systems. This research highlights YOLO11's potential to enhance autonomous vehicle performance and traffic monitoring systems, offering insights for future developments in the field.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising approach to improve the energy efficiency of machine learning models, as they naturally implement event-driven computations while avoiding expensive multiplication operations. In this paper, we develop a hardware-software co-optimisation strategy to port software-trained deep neural networks (DNN) to reduced-precision spiking models demonstrating fast and accurate inference in a novel event-driven CMOS reconfigurable spiking inference accelerator. Experimental results show that a reduced-precision Resnet-18 and VGG-11 SNN models achieves classification accuracy within 1% of the baseline full-precision DNN model within 8 spike timesteps. We also demonstrate an FPGA prototype implementation of the spiking inference accelerator with a throughput of 38.4 giga operations per second (GOPS) consuming 1.54 Watts on PYNQ-Z2 FPGA. This corresponds to 0.6 GOPS per processing element and 2.25,GOPS/DSP slice, which is 2x and 4.5x higher utilisation efficiency respectively compared to the state-of-the-art. Our co-optimisation strategy can be employed to develop deep reduced precision SNN models and port them to resource-efficient event-driven hardware accelerators for edge applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in incorporating Indic languages within multilingual models. However, it is crucial to quantitatively assess whether these languages perform comparably to globally dominant ones, such as English. Currently, there is a lack of benchmark datasets specifically designed to evaluate the regional knowledge of LLMs in various Indic languages. In this paper, we present the L3Cube-IndicQuest, a gold-standard factual question-answering benchmark dataset designed to evaluate how well multilingual LLMs capture regional knowledge across various Indic languages. The dataset contains 200 question-answer pairs, each for English and 19 Indic languages, covering five domains specific to the Indic region. We aim for this dataset to serve as a benchmark, providing ground truth for evaluating the performance of LLMs in understanding and representing knowledge relevant to the Indian context. The IndicQuest can be used for both reference-based evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. The dataset is shared publicly at https://github.com/l3cube-pune/indic-nlp .

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Interactive preference learning systems present humans with queries as pairs of options; humans then select their preferred choice, allowing the system to infer preferences from these binary choices. While binary choice feedback is simple and widely used, it offers limited information about preference strength. To address this, we leverage human response times, which inversely correlate with preference strength, as complementary information. We introduce a computationally efficient method based on the EZ-diffusion model, combining choices and response times to estimate the underlying human utility function. Theoretical and empirical comparisons with traditional choice-only estimators show that for queries where humans have strong preferences (i.e., "easy" queries), response times provide valuable complementary information and enhance utility estimates. We integrate this estimator into preference-based linear bandits for fixed-budget best-arm identification. Simulations on three real-world datasets demonstrate that incorporating response times significantly accelerates preference learning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve the efficiency and scalability of dense language models by routing each token to a small number of experts in each layer. In this paper, we show how an adversary that can arrange for their queries to appear in the same batch of examples as a victim's queries can exploit Expert-Choice-Routing to fully disclose a victim's prompt. We successfully demonstrate the effectiveness of this attack on a two-layer Mixtral model, exploiting the tie-handling behavior of the torch.topk CUDA implementation. Our results show that we can extract the entire prompt using $O({VM}^2)$ queries (with vocabulary size $V$ and prompt length $M$) or 100 queries on average per token in the setting we consider. This is the first attack to exploit architectural flaws for the purpose of extracting user prompts, introducing a new class of LLM vulnerabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using large language models (LLMs) often generate inaccurate responses due to the retrieval of irrelevant or loosely related information. Existing methods, which operate at the document level, fail to effectively filter out such content. We propose LLM-driven chunk filtering, ChunkRAG, a framework that enhances RAG systems by evaluating and filtering retrieved information at the chunk level. Our approach employs semantic chunking to divide documents into coherent sections and utilizes LLM-based relevance scoring to assess each chunk's alignment with the user's query. By filtering out less pertinent chunks before the generation phase, we significantly reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing RAG models, achieving higher accuracy on tasks requiring precise information retrieval. This advancement enhances the reliability of RAG systems, making them particularly beneficial for applications like fact-checking and multi-hop reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a critical mechanism in contemporary NLP to support Large Language Models(LLMs) in systematically accessing richer factual context. However, the integration of RAG mechanisms brings its inherent challenges, as LLMs need to deal with potentially noisy contexts. Recent studies have shown that LLMs still struggle to critically analyse RAG-based in-context information, a limitation that may lead to incorrect inferences and hallucinations. In this paper, we investigate how to elicit critical reasoning in RAG via contrastive explanations. In particular, we propose Contrastive-RAG (C-RAG), a framework that (i) retrieves relevant documents given a query, (ii) selects and exemplifies relevant passages, and (iii) generates explanations that explicitly contrast the relevance of the passages to (iv) support the final answer. We show the impact of C-RAG building contrastive reasoning demonstrations from LLMs to instruct smaller models for retrieval-augmented tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that C-RAG improves state-of-the-art RAG models while (a) requiring significantly fewer prompts and demonstrations and (b) being robust to perturbations in the retrieved documents.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Emerging interconnects, such as CXL and NVLink, have been integrated into the intra-host topology to scale more accelerators and facilitate efficient communication between them, such as GPUs. To keep pace with the accelerator's growing computing throughput, the interconnect has seen substantial enhancement in link bandwidth, e.g., 256GBps for CXL 3.0 links, which surpasses Ethernet and InfiniBand network links by an order of magnitude or more. Consequently, when data-intensive jobs, such as LLM training, scale across multiple hosts beyond the reach limit of the interconnect, the performance is significantly hindered by the limiting bandwidth of the network infrastructure. We address the problem by proposing DFabric, a two-tier interconnect architecture. We address the problem by proposing DFabric, a two-tier interconnect architecture. First, DFabric disaggregates rack's computing units with an interconnect fabric, i.e., CXL fabric, which scales at rack-level, so that they can enjoy intra-rack efficient interconnecting. Second, DFabric disaggregates NICs from hosts, and consolidates them to form a NIC pool with CXL fabric. By providing sufficient aggregated capacity comparable to interconnect bandwidth, the NIC pool bridges efficient communication across racks or beyond the reach limit of interconnect fabric. However, the local memory accessing becomes the bottleneck when enabling each host to utilize the NIC pool efficiently. To the end, DFabric builds a memory pool with sufficient bandwidth by disaggregating host local memory and adding more memory devices. We have implemented a prototype of DFabric that can run applications transparently. We validated its performance gain by running various microbenchmarks and compute-intensive applications such as DNN and graph.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The performance of large language models (LLMs) is acutely sensitive to the phrasing of prompts, which raises significant concerns about their reliability in real-world scenarios. Existing studies often divide prompts into task-level instructions and case-level inputs and primarily focus on evaluating and improving robustness against variations in tasks-level instructions. However, this setup fails to fully address the diversity of real-world user queries and assumes the existence of task-specific datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce RobustAlpacaEval, a new benchmark that consists of semantically equivalent case-level queries and emphasizes the importance of using the worst prompt performance to gauge the lower bound of model performance. Extensive experiments on RobustAlpacaEval with ChatGPT and six open-source LLMs from the Llama, Mistral, and Gemma families uncover substantial variability in model performance; for instance, a difference of 45.48% between the worst and best performance for the Llama-2-70B-chat model, with its worst performance dipping as low as 9.38%. We further illustrate the difficulty in identifying the worst prompt from both model-agnostic and model-dependent perspectives, emphasizing the absence of a shortcut to characterize the worst prompt. We also attempt to enhance the worst prompt performance using existing prompt engineering and prompt consistency methods, but find that their impact is limited. These findings underscore the need to create more resilient LLMs that can maintain high performance across diverse prompts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work presents DAVINCI, a unified architecture for single-stage Computer-Aided Design (CAD) sketch parameterization and constraint inference directly from raster sketch images. By jointly learning both outputs, DAVINCI minimizes error accumulation and enhances the performance of constrained CAD sketch inference. Notably, DAVINCI achieves state-of-the-art results on the large-scale SketchGraphs dataset, demonstrating effectiveness on both precise and hand-drawn raster CAD sketches. To reduce DAVINCI's reliance on large-scale annotated datasets, we explore the efficacy of CAD sketch augmentations. We introduce Constraint-Preserving Transformations (CPTs), i.e. random permutations of the parametric primitives of a CAD sketch that preserve its constraints. This data augmentation strategy allows DAVINCI to achieve reasonable performance when trained with only 0.1% of the SketchGraphs dataset. Furthermore, this work contributes a new version of SketchGraphs, augmented with CPTs. The newly introduced CPTSketchGraphs dataset includes 80 million CPT-augmented sketches, thus providing a rich resource for future research in the CAD sketch domain.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The opacity in developing large language models (LLMs) is raising growing concerns about the potential contamination of public benchmarks in the pre-training data. Existing contamination detection methods are typically based on the text overlap between training and evaluation data, which can be too superficial to reflect deeper forms of contamination. In this paper, we first present a cross-lingual form of contamination that inflates LLMs' performance while evading current detection methods, deliberately injected by overfitting LLMs on the translated versions of benchmark test sets. Then, we propose generalization-based approaches to unmask such deeply concealed contamination. Specifically, we examine the LLM's performance change after modifying the original benchmark by replacing the false answer choices with correct ones from other questions. Contaminated models can hardly generalize to such easier situations, where the false choices can be \emph{not even wrong}, as all choices are correct in their memorization. Experimental results demonstrate that cross-lingual contamination can easily fool existing detection methods, but not ours. In addition, we discuss the potential utilization of cross-lingual contamination in interpreting LLMs' working mechanisms and in post-training LLMs for enhanced multilingual capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> How can "weak teacher models" such as average human annotators or existing AI systems, effectively supervise LLMs to improve performance on hard reasoning tasks, especially those that challenge and requires expertise or daily practice from the teacher models? In this paper, we seek for empirical answers to this question by investigating various data-driven strategies that offer supervision data at different quality levels upon tasks of varying complexity. Two intuitive strategies emerge for teacher models to provide supervision during alignment training: 1) using lower-quality supervision from complete tasks that match the difficulty of the target reasoning tasks, and 2) leveraging higher-quality supervision from easier subtasks that are less challenging. Interestingly, we find that even when the outcome error rate for hard task supervision is high (e.g., 90\%), training on such data can outperform perfectly correct supervision on easier subtasks on multiple hard math benchmarks. We further identify a more critical factor influencing training performance: step-wise error rates, which indicate the severity of errors in solutions. Specifically, training on hard task supervision with the same outcome error rates but disparate step-wise error rates can lead to a 30\% accuracy gap on MATH benchmark. Our results also reveal that supplementing hard task supervision with the corresponding subtask supervision can yield notable performance improvements than simply combining rephrased hard full task supervision, suggesting new avenues for data augmentation.

Recently, there is a growing interest in extending this success to vision foundation models. In this survey, we review the recent advances and discuss future directions for autoregressive vision foundation models. First, we present the trend for next generation of vision foundation models, i.e., unifying both understanding and generation in vision tasks. We then analyze the limitations of existing vision foundation models, and present a formal definition of autoregression with its advantages. Later, we categorize autoregressive vision foundation models from their vision tokenizers and autoregression backbones. Finally, we discuss several promising research challenges and directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey to comprehensively summarize autoregressive vision foundation models under the trend of unifying understanding and generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models (LLMs) expand into performing as agents for real-world applications beyond traditional NLP tasks, evaluating their robustness becomes increasingly important. However, existing benchmarks often overlook critical dimensions like cultural and social awareness. To address these, we introduce CASA, a benchmark designed to assess LLM agents' sensitivity to cultural and social norms across two web-based tasks: online shopping and social discussion forums. Our approach evaluates LLM agents' ability to detect and appropriately respond to norm-violating user queries and observations. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that measures awareness coverage, helpfulness in managing user queries, and the violation rate when facing misleading web content. Experiments show that current LLMs perform significantly better in non-agent than in web-based agent environments, with agents achieving less than 10% awareness coverage and over 40% violation rates. To improve performance, we explore two methods: prompting and fine-tuning, and find that combining both methods can offer complementary advantages -- fine-tuning on culture-specific datasets significantly enhances the agents' ability to generalize across different regions, while prompting boosts the agents' ability to navigate complex tasks. These findings highlight the importance of constantly benchmarking LLM agents' cultural and social awareness during the development cycle.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As general-purpose tools, Large Language Models (LLMs) must often reason about everyday physical environments. In a question-and-answer capacity, understanding the interactions of physical objects may be necessary to give appropriate responses. Moreover, LLMs are increasingly used as reasoning engines in agentic systems, designing and controlling their action sequences. The vast majority of research has tackled this issue using static benchmarks, comprised of text or image-based questions about the physical world. However, these benchmarks do not capture the complexity and nuance of real-life physical processes. Here we advocate for a second, relatively unexplored, approach: 'embodying' the LLMs by granting them control of an agent within a 3D environment. We present the first embodied and cognitively meaningful evaluation of physical common-sense reasoning in LLMs. Our framework allows direct comparison of LLMs with other embodied agents, such as those based on Deep Reinforcement Learning, and human and non-human animals. We employ the Animal-AI (AAI) environment, a simulated 3D virtual laboratory, to study physical common-sense reasoning in LLMs. For this, we use the AAI Testbed, a suite of experiments that replicate laboratory studies with non-human animals, to study physical reasoning capabilities including distance estimation, tracking out-of-sight objects, and tool use. We demonstrate that state-of-the-art multi-modal models with no finetuning can complete this style of task, allowing meaningful comparison to the entrants of the 2019 Animal-AI Olympics competition and to human children. Our results show that LLMs are currently outperformed by human children on these tasks. We argue that this approach allows the study of physical reasoning using ecologically valid experiments drawn directly from cognitive science, improving the predictability and reliability of LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces a framework, called EMOTION, for generating expressive motion sequences in humanoid robots, enhancing their ability to engage in humanlike non-verbal communication. Non-verbal cues such as facial expressions, gestures, and body movements play a crucial role in effective interpersonal interactions. Despite the advancements in robotic behaviors, existing methods often fall short in mimicking the diversity and subtlety of human non-verbal communication. To address this gap, our approach leverages the in-context learning capability of large language models (LLMs) to dynamically generate socially appropriate gesture motion sequences for human-robot interaction. We use this framework to generate 10 different expressive gestures and conduct online user studies comparing the naturalness and understandability of the motions generated by EMOTION and its human-feedback version, EMOTION++, against those by human operators. The results demonstrate that our approach either matches or surpasses human performance in generating understandable and natural robot motions under certain scenarios. We also provide design implications for future research to consider a set of variables when generating expressive robotic gestures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we present an LLM-based code translation method and an associated tool called CoTran, that translates whole-programs from one high-level programming language to another. Existing LLM-based code translation methods lack training to ensure that the translated code reliably compiles or bears substantial functional equivalence to the input code. In our work, we fine-tune an LLM using reinforcement learning, incorporating compiler feedback, and symbolic execution (symexec)-based testing feedback to assess functional equivalence between the input and output programs. The idea is to guide an LLM during fine-tuning, via compiler and symexec-based testing feedback, by letting it know how far it is from producing perfect translations. We conduct extensive experiments comparing CoTran with 14 other code translation tools, including human-written transpilers, LLM-based translation tools, and ChatGPT. Using a benchmark of over \num{57000} code pairs in Java and Python, we demonstrate that CoTran outperforms the other tools on relevant metrics such as compilation accuracy (CompAcc) and functional equivalence accuracy (FEqAcc). For example, in Python-to-Java translation, CoTran achieves 48.68% FEqAcc and 76.98% CompAcc, whereas the nearest competing tool (PLBART-base) gets 38.26% and 75.77% respectively. Additionally, CoTran, built on top of CodeT5, improves FEqAcc by +14.89% and CompAcc by +8.14% for Python-to-Java (resp., +12.94% and +4.30% for Java-to-Python).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Visual content and accompanied audio signals naturally formulate a joint representation to improve audio-visual (AV) related applications. While studies develop various AV representation learning frameworks, the importance of AV data alignment is usually undermined for achieving high-quality representation. We observe that an audio signal may contain background noise interference. Also, non-synchronization may appear between audio and video streams. These non-strict data alignment limits representation quality and downgrade application performance. In this paper, we propose to improve AV joint representations from a data-centric perspective by aligning audio signals to visual data. Our alignment is conducted in an agentic workflow controlled by an LLM-based assistant named AVAgent. For each input AV data pair, our AVAgent uses a multi-modal LLM to convert audio and visual data into language descriptions separately (i.e., tool use). Then, AVAgent reasons whether this paired data is aligned well and plans to edit the audio signal if needed (i.e., planning). The audio editing is executed by predefined actions that filter noise or augment data. Moreover, we use a VLM to evaluate how modified audio signals match the visual content and provide feedback to AVAgent (i.e., reflection). The tool use, planning, and reflection steps operate cyclically to become an agentic workflow where audio signals are gradually aligned to visual content. To this end, existing methods can directly leverage the aligned AV data via our agentic workflow to improve AV joint representations. The experimental results comprehensively demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach against previous baselines in diverse downstream tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vulnerability of Frontier language models to misuse and jailbreaks has prompted the development of safety measures like filters and alignment training in an effort to ensure safety through robustness to adversarially crafted prompts. We assert that robustness is fundamentally insufficient for ensuring safety goals, and current defenses and evaluation methods fail to account for risks of dual-intent queries and their composition for malicious goals. To quantify these risks, we introduce a new safety evaluation framework based on impermissible information leakage of model outputs and demonstrate how our proposed question-decomposition attack can extract dangerous knowledge from a censored LLM more effectively than traditional jailbreaking. Underlying our proposed evaluation method is a novel information-theoretic threat model of inferential adversaries, distinguished from security adversaries, such as jailbreaks, in that success is measured by inferring impermissible knowledge from victim outputs as opposed to forcing explicitly impermissible outputs from the victim. Through our information-theoretic framework, we show that to ensure safety against inferential adversaries, defense mechanisms must ensure information censorship, bounding the leakage of impermissible information. However, we prove that such defenses inevitably incur a safety-utility trade-off.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Many alignment methods, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), rely on the Bradley-Terry reward assumption, which is insufficient to capture the full range of general human preferences. To achieve robust alignment with general preferences, we model the alignment problem as a two-player zero-sum game, where the Nash equilibrium policy guarantees a 50% win rate against any competing policy. However, previous algorithms for finding the Nash policy either diverge or converge to a Nash policy in a modified game, even in a simple synthetic setting, thereby failing to maintain the 50% win rate guarantee against all other policies. We propose a meta-algorithm, Convergent Meta Alignment Algorithm (COMAL), for language model alignment with general preferences, inspired by convergent algorithms in game theory. Theoretically, we prove that our meta-algorithm converges to an exact Nash policy in the last iterate. Additionally, our meta-algorithm is simple and can be integrated with many existing methods designed for RLHF and preference optimization with minimal changes. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework when combined with existing preference policy optimization methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Artificial intelligence has significantly impacted medical applications, particularly with the advent of Medical Large Vision Language Models (Med-LVLMs), sparking optimism for the future of automated and personalized healthcare. However, the trustworthiness of Med-LVLMs remains unverified, posing significant risks for future model deployment. In this paper, we introduce CARES and aim to comprehensively evaluate the Trustworthiness of Med-LVLMs across the medical domain. We assess the trustworthiness of Med-LVLMs across five dimensions, including trustfulness, fairness, safety, privacy, and robustness. CARES comprises about 41K question-answer pairs in both closed and open-ended formats, covering 16 medical image modalities and 27 anatomical regions. Our analysis reveals that the models consistently exhibit concerns regarding trustworthiness, often displaying factual inaccuracies and failing to maintain fairness across different demographic groups. Furthermore, they are vulnerable to attacks and demonstrate a lack of privacy awareness. We publicly release our benchmark and code in https://cares-ai.github.io/.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The hallucinations of large language models (LLMs) are increasingly mitigated by allowing LLMs to search for information and to ground their answers in real sources. Unfortunately, LLMs often struggle with posing the right search queries, especially when dealing with complex or otherwise indirect topics. Observing that LLMs can learn to search for relevant facts by $\textit{trying}$ different queries and learning to up-weight queries that successfully produce relevant results, we introduce $\underline{Le}$arning to $\underline{Re}$trieve by $\underline{T}$rying (LeReT), a reinforcement learning framework that explores search queries and uses preference-based optimization to improve their quality. LeReT can improve the absolute retrieval accuracy by up to 29% and the downstream generator evaluations by 17%. The simplicity and flexibility of LeReT allows it to be applied to arbitrary off-the-shelf retrievers and makes it a promising technique for improving general LLM pipelines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> 3D models have recently been popularized by the potentiality of end-to-end training offered first by Neural Radiance Fields and most recently by 3D Gaussian Splatting models. The latter has the big advantage of naturally providing fast training convergence and high editability. However, as the research around these is still in its infancy, there is still a gap in the literature regarding the model's scalability. In this work, we propose an approach enabling both memory and computation scalability of such models. More specifically, we propose an iterative pruning strategy that removes redundant information encoded in the model. We also enhance compressibility for the model by including in the optimization strategy a differentiable quantization and entropy coding estimator. Our results on popular benchmarks showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach and open the road to the broad deployability of such a solution even on resource-constrained devices.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Run to run variability in parallel programs caused by floating-point non-associativity has been known to significantly affect reproducibility in iterative algorithms, due to accumulating errors. Non-reproducibility can critically affect the efficiency and effectiveness of correctness testing for stochastic programs. Recently, the sensitivity of deep learning training and inference pipelines to floating-point non-associativity has been found to sometimes be extreme. It can prevent certification for commercial applications, accurate assessment of robustness and sensitivity, and bug detection. New approaches in scientific computing applications have coupled deep learning models with high-performance computing, leading to an aggravation of debugging and testing challenges. Here we perform an investigation of the statistical properties of floating-point non-associativity within modern parallel programming models, and analyze performance and productivity impacts of replacing atomic operations with deterministic alternatives on GPUs. We examine the recently-added deterministic options in PyTorch within the context of GPU deployment for deep learning, uncovering and quantifying the impacts of input parameters triggering run to run variability and reporting on the reliability and completeness of the documentation. Finally, we evaluate the strategy of exploiting automatic determinism that could be provided by deterministic hardware, using the Groq accelerator for inference portions of the deep learning pipeline. We demonstrate the benefits that a hardware-based strategy can provide within reproducibility and correctness efforts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This study addresses the deployment challenges of integer-only quantized Transformers on resource-constrained embedded FPGAs (Xilinx Spartan-7 XC7S15). We enhanced the flexibility of our VHDL template by introducing a selectable resource type for storing intermediate results across model layers, thereby breaking the deployment bottleneck by utilizing BRAM efficiently. Moreover, we developed a resource-aware mixed-precision quantization approach that enables researchers to explore hardware-level quantization strategies without requiring extensive expertise in Neural Architecture Search. This method provides accurate resource utilization estimates with a precision discrepancy as low as 3%, compared to actual deployment metrics. Compared to previous work, our approach has successfully facilitated the deployment of model configurations utilizing mixed-precision quantization, thus overcoming the limitations inherent in five previously non-deployable configurations with uniform quantization bitwidths. Consequently, this research enhances the applicability of Transformers in embedded systems, facilitating a broader range of Transformer-powered applications on edge devices.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The magnetic field vector of the solar corona is not regularly and comprehensively being measured, because of the complexity and degeneracy inherently present in the types of observations currently available. To address some of the current limitations of coronal polarimetry, we present computations that demonstrate the possibility of magnetometry using the unsaturated Hanle effect of the He I 1083 nm line. The main purpose of this investigation is to show how the geometric properties of the linear polarization of this line can be used to routinely diagnose the orientation of the field in erupting prominences, thus providing an important constraint on the B$_z$ determination at 1 AU. For this work, we adopted a simplified magnetic model of a flux rope, consisting of a toroidal helical structure embedded in a hydrostatically stratified corona. Our results demonstrate the possibility to discern different orientations of the magnetic field vector in such structures under rather general and practicable viewing conditions. In particular, observations from the Sun-Earth Lagrange points are found to provide excellent locations for the deployment of synoptic instruments aiming at the estimation of the magnetic field of Earth-directed Coronal Mass Ejections. We complete our demonstration by showing how a small (~5 cm) space-borne coronagraph can achieve sufficient signal-to-noise ratios to make the coronal magnetometry goal outlined above feasible.

Our approach extends traditional agent-based simulations by using strategic LLM agents (SLA) and introducing dynamic and adaptive governance through a pro-social promoting RL agent (PPA) that modulates information access across agents in a network, optimizing social welfare and promoting pro-social behavior. Through validation in iterative games, including the prisoner dilemma, we demonstrate that SLA agents exhibit nuanced strategic adaptations. The PPA agent effectively learns to adjust information transparency, resulting in enhanced cooperation rates. This framework offers significant insights into AI-mediated social dynamics, contributing to the deployment of AI in real-world team settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based architectures have dominated various areas of machine learning in recent years. In this paper, we introduce a novel robust attention mechanism designed to enhance the resilience of transformer-based architectures. Crucially, this technique can be integrated into existing transformers as a plug-and-play layer, improving their robustness without the need for additional training or fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that our ProTransformer significantly enhances the robustness of transformer models across a variety of prediction tasks, attack mechanisms, backbone architectures, and data domains. Notably, without further fine-tuning, the ProTransformer consistently improves the performance of vanilla transformers by 19.5%, 28.3%, 16.1%, and 11.4% for BERT, ALBERT, DistilBERT, and RoBERTa, respectively, under the classical TextFooler attack. Furthermore, ProTransformer shows promising resilience in large language models (LLMs) against prompting-based attacks, improving the performance of T5 and LLaMA by 24.8% and 17.8%, respectively, and enhancing Vicuna by an average of 10.4% against the Jailbreaking attack. Beyond the language domain, ProTransformer also demonstrates outstanding robustness in both vision and graph domains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents ReasoningRec, a reasoning-based recommendation framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to bridge the gap between recommendations and human-interpretable explanations. In contrast to conventional recommendation systems that rely on implicit user-item interactions, ReasoningRec employs LLMs to model users and items, focusing on preferences, aversions, and explanatory reasoning. The framework utilizes a larger LLM to generate synthetic explanations for user preferences, subsequently used to fine-tune a smaller LLM for enhanced recommendation accuracy and human-interpretable explanation. Our experimental study investigates the impact of reasoning and contextual information on personalized recommendations, revealing that the quality of contextual and personalized data significantly influences the LLM's capacity to generate plausible explanations. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ReasoningRec surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to 12.5\% in recommendation prediction while concurrently providing human-intelligible explanations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite rapid progress in large language models (LLMs), their performance on a vast majority of languages remains unsatisfactory. In this paper, we study building language-specific LLMs by adapting monolingual and multilingual LLMs. We conduct systematic experiments on how design choices (base model selection, vocabulary extension, and continued pretraining) impact the adapted LLM, both in terms of efficiency (how many tokens are needed to encode the same amount of information) and end task performance. We find that (1) the initial performance of LLM does not always correlate with the final performance after the adaptation. Adapting an English-centric models can yield better results than adapting multilingual models despite their worse initial performance on low-resource languages. (2) Efficiency can easily improved with simple vocabulary extension and continued pretraining in most LLMs we study, and (3) The optimal adaptation method (choice of the base model, new vocabulary size, training data, initialization strategy) is highly language-dependent, and the simplest embedding initialization works well across various experimental settings. Together, our work lays foundations on efficiently building language-specific LLMs by adapting existing LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of reproducing human-like inferences, including inferences about emotions and mental states, from text. Whether this capability extends beyond text to other modalities remains unclear. Humans possess a sophisticated ability to read the mind in the eyes of other people. Here we tested whether this ability is also present in GPT-4o, a multimodal LLM. Using two versions of a widely used theory of mind test, the Reading the Mind in Eyes Test and the Multiracial Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, we found that GPT-4o outperformed humans in interpreting mental states from upright faces but underperformed humans when faces were inverted. While humans in our sample showed no difference between White and Non-white faces, GPT-4o's accuracy was higher for White than for Non-white faces. GPT-4o's errors were not random but revealed a highly consistent, yet incorrect, processing of mental-state information across trials, with an orientation-dependent error structure that qualitatively differed from that of humans for inverted faces but not for upright faces. These findings highlight how advanced mental state inference abilities and human-like face processing signatures, such as inversion effects, coexist in GPT-4o alongside substantial differences in information processing compared to humans.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The exponential growth of knowledge and the increasing complexity of interdisciplinary research pose significant challenges for researchers, including information overload and difficulties in exploring novel ideas. The advancements in large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have shown great potential in enhancing idea proposals, but how to effectively utilize large models for reasonable idea proposal has not been thoroughly explored. This paper proposes a scientific paper idea proposer (SciPIP). Based on a user-provided research background, SciPIP retrieves helpful papers from a literature database while leveraging the capabilities of LLMs to generate more novel and feasible ideas. To this end, 1) we construct a literature retrieval database, extracting lots of papers' multi-dimension information for fast access. Then, a literature retrieval method based on semantics, entity, and citation co-occurrences is proposed to search relevant literature from multiple aspects based on the user-provided background. 2) After literature retrieval, we introduce dual-path idea proposal strategies, where one path infers solutions from the retrieved literature and the other path generates original ideas through model brainstorming. We then combine the two to achieve a good balance between feasibility and originality. Through extensive experiments on the natural language processing (NLP) field, we demonstrate that SciPIP can retrieve citations similar to those of existing top conference papers and generate many ideas consistent with them. Additionally, we evaluate the originality of other ideas generated by SciPIP using large language models, further validating the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code and the database are released at https://github.com/cheerss/SciPIP.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Human-Oriented Binary Reverse Engineering (HOBRE) lies at the intersection of binary and source code, aiming to lift binary code to human-readable content relevant to source code, thereby bridging the binary-source semantic gap. Recent advancements in uni-modal code model pre-training, particularly in generative Source Code Foundation Models (SCFMs) and binary understanding models, have laid the groundwork for transfer learning applicable to HOBRE. However, existing approaches for HOBRE rely heavily on uni-modal models like SCFMs for supervised fine-tuning or general LLMs for prompting, resulting in sub-optimal performance. Inspired by recent progress in large multi-modal models, we propose that it is possible to harness the strengths of uni-modal code models from both sides to bridge the semantic gap effectively. In this paper, we introduce a novel probe-and-recover framework that incorporates a binary-source encoder-decoder model and black-box LLMs for binary analysis. Our approach leverages the pre-trained knowledge within SCFMs to synthesize relevant, symbol-rich code fragments as context. This additional context enables black-box LLMs to enhance recovery accuracy. We demonstrate significant improvements in zero-shot binary summarization and binary function name recovery, with a 10.3% relative gain in CHRF and a 16.7% relative gain in a GPT4-based metric for summarization, as well as a 6.7% and 7.4% absolute increase in token-level precision and recall for name recovery, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in automating and improving binary code analysis.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce the concept of a generative infinite game, a video game that transcends the traditional boundaries of finite, hard-coded systems by using generative models. Inspired by James P. Carse's distinction between finite and infinite games, we leverage recent advances in generative AI to create Unbounded: a game of character life simulation that is fully encapsulated in generative models. Specifically, Unbounded draws inspiration from sandbox life simulations and allows you to interact with your autonomous virtual character in a virtual world by feeding, playing with and guiding it - with open-ended mechanics generated by an LLM, some of which can be emergent. In order to develop Unbounded, we propose technical innovations in both the LLM and visual generation domains. Specifically, we present: (1) a specialized, distilled large language model (LLM) that dynamically generates game mechanics, narratives, and character interactions in real-time, and (2) a new dynamic regional image prompt Adapter (IP-Adapter) for vision models that ensures consistent yet flexible visual generation of a character across multiple environments. We evaluate our system through both qualitative and quantitative analysis, showing significant improvements in character life simulation, user instruction following, narrative coherence, and visual consistency for both characters and the environments compared to traditional related approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work aims to advance sound event detection (SED) research by presenting a new large language model (LLM)-powered dataset namely wild domestic environment sound event detection (WildDESED). It is crafted as an extension to the original DESED dataset to reflect diverse acoustic variability and complex noises in home settings. We leveraged LLMs to generate eight different domestic scenarios based on target sound categories of the DESED dataset. Then we enriched the scenarios with a carefully tailored mixture of noises selected from AudioSet and ensured no overlap with target sound. We consider widely popular convolutional neural recurrent network to study WildDESED dataset, which depicts its challenging nature. We then apply curriculum learning by gradually increasing noise complexity to enhance the model's generalization capabilities across various noise levels. Our results with this approach show improvements within the noisy environment, validating the effectiveness on the WildDESED dataset promoting noise-robust SED advancements.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Frequently updating Large Language Model (LLM)-based recommender systems to adapt to new user interests -- as done for traditional ones -- is impractical due to high training costs, even with acceleration methods. This work explores adapting to dynamic user interests without any model updates by leveraging In-Context Learning (ICL), which allows LLMs to learn new tasks from few-shot examples provided in the input. Using new-interest examples as the ICL few-shot examples, LLMs may learn real-time interest directly, avoiding the need for model updates. However, existing LLM-based recommenders often lose the in-context learning ability during recommendation tuning, while the original LLM's in-context learning lacks recommendation-specific focus. To address this, we propose RecICL, which customizes recommendation-specific in-context learning for real-time recommendations. RecICL organizes training examples in an in-context learning format, ensuring that in-context learning ability is preserved and aligned with the recommendation task during tuning.   Extensive experiments demonstrate RecICL's effectiveness in delivering real-time recommendations without requiring model updates. Our code is available at https://github.com/ym689/rec_icl.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) achieve good performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks, yet could also make basic reasoning mistakes. This contrasting behavior is puzzling when it comes to understanding the mechanisms behind LLMs' reasoning capabilities. One hypothesis is that the increasingly high and nearly saturated performance on common reasoning benchmarks could be due to the memorization of similar problems. In this paper, we systematically investigate this hypothesis with a quantitative measurement of memorization in reasoning tasks, using a dynamically generated logical reasoning benchmark based on Knights and Knaves (K&K) puzzles. We found that LLMs could interpolate the training puzzles (achieving near-perfect accuracy) after fine-tuning, yet fail when those puzzles are slightly perturbed, suggesting that the models heavily rely on memorization to solve those training puzzles. On the other hand, we show that while fine-tuning leads to heavy memorization, it also consistently improves generalization performance. In-depth analyses with perturbation tests, cross difficulty-level transferability, probing model internals, and fine-tuning with wrong answers suggest that the LLMs learn to reason on K&K puzzles despite training data memorization. This phenomenon indicates that LLMs exhibit a complex interplay between memorization and genuine reasoning abilities. Finally, our analysis with per-sample memorization score sheds light on how LLMs switch between reasoning and memorization in solving logical puzzles.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Increasing the size of large language models (LLMs) has been shown to lead to better performance. However, this comes at the cost of slower and more expensive inference. Early-exiting is a promising approach for improving the efficiency of LLM inference by enabling next token prediction at intermediate layers. Yet, the large vocabulary size in modern LLMs makes the confidence estimation required for exit decisions computationally expensive, diminishing the efficiency gains. To address this, we propose dynamically pruning the vocabulary at test time for each token. Specifically, the vocabulary is pruned at one of the initial layers, and the smaller vocabulary is then used throughout the rest of the forward pass. Our experiments demonstrate that such post-hoc dynamic vocabulary pruning improves the efficiency of confidence estimation in early-exit LLMs while maintaining competitive performance.

  Federated Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models</h2>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, particularly in task generalization for both text and vision data. While fine-tuning these models can significantly enhance their performance on specific downstream tasks, it often requires high-quality data that cannot be shared due to privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution for collaborative training without direct data sharing. However, many parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for LLMs in FL, particularly those based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), face limitations. In this paper, we critically analyze the convergence and performance guarantees of popular FL frameworks utilizing LoRA, highlighting its suboptimal nature due to constrained subspace learning of low-rank matrices. This limitation hinders effective fine-tuning of LLMs in federated settings. Through rigorous analytical and empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that direct weight averaging outperforms LoRA-based strategies, leading to superior performance for fine-tuned models. Our comprehensive comparison exposes inefficiencies in LoRA approaches and underscores the advantages of full-rank weight aggregation. We extend our analysis to low-rank gradient-based optimizers, such as GaLore, used during local training steps. Our findings show that GaLore is a more effective alternative, outperforming federated LoRA methods like FlexLoRA and FFA-LoRA across both text and image modalities. While privacy remains paramount in FL discourse, our focus is on assessing performance outcomes of federated fine-tuned models and evaluating various FL frameworks from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Our findings advocate reassessing the reliance on LoRA within FL contexts, paving the way for more efficient training methodologies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural language questions over large-scale knowledge bases (KBs), which can be summarized into two crucial steps: knowledge retrieval and semantic parsing. However, three core challenges remain: inefficient knowledge retrieval, mistakes of retrieval adversely impacting semantic parsing, and the complexity of previous KBQA methods. To tackle these challenges, we introduce ChatKBQA, a novel and simple generate-then-retrieve KBQA framework, which proposes first generating the logical form with fine-tuned LLMs, then retrieving and replacing entities and relations with an unsupervised retrieval method, to improve both generation and retrieval more directly. Experimental results show that ChatKBQA achieves new state-of-the-art performance on standard KBQA datasets, WebQSP, and CWQ. This work can also be regarded as a new paradigm for combining LLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs) for interpretable and knowledge-required question answering. Our code is publicly available.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In-context learning can help Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt new tasks without additional training. However, this performance heavily depends on the quality of the demonstrations, driving research into effective demonstration selection algorithms to optimize this process. These algorithms assist users in selecting the best $k$ input-label pairs (demonstration examples) based on a given test input, enabling LLMs to in-context learn the relationship between the provided examples and the test inputs. Despite all the proposed demonstration selection algorithms, their efficiency and effectiveness remain unclear. This lack of clarity make it difficult to apply these algorithms in real-world scenarios and poses challenges for future research aimed at developing improved methods. This paper revisits six proposed algorithms, evaluating them on five datasets from both efficiency and effectiveness perspectives. Our experiments reveal significant variations in algorithm performance across different tasks, with some methods struggling to outperform random selection in certain scenarios. We also find that increasing the number of demonstrations does not always lead to better performance, and that there are often trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a powerful paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) through external knowledge retrieval. Despite its widespread attention, existing academic research predominantly focuses on single-turn RAG, leaving a significant gap in addressing the complexities of multi-turn conversations found in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce CORAL, a large-scale benchmark designed to assess RAG systems in realistic multi-turn conversational settings. CORAL includes diverse information-seeking conversations automatically derived from Wikipedia and tackles key challenges such as open-domain coverage, knowledge intensity, free-form responses, and topic shifts. It supports three core tasks of conversational RAG: passage retrieval, response generation, and citation labeling. We propose a unified framework to standardize various conversational RAG methods and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of these methods on CORAL, demonstrating substantial opportunities for improving existing approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have activated the capabilitiesof Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving visual-language tasks by integratingvisual information. The prevailing approach in existing MLLMs involvesemploying an image encoder to extract visual features, converting thesefeatures into visual tokens via an adapter, and then integrating them with theprompt into the LLM. However, because the process of image encoding isprompt-agnostic, the extracted visual features only provide a coarsedescription of the image, impossible to focus on the requirements of theprompt. On one hand, it is easy for image features to lack information aboutthe prompt-specified objects, resulting in unsatisfactory responses. On theother hand, the visual features contain a large amount of irrelevantinformation, which not only increases the burden on memory but also worsens thegeneration effectiveness. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose\textbf{PIP-MM}, a framework that \textbf{P}re-\textbf{I}ntegrates\textbf{P}rompt information into the visual encoding process using existingmodules of MLLMs. Specifically, We utilize the frozen LLM in the MLLM tovectorize the input prompt, which summarizes the requirements of the prompt.Then, we input the prompt vector into our trained Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)to align with the visual input requirements, and subsequently replace the classembedding in the image encoder. Since our model only requires adding atrainable MLP, it can be applied to any MLLM. To validate the effectiveness ofPIP-MM, we conducted experiments on multiple benchmarks. Automated evaluationmetrics and manual assessments demonstrate the strong performance of PIP-MM.Particularly noteworthy is that our model maintains excellent generationresults even when half of the visual tokens are reduced.

These requirements present new challenges, which can no longer be efficiently addressed by conventional strategies. In response, this article underscores the transformative potential of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for 6G, highlighting its advantages over classic machine learning solutions in meeting the demands of 6G. The necessity of DRL is further validated through three DRL applications in an end-to-end communication procedure, including wireless access control, baseband function placement, and network slicing coordination. However, DRL-based network management initiatives are far from mature. We extend the discussion to identify the challenges of applying DRL in practical networks and explore potential solutions along with their respective limitations. In the end, these insights are validated through a practical DRL deployment in managing network slices on the testbed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Compute-in-memory (CIM) accelerators for spiking neural networks (SNNs) are promising solutions to enable $\mu$s-level inference latency and ultra-low energy in edge vision applications. Yet, their current lack of flexibility at both the circuit and system levels prevents their deployment in a wide range of real-life scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel digital CIM macro that supports arbitrary operand resolution and shape, with a unified CIM storage for weights and membrane potentials. These circuit-level techniques enable a hybrid weight- and output-stationary dataflow at the system level to maximize operand reuse, thereby minimizing costly on- and off-chip data movements during the SNN execution. Measurement results of a fabricated FlexSpIM prototype in 40-nm CMOS demonstrate a 2$\times$ increase in bit-normalized energy efficiency compared to prior fixed-precision digital CIM-SNNs, while providing resolution reconfiguration with bitwise granularity. Our approach can save up to 90% energy in large-scale systems, while reaching a state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 95.8% on the IBM DVS gesture dataset.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Molecule optimization is a critical task in drug discovery to optimize desired properties of a given molecule through chemical modification. Despite Large Language Models (LLMs) holding the potential to efficiently simulate this task by using natural language to direct the optimization, straightforwardly utilizing shows limited performance. In this work, we facilitate utilizing LLMs in an iterative paradigm by proposing a simple yet highly effective domain feedback provider, namely $\text{Re}^3$DF. In detail, $\text{Re}^3$DF harnesses an external toolkit, RDKit, to handle the molecule hallucination, if the modified molecule is chemically invalid. Otherwise, its desired properties are computed and compared to the original one, establishing reliable domain feedback with correct direction and distance towards the objective, followed by a retrieved example, to explicitly guide the LLM to refine the modified molecule. We conduct experiments across both single- and multi-property objectives with 2 thresholds, where $\text{Re}^3$DF shows significant improvements. Particularly, for 20 single-property objectives, $\text{Re}^3$DF enhances Hit ratio by 16.95% and 20.76% under loose and strict thresholds, respectively. For 32 multi-property objectives, $\text{Re}^3$DF enhances Hit ratio by 6.04% and 5.25%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are essential in natural language processing but often struggle with inference speed and computational efficiency, limiting real-time deployment. The key-value (KV) cache mechanism reduces computational overhead in transformer models, but challenges in maintaining contextual understanding remain. In this paper, we propose BUZZ, a novel KV caching algorithm that leverages structured contextual information to minimize cache memory usage while enhancing inference speed. BUZZ employs a beehive-structured sparse cache, incorporating a sliding window to capture recent information and dynamically segmenting historical tokens into chunks to prioritize important tokens in local neighborhoods. We evaluate BUZZ on four real-world datasets: CNN/Daily Mail, XSUM, Wikitext, and 10-QA. Our results demonstrate that BUZZ (1) reduces cache memory usage by $\textbf{2.5}\times$ in LLM inference while maintaining over 99% accuracy in long-text summarization, and (2) surpasses state-of-the-art performance in multi-document question answering by $\textbf{7.69%}$ under the same memory limit, where full cache methods encounter out-of-memory issues. Additionally, BUZZ achieves significant inference speedup with a $\log{n}$ time complexity. The code is available at https://github.com/JunqiZhao888/buzz-llm.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The computational challenges of Large Language Model (LLM) inference remain a significant barrier to their widespread deployment, especially as prompt lengths continue to increase. Due to the quadratic complexity of the attention computation, it takes 30 minutes for an 8B LLM to process a prompt of 1M tokens (i.e., the pre-filling stage) on a single A100 GPU. Existing methods for speeding up prefilling often fail to maintain acceptable accuracy or efficiency when applied to long-context LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce MInference (Milliontokens Inference), a sparse calculation method designed to accelerate pre-filling of long-sequence processing. Specifically, we identify three unique patterns in long-context attention matrices-the A-shape, Vertical-Slash, and Block-Sparsethat can be leveraged for efficient sparse computation on GPUs. We determine the optimal pattern for each attention head offline and dynamically build sparse indices based on the assigned pattern during inference. With the pattern and sparse indices, we perform efficient sparse attention calculations via our optimized GPU kernels to significantly reduce the latency in the pre-filling stage of long-context LLMs. Our proposed technique can be directly applied to existing LLMs without any modifications to the pre-training setup or additional fine-tuning. By evaluating on a wide range of downstream tasks, including InfiniteBench, RULER, PG-19, and Needle In A Haystack, and models including LLaMA-3-1M, GLM4-1M, Yi-200K, Phi-3-128K, and Qwen2-128K, we demonstrate that MInference effectively reduces inference latency by up to 10x for pre-filling on an A100, while maintaining accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs), with their exceptional ability to handle a wide range of tasks, have driven significant advancements in tackling reasoning and planning tasks, wherein decomposing complex problems into executable workflows is a crucial step in this process. Existing workflow evaluation frameworks either focus solely on holistic performance or suffer from limitations such as restricted scenario coverage, simplistic workflow structures, and lax evaluation standards. To this end, we introduce WorFBench, a unified workflow generation benchmark with multi-faceted scenarios and intricate graph workflow structures. Additionally, we present WorFEval, a systemic evaluation protocol utilizing subsequence and subgraph matching algorithms to accurately quantify the LLM agent's workflow generation capabilities. Through comprehensive evaluations across different types of LLMs, we discover distinct gaps between the sequence planning capabilities and graph planning capabilities of LLM agents, with even GPT-4 exhibiting a gap of around 15%. We also train two open-source models and evaluate their generalization abilities on held-out tasks. Furthermore, we observe that the generated workflows can enhance downstream tasks, enabling them to achieve superior performance with less time during inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce MPLSandbox, an out-of-the-box multi-programming language sandbox designed to provide unified and comprehensive feedback from compiler and analysis tools for Large Language Models (LLMs). It can automatically identify the programming language of the code, compiling and executing it within an isolated sub-sandbox to ensure safety and stability. In addition, MPLSandbox also integrates both traditional and LLM-based code analysis tools, providing a comprehensive analysis of generated code. MPLSandbox can be effortlessly integrated into the training and deployment of LLMs to improve the quality and correctness of their generated code. It also helps researchers streamline their workflows for various LLM-based code-related tasks, reducing the development cost. To validate the effectiveness of MPLSandbox, we integrate it into training and deployment approaches, and also employ it to optimize workflows for a wide range of real-world code-related tasks. Our goal is to enhance researcher productivity on LLM-based code-related tasks by simplifying and automating workflows through delegation to MPLSandbox.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work takes a pedagogical lens to explore the implications of generative AI (GenAI) models and tools, such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, in a semester-long 2nd-year undergraduate Software Engineering Team Project. Qualitative findings from survey (39 students) and interviews (eight students) provide insights into the students' views on the impact of GenAI use on their coding experience, learning, and self-efficacy. Our results address a particular gap in understanding the role and implications of GenAI on teamwork, team-efficacy, and team dynamics. The analysis of the learning aspects is distinguished by the application of learning and pedagogy informed lenses to discuss the data. We propose a preliminary design space for GenAI-based programming learning tools highlighting the importance of considering the roles that GenAI can play during the learning process, the varying support-ability patterns that can be applied to each role, and the importance of supporting transparency in GenAI for team members and students in addition to educators.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Robot swarms are composed of many simple robots that communicate and collaborate to fulfill complex tasks. Robot controllers usually need to be specified by experts on a case-by-case basis via programming code. This process is time-consuming, prone to errors, and unable to take into account all situations that may be encountered during deployment. On the other hand, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated reasoning and planning capabilities, introduced new ways to interact with and program machines, and incorporate both domain-specific and commonsense knowledge. Hence, we propose to address the aforementioned challenges by integrating LLMs with robot swarms and show the potential in proofs of concept (showcases). For this integration, we explore two approaches. The first approach is 'indirect integration,' where LLMs are used to synthesize and validate the robot controllers. This approach may reduce development time and human error before deployment. Moreover, during deployment, it could be used for on-the-fly creation of new robot behaviors. The second approach is 'direct integration,' where each robot locally executes a separate LLM instance during deployment for robot-robot collaboration and human-swarm interaction. These local LLM instances enable each robot to reason, plan, and collaborate using natural language, as demonstrated in our showcases where the robots are able to detect a variety of anomalies, without prior information about the nature of these anomalies. To enable further research on our mainly conceptual contribution, we release the software and videos for our LLM2Swarm system: https://github.com/Pold87/LLM2Swarm.

To address this gap, we introduce the SECURE (Security Extraction, Understanding \& Reasoning Evaluation), a benchmark designed to assess LLMs performance in realistic cybersecurity scenarios. SECURE includes six datasets focussed on the Industrial Control System sector to evaluate knowledge extraction, understanding, and reasoning based on industry-standard sources. Our study evaluates seven state-of-the-art models on these tasks, providing insights into their strengths and weaknesses in cybersecurity contexts, and offer recommendations for improving LLMs reliability as cyber advisory tools.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing capabilities of large generative models and their ever more widespread deployment have raised concerns about their reliability, safety, and potential misuse. To address these issues, recent works have proposed to control model generation by steering model activations in order to effectively induce or prevent the emergence of concepts or behaviors in the generated output. In this paper we introduce Activation Transport (AcT), a general framework to steer activations guided by optimal transport theory that generalizes many previous activation-steering works. AcT is modality-agnostic and provides fine-grained control over the model behavior with negligible computational overhead, while minimally impacting model abilities. We experimentally show the effectiveness and versatility of our approach by addressing key challenges in large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image diffusion models (T2Is). For LLMs, we show that AcT can effectively mitigate toxicity, induce arbitrary concepts, and increase their truthfulness. In T2Is, we show how AcT enables fine-grained style control and concept negation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this work we consider Code World Models, world models generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) in the form of Python code for model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). Calling code instead of LLMs for planning has potential to be more precise, reliable, interpretable, and extremely efficient. However, writing appropriate Code World Models requires the ability to understand complex instructions, to generate exact code with non-trivial logic and to self-debug a long program with feedback from unit tests and environment trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose Generate, Improve and Fix with Monte Carlo Tree Search (GIF-MCTS), a new code generation strategy for LLMs. To test our approach in an offline RL setting, we introduce the Code World Models Benchmark (CWMB), a suite of program synthesis and planning tasks comprised of 18 diverse RL environments paired with corresponding textual descriptions and curated trajectories. GIF-MCTS surpasses all baselines on the CWMB and two other benchmarks, and we show that the Code World Models synthesized with it can be successfully used for planning, resulting in model-based RL agents with greatly improved sample efficiency and inference speed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Robotic systems show significant promise for water environmental sensing applications such as water quality monitoring, pollution mapping and biodiversity data collection.   Conventional deployment methods often disrupt fragile ecosystems, preventing depiction of the undisturbed environmental condition. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel framework utilizing a lightweight tumbler system equipped with a sensing unit, deployed via a drone. This design minimizes disruption to the water habitat by maintaining a slow descent. The sensing unit is detached once on the water surface, enabling precise and non-invasive data collection from the benthic zone.   The tumbler is designed to be lightweight and compact, enabling deployment via a drone. The sensing pod, which detaches from the tumbler and descends to the bottom of the water body, is equipped with temperature and pressure sensors, as well as a buoyancy system. The later, activated upon task completion, utilizes a silicon membrane inflated via a chemical reaction. The reaction generates a pressure of 70 kPa, causing the silicon membrane to expand by 30\%, which exceeds the 5.7\% volume increase required for positive buoyancy. The tumblers, made from ecofriendly materials to minimize environmental impact when lost during the mission, were tested for their gliding ratio and descent rate. They exhibit a low descent rate, in the range of 0.8 to 2.5 meters per seconds, which minimizes disturbance to the ecosystem upon water landing. Additionally, the system demonstrated robustness in moderate to strong wind conditions during outdoor tests, validating the overall framework.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models excel in tasks like natural language understanding and text generation. Prompt engineering plays a critical role in leveraging LLM effectively. However, LLMs black-box nature hinders its interpretability and effective prompting engineering. A wide range of model explanation approaches have been developed for deep learning models, However, these local explanations are designed for single-output tasks like classification and regression,and cannot be directly applied to LLMs, which generate sequences of tokens. Recent efforts in LLM explanation focus on natural language explanations, but they are prone to hallucinations and inaccuracies. To address this, we introduce PromptExp , a framework for multi-granularity prompt explanations by aggregating token-level insights. PromptExp introduces two token-level explanation approaches: 1. an aggregation-based approach combining local explanation techniques, and 2. a perturbation-based approach with novel techniques to evaluate token masking impact. PromptExp supports both white-box and black-box explanations and extends explanations to higher granularity levels, enabling flexible analysis. We evaluate PromptExp in case studies such as sentiment analysis, showing the perturbation-based approach performs best using semantic similarity to assess perturbation impact. Furthermore, we conducted a user study to confirm PromptExp's accuracy and practical value, and demonstrate its potential to enhance LLM interpretability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As LLMs exhibit a high degree of human-like capability, increasing attention has been paid to role-playing research areas in which responses generated by LLMs are expected to mimic human replies. This has promoted the exploration of role-playing agents in various applications, such as chatbots that can engage in natural conversations with users and virtual assistants that can provide personalized support and guidance. The crucial factor in the role-playing task is the effective utilization of character memory, which stores characters' profiles, experiences, and historical dialogues. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technology is used to access the related memory to enhance the response generation of role-playing agents. Most existing studies retrieve related information based on the semantic similarity of memory to maintain characters' personalized traits, and few attempts have been made to incorporate the emotional factor in the retrieval argument generation (RAG) of LLMs. Inspired by the Mood-Dependent Memory theory, which indicates that people recall an event better if they somehow reinstate during recall the original emotion they experienced during learning, we propose a novel emotion-aware memory retrieval framework, termed Emotional RAG, which recalls the related memory with consideration of emotional state in role-playing agents. Specifically, we design two kinds of retrieval strategies, i.e., combination strategy and sequential strategy, to incorporate both memory semantic and emotional states during the retrieval process. Extensive experiments on three representative role-playing datasets demonstrate that our Emotional RAG framework outperforms the method without considering the emotional factor in maintaining the personalities of role-playing agents. This provides evidence to further reinforce the Mood-Dependent Memory theory in psychology.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Existing view planning systems either adopt an iterative paradigm using next-best views (NBV) or a one-shot pipeline relying on the set-covering view-planning (SCVP) network. However, neither of these methods can concurrently guarantee both high-quality and high-efficiency reconstruction of 3D unknown objects. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a crucial hypothesis: with the availability of more information about the unknown object, the prediction quality of the SCVP network improves. There are two ways to provide extra information: (1) leveraging perception data obtained from NBVs, and (2) training on an expanded dataset of multiview inputs. In this work, we introduce a novel combined pipeline that incorporates a single NBV before activating the proposed multiview-activated (MA-)SCVP network. The MA-SCVP is trained on a multiview dataset generated by our long-tail sampling method, which addresses the issue of unbalanced multiview inputs and enhances the network performance. Extensive simulated experiments substantiate that our system demonstrates a significant surface coverage increase and a substantial 45% reduction in movement cost compared to state-of-the-art systems. Real-world experiments justify the capability of our system for generalization and deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Instruction-following is crucial for building AI agents with large language models (LLMs), as these models must adhere strictly to user-provided constraints and guidelines. However, LLMs often fail to follow even simple and clear instructions. To improve instruction-following behavior and prevent undesirable outputs, a deeper understanding of how LLMs' internal states relate to these outcomes is required. Our analysis of LLM internal states reveal a dimension in the input embedding space linked to successful instruction-following. We demonstrate that modifying representations along this dimension improves instruction-following success rates compared to random changes, without compromising response quality. Further investigation reveals that this dimension is more closely related to the phrasing of prompts rather than the inherent difficulty of the task or instructions. This discovery also suggests explanations for why LLMs sometimes fail to follow clear instructions and why prompt engineering is often effective, even when the content remains largely unchanged. This work provides insight into the internal workings of LLMs' instruction-following, paving the way for reliable LLM agents.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Contemporary radio access networks employ link adaption (LA) algorithms to optimize the modulation and coding schemes to adapt to the prevailing propagation conditions and are near-optimal in terms of the achieved spectral efficiency. LA is a challenging task in the presence of mobility, fast fading, and imperfect channel quality information and limited knowledge of the receiver characteristics at the transmitter, which render model-based LA algorithms complex and suboptimal. Model-based LA is especially difficult as connected user equipment devices become increasingly heterogeneous in terms of receiver capabilities, antenna configurations and hardware characteristics. Recognizing these difficulties, previous works have proposed reinforcement learning (RL) for LA, which faces deployment difficulties due to their potential negative impacts on live performance. To address this challenge, this paper considers offline RL to learn LA policies from data acquired in live networks with minimal or no intrusive effects on the network operation. We propose three LA designs based on batch-constrained deep Q-learning, conservative Q-learning, and decision transformers, showing that offline RL algorithms can achieve performance of state-of-the-art online RL methods when data is collected with a proper behavioral policy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Gradient based optimization algorithms deployed in Machine Learning (ML) applications are often analyzed and compared by their convergence rates or regret bounds. While these rates and bounds convey valuable information they don't always directly translate to stability guarantees. Stability and similar concepts, like robustness, will become ever more important as we move towards deploying models in real-time and safety critical systems. In this work we build upon the results in Gaudio et al. 2021 and Moreu & Annaswamy 2022 for gradient descent with second order dynamics when applied to explicitly time varying cost functions and provide more general stability guarantees. These more general results can aid in the design and certification of these optimization schemes so as to help ensure safe and reliable deployment for real-time learning applications. We also hope that the techniques provided here will stimulate and cross-fertilize the analysis that occurs on the same algorithms from the online learning and stochastic optimization communities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Automatically synthesizing dense rewards from natural language descriptions is a promising paradigm in reinforcement learning (RL), with applications to sparse reward problems, open-ended exploration, and hierarchical skill design. Recent works have made promising steps by exploiting the prior knowledge of large language models (LLMs). However, these approaches suffer from important limitations: they are either not scalable to problems requiring billions of environment samples; or are limited to reward functions expressible by compact code, which may require source code and have difficulty capturing nuanced semantics; or require a diverse offline dataset, which may not exist or be impossible to collect. In this work, we address these limitations through a combination of algorithmic and systems-level contributions. We propose ONI, a distributed architecture that simultaneously learns an RL policy and an intrinsic reward function using LLM feedback. Our approach annotates the agent's collected experience via an asynchronous LLM server, which is then distilled into an intrinsic reward model. We explore a range of algorithmic choices for reward modeling with varying complexity, including hashing, classification, and ranking models. By studying their relative tradeoffs, we shed light on questions regarding intrinsic reward design for sparse reward problems. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of challenging, sparse reward tasks from the NetHack Learning Environment in a simple unified process, solely using the agent's gathered experience, without requiring external datasets nor source code. We make our code available at \url{URL} (coming soon).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the evolving landscape of online communication, moderating hate speech (HS) presents an intricate challenge, compounded by the multimodal nature of digital content. This comprehensive survey delves into the recent strides in HS moderation, spotlighting the burgeoning role of large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs). Our exploration begins with a thorough analysis of current literature, revealing the nuanced interplay between textual, visual, and auditory elements in propagating HS. We uncover a notable trend towards integrating these modalities, primarily due to the complexity and subtlety with which HS is disseminated. A significant emphasis is placed on the advances facilitated by LLMs and LMMs, which have begun to redefine the boundaries of detection and moderation capabilities. We identify existing gaps in research, particularly in the context of underrepresented languages and cultures, and the need for solutions to handle low-resource settings. The survey concludes with a forward-looking perspective, outlining potential avenues for future research, including the exploration of novel AI methodologies, the ethical governance of AI in moderation, and the development of more nuanced, context-aware systems. This comprehensive overview aims to catalyze further research and foster a collaborative effort towards more sophisticated, responsible, and human-centric approaches to HS moderation in the digital era.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present a novel approach for long-term human trajectory prediction in indoor human-centric environments, which is essential for long-horizon robot planning in these environments. State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment. In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged (i.e., evaluated in a zero-shot fashion on the dataset) baselines for a time horizon of 60s.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The advent of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has spurred research into their applications in multi-modal contexts, particularly in video understanding. Traditional VideoQA benchmarks, despite providing quantitative metrics, often fail to encompass the full spectrum of video content and inadequately assess models' temporal comprehension. To address these limitations, we introduce MMBench-Video, a quantitative benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LVLMs' proficiency in video understanding. MMBench-Video incorporates lengthy videos from YouTube and employs free-form questions, mirroring practical use cases. The benchmark is meticulously crafted to probe the models' temporal reasoning skills, with all questions human-annotated according to a carefully constructed ability taxonomy. We employ GPT-4 for automated assessment, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness over earlier LLM-based evaluations. Utilizing MMBench-Video, we have conducted comprehensive evaluations that include both proprietary and open-source LVLMs for images and videos. MMBench-Video stands as a valuable resource for the research community, facilitating improved evaluation of LVLMs and catalyzing progress in the field of video understanding. The evalutation code of MMBench-Video will be integrated into VLMEvalKit: https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising approach to address the limitations of fixed knowledge in large language models (LLMs). However, current benchmarks for evaluating RAG systems suffer from two key deficiencies: (1) they fail to adequately measure LLMs' capability in handling long-context retrieval due to a lack of datasets that reflect the characteristics of retrieved documents, and (2) they lack a comprehensive evaluation method for assessing LLMs' ability to generate long-form responses that effectively exploits retrieved information. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the Long$^2$RAG benchmark and the Key Point Recall (KPR) metric. Long$^2$RAG comprises 280 questions spanning 10 domains and across 8 question categories, each associated with 5 retrieved documents with an average length of 2,444 words. KPR evaluates the extent to which LLMs incorporate key points extracted from the retrieved documents into their generated responses, providing a more nuanced assessment of their ability to exploit retrieved information.

Previous works have investigated various prompt engineering techniques for improving the performance of \glspl{LLM} to accomplish tasks, while others have proposed methods that utilize LLMs to plan and execute tasks based on the available functionalities of a given robot platform. In this work, we consider both lines of research by comparing prompt engineering techniques and combinations thereof within the application of high-level task planning and execution in service robotics.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Although previous research on large language models (LLMs) and large multi-modal models (LMMs) has systematically explored mathematical problem-solving (MPS) within visual contexts, the analysis of how these models process visual information during problem-solving remains insufficient. To address this gap, we present VisAidMath, a benchmark for evaluating the MPS process related to visual information. We follow a rigorous data curation pipeline involving both automated processes and manual annotations to ensure data quality and reliability. Consequently, this benchmark includes 1,200 challenging problems from various mathematical branches, vision-aid formulations, and difficulty levels, collected from diverse sources such as textbooks, examination papers, and Olympiad problems. Based on the proposed benchmark, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on ten mainstream LLMs and LMMs, highlighting deficiencies in the visual-aided reasoning process. For example, GPT-4V only achieves 45.33% accuracy in the visual-aided reasoning task, even with a drop of 2 points when provided with golden visual aids. In-depth analysis reveals that the main cause of deficiencies lies in hallucination regarding the implicit visual reasoning process, shedding light on future research directions in the visual-aided MPS process.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Surface electromyography (sEMG) based gesture recognition offers a natural and intuitive interaction modality for wearable devices. Despite significant advancements in sEMG-based gesture-recognition models, existing methods often suffer from high computational latency and increased energy consumption. Additionally, the inherent instability of sEMG signals, combined with their sensitivity to distribution shifts in real-world settings, compromises model robustness. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel SpGesture framework based on Spiking Neural Networks, which possesses several unique merits compared with existing methods: (1) Robustness: By utilizing membrane potential as a memory list, we pioneer the introduction of Source-Free Domain Adaptation into SNN for the first time. This enables SpGesture to mitigate the accuracy degradation caused by distribution shifts. (2) High Accuracy: With a novel Spiking Jaccard Attention, SpGesture enhances the SNNs' ability to represent sEMG features, leading to a notable rise in system accuracy. To validate SpGesture's performance, we collected a new sEMG gesture dataset which has different forearm postures, where SpGesture achieved the highest accuracy among the baselines ($89.26\%$). Moreover, the actual deployment on the CPU demonstrated a system latency below 100ms, well within real-time requirements. This impressive performance showcases SpGesture's potential to enhance the applicability of sEMG in real-world scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/guoweiyu/SpGesture/.

Central to this concept is the rapid deployment of UAV swarms equipped with diverse sensing, communication, and intelligence capabilities, functioning as an integrated system that incorporates multiple technologies and approaches for efficient detection of individuals buried beneath rubble or debris following a disaster. Within this framework, we propose architectural solution and address associated challenges to ensure optimal performance in real-world disaster scenarios. The proposed framework aims to achieve complete coverage of damaged areas significantly faster than traditional methods using a multi-tier swarm architecture. Furthermore, integrating multi-modal sensing data with machine learning for data fusion could enhance detection accuracy, ensuring precise identification of survivors.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> 6-DoF grasp detection is critically important for the advancement of intelligent embodied systems, as it provides feasible robot poses for object grasping. Various methods have been proposed to detect 6-DoF grasps through the extraction of 3D geometric features from RGBD or point cloud data. However, most of these approaches encounter challenges during real robot deployment due to their significant computational demands, which can be particularly problematic for mobile robot platforms, especially those reliant on edge computing devices. This paper presents an Efficient End-to-End Grasp Detection Network (E3GNet) for 6-DoF grasp detection utilizing hierarchical heatmap representations. E3GNet effectively identifies high-quality and diverse grasps in cluttered real-world environments. Benefiting from our end-to-end methodology and efficient network design, our approach surpasses previous methods in model inference efficiency and achieves real-time 6-Dof grasp detection on edge devices. Furthermore, real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a satisfactory 94% object grasping success rate.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> How capable are diffusion models of generating synthetics texts? Recent research shows their strengths, with performance reaching that of auto-regressive LLMs. But are they also good in generating synthetic data if the training was under differential privacy? Here the evidence is missing, yet the promises from private image generation look strong. In this paper we address this open question by extensive experiments. At the same time, we critically assess (and reimplement) previous works on synthetic private text generation with LLMs and reveal some unmet assumptions that might have led to violating the differential privacy guarantees. Our results partly contradict previous non-private findings and show that fully open-source LLMs outperform diffusion models in the privacy regime. Our complete source codes, datasets, and experimental setup is publicly available to foster future research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses key limitations of large language models (LLMs), such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge, by incorporating external databases. These databases typically consult multiple sources to encompass up-to-date and various information. However, standard RAG methods often overlook the heterogeneous source reliability in the multi-source database and retrieve documents solely based on relevance, making them prone to propagating misinformation. To address this, we propose Reliability-Aware RAG (RA-RAG) which estimates the reliability of multiple sources and incorporates this information into both retrieval and aggregation processes. Specifically, it iteratively estimates source reliability and true answers for a set of queries with no labelling. Then, it selectively retrieves relevant documents from a few of reliable sources and aggregates them using weighted majority voting, where the selective retrieval ensures scalability while not compromising the performance. We also introduce a benchmark designed to reflect real-world scenarios with heterogeneous source reliability and demonstrate the effectiveness of RA-RAG compared to a set of baselines.

While the vanilla few-shot jailbreaking may be inefficient, we propose improved techniques such as injecting special system tokens like [/INST] and employing demo-level random search from a collected demo pool. These simple techniques result in surprisingly effective jailbreaking against aligned LLMs (even with advanced defenses). For examples, our method achieves >80% (mostly >95%) ASRs on Llama-2-7B and Llama-3-8B without multiple restarts, even if the models are enhanced by strong defenses such as perplexity detection and/or SmoothLLM, which is challenging for suffix-based jailbreaking. In addition, we conduct comprehensive and elaborate (e.g., making sure to use correct system prompts) evaluations against other aligned LLMs and advanced defenses, where our method consistently achieves nearly 100% ASRs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative Agents to enhance time series forecasting by reasoning across both text and time series data. With language as a medium, our method adaptively integrates social events into forecasting models, aligning news content with time series fluctuations to provide richer insights. Specifically, we utilize LLM-based agents to iteratively filter out irrelevant news and employ human-like reasoning to evaluate predictions. This enables the model to analyze complex events, such as unexpected incidents and shifts in social behavior, and continuously refine the selection logic of news and the robustness of the agent's output. By integrating selected news events with time series data, we fine-tune a pre-trained LLM to predict sequences of digits in time series. The results demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting accuracy, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in time series forecasting through the effective utilization of unstructured news data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A promising approach to detect high-energy tau neutrinos is through the measurement of impulsive radio emission from horizontal air showers initiated in the Earth's atmosphere. Observations at frequencies between 30 and 80 MHz seem particularly promising -- if high-gain antennas focused at the horizon and blocking out as much as possible of the noisy sky are employed. Due to the large wavelengths, however, designing an antenna with the required properties is highly non-trivial at such low frequencies. In this article, we explore suitable antenna designs that provide the desired high gain, possess a smooth beam, are insensitive to ground conditions, are easily impedance-matched over the wide band, and are mechanically simple for deployment in large numbers in inaccessible terrain. In particular, we consider the "rhombus" antenna design for both horizontally and vertically polarized radiation a very attractive option for tau neutrino detection efforts in the atmosphere with the radio technique.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite the success of Instruction Tuning (IT) in training large language models (LLMs) to perform arbitrary user-specified tasks, these models often still leverage spurious or biased features learned from their training data, leading to undesired behaviours when deploying them in new contexts. In this work, we introduce Focus Instruction Tuning (FIT), which trains LLMs to condition their responses by focusing on specific features whilst ignoring others, leading to different behaviours based on what features are specified. Across several experimental settings, we show that focus-tuned models can be adaptively steered by focusing on different features at inference-time: for instance, robustness can be improved by focusing on task-causal features and ignoring spurious features, and social bias can be mitigated by ignoring demographic categories. Furthermore, FIT can steer behaviour in new contexts, generalising under distribution shift and to new unseen features at inference time, and thereby facilitating more robust, fair, and controllable LLM applications in real-world environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> News headlines often evoke sentiment by intentionally portraying entities in particular ways, making targeted sentiment analysis (TSA) of headlines a worthwhile but difficult task. Due to its subjectivity, creating TSA datasets can involve various annotation paradigms, from descriptive to prescriptive, either encouraging or limiting subjectivity. LLMs are a good fit for TSA due to their broad linguistic and world knowledge and in-context learning abilities, yet their performance depends on prompt design. In this paper, we compare the accuracy of state-of-the-art LLMs and fine-tuned encoder models for TSA of news headlines using descriptive and prescriptive datasets across several languages. Exploring the descriptive--prescriptive continuum, we analyze how performance is affected by prompt prescriptiveness, ranging from plain zero-shot to elaborate few-shot prompts. Finally, we evaluate the ability of LLMs to quantify uncertainty via calibration error and comparison to human label variation. We find that LLMs outperform fine-tuned encoders on descriptive datasets, while calibration and F1-score generally improve with increased prescriptiveness, yet the optimal level varies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multilingual large language models (LLMs) have gained prominence, but concerns arise regarding their reliability beyond English. This study addresses the gap in cross-lingual semantic evaluation by introducing a novel benchmark for cross-lingual sense disambiguation, StingrayBench. In this paper, we demonstrate using false friends -- words that are orthographically similar but have completely different meanings in two languages -- as a possible approach to pinpoint the limitation of cross-lingual sense disambiguation in LLMs. We collect false friends in four language pairs, namely Indonesian-Malay, Indonesian-Tagalog, Chinese-Japanese, and English-German; and challenge LLMs to distinguish the use of them in context. In our analysis of various models, we observe they tend to be biased toward higher-resource languages. We also propose new metrics for quantifying the cross-lingual sense bias and comprehension based on our benchmark. Our work contributes to developing more diverse and inclusive language modeling, promoting fairer access for the wider multilingual community.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Binarization, which converts weight parameters to binary values, has emerged as an effective strategy to reduce the size of large language models (LLMs). However, typical binarization techniques significantly diminish linguistic effectiveness of LLMs. To address this issue, we introduce a novel binarization technique called Mixture of Scales (BinaryMoS). Unlike conventional methods, BinaryMoS employs multiple scaling experts for binary weights, dynamically merging these experts for each token to adaptively generate scaling factors. This token-adaptive approach boosts the representational power of binarized LLMs by enabling contextual adjustments to the values of binary weights. Moreover, because this adaptive process only involves the scaling factors rather than the entire weight matrix, BinaryMoS maintains compression efficiency similar to traditional static binarization methods. Our experimental results reveal that BinaryMoS surpasses conventional binarization techniques in various natural language processing tasks and even outperforms 2-bit quantization methods, all while maintaining similar model size to static binarization techniques.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In an era where single large language models have dominated the landscape of artificial intelligence for years, multi-agent systems arise as new protagonists in conversational task-solving. While previous studies have showcased their potential in reasoning tasks and creative endeavors, an analysis of their limitations concerning the conversational paradigms and the impact of individual agents is missing. It remains unascertained how multi-agent discussions perform across tasks of varying complexity and how the structure of these conversations influences the process. To fill that gap, this work systematically evaluates multi-agent systems across various discussion paradigms, assessing their strengths and weaknesses in both generative tasks and question-answering tasks. Alongside the experiments, I propose a taxonomy of 20 multi-agent research studies from 2022 to 2024, followed by the introduction of a framework for deploying multi-agent LLMs in conversational task-solving. I demonstrate that while multi-agent systems excel in complex reasoning tasks, outperforming a single model by leveraging expert personas, they fail on basic tasks. Concretely, I identify three challenges that arise: 1) While longer discussions enhance reasoning, agents fail to maintain conformity to strict task requirements, which leads to problem drift, making shorter conversations more effective for basic tasks. 2) Prolonged discussions risk alignment collapse, raising new safety concerns for these systems. 3) I showcase discussion monopolization through long generations, posing the problem of fairness in decision-making for tasks like summarization. This work uncovers both the potential and challenges that arise with multi-agent interaction and varying conversational paradigms, providing insights into how future research could improve the efficiency, performance, and safety of multi-agent LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Autonomous mobile app interaction has become increasingly important with growing complexity of mobile applications. Developing intelligent agents that can effectively navigate and interact with mobile apps remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose an Explainable Behavior Cloning LLM Agent (EBC-LLMAgent), a novel approach that combines large language models (LLMs) with behavior cloning by learning demonstrations to create intelligent and explainable agents for autonomous mobile app interaction. EBC-LLMAgent consists of three core modules: Demonstration Encoding, Code Generation, and UI Mapping, which work synergistically to capture user demonstrations, generate executable codes, and establish accurate correspondence between code and UI elements. We introduce the Behavior Cloning Chain Fusion technique to enhance the generalization capabilities of the agent. Extensive experiments on five popular mobile applications from diverse domains demonstrate the superior performance of EBC-LLMAgent, achieving high success rates in task completion, efficient generalization to unseen scenarios, and the generation of meaningful explanations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in incorporating Indic languages within multilingual models. However, it is crucial to quantitatively assess whether these languages perform comparably to globally dominant ones, such as English. Currently, there is a lack of benchmark datasets specifically designed to evaluate the regional knowledge of LLMs in various Indic languages. In this paper, we present the L3Cube-IndicQuest, a gold-standard factual question-answering benchmark dataset designed to evaluate how well multilingual LLMs capture regional knowledge across various Indic languages. The dataset contains 200 question-answer pairs, each for English and 19 Indic languages, covering five domains specific to the Indic region. We aim for this dataset to serve as a benchmark, providing ground truth for evaluating the performance of LLMs in understanding and representing knowledge relevant to the Indian context. The IndicQuest can be used for both reference-based evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. The dataset is shared publicly at https://github.com/l3cube-pune/indic-nlp .

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve the efficiency and scalability of dense language models by routing each token to a small number of experts in each layer. In this paper, we show how an adversary that can arrange for their queries to appear in the same batch of examples as a victim's queries can exploit Expert-Choice-Routing to fully disclose a victim's prompt. We successfully demonstrate the effectiveness of this attack on a two-layer Mixtral model, exploiting the tie-handling behavior of the torch.topk CUDA implementation. Our results show that we can extract the entire prompt using $O({VM}^2)$ queries (with vocabulary size $V$ and prompt length $M$) or 100 queries on average per token in the setting we consider. This is the first attack to exploit architectural flaws for the purpose of extracting user prompts, introducing a new class of LLM vulnerabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using large language models (LLMs) often generate inaccurate responses due to the retrieval of irrelevant or loosely related information. Existing methods, which operate at the document level, fail to effectively filter out such content. We propose LLM-driven chunk filtering, ChunkRAG, a framework that enhances RAG systems by evaluating and filtering retrieved information at the chunk level. Our approach employs semantic chunking to divide documents into coherent sections and utilizes LLM-based relevance scoring to assess each chunk's alignment with the user's query. By filtering out less pertinent chunks before the generation phase, we significantly reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing RAG models, achieving higher accuracy on tasks requiring precise information retrieval. This advancement enhances the reliability of RAG systems, making them particularly beneficial for applications like fact-checking and multi-hop reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a critical mechanism in contemporary NLP to support Large Language Models(LLMs) in systematically accessing richer factual context. However, the integration of RAG mechanisms brings its inherent challenges, as LLMs need to deal with potentially noisy contexts. Recent studies have shown that LLMs still struggle to critically analyse RAG-based in-context information, a limitation that may lead to incorrect inferences and hallucinations. In this paper, we investigate how to elicit critical reasoning in RAG via contrastive explanations. In particular, we propose Contrastive-RAG (C-RAG), a framework that (i) retrieves relevant documents given a query, (ii) selects and exemplifies relevant passages, and (iii) generates explanations that explicitly contrast the relevance of the passages to (iv) support the final answer. We show the impact of C-RAG building contrastive reasoning demonstrations from LLMs to instruct smaller models for retrieval-augmented tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that C-RAG improves state-of-the-art RAG models while (a) requiring significantly fewer prompts and demonstrations and (b) being robust to perturbations in the retrieved documents.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Emerging interconnects, such as CXL and NVLink, have been integrated into the intra-host topology to scale more accelerators and facilitate efficient communication between them, such as GPUs. To keep pace with the accelerator's growing computing throughput, the interconnect has seen substantial enhancement in link bandwidth, e.g., 256GBps for CXL 3.0 links, which surpasses Ethernet and InfiniBand network links by an order of magnitude or more. Consequently, when data-intensive jobs, such as LLM training, scale across multiple hosts beyond the reach limit of the interconnect, the performance is significantly hindered by the limiting bandwidth of the network infrastructure. We address the problem by proposing DFabric, a two-tier interconnect architecture. We address the problem by proposing DFabric, a two-tier interconnect architecture. First, DFabric disaggregates rack's computing units with an interconnect fabric, i.e., CXL fabric, which scales at rack-level, so that they can enjoy intra-rack efficient interconnecting. Second, DFabric disaggregates NICs from hosts, and consolidates them to form a NIC pool with CXL fabric. By providing sufficient aggregated capacity comparable to interconnect bandwidth, the NIC pool bridges efficient communication across racks or beyond the reach limit of interconnect fabric. However, the local memory accessing becomes the bottleneck when enabling each host to utilize the NIC pool efficiently. To the end, DFabric builds a memory pool with sufficient bandwidth by disaggregating host local memory and adding more memory devices. We have implemented a prototype of DFabric that can run applications transparently. We validated its performance gain by running various microbenchmarks and compute-intensive applications such as DNN and graph.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The performance of large language models (LLMs) is acutely sensitive to the phrasing of prompts, which raises significant concerns about their reliability in real-world scenarios. Existing studies often divide prompts into task-level instructions and case-level inputs and primarily focus on evaluating and improving robustness against variations in tasks-level instructions. However, this setup fails to fully address the diversity of real-world user queries and assumes the existence of task-specific datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce RobustAlpacaEval, a new benchmark that consists of semantically equivalent case-level queries and emphasizes the importance of using the worst prompt performance to gauge the lower bound of model performance. Extensive experiments on RobustAlpacaEval with ChatGPT and six open-source LLMs from the Llama, Mistral, and Gemma families uncover substantial variability in model performance; for instance, a difference of 45.48% between the worst and best performance for the Llama-2-70B-chat model, with its worst performance dipping as low as 9.38%. We further illustrate the difficulty in identifying the worst prompt from both model-agnostic and model-dependent perspectives, emphasizing the absence of a shortcut to characterize the worst prompt. We also attempt to enhance the worst prompt performance using existing prompt engineering and prompt consistency methods, but find that their impact is limited. These findings underscore the need to create more resilient LLMs that can maintain high performance across diverse prompts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping consumer decision-making, particularly in communication with firms, yet our understanding of their impact remains limited. This research explores the effect of LLMs on consumer complaints submitted to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from 2015 to 2024, documenting the adoption of LLMs for drafting complaints and evaluating the likelihood of obtaining relief from financial firms. Utilizing a leading AI detection tool, we analyzed over 1 million complaints and identified a significant increase in LLM usage following the release of ChatGPT. We establish a causal relationship between LLM usage and an increased likelihood of obtaining relief by employing instrumental variables to address endogeneity in LLM adoption. Experimental data further support this link, demonstrating that LLMs enhance the clarity and persuasiveness of consumer narratives. Our findings suggest that facilitating access to LLMs can help firms better understand consumer concerns and level the playing field among consumers. This underscores the importance of policies promoting technological accessibility, enabling all consumers to effectively voice their concerns.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Effective research ideation is a critical step for scientific research. However, the exponential increase in scientific literature makes it challenging for researchers to stay current with recent advances and identify meaningful research directions. Recent developments in large language models~(LLMs) suggest a promising avenue for automating the generation of novel research ideas. However, existing methods for idea generation either trivially prompt LLMs or directly expose LLMs to extensive literature without indicating useful information. Inspired by the research process of human researchers, we propose a Chain-of-Ideas~(CoI) agent, an LLM-based agent that organizes relevant literature in a chain structure to effectively mirror the progressive development in a research domain. This organization facilitates LLMs to capture the current advancements in research, thereby enhancing their ideation capabilities. Furthermore, we propose Idea Arena, an evaluation protocol that can comprehensively evaluate idea generation methods from different perspectives, aligning closely with the preferences of human researchers. Experimental results indicate that the CoI agent consistently outperforms other methods and shows comparable quality as humans in research idea generation. Moreover, our CoI agent is budget-friendly, with a minimum cost of \$0.50 to generate a candidate idea and its corresponding experimental design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge, making them adaptable and cost-effective for various applications. However, the growing reliance on these systems also introduces potential security risks. In this work, we reveal a novel vulnerability, the retrieval prompt hijack attack (HijackRAG), which enables attackers to manipulate the retrieval mechanisms of RAG systems by injecting malicious texts into the knowledge database. When the RAG system encounters target questions, it generates the attacker's pre-determined answers instead of the correct ones, undermining the integrity and trustworthiness of the system. We formalize HijackRAG as an optimization problem and propose both black-box and white-box attack strategies tailored to different levels of the attacker's knowledge. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that HijackRAG consistently achieves high attack success rates, outperforming existing baseline attacks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the attack is transferable across different retriever models, underscoring the widespread risk it poses to RAG systems. Lastly, our exploration of various defense mechanisms reveals that they are insufficient to counter HijackRAG, emphasizing the urgent need for more robust security measures to protect RAG systems in real-world deployments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely used in code completion, and researchers are focusing on scaling up LLMs to improve their accuracy. However, larger LLMs will increase the response time of code completion and decrease the developers' productivity. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and effective LLM for code completion named aiXcoder-7B. Compared to existing LLMs, aiXcoder-7B achieves higher code completion accuracy while having smaller scales (i.e., 7 billion parameters). We attribute the superiority of aiXcoder-7B to three key factors: (1) Multi-objective training. We employ three training objectives, one of which is our proposed Structured Fill-In-the-Middle (SFIM). SFIM considers the syntax structures in code and effectively improves the performance of LLMs for code. (2) Diverse data sampling strategies. They consider inter-file relationships and enhance the capability of LLMs in understanding cross-file contexts. (3) Extensive high-quality data. We establish a rigorous data collection pipeline and consume a total of 1.2 trillion unique tokens for training aiXcoder-7B. This vast volume of data enables aiXcoder-7B to learn a broad distribution of code. We evaluate aiXcoder-7B in five popular code completion benchmarks and a new benchmark collected by this paper. The results show that aiXcoder-7B outperforms the latest six LLMs with similar sizes and even surpasses four larger LLMs (e.g., StarCoder2-15B and CodeLlama-34B), positioning aiXcoder-7B as a lightweight and effective LLM for academia and industry. Finally, we summarize three valuable insights for helping practitioners train the next generations of LLMs for code. aiXcoder-7B has been open-souced and gained significant attention. As of the submission date, aiXcoder-7B has received 2,193 GitHub Stars.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> How to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation remains an open question. Existing benchmarks have two limitations - data leakage and lack of domain-specific evaluation. The former hurts the fairness of benchmarks, and the latter hinders practitioners from selecting superior LLMs for specific programming domains. To address these two limitations, we propose a new benchmark - EvoCodeBench, which has the following advances: (1) Evolving data. EvoCodeBench will be dynamically updated every period (e.g., 6 months) to avoid data leakage. This paper releases the first version - EvoCodeBench-2403, containing 275 samples from 25 repositories. (2) A domain taxonomy and domain labels. Based on the statistics of open-source communities, we design a programming domain taxonomy consisting of 10 popular domains. Based on the taxonomy, we annotate each sample in EvoCodeBench with a domain label. (3) Domain-specific evaluations. Besides the Pass@k, we compute the Domain-Specific Improvement (DSI) and define LLMs' comfort and strange domains. These evaluations help practitioners select superior LLMs in specific domains and discover the shortcomings of existing LLMs. We evaluate 8 popular LLMs (e.g., gpt-4, DeepSeek Coder) on EvoCodeBench and summarize some insights. EvoCodeBench reveals the actual abilities of these LLMs in real-world repositories. For example, the highest Pass@1 of gpt-4 on EvoCodeBench-2403 is only 20.74%. Besides, we evaluate LLMs in different domains and discover their comfort and strange domains. For example, gpt-4 performs best in most domains but falls behind others in the Internet domain. StarCoder 2-15B unexpectedly performs well in the Database domain and even outperforms 33B LLMs. EvoCodeBench has been released.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in natural language processing tasks and demonstrate considerable potential in the legal domain. However, legal applications demand high standards of accuracy, reliability, and fairness. Applying existing LLMs to legal systems without careful evaluation of their potential and limitations could pose significant risks in legal practice. To this end, we introduce a standardized comprehensive Chinese legal benchmark LexEval. This benchmark is notable in the following three aspects: (1) Ability Modeling: We propose a new taxonomy of legal cognitive abilities to organize different tasks. (2) Scale: To our knowledge, LexEval is currently the largest Chinese legal evaluation dataset, comprising 23 tasks and 14,150 questions. (3) Data: we utilize formatted existing datasets, exam datasets and newly annotated datasets by legal experts to comprehensively evaluate the various capabilities of LLMs. LexEval not only focuses on the ability of LLMs to apply fundamental legal knowledge but also dedicates efforts to examining the ethical issues involved in their application. We evaluated 38 open-source and commercial LLMs and obtained some interesting findings. The experiments and findings offer valuable insights into the challenges and potential solutions for developing Chinese legal systems and LLM evaluation pipelines. The LexEval dataset and leaderboard are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/CSHaitao/LexEval} and will be continuously updated.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper addresses the challenges of aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values via preference learning (PL), focusing on incomplete and corrupted data in preference datasets. We propose a novel method for robustly and completely recalibrating values within these datasets to enhance LLMs' resilience against the issues. In particular, we devise a guaranteed polynomial time ranking algorithm that robustifies several existing models, such as the classic Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) (Bradley and Terry, 1952) model and certain generalizations of it. To the best of our knowledge, our present work is the first to propose an algorithm that provably recovers an $\epsilon$-optimal ranking with high probability while allowing as large as $O(n)$ perturbed pairwise comparison results per model response. Furthermore, we show robust recovery results in the partially observed setting. Our experiments confirm that our algorithms handle adversarial noise and unobserved comparisons well in both general and LLM preference dataset settings. This work contributes to the development and scaling of more reliable and ethically aligned AI models by equipping the dataset curation pipeline with the ability to handle missing and maliciously manipulated inputs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the task of code translation, neural network-based models have been shown to frequently produce semantically erroneous code that deviates from the original logic of the source code. This issue persists even with advanced large models. Although a recent approach proposed using test cases to identify these semantic errors, it relies heavily on the quality of the test cases and is not applicable to code snippets without test cases in real-world scenarios. Therefore, We present EISP, a static analysis framework based on the Large Language Model (LLM).First, the framework generates a semantic mapping between source code and translated code. Next, each sub-code fragment is identified by recursively traversing the abstract syntax tree of the source code, and its corresponding translated code fragment is found through the semantic mapping. Finally, EISP connects each pair of sub-code fragments with fine-grained knowledge hints through an AI chain to assist LLMs in discovering semantic mistakes in the translated code. In our benchmark evaluation, the EISP framework, based on GPT-4o mini, achieved an accuracy of 82.3\%, representing a 20.3\% improvement over baseline methods using the same base model, and a 7.4\% improvement compared to dynamic analysis methods that require test cases and manual intervention. To our knowledge, EISP is the first tool to locate semantic errors in translated code without test cases or compilable code. This innovative tool provides the software engineering community with a new way to deal with code fragments without test cases.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is a challenging task in sentiment analysis, aiming to provide fine-grained insights into human sentiments. However, existing benchmarks are limited to two domains and do not evaluate model performance on unseen domains, raising concerns about the generalization of proposed methods. Furthermore, it remains unclear if large language models (LLMs) can effectively handle complex sentiment tasks like ASTE. In this work, we address the issue of generalization in ASTE from both a benchmarking and modeling perspective. We introduce a domain-expanded benchmark by annotating samples from diverse domains, enabling evaluation of models in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Additionally, we propose CASE, a simple and effective decoding strategy that enhances trustworthiness and performance of LLMs in ASTE. Through comprehensive experiments involving multiple tasks, settings, and models, we demonstrate that CASE can serve as a general decoding strategy for complex sentiment tasks. By expanding the scope of evaluation and providing a more reliable decoding strategy, we aim to inspire the research community to reevaluate the generalizability of benchmarks and models for ASTE.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated fine-tuning for Large Language Models (LLMs) has recently gained attention due to the heavy communication overhead of transmitting large model updates. Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been proposed as a solution, yet its application in federated learning is complicated by discordance in aggregation. Existing methods addressing this discordance often suffer from performance degradation at low ranks in heterogeneous data settings. In response, we introduce LoRA-A2 (Low Rank Adaptation with Alternating freeze and Adaptive rank selection), which demonstrates robustness in challenging settings with low ranks and high data heterogeneity. Our experimental findings reveal that LoRA-A2 maintains performance even under extreme heterogeneity and low rank conditions, achieving up to a 99.8% reduction in uploaded parameters compared to full fine-tuning without compromising performance. This adaptive mechanism boosts robustness and communication efficiency in federated fine-tuning, enabling the practical deployment of LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in recommender systems have focused on leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve user preference modeling, yielding promising outcomes. However, current LLM-based approaches struggle to fully leverage user behavior sequences, resulting in suboptimal preference modeling for personalized recommendations. In this study, we propose a novel Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (CFT) method to address this issue by explicitly emphasizing the role of behavior sequences when generating recommendations. Specifically, we employ counterfactual reasoning to identify the causal effects of behavior sequences on model output and introduce a task that directly fits the ground-truth labels based on these effects, achieving the goal of explicit emphasis. Additionally, we develop a token-level weighting mechanism to adjust the emphasis strength for different item tokens, reflecting the diminishing influence of behavior sequences from earlier to later tokens during predicting an item. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CFT effectively improves behavior sequence modeling. Our codes are available at https://github.com/itsmeyjt/CFT.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering has intensified the need for improved model and resource efficiency. In particular, for neural code generation, LLMs are used to translate function/method signature and DocString to executable code. DocStrings which capture user re quirements for the code and used as the prompt for LLMs, often contains redundant information. Recent advancements in prompt compression have shown promising results in Natural Language Processing (NLP), but their applicability to code generation remains uncertain. Our empirical study show that the state-of-the-art prompt compression methods achieve only about 10% reduction, as further reductions would cause significant performance degradation. In our study, we propose a novel compression method, ShortenDoc, dedicated to DocString compression for code generation. Our extensive experiments on six code generation datasets, five open-source LLMs (1B to 10B parameters), and one closed-source LLM GPT-4o confirm that ShortenDoc achieves 25-40% compression while preserving the quality of generated code, outperforming other baseline methods at similar compression levels. The benefit of this research is to improve efficiency and reduce the cost while maintaining the quality of the generated code, especially when calling third-party APIs, and is able to reduce the token processing cost by 25-40%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have acquired the ability to solve general tasks by utilizing instruction finetuning (IFT). However, IFT still relies heavily on instance training of extensive task data, which greatly limits the adaptability of LLMs to real-world scenarios where labeled task instances are scarce and broader task generalization becomes paramount. Contrary to LLMs, humans acquire skills and complete tasks not merely through repeated practice but also by understanding and following instructional guidelines. This paper is dedicated to simulating human learning to address the shortcomings of instance training, focusing on instruction learning to enhance cross-task generalization. Within this context, we introduce Task Adapters Generation from Instructions (TAGI), which automatically constructs the task-specific model in a parameter generation manner based on the given task instructions without retraining for unseen tasks. Specifically, we utilize knowledge distillation to enhance the consistency between TAGI developed through Learning with Instruction and task-specific models developed through Training with Instance, by aligning the labels, output logits, and adapter parameters between them. TAGI is endowed with cross-task generalization capabilities through a two-stage training process that includes hypernetwork pretraining and finetuning. We evaluate TAGI on the Super-Natural Instructions and P3 datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that TAGI can match or even outperform traditional meta-trained models and other hypernetwork models, while significantly reducing computational requirements.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA have significantly improved the adaptation of LLMs to downstream tasks in a resource-efficient manner. However, in multi-task scenarios, challenges such as training imbalance and the seesaw effect frequently emerge. Mixture-of-LoRA (MoLoRA), which combines LoRA with sparse Mixture-of-Experts, mitigates some of these issues by promoting task-specific learning across experts. Despite this, MoLoRA remains inefficient in terms of training speed, parameter utilization, and overall multi-task performance. In this paper, we propose Mixture of Asymmetric Low-Rank Adaptaion (MALoRA), a flexible fine-tuning framework that leverages asymmetric optimization across LoRA experts. MALoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters by 30% to 48%, increases training speed by 1.2x, and matches the computational efficiency of single-task LoRA models. Additionally, MALoRA addresses overfitting issues commonly seen in high-rank configurations, enhancing performance stability. Extensive experiments across diverse multi-task learning scenarios demonstrate that MALoRA consistently outperforms all baseline methods in both inter-domain and intra-domain tasks.

To this end, we establish a causal framework for ST predictions, termed CaPaint, which targets to identify causal regions in data and endow model with causal reasoning ability in a two-stage process. Going beyond this process, we utilize the back-door adjustment to specifically address the sub-regions identified as non-causal in the upstream phase. Specifically, we employ a novel image inpainting technique. By using a fine-tuned unconditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as the generative prior, we in-fill the masks defined as environmental parts, offering the possibility of reliable extrapolation for potential data distributions. CaPaint overcomes the high complexity dilemma of optimal ST causal discovery models by reducing the data generation complexity from exponential to quasi-linear levels. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world ST benchmarks demonstrate that integrating the CaPaint concept allows models to achieve improvements ranging from 4.3% to 77.3%. Moreover, compared to traditional mainstream ST augmenters, CaPaint underscores the potential of diffusion models in ST enhancement, offering a novel paradigm for this field.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantum computers leverage the unique advantages of quantum mechanics to achieve acceleration over classical computers for certain problems. Currently, various quantum simulators provide powerful tools for researchers, but simulating quantum evolution with these simulators often incurs high time costs. Additionally, resource consumption grows exponentially as the number of quantum bits increases. To address this issue, our research aims to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate quantum circuits. This paper details the process of constructing 1-qubit and 2-qubit quantum simulator models, extending to multiple qubits, and ultimately implementing a 3-qubit example. Our study demonstrates that LLMs can effectively learn and predict the evolution patterns among quantum bits, with minimal error compared to the theoretical output states. Even when dealing with quantum circuits comprising an exponential number of quantum gates, LLMs remain computationally efficient. Overall, our results highlight the potential of LLMs to predict the outputs of complex quantum dynamics, achieving speeds far surpassing those required to run the same process on a quantum computer. This finding provides new insights and tools for applying machine learning methods in the field of quantum computing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Prompt injection attacks pose a critical threat to large language models (LLMs), enabling goal hijacking and data leakage. Prompt guard models, though effective in defense, suffer from over-defense -- falsely flagging benign inputs as malicious due to trigger word bias. To address this issue, we introduce NotInject, an evaluation dataset that systematically measures over-defense across various prompt guard models. NotInject contains 339 benign samples enriched with trigger words common in prompt injection attacks, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Our results show that state-of-the-art models suffer from over-defense issues, with accuracy dropping close to random guessing levels (60%). To mitigate this, we propose InjecGuard, a novel prompt guard model that incorporates a new training strategy, Mitigating Over-defense for Free (MOF), which significantly reduces the bias on trigger words. InjecGuard demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on diverse benchmarks including NotInject, surpassing the existing best model by 30.8%, offering a robust and open-source solution for detecting prompt injection attacks. The code and datasets are released at https://github.com/SaFoLab-WISC/InjecGuard.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Goal-oriented chatbots are essential for automating user tasks, such as booking flights or making restaurant reservations. A key component of these systems is Dialogue State Tracking (DST), which interprets user intent and maintains the dialogue state. However, existing DST methods often rely on fixed ontologies and manually compiled slot values, limiting their adaptability to open-domain dialogues. We propose a novel approach that leverages instruction tuning and advanced prompt strategies to enhance DST performance, without relying on any predefined ontologies. Our method enables Large Language Model (LLM) to infer dialogue states through carefully designed prompts and includes an anti-hallucination mechanism to ensure accurate tracking in diverse conversation contexts. Additionally, we employ a Variational Graph Auto-Encoder (VGAE) to model and predict subsequent user intent. Our approach achieved state-of-the-art with a JGA of 42.57% outperforming existing ontology-less DST models, and performed well in open-domain real-world conversations. This work presents a significant advancement in creating more adaptive and accurate goal-oriented chatbots.
