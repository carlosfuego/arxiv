                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work explores the cross-node scaling potential of SOT-MRAM for last-level caches (LLCs) under heterogeneous system scaling paradigm. We perform extensive Design-Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) exercises to evaluate the bitcell footprint for different cell configurations at a representative 7 nm technology and to assess their implications on read and write power-performance. We crucially identify the MTJ routing struggle in conventional two-transistor one-resistor (2T1R) SOT-MRAMs as the primary bitcell area scaling challenge and propose to use BEOL read selectors (BEOL RSs) that enable (10 -- 40) % bitcell area reduction and eventually match sub-N3 SRAM. On writability, we affirm that BEOL RS-based bitcells could meet the required SOT switching current, provided the magnetic free layer properties be engineered in line with LLC-specific, (0.1 -- 100) s retention targets. This is particularly to attribute to their (i) more available Si fins for write transistor and (ii) lower bitline resistance at reduced cell width. We nevertheless underscore the read tradeoff associated with BEOL RSs, with the low-drive IGZO-FET selector sacrificing the latency up to (3 -- 5) ns and the imperfectly rectifying diode selectors suffering (2.5 -- 5)$\times$ energy cost relative to 2T1R. This article thus highlights the realistic prospects and hurdles of BEOL RSs towards holistic power-performance-area scaling of SOT-MRAM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scaling-law has guided the language model designing for past years, however, it is worth noting that the scaling laws of NLP cannot be directly applied to RecSys due to the following reasons: (1) The amount of training samples and model parameters is typically not the bottleneck for the model. Our recommendation system can generate over 50 billion user samples daily, and such a massive amount of training data can easily allow our model parameters to exceed 200 billion, surpassing many LLMs (about 100B). (2) To ensure the stability and robustness of the recommendation system, it is essential to control computational complexity FLOPs carefully. Considering the above differences with LLM, we can draw a conclusion that: for a RecSys model, compared to model parameters, the computational complexity FLOPs is a more expensive factor that requires careful control. In this paper, we propose our milestone work, MARM (Memory Augmented Recommendation Model), which explores a new cache scaling-laws successfully.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated success across many benchmarks. However, they still exhibit limitations in long-context scenarios, primarily due to their short effective context length, quadratic computational complexity, and high memory overhead when processing lengthy inputs. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a novel context compression pipeline, called Intermediate Layer Retrieval (ILRe), which determines one intermediate decoder layer offline, encodes context by streaming chunked prefill only up to that layer, and recalls tokens by the attention scores between the input query and full key cache in that specified layer. In particular, we propose a multi-pooling kernels allocating strategy in the token recalling process to maintain the completeness of semantics. Our approach not only reduces the prefilling complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L)$, but also achieves performance comparable to or better than the full context in the long context scenarios. Without additional post training or operator development, ILRe can process a single $1M$ tokens request in less than half a minute (speedup $\approx 180\times$) and scores RULER-$1M$ benchmark of $\approx 79.8$ with model Llama-3.1-UltraLong-8B-1M-Instruct on a Huawei Ascend 910B NPU.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable success in generative tasks (e.g., image and video generation), and the demand for high-quality content (e.g., 2K/4K videos) is rapidly increasing across various domains. However, generating ultra-high-resolution videos on existing standard-resolution (e.g., 720p) platforms remains challenging due to the excessive re-training requirements and prohibitively high computational and memory costs. To this end, we introduce SuperGen, an efficient tile-based framework for ultra-high-resolution video generation. SuperGen features a novel training-free algorithmic innovation with tiling to successfully support a wide range of resolutions without additional training efforts while significantly reducing both memory footprint and computational complexity. Moreover, SuperGen incorporates a tile-tailored, adaptive, region-aware caching strategy that accelerates video generation by exploiting redundancy across denoising steps and spatial regions. SuperGen also integrates cache-guided, communication-minimized tile parallelism for enhanced throughput and minimized latency. Evaluations demonstrate that SuperGen harvests the maximum performance gains while achieving high output quality across various benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large models from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon autoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive Model (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the joint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world knowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without requiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent action trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames and actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and facilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with inverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further improve performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show that PAR achieves a 100\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the performance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately predicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings underscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world knowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process. Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the sampling procedure. In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling direction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based generative models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Expert-Specialized Fine-Tuning (ESFT) adapts Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language models to enhance their task-specific performance by selectively tuning the top-activated experts for the task. Serving these fine-tuned models at scale is challenging: deploying merged models in isolation is prohibitively resource-hungry, while existing multi-adapter serving systems with LoRA-style additive updates are incompatible with ESFT's expert-oriented paradigm. We present ExpertWeave, a system that serves multiple ESFT adapters concurrently over a single shared MoE base model, drastically reducing the memory footprint and improving resource utilization. To seamlessly integrate into existing inference pipelines for MoE models with non-intrusive modifications and minimal latency overhead, ExpertWeave introduces a virtual-memory-assisted expert weight manager that co-locates base-model and adapter experts without incurring memory overhead from fragmentation, and a fused kernel for batched rerouting to enable lightweight redirection of tokens to the appropriate experts at runtime. Our evaluations show that ExpertWeave can simultaneously serve multiple adapters of a 16B MoE model on a single accelerator where the baseline runs out of memory, or provides up to 94x more KV cache capacity and achieves up to 18% higher throughput while using comparable resources, all without compromising model accuracy. ExpertWeave maintains low overhead even when scaling to 20 adapters, with a 4-11% latency increase compared with serving the base model alone. Source code will be released soon.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), introduced in DeepSeek-V2, compresses key-value states into a low-rank latent vector, caching only this vector to reduce memory. In tensor parallelism (TP), however, attention heads are computed across multiple devices, and each device must load the full cache, eroding the advantage of MLA over Grouped Query Attention (GQA). We propose Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): a scheme that partitions both the latent representation and each head's input dimension across devices, performs attention independently per shard, and then combines results with an all-reduce. TPLA preserves the benefits of a compressed KV cache while unlocking TP efficiency. Unlike Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), every head in TPLA still leverages the full latent representation, maintaining stronger representational capacity. TPLA is drop-in compatible with models pre-trained using MLA: it supports MLA-style prefilling and enables efficient tensor-parallel decoding without retraining. Applying simple orthogonal transforms -- e.g., the Hadamard transform or PCA -- before TP slicing further mitigates cross-shard interference, yielding minimal accuracy degradation. By reducing the per-device KV cache for DeepSeek-V3 and Kimi-K2, we achieve 1.79x and 1.93x speedups, respectively, at a 32K-token context length while maintaining performance on commonsense and LongBench benchmarks. TPLA can be implemented with FlashAttention-3, enabling practical end-to-end acceleration.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based deep learning models are increasingly deployed on energy, and DRAM bandwidth constrained devices such as laptops and gaming consoles, which presents significant challenges in meeting the latency requirements of the models. The industry is turning to neural processing units (NPUs) for superior performance-per-watt (perf/watt); however, efficiently mapping dynamic attention layers to the NPUs remains a challenging task. For optimizing perf/watt, AMD XDNA NPUs employ software managed caches and share system memory with host. This requires substantial engineering effort to unlock efficient tiling, buffer allocation, and data movement to extract the maximum efficiency from the device. This paper introduces Zen-Attention, a framework that optimizes DRAM bandwidth utilization in the attention layer of models by systematically exploring the complex design space of layer folding, tiling, and data-movement on the interconnect, and the tensor layouts to come up with an optimal solution. Our evaluation includes comparative analysis of end-to-end model latency and specific attention latency in each model. We demonstrate how the framework enhances mapping capabilities by varying input dimensions, which require padding and masking in the attention block. For representative transformer models, the Zen-Attention Framework achieves up to 4x improvement in the latency of the attention block and up to 32% improvement in end-to-end network latency compared to the baseline Unfolded- approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> GPUs are critical for compute-intensive applications, yet emerging workloads such as recommender systems, graph analytics, and data analytics often exceed GPU memory capacity. Existing solutions allow GPUs to use CPU DRAM or SSDs as external memory, and the GPU-centric approach enables GPU threads to directly issue NVMe requests, further avoiding CPU intervention. However, current GPU-centric approaches adopt synchronous I/O, forcing threads to stall during long communication delays.   We propose AGILE, a lightweight asynchronous GPU-centric I/O library that eliminates deadlock risks and integrates a flexible HBM-based software cache. AGILE overlaps computation and I/O, improving performance by up to 1.88$\times$ across workloads with diverse computation-to-communication ratios. Compared to BaM on DLRM, AGILE achieves up to 1.75$\times$ speedup through efficient design and overlapping; on graph applications, AGILE reduces software cache overhead by up to 3.12$\times$ and NVMe I/O overhead by up to 2.85$\times$; AGILE also lowers per-thread register usage by up to 1.32$\times$.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Real robots are expected to repeat the same behavior in new environments with very little new data, yet modern controllers either incur heavy per-step inference or require deployment-time fine-tuning. We propose RT-Cache, a training-free retrieval-as-control pipeline that caches diverse image action trajectories in a unified vector memory and, at test time, embeds the current frame to retrieve and replay multi-step snippets, replacing per-step model calls. A hierarchical search keeps lookups sub-second at million scale, shifting cost from compute to storage and enabling real-time control on modest GPUs. Across real-robot tasks and large open logs, RT-Cache achieves higher success and lower completion time than strong retrieval baselines (approximately x2 higher success and ~30% faster in our settings), and a single-episode anchoring study shows immediate adaptation to a more complex, contact-rich task without fine-tuning. RT-Cache turns experience into an append-only memory, offering a simple, scalable path to few-shot deployment today and a foundation for multimodal keys and optional integration with high-level policies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Long-range tasks demand reasoning over long inputs. However, existing solutions are limited, e.g., long-context models require large compute budgets, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) needs training data, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) entails complex task-specific designs. Though in-context approaches overcome many of these issues, methods with short-context LLMs are inefficient, trading context for processing more tokens. We introduce PRISM, a highly token-efficient in-context method based on structured schemas that outperforms baselines on diverse tasks with 4x shorter contexts. This approach produces concise outputs and efficiently leverages key-value (KV) caches to reduce costs by up to 54%. PRISM scales down to tiny contexts without increasing costs or sacrificing quality, and generalizes to new tasks with minimal effort by generating schemas from task descriptions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are the cornerstone of programmable cryptography. They enable (1) privacy-preserving and verifiable computation across blockchains, and (2) an expanding range of off-chain applications such as credential schemes. Zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs) lower the barrier by turning ZKPs into a drop-in backend for standard compilation pipelines. This lets developers write proof-generating programs in conventional languages (e.g., Rust or C++) instead of hand-crafting arithmetic circuits. However, these VMs inherit compiler infrastructures tuned for traditional architectures rather than for proof systems. In particular, standard compiler optimizations assume features that are absent in zkVMs, including cache locality, branch prediction, or instruction-level parallelism. Therefore, their impact on proof generation is questionable.   We present the first systematic study of the impact of compiler optimizations on zkVMs. We evaluate 64 LLVM passes, six standard optimization levels, and an unoptimized baseline across 58 benchmarks on two RISC-V-based zkVMs (RISC Zero and SP1). While standard LLVM optimization levels do improve zkVM performance (over 40\%), their impact is far smaller than on traditional CPUs, since their decisions rely on hardware features rather than proof constraints. Guided by a fine-grained pass-level analysis, we~\emph{slightly} refine a small set of LLVM passes to be zkVM-aware, improving zkVM execution time by up to 45\% (average +4.6\% on RISC Zero, +1\% on SP1) and achieving consistent proving-time gains. Our work highlights the potential of compiler-level optimizations for zkVM performance and opens new direction for zkVM-specific passes, backends, and superoptimizers.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Convex hull data structures are fundamental in computational geometry. We study insertion-only data structures, supporting various containment and intersection queries. When $P$ is sorted by $x$- or $y$-coordinate, convex hulls can be constructed in linear time using classical algorithms such as Graham scan. We investigate a variety of methods tailored to the insertion-only setting. We explore a broad selection of trade-offs involving robustness, memory access patterns, and space usage, providing an extensive evaluation of both existing and novel techniques. Logarithmic-time methods rely on pointer-based tree structures, which suffer in practice due to poor memory locality. Motivated by this, we develop a vector-based solution inspired by Overmars' logarithmic method. Our structure has worse asymptotic bounds, supporting queries in $O(\log^2 n)$ time, but stores data in $O(\log n)$ contiguous vectors, greatly improving cache performance.   Through empirical evaluation on real-world and synthetic data sets, we uncover surprising trends. Let $h$ denote the size of the convex hull. We show that a na\"ive $O(h)$ insertion-only algorithm based on Graham scan consistently outperforms both theoretical and practical state-of-the-art methods under realistic workloads, even on data sets with rather large convex hulls. While tree-based methods with $O(\log h)$ update times offer solid theoretical guarantees, they are never optimal in practice. In contrast, our vector-based logarithmic method, despite its theoretically inferior bounds, is highly competitive across all tested scenarios. It is optimal whenever the convex hull becomes large.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in aligning large language models via reinforcement learning have achieved remarkable gains in solving complex reasoning problems, but at the cost of expensive on-policy rollouts and limited exploration of diverse reasoning paths. In this work, we introduce TreePO, involving a self-guided rollout algorithm that views sequence generation as a tree-structured searching process. Composed of dynamic tree sampling policy and fixed-length segment decoding, TreePO leverages local uncertainty to warrant additional branches. By amortizing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-value paths early, TreePO essentially reduces the per-update compute burden while preserving or enhancing exploration diversity. Key contributions include: (1) a segment-wise sampling algorithm that alleviates the KV cache burden through contiguous segments and spawns new branches along with an early-stop mechanism; (2) a tree-based segment-level advantage estimation that considers both global and local proximal policy optimization. and (3) analysis on the effectiveness of probability and quality-driven dynamic divergence and fallback strategy. We empirically validate the performance gain of TreePO on a set reasoning benchmarks and the efficiency saving of GPU hours from 22\% up to 43\% of the sampling design for the trained models, meanwhile showing up to 40\% reduction at trajectory-level and 35\% at token-level sampling compute for the existing models. While offering a free lunch of inference efficiency, TreePO reveals a practical path toward scaling RL-based post-training with fewer samples and less compute.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) focuses on recovering high-quality images from low-resolution inputs that suffer from complex degradations like noise, blur, and compression. Recently, diffusion models (DMs) have shown great potential in this area by leveraging strong generative priors to restore fine details. However, their iterative denoising process incurs high computational overhead, posing challenges for real-time applications. Although one-step distillation methods, such as OSEDiff and TSD-SR, offer faster inference, they remain fundamentally constrained by their large, over-parameterized model architectures. In this work, we present TinySR, a compact yet effective diffusion model specifically designed for Real-ISR that achieves real-time performance while maintaining perceptual quality. We introduce a Dynamic Inter-block Activation and an Expansion-Corrosion Strategy to facilitate more effective decision-making in depth pruning. We achieve VAE compression through channel pruning, attention removal and lightweight SepConv. We eliminate time- and prompt-related modules and perform pre-caching techniques to further speed up the model. TinySR significantly reduces computational cost and model size, achieving up to 5.68x speedup and 83% parameter reduction compared to its teacher TSD-SR, while still providing high quality results.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of acceleration techniques for diffusion models, especially caching-based acceleration methods. These studies seek to answer two fundamental questions: "When to cache" and "How to use cache", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level priors to determine the timing of caching and utilizing handcrafted rules for leveraging multi-step caches. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the diffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail on outlier samples. In this paper, a strong correlation is revealed between the variation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion model and those of final model outputs. Moreover, we have observed that the features from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these observations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching strategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and how to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of two principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a shallow-layer online probe to obtain a stable prior for the caching error in real time, enabling the model to autonomously determine caching schedules. (2) Dynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment combines multi-step caches based on shallow-layer probe feature trajectory to better approximate the current feature, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate DiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved visual fidelity over state-of-the-art methods on various leading diffusion models including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo for video generation, and Flux for image generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Prefix caching is crucial to accelerate multi-turn interactions and requests with shared prefixes. At the cluster level, existing prefix caching systems are tightly coupled with request scheduling to optimize cache efficiency and computation performance together, leading to load imbalance, data redundancy, and memory fragmentation of caching systems across instances. To address these issues, memory pooling is promising to shield the scheduler from the underlying cache management so that it can focus on the computation optimization. However, because existing prefix caching systems only transfer increasingly longer prefix caches between instances, they cannot achieve low-latency memory pooling.   To address these problems, we propose a unified segment-level prefix cache pool, TokenLake. It uses a declarative cache interface to expose requests' query tensors, prefix caches, and cache-aware operations to TokenLake for efficient pooling. Powered by this abstraction, TokenLake can manage prefix cache at the segment level with a heavy-hitter-aware load balancing algorithm to achieve better cache load balance, deduplication, and defragmentation. TokenLake also transparently minimizes the communication volume of query tensors and new caches. Based on TokenLake, the scheduler can schedule requests elastically by using existing techniques without considering prefix cache management. Evaluations on real-world workloads show that TokenLake can improve throughput by up to 2.6$\times$ and 2.0$\times$ and boost hit rate by 2.0$\times$ and 2.1$\times$, compared to state-of-the-art cache-aware routing and cache-centric PD-disaggregation solutions, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs) parallelize text generation by framing decoding as a denoising process, but suffer from high computational overhead since they predict all future suffix tokens at each step while retaining only a small fraction. We propose Diffusion Scratchpad (DPad), a training-free method that restricts attention to a small set of nearby suffix tokens, preserving fidelity while eliminating redundancy. DPad integrates two strategies: (i) a sliding window, which maintains a fixed-length suffix window, and (ii) distance-decay dropout, which deterministically removes distant suffix tokens before attention computation. This simple design is compatible with existing optimizations such as prefix caching and can be implemented with only a few lines of code. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks on LLaDA-1.5 and Dream models demonstrate that DPad delivers up to $\mathbf{61.4\times}$ speedup over vanilla dLLMs while maintaining comparable accuracy, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable long-sequence inference. Our code is available at https://github.com/Crys-Chen/DPad.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The deployment of large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models on edge devices presents significant challenges due to memory constraints. While MoE architectures enable efficient utilization of computational resources by activating only a subset of experts per inference, they require careful memory management to operate efficiently in resource-constrained environments. Traditional heuristic-based expert caching strategies such as MoE-Infinity struggle to maintain high cache hit rates as models parameters scale. In this work, we introduce MoE-Beyond, a learning-based expert activation predictor trained to predict expert activations during autoregressive decoding. By framing the task as a multi-label sequence prediction problem, we train a lightweight transformer model on 66 million expert activation traces extracted from LDJnr-Puffin dataset [5] using DeepSeek-V2-Chat-Lite MoE. Our predictor generalizes effectively across unseen prompts from WebGLM-QA dataset [6], achieving 97.5% accuracy and an 86.6% F1-score. Simulation results show that MoE-Beyond improves GPU cache hit rate from 17% to 72% when only 10% of experts fit in GPU cache, outperforming heuristic baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In large-scale recommender systems, ultra-long user behavior sequences encode rich signals of evolving interests. Extending sequence length generally improves accuracy, but directly modeling such sequences in production is infeasible due to latency and memory constraints. Existing solutions fall into two categories: (1) top-k retrieval, which truncates the sequence and may discard most attention mass when L >> k; and (2) encoder-based compression, which preserves coverage but often over-compresses and fails to incorporate key context such as temporal gaps or target-aware signals. Neither class achieves a good balance of low-loss compression, context awareness, and efficiency.   We propose VQL, a context-aware Vector Quantization Attention framework for ultra-long behavior modeling, with three innovations. (1) Key-only quantization: only attention keys are quantized, while values remain intact; we prove that softmax normalization yields an error bound independent of sequence length, and a codebook loss directly supervises quantization quality. This also enables L-free inference via offline caches. (2) Multi-scale quantization: attention heads are partitioned into groups, each with its own small codebook, which reduces quantization error while keeping cache size fixed. (3) Efficient context injection: static features (e.g., item category, modality) are directly integrated, and relative position is modeled via a separable temporal kernel. All context is injected without enlarging the codebook, so cached representations remain query-independent.   Experiments on three large-scale datasets (KuaiRand-1K, KuaiRec, TMALL) show that VQL consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving higher accuracy while reducing inference latency, establishing a new state of the art in balancing accuracy and efficiency for ultra-long sequence recommendation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A bottleneck for long-context LLM inference is the linearly growing KV cache. Recent work has proposed CARTRIDGES, an approach which leverages offline compute to train a much smaller KV cache than is typically required for a full document (up to 40x less memory usage at inference time). In this paper, we present the first mechanistic exploration of the learned CARTRIDGE key-value cache structure. In particular, we propose that (1) CARTRIDGE keys act as stable, shareable retrieval routers for the compressed corpora and (2) most of the learned compression occurs within the CARTRIDGE value vectors. We present empirical evidence of our routing theory across tasks, model families, and model sizes; for example, we can ablate the learned CARTRIDGE key vectors between tasks with little performance loss. Finally, we propose a slight improvement in initialization called Sampled Chunk Initialization (SCI). We suggest that SCI can lead to faster CARTRIDGE convergence than previously demonstrated in the literature. Our findings lay the groundwork for broader empirical study of CARTRIDGE training optimization which may be crucial for further scaling.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in content generation but suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to iterative sampling. While recent feature caching methods tend to accelerate inference through temporal extrapolation, these methods still suffer from server quality loss due to the failure in modeling the complex dynamics of feature evolution. To solve this problem, this paper presents HiCache, a training-free acceleration framework that fundamentally improves feature prediction by aligning mathematical tools with empirical properties. Our key insight is that feature derivative approximations in Diffusion Transformers exhibit multivariate Gaussian characteristics, motivating the use of Hermite polynomials-the potentially theoretically optimal basis for Gaussian-correlated processes. Besides, We further introduce a dual-scaling mechanism that ensures numerical stability while preserving predictive accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate HiCache's superiority: achieving 6.24x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while exceeding baseline quality, maintaining strong performance across text-to-image, video generation, and super-resolution tasks. Core implementation is provided in the appendix, with complete code to be released upon acceptance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Larger model sizes and longer sequence lengths have empowered the Large Language Model (LLM) to achieve outstanding performance across various domains. However, this progress brings significant storage capacity challenges for LLM pretraining. High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) is expensive and requires more advanced packaging technologies for capacity expansion, creating an urgent need for memory-efficient scheduling strategies. Yet, prior pipeline parallelism schedules have primarily focused on reducing bubble overhead, often neglecting memory efficiency and lacking compatibility with other memory-efficient strategies. Consequently, these methods struggle to meet the storage demands of storage capacity for next-generation LLM. This work presents ChronosPipe, a Chronos-aware pipeline parallelism for memory-efficient LLM pretraining. The core insight of ChronosPipe is to treat HBM as a fast but small 'cache,' optimizing and exploiting temporal locality within LLM pretraining to enhance HBM utilization. ChronosPipe introduces a pipeline scheduling strategy, Chronos-Pipe, to reduce the extrinsic overhead that disrupts the temporal locality of activations. Additionally, it leverages Chronos-Recomp and Chronos-Offload to efficiently harness the intrinsic temporal locality of activations and weights in Deep Neural Networks. Experiment results show that ChronosPipe can expand the trainable model size by 2.4x while maintaining comparable throughput, achieving 1.5x better than the 1F1B strategy combined with recomputation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Speculative decoding is a widely adopted technique for accelerating inference in large language models (LLMs), but its performance degrades on long inputs due to increased attention cost and reduced draft accuracy. We introduce SpecExtend, a drop-in enhancement that improves the performance of speculative decoding on long sequences without any additional training. First, SpecExtend integrates efficient attention mechanisms such as FlashAttention and Hybrid Tree Attention into both the draft and target models. To improve draft accuracy and speed on long inputs without retraining, we propose Cross-model Retrieval, a novel KV cache eviction strategy that uses the target model's attention scores to dynamically select relevant context for the draft model. Extensive evaluations on three long-context understanding datasets show that SpecExtend accelerates standard tree-based speculative decoding by up to 2.22x for inputs up to 16K tokens, providing an effective solution for speculative decoding of long sequences.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in high-fidelity image and video generation. To reduce their substantial computational costs, feature caching techniques have been proposed to accelerate inference by reusing hidden representations from previous timesteps. However, current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high acceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the inherent instability of long-step forecasting. In this work, we adopt an ordinary differential equation (ODE) perspective on the hidden-feature sequence, modeling layer representations along the trajectory as a feature-ODE. We attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability to robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals. To address this, we propose FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), which treats feature caching as a feature-ODE solving problem. Extensive experiments on image synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of FoCa, especially under aggressive acceleration. Without additional training, FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on FLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high quality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this letter, we investigate the problem of joint content caching and routing in satellite-terrestrial edge computing networks (STECNs) to improve caching service for geographically distributed users. To handle the challenges arising from dynamic low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite topologies and heterogeneous content demands, we propose a learning-based framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The satellite network is represented as a dynamic graph, where GNNs are embedded within the DRL agent to capture spatial and topological dependencies and support routing-aware decision-making. The caching strategy is optimized by formulating the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and applying soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the delivery success rate and reduces communication traffic cost.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) confront significant memory challenges due to the escalating KV cache with increasing sequence length. As a crucial technique, existing cross-layer KV cache sharing methods either necessitate modified model architectures with subsequent pre-training or incur significant performance degradation at high compression rates. To mitigate these challenges, we propose CommonKV, a training-free method for cross-layer KV cache compression through adjacent parameters sharing. Inspired by the high similarity observed in cross-layer hidden states, we utilize Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to achieve weight sharing across adjacent parameters, resulting in a more easily mergeable latent KV cache. Furthermore, we also introduce an adaptive budget allocation strategy. It dynamically assigns compression budgets based on cosine similarity, ensuring that dissimilar caches are not over-compressed. Experiments across multiple backbone models and benchmarks including LongBench and Ruler demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing low-rank and cross-layer approaches at various compression ratios. Moreover, we find that the benefits of CommonKV are orthogonal to other quantization and eviction methods. By integrating these approaches, we can ultimately achieve a 98\% compression ratio without significant performance loss.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The image enhancement methods based on 3D lookup tables (3D LUTs) efficiently reduce both model size and runtime by interpolating pre-calculated values at the vertices. However, the 3D LUT methods have a limitation due to their lack of spatial information, as they convert color values on a point-by-point basis. Although spatial-aware 3D LUT methods address this limitation, they introduce additional modules that require a substantial number of parameters, leading to increased runtime as image resolution increases. To address this issue, we propose a method for generating image-adaptive LUTs by focusing on the redundant parts of the tables. Our efficient framework decomposes a 3D LUT into a linear sum of low-dimensional LUTs and employs singular value decomposition (SVD). Furthermore, we enhance the modules for spatial feature fusion to be more cache-efficient. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model effectively decreases both the number of parameters and runtime while maintaining spatial awareness and performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The exponential growth of data-intensive applications has placed unprecedented demands on modern storage systems, necessitating dynamic and efficient optimization strategies. Traditional heuristics employed for storage performance optimization often fail to adapt to the variability and complexity of contemporary workloads, leading to significant performance bottlenecks and resource inefficiencies. To address these challenges, this paper introduces RL-Storage, a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework designed to dynamically optimize storage system configurations. RL-Storage leverages deep Q-learning algorithms to continuously learn from real-time I/O patterns and predict optimal storage parameters, such as cache size, queue depths, and readahead settings[1].This work underscores the transformative potential of reinforcement learning techniques in addressing the dynamic nature of modern storage systems. By autonomously adapting to workload variations in real time, RL-Storage provides a robust and scalable solution for optimizing storage performance, paving the way for next-generation intelligent storage infrastructures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent work presented at USENIX Security 2025 (SEC'25) claims that occupancy-based attacks can recover AES keys from the MIRAGE randomized cache. In this paper, we examine these claims and find that they arise from a modeling flaw in the SEC'25 paper. Most critically, the SEC'25 paper's simulation of MIRAGE uses a constant seed to initialize the random number generator used for global evictions in MIRAGE, causing every AES encryption they trace to evict the same deterministic sequence of cache lines. This artificially creates a highly repeatable timing pattern that is not representative of a realistic implementation of MIRAGE, where eviction sequences vary randomly between encryptions. When we instead randomize the eviction seed for each run, reflecting realistic operation, the correlation between AES T-table accesses and attacker runtimes disappears, and the attack fails. These findings show that the reported leakage is an artifact of incorrect modeling, and not an actual vulnerability in MIRAGE.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using unlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test distributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy criterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class compactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution shifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class distributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using high-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype residual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve state-of-the-art generalization performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern large language model (LLM) serving systems face challenges from highly variable requests with diverse lengths, priorities, and stage-specific service-level objectives (SLOs). Meeting these requires real-time scheduling, rapid and cost-effective scaling, and support for both collocated and disaggregated Prefill/Decode (P/D) architectures.   We present \textbf{HyperFlexis}, a unified LLM serving system that integrates algorithmic and system-level innovations to jointly optimize scheduling and scaling under multiple SLOs. It features a multi-SLO-aware scheduler that leverages budget estimation and request prioritization to ensure proactive SLO compliance for both new and ongoing requests. The system supports prefill- and decode-stage multi-SLO scheduling for P/D-disaggregated architectures and KV cache transfers. It also enables cost-effective scaling decisions, prefill-decode instance linking during scaling, and rapid P/D role transitions. To accelerate scaling and reduce cold-start latency, a device-to-device (D2D) weight transfer mechanism is proposed that lowers weight loading overhead by up to \textbf{19.39$\times$}. These optimizations allow the system to achieve up to \textbf{4.44$\times$} higher SLO attainment, \textbf{65.82\%} lower request latency, and cost parity with state-of-the-art baselines. The code will be released soon.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios. Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware compression approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph-based high-dimensional vector indices have become a mainstream solution for large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS). However, their substantial memory footprint often requires storage on secondary devices, where frequent on-demand loading of graph and vector data leads to I/O becoming the dominant bottleneck, accounting for over 90\% of query latency. Existing static caching strategies mitigate this issue only in the initial navigation phase by preloading entry points and multi-hop neighbors, but they fail in the second phase where query-dependent nodes must be dynamically accessed to achieve high recall. We propose GoVector, an I/O-efficient caching strategy tailored for disk-based graph indices. GoVector combines (1) a static cache that stores entry points and frequently accessed neighbors, and (2) a dynamic cache that adaptively captures nodes with high spatial locality during the second search phase. To further align storage layout with similarity-driven search patterns, GoVector reorders nodes on disk so that similar vectors are colocated on the same or adjacent pages, thereby improving locality and reducing I/O overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that GoVector achieves substantial performance improvements. At 90% recall, it reduces I/O operations by 46% on average, increases query throughput by 1.73x, and lowers query latency by 42% compared to state-of-the-art disk-based graph indexing systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Stateful serverless workflows consist of multiple serverless functions that access state on a remote database. Developers sometimes add a cache layer between the serverless runtime and the database to improve I/O latency. However, in a serverless environment, functions in the same workflow may be scheduled to different nodes with different caches, which can cause non-intuitive anomalies. This paper presents CausalMesh, a novel approach to causally consistent caching in environments where a computation may migrate from one machine to another, such as in serverless computing. CausalMesh is the first cache system that supports coordination-free and abort-free read/write operations and read transactions when clients roam among multiple servers. CausalMesh also supports read-write transactional causal consistency in the presence of client roaming, but at the cost of abort-freedom.   We have formally verified CausalMesh's protocol in Dafny, and our experimental evaluation shows that CausalMesh has lower latency and higher throughput than existing proposals

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As power consumption from AI training and inference continues to increase, AI accelerators are being integrated directly into the CPU. Intel's Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX) is one such example, debuting on the 4th generation Intel Xeon Scalable CPU. We discover a timing side and covert channel, GATEBLEED, caused by the aggressive power gating utilized to keep the CPU within operating limits. We show that the GATEBLEED side channel is a threat to AI privacy as many ML models such as transformers and CNNs make critical computationally-heavy decisions based on private values like confidence thresholds and routing logits. Timing delays from selective powering down of AMX components mean that each matrix multiplication is a potential leakage point when executed on the AMX accelerator. Our research identifies over a dozen potential gadgets across popular ML libraries (HuggingFace, PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.), revealing that they can leak sensitive and private information. GATEBLEED poses a risk for local and remote timing inference, even under previous protective measures. GATEBLEED can be used as a high performance, stealthy remote covert channel and a generic magnifier for timing transmission channels, capable of bypassing traditional cache defenses to leak arbitrary memory addresses and evading state of the art microarchitectural attack detectors under realistic network conditions and system configurations in which previous attacks fail. We implement an end-to-end microarchitectural inference attack on a transformer model optimized with Intel AMX, achieving a membership inference accuracy of 81% and a precision of 0.89. In a CNN-based or transformer-based mixture-of-experts model optimized with Intel AMX, we leak expert choice with 100% accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first side-channel attack on AI privacy that exploits hardware optimizations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mixed-precision inference techniques reduce the memory and computational demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) by applying hybrid precision formats to model weights, activations, and KV caches. This work introduces mixed-precision LLM inference techniques that encompass (i) systematic memory and compute optimization across hierarchical storage and tensor core architectures, and (ii) comprehensive end-to-end mixed-precision optimization across diverse precision formats and hardware configurations. Our approach features two novel mixed-precision pipelines designed for optimal hardware utilization: a General Matrix Multiply (GEMM) pipeline that optimizes matrix operations through offline weight packing and online acceleration, and an attention pipeline that enables efficient attention computation with arbitrary Query, Key, and Value precision combinations. The key implementation of the pipelines includes (i) hardware-aware weight packing for automatic format optimization, (ii) adaptive head alignment for efficient attention computation, (iii) instruction-level parallelism for memory hierarchy exploitation, and (iv) KV memory loading pipeline for enhanced inference efficiency. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across 16 popular LLMs and 4 representative GPU architectures. Results demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 61% lower serving latency (30% on average) and up to 156% higher throughput (58% on average) in mixed-precision workloads compared to existing mixed-precision frameworks, establishing consistent performance improvements across all tested configurations and hardware types.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Directed q-analysis is a recent extension of q-analysis, an established method for extracting structure from networks, to directed graphs. Until recently, a lack of efficient algorithms heavily restricted the application of this technique: Previous approaches scale with the square of the input size, which is also the maximal size of the output, rendering such approaches worst-case optimal. In practice, output sizes of relevant networks are usually far from the worst case, a fact that could be exploited by an (efficient) output-sensitive algorithm. We develop such an algorithm and formally describe it in detail. The key insight, obtained by carefully studying various approaches to directed q-analysis and how they relate to each other, is that inverting the order of computation leads to significant complexity gains. Targeted precomputation and caching tactics further reduce the introduced overhead, enough to achieve (under mild assumptions) a time complexity that is linear in output size. The resulting algorithm for performing directed q-analysis is shown to be time-optimal.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In response to the challenges in large-scale quantum state simulation on classical computing platforms, including memory limits, frequent disk I/O, and high computational complexity, this study builds upon a previously proposed hierarchical storage-based quantum simulation system and introduces an optimization framework, the Quantum Vector Optimization Framework (QVecOpt). QVecOpt integrates four strategies: amplitude pairing, cache optimization, block storage optimization, and parallel optimization. These collectively enhance state vector storage and computational scheduling. The amplitude pairing mechanism locates relevant amplitude pairs via bitwise XOR, reducing traversal complexity of single-qubit gates from $O(2^n)$ to $O(1)$. Cache optimization pre-allocates buffers and loads only required data, cutting disk I/O. Block storage optimization partitions the state vector for on-demand loading and local updates, reducing redundant access. Parallel optimization distributes the state vector across nodes for collaborative computation, achieving near-linear speedup. Complexity analysis shows that, compared with hierarchical storage simulation, the method reduces state vector traversals for single-qubit gates from $2^n$ to 1, removing the main bottleneck. It also lowers computational and I/O complexity from $O(2^n)$ to $O(2^n/C)$ and $O(2^n/B)$. In simulations of 16-29 qubits, efficiency improves nearly tenfold, breaking the memory bottleneck of existing tools and enabling high-bit quantum circuit simulations beyond traditional methods. This work provides an efficient, scalable solution for classical simulation of large-scale quantum computation with significant academic and practical value.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present 3DGS-LM, a new method that accelerates the reconstruction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by replacing its ADAM optimizer with a tailored Levenberg-Marquardt (LM). Existing methods reduce the optimization time by decreasing the number of Gaussians or by improving the implementation of the differentiable rasterizer. However, they still rely on the ADAM optimizer to fit Gaussian parameters of a scene in thousands of iterations, which can take up to an hour. To this end, we change the optimizer to LM that runs in conjunction with the 3DGS differentiable rasterizer. For efficient GPU parallization, we propose a caching data structure for intermediate gradients that allows us to efficiently calculate Jacobian-vector products in custom CUDA kernels. In every LM iteration, we calculate update directions from multiple image subsets using these kernels and combine them in a weighted mean. Overall, our method is 20% faster than the original 3DGS while obtaining the same reconstruction quality. Our optimization is also agnostic to other methods that acclerate 3DGS, thus enabling even faster speedups compared to vanilla 3DGS.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Next-generation mobile networks are expected to facilitate fast AI model downloading to end users. By caching models on edge servers, mobile networks can deliver models to end users with low latency, resulting in a paradigm of edge model caching. In this paper, we develop a novel model placement framework, called parameter-sharing model caching (TrimCaching). TrimCaching exploits the key observation that a wide range of AI models, such as convolutional neural networks or large language models, can share a significant proportion of parameter blocks containing reusable knowledge, thereby improving storage efficiency. To this end, we formulate a parameter-sharing model placement problem to maximize the cache hit ratio in multi-edge wireless networks by balancing the fundamental tradeoff between storage efficiency and service latency. We show that the formulated problem is a submodular maximization problem with submodular constraints, for which no polynomial-time approximation algorithm exists. To tackle this challenge, we study an important special case, where a small fixed number of parameter blocks are shared across models, which often holds in practice. In such a case, a polynomial-time algorithm with a $\left(1-\epsilon\right)/2$-approximation guarantee is developed. Subsequently, we address the original problem for the general case by developing a greedy algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed TrimCaching framework significantly improves the cache hit ratio compared with state-of-the-art content caching without exploiting shared parameters in AI models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Similarity-based vector search underpins many important applications, but a key challenge is processing massive vector datasets (e.g., in TBs). To reduce costs, some systems utilize SSDs as the primary data storage. They employ a proximity graph, which connects similar vectors to form a graph and is the state-of-the-art index for vector search. However, these systems are hindered by sub-optimal data layouts that fail to effectively utilize valuable memory space to reduce disk access and suffer from poor locality for accessing disk-resident data. Through extensive profiling and analysis, we found that the structure of the proximity graph index is accessed more frequently than the vectors themselves, yet existing systems do not distinguish between the two. To address this problem, we design the Gorgeous system with the principle of prioritizing graph structure over vectors. Specifically, Gorgeous features a memory cache that keeps the adjacency lists of graph nodes to improve cache hits and a disk block format that explicitly stores neighbors' adjacency lists along with a vector to enhance data locality. Experimental results show that Gorgeous consistently outperforms two state-of-the-art disk-based systems for vector search, boosting average query throughput by over 60% and reducing query latency by over 35%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis), thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques, making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration. By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern AI, fueling remarkable progress across applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal learning. As these models continue to scale explosively for performance, implementation efficiency remains a critical challenge. Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, selectively activating specialized subnetworks (experts), offer a unique balance between model accuracy and computational cost. However, the adaptive routing in MoE architectures, where input tokens are dynamically directed to specialized experts based on their semantic meaning inadvertently opens up a new attack surface for privacy breaches. These input-dependent activation patterns leave distinctive temporal and spatial traces in hardware execution, which adversaries could exploit to deduce sensitive user data. In this work, we propose MoEcho, discovering a side channel analysis based attack surface that compromises user privacy on MoE based systems. Specifically, in MoEcho, we introduce four novel architectural side channels on different computing platforms, including Cache Occupancy Channels and Pageout+Reload on CPUs, and Performance Counter and TLB Evict+Reload on GPUs, respectively. Exploiting these vulnerabilities, we propose four attacks that effectively breach user privacy in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) based on MoE architectures: Prompt Inference Attack, Response Reconstruction Attack, Visual Inference Attack, and Visual Reconstruction Attack. MoEcho is the first runtime architecture level security analysis of the popular MoE structure common in modern transformers, highlighting a serious security and privacy threat and calling for effective and timely safeguards when harnessing MoE based models for developing efficient large scale AI services.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the growing size of deep neural networks and datasets, the computational costs of training have significantly increased. The layer-freezing technique has recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively reduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing methods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate feature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs. To overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches feature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to train directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be straightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely overlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations to feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these overlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method will be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first to comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution. To improve training accuracy, we propose \textit{similarity-aware channel augmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a minimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate lossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \textit{progressive compression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are frozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with a minor time overhead. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of freezing and compression strategies, providing insights into optimizing their application for efficient DNN training.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Implicit collaborative filtering recommenders are usually trained to learn user positive preferences. Negative sampling, which selects informative negative items to form negative training data, plays a crucial role in this process. Since items are often clustered in the latent space, existing negative sampling strategies normally oversample negative items from the dense regions. This leads to homogeneous negative data and limited model expressiveness. In this paper, we propose Diverse Negative Sampling (DivNS), a novel approach that explicitly accounts for diversity in negative training data during the negative sampling process. DivNS first finds hard negative items with large preference scores and constructs user-specific caches that store unused but highly informative negative samples. Then, its diversity-augmented sampler selects a diverse subset of negative items from the cache while ensuring dissimilarity from the user's hard negatives. Finally, a synthetic negatives generator combines the selected diverse negatives with hard negatives to form more effective training data. The resulting synthetic negatives are both informative and diverse, enabling recommenders to learn a broader item space and improve their generalisability. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DivNS in improving recommendation quality while maintaining computational efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reranking plays a crucial role in modern recommender systems by capturing the mutual influences within the list. Due to the inherent challenges of combinatorial search spaces, most methods adopt a two-stage search paradigm: a simple General Search Unit (GSU) efficiently reduces the candidate space, and an Exact Search Unit (ESU) effectively selects the optimal sequence. These methods essentially involve making trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency, while suffering from a severe \textbf{inconsistency problem}, that is, the GSU often misses high-value lists from ESU. To address this problem, we propose YOLOR, a one-stage reranking method that removes the GSU while retaining only the ESU. Specifically, YOLOR includes: (1) a Tree-based Context Extraction Module (TCEM) that hierarchically aggregates multi-scale contextual features to achieve "list-level effectiveness", and (2) a Context Cache Module (CCM) that enables efficient feature reuse across candidate permutations to achieve "permutation-level efficiency". Extensive experiments across public and industry datasets validate YOLOR's performance, and we have successfully deployed YOLOR on the Meituan food delivery platform.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in a wide range of natural language processing applications. However, the high energy and latency overhead induced by the KV cache limits the edge deployment, especially for long contexts. Emerging hybrid bonding (HB) technology has been proposed as a promising alternative to conventional near-memory processing (NMP) architectures, offering improved bandwidth efficiency and lower power consumption while exhibiting characteristics of distributed memory. In this paper, we propose H2EAL, a hybrid bonding-based accelerator with sparse attention algorithm-hardware co-design for efficient LLM inference at the edge. At the algorithm level, we propose a hybrid sparse attention scheme with static and dynamic sparsity for different heads to fully leverage the sparsity with high accuracy. At the hardware level, we co-design the hardware to support hybrid sparse attention and propose memory-compute co-placement to address the distributed memory bottleneck. Since different attention heads exhibit different sparse patterns and the attention structure often mismatches the HB architecture, we further develop a load-balancing scheduler with parallel tiled attention to address workload imbalance and optimize the mapping strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate H2EAL achieves 5.20~48.21x speedup and 6.22~73.48x energy efficiency improvement over baseline HB implementation, with a negligible average accuracy drop of 0.87% on multiple benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Key-Value Stores (KVS) based on log-structured merge-trees (LSM-trees) are widely used in storage systems but face significant challenges, such as high write amplification caused by compaction. KV-separated LSM-trees address write amplification but introduce significant space amplification, a critical concern in cost-sensitive scenarios. Garbage collection (GC) can reduce space amplification, but existing strategies are often inefficient and fail to account for workload characteristics. Moreover, current key-value (KV) separated LSM-trees overlook the space amplification caused by the index LSM-tree. In this paper, we systematically analyze the sources of space amplification in KV-separated LSM-trees and propose Scavenger+, which achieves a better performance-space trade-off. Scavenger+ introduces (1) an I/O-efficient garbage collection scheme to reduce I/O overhead, (2) a space-aware compaction strategy based on compensated size to mitigate index-induced space amplification, and (3) a dynamic GC scheduler that adapts to system load to make better use of CPU and storage resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Scavenger+ significantly improves write performance and reduces space amplification compared to state-of-the-art KV-separated LSM-trees, including BlobDB, Titan, and TerarkDB.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Key-Value Stores (KVS) implemented with log-structured merge-tree (LSM-tree) have gained widespread acceptance in storage systems. Nonetheless, a significant challenge arises in the form of high write amplification due to the compaction process. While KV-separated LSM-trees successfully tackle this issue, they also bring about substantial space amplification problems, a concern that cannot be overlooked in cost-sensitive scenarios. Garbage collection (GC) holds significant promise for space amplification reduction, yet existing GC strategies often fall short in optimization performance, lacking thorough consideration of workload characteristics. Additionally, current KV-separated LSM-trees also ignore the adverse effect of the space amplification in the index LSM-tree. In this paper, we systematically analyze the sources of space amplification of KV-separated LSM-trees and introduce Scavenger, which achieves a better trade-off between performance and space amplification. Scavenger initially proposes an I/O-efficient garbage collection scheme to reduce I/O overhead and incorporates a space-aware compaction strategy based on compensated size to minimize the space amplification of index LSM-trees. Extensive experiments show that Scavenger significantly improves write performance and achieves lower space amplification than other KV-separated LSM-trees (including BlobDB, Titan, and TerarkDB).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> WCET (Worst-Case Execution Time) estimation on multicore architecture is particularly challenging mainly due to the complex accesses over cache shared by multiple cores. Existing analysis identifies possible contentions between parallel tasks by leveraging the partial order of the tasks or their program regions. Unfortunately, they overestimate the number of cache misses caused by a remote block access without considering the actual cache state and the number of accesses. This paper reports a new analysis for inter-core cache contention. Based on the order of program regions in a task, we first identify memory references that could be affected if a remote access occurs in a region. Afterwards, a fine-grained contention analysis is constructed that computes the number of cache misses based on the access quantity of local and remote blocks. We demonstrate that the overall inter-core cache interference of a task can be obtained via dynamic programming. Experiments show that compared to existing methods, the proposed analysis reduces inter-core cache interference and WCET estimations by 52.31% and 8.94% on average, without significantly increasing computation overhead.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Symbolic regression encompasses a family of search algorithms that aim to discover the best fitting function for a set of data without requiring an a priori specification of the model structure. The most successful and commonly used technique for symbolic regression is Genetic Programming (GP), an evolutionary search method that evolves a population of mathematical expressions through the mechanism of natural selection. In this work we analyze the efficiency of the evolutionary search in GP and show that many points in the search space are re-visited and re-evaluated multiple times by the algorithm, leading to wasted computational effort. We address this issue by introducing a caching mechanism based on the Zobrist hash, a type of hashing frequently used in abstract board games for the efficient construction and subsequent update of transposition tables. We implement our caching approach using the open-source framework Operon and demonstrate its performance on a selection of real-world regression problems, where we observe up to 34\% speedups without any detrimental effects on search quality. The hashing approach represents a straightforward way to improve runtime performance while also offering some interesting possibilities for adjusting search strategy based on cached information.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Real-time streaming of point cloud video, characterized by massive data volumes and high sensitivity to packet loss, remains a key challenge for immersive applications under dynamic network conditions. While connection-oriented protocols such as TCP and more modern alternatives like QUIC alleviate some transport-layer inefficiencies, including head-of-line blocking, they still retain a coarse-grained, segment-based delivery model and a centralized control loop that limit fine-grained adaptation and effective caching. We introduce INDS (Incremental Named Data Streaming), an adaptive streaming framework based on Information-Centric Networking (ICN) that rethinks delivery for hierarchical, layered media. INDS leverages the Octree structure of point cloud video and expressive content naming to support progressive, partial retrieval of enhancement layers based on consumer bandwidth and decoding capability. By combining time-windows with Group-of-Frames (GoF), INDS's naming scheme supports fine-grained in-network caching and facilitates efficient multi-user data reuse. INDS can be deployed as an overlay, remaining compatible with QUIC-based transport infrastructure as well as future Media-over-QUIC (MoQ) architectures, without requiring changes to underlying IP networks. Our prototype implementation shows up to 80% lower delay, 15-50% higher throughput, and 20-30% increased cache hit rates compared to state-of-the-art DASH-style systems. Together, these results establish INDS as a scalable, cache-friendly solution for real-time point cloud streaming under variable and lossy conditions, while its compatibility with MoQ overlays further positions it as a practical, forward-compatible architecture for emerging immersive media systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable capabilities in processing graph-structured data prevalent in various real-world applications. However, the scalability of full-batch GNN training becomes severely limited by high communication overhead and load imbalance in distributed environments. In this paper, we present CaPGNN, a novel framework for efficient parallel full-batch GNN training on single-server with multi-GPU, designed specifically to reduce redundant inter-GPU communication and balance computational workloads. We propose a joint adaptive caching algorithm that leverages both CPU and GPU memory to significantly reduce the repetitive transmission of vertex features across partitions. Additionally, we introduce a resource-aware graph partitioning algorithm that adjusts subgraph sizes dynamically according to the heterogeneous computational and communication capacities of GPUs. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate that CaPGNN effectively reduces communication costs by up to 96% and accelerates GNN training by up to 12.7 times compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Our results highlight the potential of adaptive caching and resource-aware partitioning to facilitate scalable, efficient, and practical deployment of full-batch GNN training in distributed computing environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Low-precision matrix engines, such as FP16 cube, offer high throughput but lack support for full-precision computation. In this work, we propose SGEMM-cube, a high-performance algorithm for emulating FP32 general matrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM) using only FP16 computation units on a representative AI accelerator. The method decomposes each FP32 operand into two FP16 values and compensates for numerical errors through a tunable scaling strategy. A detailed analysis of numerical errors, including underflow conditions and precision loss, guides the selection of scaling parameters to preserve up to 22 bits of mantissa accuracy. We further investigate the effect of computation order on accuracy and demonstrate that a term-wise accumulation scheme improves numerical stability over conventional FP32 GEMM in low-exponent regimes. Finally, a cache-aware blocking strategy and double-buffered pipeline are introduced to overlap memory transfers with computation, enabling SGEMM-cube to achieve up to 77\% of the theoretical FP32-equivalent peak performance on Ascend 910A NPU lacking native FP32 support. Extensive numerical experiments confirm that our method not only recovers the accuracy of native FP32 GEMM but also exhibits superior numerical stability under certain conditions, due to its structured and error-aware computation order.

We discuss how LAMMPS has adapted to the modern heterogeneous computing landscape by integrating the Kokkos performance portability library into the existing C++ code. We investigate performance portability of simple pairwise, many-body reactive, and machine-learned force-field interatomic potentials. We present results on GPUs across different vendors and generations, and analyze performance trends, probing FLOPS throughput, memory bandwidths, cache capabilities, and thread-atomic operation performance. Finally, we demonstrate strong scaling on all current US exascale machines -- OLCF Frontier, and ALCF Aurora, and NNSA El Capitan -- for the three potentials.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps. Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2) region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$ on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without compromising generation quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Nonlocal Coulomb interactions play a crucial role in stabilizing distinct electronic phases in kagome materials. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of on-site ($U$) and inter-site ($V$) Coulomb interactions on the electronic structure and stability of charge-density-wave (CDW) phases in the kagome metal KV$_3$Sb$_5$ using density functional theory (DFT+$U$+$V$) calculations. We demonstrate that $V$ promotes the formation and stability of CDW phases, whereas $U$ suppresses these phases, highlighting a fundamental competition between local and nonlocal Coulomb interactions. By directly comparing our theoretical results with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data, we identify realistic values of $U$ and $V$ that accurately describe the electronic band structure of KV$_3$Sb$_5$. Our findings establish a detailed $U$-$V$ phase diagram for KV$_3$Sb$_5$, offering valuable insights into the correlated electronic states in kagome metals and serving as a foundation for future explorations of correlation-driven phenomena in related materials.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present Datarus-R1-14B, a 14 B-parameter open-weights language model fine-tuned from Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct to act as a virtual data analyst and graduate-level problem solver. Datarus is trained not on isolated question-answer pairs but on full analytical trajectories including reasoning steps, code execution, error traces, self-corrections, and final conclusions, all captured in a ReAct-style notebook format spanning finance, medicine, numerical analysis, and other quantitative domains. Our training pipeline combines (i) a trajectory-centric synthetic data generator that yielded 144 000 tagged notebook episodes, (ii) a dual-reward framework blending a lightweight tag-based structural signal with a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM) that scores both single-step soundness and end-to-end coherence, and (iii) a memory-optimized implementation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) featuring KV-cache reuse, sequential generation, and reference-model sharding. A cosine curriculum smoothly shifts emphasis from structural fidelity to semantic depth, reducing the format collapse and verbosity that often plague RL-aligned LLMs. A central design choice in Datarus is it dual reasoning interface. In agentic mode the model produces ReAct-tagged steps that invoke Python tools to execute real code; in reflection mode it outputs compact Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces delimited by <think> and <answer> tags. On demanding postgraduate-level problems, Datarus exhibits an "AHA-moment" pattern: it sketches hypotheses, revises them once or twice, and converges avoiding the circular, token-inflating loops common to contemporary systems. Across standard public benchmarks Datarus surpasses similar size models and even reaches the level of larger reasoning models such as QwQ-32B achieving up to 30% higher accuracy on AIME 2024/2025 and LiveCodeBench while emitting 18-49% fewer tokens per solution.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in generative AI have accelerated the discovery of novel chemicals and materials. However, scaling these discoveries to industrial production remains a major bottleneck due to the synthesis gap -- the need to develop entirely new manufacturing processes. This challenge requires detailed engineering blueprints: PFDs for equipment layouts and material/energy flows, and PIDs for process plant operations. Current AI systems cannot yet reliably generate these critical engineering schematics, creating a fundamental obstacle to manufacturing scale-up of novel discoveries. We present a closed-loop, physics-aware framework for automated generation of industrially viable PFDs and PIDs. The framework integrates three key components: (1) domain-specialized small language models (SLMs) trained for auto-generation of PFDs and PIDs, (2) a hierarchical knowledge graph containing process flow and instrumentation descriptions for 1,020+ chemicals for Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRAG), and (3) an open-source chemical process simulator for modeling, simulation, optimization, and analysis of novel chemical processes. The SLMs are trained through a multi-stage pipeline on synthetic datasets, with process simulator-in-the-loop validation ensuring feasibility. To enhance computational efficiency, the framework implements structural pruning (width and depth) guided by importance heuristics to reduce language model size while preserving accuracy, followed by advanced inference optimizations including FlashAttention, Lookahead Decoding, PagedAttention with KV-cache quantization, and Test-Time Inference Scaling. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework generates simulator-validated process descriptions with high fidelity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex tasks, but their extended chain-of-thought reasoning process increases inference overhead. While quantization has been widely adopted to reduce the inference cost of large language models, its impact on reasoning models remains understudied. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study on quantized reasoning models, evaluating the open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Distilled Qwen and LLaMA families ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3-8B. Our investigation covers weight, KV cache, and activation quantization using state-of-the-art algorithms at varying bit-widths, with extensive evaluation across mathematical (AIME, MATH-500), scientific (GPQA), and programming (LiveCodeBench) reasoning benchmarks. Our findings reveal that while lossless quantization can be achieved with W8A8 or W4A16 quantization, lower bit-widths introduce significant accuracy risks. We further identify model size, model origin, and task difficulty as critical determinants of performance. Contrary to expectations, quantized models do not exhibit increased output lengths. In addition, strategically scaling the model sizes or reasoning steps can effectively enhance the performance. All quantized models and codes are open-sourced in https://github.com/ruikangliu/Quantized-Reasoning-Models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Software-defined networking (SDN) technology aims to create a highly flexible network by decoupling control plane and the data plane and programming them independently. There has been a lot of research on improving and optimizing the control plane, and data plane programming is a relatively new concept, so study on it is one of the hot topics for researchers. At the 2019 Dagstuhl Seminar, well-known scientists on computer networking discussed challenges and problems in the field of data plane programming that need to be addressed over the next 10 years. Based on this seminar issues and papers review, we suggested some possible solutions which are for optimizing data plane to improve packet processing performance and link utilization. The suggestions include (i) enriching data plane language with asynchronous external function, (ii) compression based on payload size, (iii) in-network caching for fast packet processing, and (iv) offloading external functions to an additional thread, virtual machine (VM) or server, etc. In addition, we implemented some of these in the P4 data plane language to illustrate the practicality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Discrete GPUs are a cornerstone of HPC and data center systems, requiring management of separate CPU and GPU memory spaces. Unified Virtual Memory (UVM) has been proposed to ease the burden of memory management; however, at a high cost in performance. The recent introduction of AMD's MI300A Accelerated Processing Units (APUs)--as deployed in the El Capitan supercomputer--enables HPC systems featuring integrated CPU and GPU with Unified Physical Memory (UPM) for the first time. This work presents the first comprehensive characterization of the UPM architecture on MI300A. We first analyze the UPM system properties, including memory latency, bandwidth, and coherence overhead. We then assess the efficiency of the system software in memory allocation, page fault handling, TLB management, and Infinity Cache utilization. We propose a set of porting strategies for transforming applications for the UPM architecture and evaluate six applications on the MI300A APU. Our results show that applications on UPM using the unified memory model can match or outperform those in the explicitly managed model--while reducing memory costs by up to 44%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Leveraging the Transformer architecture and the diffusion process, video DiT models have emerged as a dominant approach for high-quality video generation. However, their multi-step iterative denoising process incurs high computational cost and inference latency. Caching, a widely adopted optimization method in DiT models, leverages the redundancy in the diffusion process to skip computations in different granularities (e.g., step, cfg, block). Nevertheless, existing caching methods are limited to single-granularity strategies, struggling to balance generation quality and inference speed in a flexible manner. In this work, we propose MixCache, a training-free caching-based framework for efficient video DiT inference. It first distinguishes the interference and boundary between different caching strategies, and then introduces a context-aware cache triggering strategy to determine when caching should be enabled, along with an adaptive hybrid cache decision strategy for dynamically selecting the optimal caching granularity. Extensive experiments on diverse models demonstrate that, MixCache can significantly accelerate video generation (e.g., 1.94$\times$ speedup on Wan 14B, 1.97$\times$ speedup on HunyuanVideo) while delivering both superior generation quality and inference efficiency compared to baseline methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Web proxies such as NGINX commonly rely on least-recently-used (LRU) eviction, which is size agnostic and can thrash under periodic bursts and mixed object sizes. We introduce Cold-RL, a learned eviction policy for NGINX that replaces LRU's forced-expire path with a dueling Deep Q-Network served by an ONNX sidecar within a strict microsecond budget. On each eviction, Cold-RL samples the K least-recently-used objects, extracts six lightweight features (age, size, hit count, inter-arrival time, remaining TTL, and last origin RTT), and requests a bitmask of victims; a hard timeout of 500 microseconds triggers immediate fallback to native LRU. Policies are trained offline by replaying NGINX access logs through a cache simulator with a simple reward: a retained object earns one point if it is hit again before TTL expiry. We compare against LRU, LFU, size-based, adaptive LRU, and a hybrid baseline on two adversarial workloads. With a 25 MB cache, Cold-RL raises hit ratio from 0.1436 to 0.3538, a 146 percent improvement over the best classical baseline; at 100 MB, from 0.7530 to 0.8675, a 15 percent gain; and at 400 MB it matches classical methods (about 0.918). Inference adds less than 2 percent CPU overhead and keeps 95th percentile eviction latency within budget. To our knowledge, this is the first reinforcement learning eviction policy integrated into NGINX with strict SLOs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Model (LLM) inference is increasingly constrained by memory bandwidth, with frequent access to the key-value (KV) cache dominating data movement. While attention sparsity reduces some memory traffic, the relevance of past tokens varies over time, requiring the full KV cache to remain accessible and sustaining pressure on both bandwidth and capacity. With advances in interconnects such as NVLink and LPDDR5X, modern AI hardware now integrates high-bandwidth memory (HBM) with high-speed off-package DRAM, making heterogeneous memory systems a practical solution. This work investigates dynamic KV cache placement across such systems to maximize aggregated bandwidth utilization under capacity constraints. Rather than proposing a specific scheduling policy, we formulate the placement problem mathematically and derive a theoretical upper bound, revealing substantial headroom for runtime optimization. To our knowledge, this is the first formal treatment of dynamic KV cache scheduling in heterogeneous memory systems for LLM inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), handling long context has become one of the vital abilities in LLMs. Such long-context ability is accompanied by difficulties in deployment, especially due to the increased consumption of KV cache. There is certain work aiming to optimize the memory footprint of KV cache, inspired by the observation that attention heads can be categorized into retrieval heads that are of great significance and streaming heads that are of less significance. Typically, identifying the streaming heads and and waiving the KV cache in the streaming heads would largely reduce the overhead without hurting the performance that much. However, since employing both retrieval and streaming heads in one layer decomposes one large round of attention computation into two small ones, it may unexpectedly bring extra latency on accessing and indexing tensors. Based on this intuition, we impose an important improvement to the identification process of retrieval and streaming heads, in which we design a criterion that enforces exclusively retrieval or streaming heads gathered in one unique layer. In this way, we further eliminate the extra latency and only incur negligible performance degradation. Our method named \textsc{ZigzagAttention} is competitive among considered baselines owing to reduced latency and comparable performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While long context support of large language models has extended their abilities, it also incurs challenges in memory and compute which becomes crucial bottlenecks in resource-restricted devices. Token eviction, a widely adopted post-training methodology designed to alleviate the bottlenecks by evicting less important tokens from the cache, typically uses attention scores as proxy metrics for token importance. However, one major limitation of attention score as a token-wise importance metrics is that it lacks the information about contribution of tokens to the attention output. In this paper, we propose a simple eviction criterion based on the contribution of cached tokens to attention outputs. Our method, CAOTE, optimizes for eviction error due to token eviction, by seamlessly integrating attention scores and value vectors. This is the first method which uses value tokens on top of attention-based eviction scores in closed-form. Additionally, CAOTE can act as a meta-heuristic method with flexible usage with any token eviction method. We show that CAOTE, when combined with the state-of-the-art attention score-based methods, always improves accuracies on the downstream task, indicating the importance of leveraging information from values during token eviction process.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Memory is fundamental to intelligence, enabling learning, reasoning, and adaptability across biological and artificial systems. While Transformer architectures excel at sequence modeling, they face critical limitations in long-range context retention, continual learning, and knowledge integration. This review presents a unified framework bridging neuroscience principles, including dynamic multi-timescale memory, selective attention, and consolidation, with engineering advances in Memory-Augmented Transformers. We organize recent progress through three taxonomic dimensions: functional objectives (context extension, reasoning, knowledge integration, adaptation), memory representations (parameter-encoded, state-based, explicit, hybrid), and integration mechanisms (attention fusion, gated control, associative retrieval). Our analysis of core memory operations (reading, writing, forgetting, and capacity management) reveals a shift from static caches toward adaptive, test-time learning systems. We identify persistent challenges in scalability and interference, alongside emerging solutions including hierarchical buffering and surprise-gated updates. This synthesis provides a roadmap toward cognitively-inspired, lifelong-learning Transformer architectures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To protect privacy for data-collection-based services, local differential privacy (LDP) is widely adopted due to its rigorous theoretical bound on privacy loss. However, mistakes in complex theoretical analysis or subtle implementation errors may undermine its practical guarantee. To address this, auditing is crucial to confirm that LDP protocols truly protect user data. However, existing auditing methods, though, mainly target machine learning and federated learning tasks based on centralized differentially privacy (DP), with limited attention to LDP. Moreover, the few studies on LDP auditing focus solely on simple frequency estimation task for discrete data, leaving correlated key-value data - which requires both discrete frequency estimation for keys and continuous mean estimation for values - unexplored.   To bridge this gap, we propose KV-Auditor, a framework for auditing LDP-based key-value estimation mechanisms by estimating their empirical privacy lower bounds. Rather than traditional LDP auditing methods that relies on binary output predictions, KV-Auditor estimates this lower bound by analyzing unbounded output distributions, supporting continuous data. Specifically, we classify state-of-the-art LDP key-value mechanisms into interactive and non-interactive types. For non-interactive mechanisms, we propose horizontal KV-Auditor for small domains with sufficient samples and vertical KV-Auditor for large domains with limited samples. For interactive mechanisms, we design a segmentation strategy to capture incremental privacy leakage across iterations. Finally, we perform extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our approach, offering insights for optimizing LDP-based key-value estimators.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The integration of wireless communications and Large Language Models (LLMs) is poised to unlock ubiquitous intelligent services, yet deploying them in wireless edge-device collaborative environments presents a critical trade-off between inference quality and end-to-end latency. A fundamental mismatch exists between task complexity and resource allocation: offloading simple queries invites prohibitive latency, while on-device models lack the capacity for demanding computations. To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic, quality-latency aware routing framework that orchestrates inference between a lightweight model on the mobile device and a powerful model on the edge server. Our framework employs two distinct cost models: for single-turn queries, it fuses a BERT-predicted semantic score with communication and computation overheads; for multi-turn dialogues, it further quantifies context-aware costs arising from model switching and KV-cache management. While maintaining full inference quality, extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework cuts average response latency by 5-15% and reduces large model invocations by 10-20% against competitive baselines on MMLU, GSM8K, and MT-Bench-101 benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in reasoning tasks, but their performance on linguistics puzzles remains consistently poor. These puzzles, often derived from Linguistics Olympiad (LO) contests, provide a minimal contamination environment to assess LLMs' linguistic reasoning abilities across low-resource languages. This work analyses LLMs' performance on 629 problems across 41 low-resource languages by labelling each with linguistically informed features to unveil weaknesses. Our analyses show that LLMs struggle with puzzles involving higher morphological complexity and perform better on puzzles involving linguistic features that are also found in English. We also show that splitting words into morphemes as a pre-processing step improves solvability, indicating a need for more informed and language-specific tokenisers. These findings thus offer insights into some challenges in linguistic reasoning and modelling of low-resource languages.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend LLMs to handle images, videos, and audio by incorporating feature extractors and projection modules. However, these additional components -- combined with complex inference pipelines and heterogeneous workloads -- introduce significant inference overhead. Therefore, efficiently serving MLLMs remains a major challenge. Current tightly coupled serving architectures struggle to distinguish between mixed request types or adapt parallelism strategies to different inference stages, leading to increased time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency and poor resource utilization. To address this, we introduce Elastic Multimodal Parallelism (EMP), a new serving paradigm that elastically adapts to resource heterogeneity across request types and inference stages. Building upon EMP, we develop ElasticMM, an MLLM serving system that (1) separates requests into independent modality groups with dynamic resource allocation via a modality-aware load balancer; (2) decouples inference stages and enables parallelism adjustment and adaptive scaling via elastic partition scheduling; and (3) improves inference efficiency through unified multimodal prefix caching and non-blocking encoding. Experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that ElasticMM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) serving systems, reducing TTFT by up to 4.2x and achieving 3.2-4.5x higher throughput while meeting service-level objectives (SLOs).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are rapidly emerging as a powerful and promising alternative to the dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm. By generating tokens in parallel through an iterative denoising process, DLMs possess inherent advantages in reducing inference latency and capturing bidirectional context, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the generation process. While achieving a several-fold speed-up, recent advancements have allowed DLMs to show performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, making them a compelling choice for various natural language processing tasks. In this survey, we provide a holistic overview of the current DLM landscape. We trace its evolution and relationship with other paradigms, such as autoregressive and masked language models, and cover both foundational principles and state-of-the-art models. Our work offers an up-to-date, comprehensive taxonomy and an in-depth analysis of current techniques, from pre-training strategies to advanced post-training methods. Another contribution of this survey is a thorough review of DLM inference strategies and optimizations, including improvements in decoding parallelism, caching mechanisms, and generation quality. We also highlight the latest approaches to multimodal extensions of DLMs and delineate their applications across various practical scenarios. Furthermore, our discussion addresses the limitations and challenges of DLMs, including efficiency, long-sequence handling, and infrastructure requirements, while outlining future research directions to sustain progress in this rapidly evolving field.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed with rapidly expanding context windows to support increasingly demanding applications. However, long contexts pose significant deployment challenges, primarily due to the KV cache whose size grows proportionally with context length. While KV cache compression methods are proposed to address this issue, KV dropping methods incur considerable accuracy loss, and KV retrieval methods suffer from significant efficiency bottlenecks. We propose FreeKV, an algorithm-system co-optimization framework to enhance KV retrieval efficiency while preserving accuracy. On the algorithm side, FreeKV introduces speculative retrieval to shift the KV selection and recall processes out of the critical path, combined with fine-grained correction to ensure accuracy. On the system side, FreeKV employs hybrid KV layouts across CPU and GPU memory to eliminate fragmented data transfers, and leverages double-buffered streamed recall to further improve efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that FreeKV achieves near-lossless accuracy across various scenarios and models, delivering up to 13$\times$ speedup compared to SOTA KV retrieval methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rise of long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) amplifies memory and bandwidth demands during autoregressive decoding, as the Key-Value (KV) cache grows with each generated token. Low-bit KV-cache quantization (e.g., 4-bit or 2-bit) can reduce memory footprint while preserving accuracy, but existing systems suffer from slow decoding due to their exclusive reliance on CUDA cores, neglecting Tensor Cores (the primary source of compute on modern GPUs). We present BitDecoding, a new long-context LLM inference system with a low-bit KV cache. BitDecoding enables efficient low-bit KV-cache decoding by cooperatively leveraging CUDA cores and Tensor Cores. It introduces methods for automatically inducing optimized layouts to exploit Tensor Cores, along with warp-level parallelization strategies for dequantization. For unified system support, BitDecoding includes a query transformation module supporting diverse attention variants, a quantization kernel that supports both tensor-wise and channel-wise scaling used in various quantization algorithms with high performance, and a dequantization kernel with a software-defined pipeline to coordinate CUDA and Tensor Cores execution for mixed-precision operations. Evaluated on RTX 4090, A100, and H100, BitDecoding accelerates decoding by up to 7.5x, 4.8x, and 8.9x, respectively, over FP16 FlashDecoding-v2, and surpasses the state-of-the-art low-bit system QServe by up to 4.3x. On LLaMA-3.1-8B with a 128K context, BitDecoding reduces single-batch decoding latency by 3x, showing substantial improvements for long-context generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Visual generation includes both image and video generation, training probabilistic models to create coherent, diverse, and semantically faithful content from scratch. While early research focused on unconditional sampling, practitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise specification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants precise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases latency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and denoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce EVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead without retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual caching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we first profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained control, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A locality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the control signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions. For temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on CogVideo-Controlnet, Wan2.1-Controlnet, and Flux demonstrate that our method is effective in image and video control generation without the need for training. For example, it achieves 2.16 and 2.05 times speedups on CogVideo-Controlnet and Wan2.1-Controlnet, respectively, with almost no degradation in generation quality.Codes are available in the supplementary materials.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing input sequence length in Large Language Models (LLMs) puts significant pressure on key-value (KV) cache storage, making efficient inference challenging. Explicitly distinguishing attention behavior into our self-defined surface memorization and logic construction reveals essential roles in long-context reasoning. We observe that an individual attention head can display various behaviors, with nearly 98.5% effectively ignoring completely irrelevant information. The remaining 1.5% behaves as logic construction, and 0.5% behaves as surface memorization. Based on layer- and head-wise integration, we propose a novel two-stage SurfaceLogicKV method to utilize these attention behaviors for KV Cache compression. As a result, it achieves improved compressing robustness while maintaining competitive performance across various tasks and long sequences compared to baselines or even FullKV in some specific situations

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) can distribute keys with guaranteed security but remains susceptible to key exchange interruption due to physical-layer threats, such as high-power jamming attacks. To address this challenge, we first introduce a novel metric, namely Maximum Number of Affected Requests (maxNAR), to quantify the worst-case impact of a single physical-layer attack, and then we investigate a new problem of Routing and Wavelength Assignment with Minimal Attack Radius (RWA-MAR). We formulate the problem using an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model and propose a scalable heuristic to efficiently minimize maxNAR. Our approach incorporates key caching through Quantum Key Pools (QKPs) to enhance resilience and optimize resource utilization. Moreover, we model the impact of different QKD network architectures, employing Optical Bypass (OB) for optical switching of quantum channels and Trusted Relay (TR) for secure key forwarding. Moreover, a tunable parameter is designed in the heuristic to guide the preference for OB or TR, offering enhanced adaptability and dynamic control in diverse network scenarios. Simulation results confirm that our method significantly outperforms the baseline in terms of security and scalability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present Yan, a foundational framework for interactive video generation, covering the entire pipeline from simulation and generation to editing. Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering, enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the next generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing scale and complexity of large language models (LLMs) pose significant inference latency challenges, primarily due to their autoregressive decoding paradigm characterized by the sequential nature of next-token prediction. By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed that some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic parallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel decoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which addresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data and efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a non-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable structures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient adaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which enables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while maintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical Reasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, on Vicuna Bench, our method achieves up to 3.19x speedup (1.85x on average) while maintaining response quality within 1% difference compared to autoregressive models, realizing significant acceleration without compromising generation quality. Our framework sets a groundbreaking benchmark for efficient LLM parallel inference, paving the way for its deployment in latency-sensitive applications such as AI-powered customer service bots and answer retrieval engines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in text-to-image synthesis. However, in the domain of controllable text-to-image generation using DiTs, most existing methods still rely on the ControlNet paradigm originally designed for UNet-based diffusion models. This paradigm introduces significant parameter overhead and increased computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose the Nano Control Diffusion Transformer (NanoControl), which employs Flux as the backbone network. Our model achieves state-of-the-art controllable text-to-image generation performance while incurring only a 0.024\% increase in parameter count and a 0.029\% increase in GFLOPs, thus enabling highly efficient controllable generation. Specifically, rather than duplicating the DiT backbone for control, we design a LoRA-style (low-rank adaptation) control module that directly learns control signals from raw conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce a KV-Context Augmentation mechanism that integrates condition-specific key-value information into the backbone in a simple yet highly effective manner, facilitating deep fusion of conditional features. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that NanoControl significantly reduces computational overhead compared to conventional control approaches, while maintaining superior generation quality and achieving improved controllability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial memory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates the challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade increased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods. We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X, instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and Values on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\times$ memory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to $\sim 7.7\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to the FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values are similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for extreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to 10$\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01 perplexity degradation, and 12.5$\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$ perplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based Large Language Models rely critically on the KV cache to efficiently handle extended contexts during the decode phase. Yet, the size of the KV cache grows proportionally with the input length, burdening both memory bandwidth and capacity as decoding progresses. To address this challenge, we present RocketKV, a training-free KV cache compression strategy containing two consecutive stages. In the first stage, it performs coarse-grain permanent KV cache eviction on the input sequence tokens. In the second stage, it adopts a hybrid sparse attention method to conduct fine-grain top-k sparse attention, approximating the attention scores by leveraging both head and sequence dimensionality reductions. We show that RocketKV provides a compression ratio of up to 400$\times$, end-to-end speedup of up to 3.7$\times$ as well as peak memory reduction of up to 32.6% in the decode phase on an NVIDIA A100 GPU compared to the full KV cache baseline, while achieving negligible accuracy loss on a variety of long-context tasks. We also propose a variant of RocketKV for multi-turn scenarios, which consistently outperforms other existing methods and achieves accuracy nearly on par with an oracle top-k attention scheme.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) are specialized accelerators commonly employed to boost performance in workloads with iterative structures. Existing research typically focuses on compiler or architecture optimizations aimed at improving CGRA performance, energy efficiency, flexibility, and area utilization, under the idealistic assumption that kernels can access all data from Scratchpad Memory (SPM). However, certain complex workloads-particularly in fields like graph analytics, irregular database operations, and specialized forms of high-performance computing (e.g., unstructured mesh simulations)-exhibit irregular memory access patterns that hinder CGRA utilization, sometimes dropping below 1.5%, making the CGRA memory-bound. To address this challenge, we conduct a thorough analysis of the underlying causes of performance degradation, then propose a redesigned memory subsystem and refine the memory model. With both microarchitectural and theoretical optimization, our solution can effectively manage irregular memory accesses through CGRA-specific runahead execution mechanism and cache reconfiguration techniques. Our results demonstrate that we can achieve performance comparable to the original SPM-only system while requiring only 1.27% of the storage size. The runahead execution mechanism achieves an average 3.04x speedup (up to 6.91x), with cache reconfiguration technique providing an additional 6.02% improvement, significantly enhancing CGRA performance for irregular memory access patterns.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> BLAS is a fundamental building block of advanced linear algebra libraries and many modern scientific computing applications. GPUs are known for their strong arithmetic computing capabilities and are highly suited for BLAS operations. However, porting code to GPUs often requires significant effort, especially for large, complex codes or legacy codes, even for BLAS-heavy applications. While various tools exist to automatically offload BLAS to GPUs, they are often impractical due to the high costs associated with mandatory data transfers. The advent of unified memory architectures in recent GPU designs, such as the NVIDIA Grace-Hopper, allows cache-coherent memory access across all types of memory for both CPU and GPU, potentially eliminating the bottlenecks faced in conventional architectures. This breakthrough paves the way for innovative application developments and porting strategies. Building on our preliminary work demonstrating the potential of automatic *gemm offload, this paper extends the framework to all level-3 BLAS operations and introduces SCILIB-Accel, a novel tool for automatic BLAS offload. SCILIB-Accel leverages the memory coherency in Grace-Hopper and introduces a Device First-Use data movement policy inspired by the OpenMP First-Touch approach in multi-socket CPU programming, minimizing CPU-GPU data transfers for typical scientific computing codes. Additionally, utilizing dynamic binary instrumentation, the tool intercepts BLAS symbols directly from a CPU binary, requiring no code modifications or recompilation. SCILIB-Accel has been evaluated using multiple quantum physics codes on up to a few hundred GPU nodes, yielding promising speedups. Notably, for the LSMS method in the MuST suite, a 3x speedup was achieved on Grace-Hopper compared to Grace-Grace.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot capabilities but struggle with distribution shifts in downstream tasks when labeled data is unavailable, which has motivated the development of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) to improve VLMs' performance during inference without annotations. Among various TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving historical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering efficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability challenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts, causing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation performance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible decision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA) method that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from two perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample selection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware Entropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight entropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low entropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method leverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and facilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven Distribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as multivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for more accurate predictions across visually diverse content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly under real-world distribution shifts. Code: https://github.com/Evelyn1ywliang/ReTA.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The wide deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to strong demands for optimizing their inference performance. Today's techniques serving this purpose primarily focus on reducing latency and improving throughput through algorithmic and hardware enhancements, while largely overlooking their privacy side effects, particularly in a multi-user environment. In our research, for the first time, we discovered a set of new timing side channels in LLM systems, arising from shared caches and GPU memory allocations, which can be exploited to infer both confidential system prompts and those issued by other users. These vulnerabilities echo security challenges observed in traditional computing systems, highlighting an urgent need to address potential information leakage in LLM serving infrastructures. In this paper, we report novel attack strategies designed to exploit such timing side channels inherent in LLM deployments, specifically targeting the Key-Value (KV) cache and semantic cache widely used to enhance LLM inference performance. Our approach leverages timing measurements and classification models to detect cache hits, allowing an adversary to infer private prompts with high accuracy. We also propose a token-by-token search algorithm to efficiently recover shared prompt prefixes in the caches, showing the feasibility of stealing system prompts and those produced by peer users. Our experimental studies on black-box testing of popular online LLM services demonstrate that such privacy risks are completely realistic, with significant consequences. Our findings underscore the need for robust mitigation to protect LLM systems against such emerging threats.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Key-Value (KV) cache, which stores intermediate attention computations (Key and Value pairs) to avoid redundant calculations, is a fundamental mechanism for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference. However, this efficiency optimization introduces significant yet underexplored privacy risks. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of these vulnerabilities, demonstrating that an attacker can reconstruct sensitive user inputs directly from the KV-cache. We design and implement three distinct attack vectors: a direct Inversion Attack, a more broadly applicable and potent Collision Attack, and a semantic-based Injection Attack. These methods demonstrate the practicality and severity of KV-cache privacy leakage issues. To mitigate this, we propose KV-Cloak, a novel, lightweight, and efficient defense mechanism. KV-Cloak uses a reversible matrix-based obfuscation scheme, combined with operator fusion, to secure the KV-cache. Our extensive experiments show that KV-Cloak effectively thwarts all proposed attacks, reducing reconstruction quality to random noise. Crucially, it achieves this robust security with virtually no degradation in model accuracy and minimal performance overhead, offering a practical solution for trustworthy LLM deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) in high-dimensional vector spaces has a wide range of real-world applications. Numerous methods have been proposed to handle ANNS efficiently, while graph-based indexes have gained prominence due to their high accuracy and efficiency. However, the indexing overhead of graph-based indexes remains substantial. With exponential growth in data volume and increasing demands for dynamic index adjustments, this overhead continues to escalate, posing a critical challenge. In this paper, we introduce Tagore, a fast library accelerated by GPUs for graph indexing, which has powerful capabilities of constructing refinement-based graph indexes such as NSG and Vamana. We first introduce GNN-Descent, a GPU-specific algorithm for efficient k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) graph initialization. GNN-Descent speeds up the similarity comparison by a two-phase descent procedure and enables highly parallelized neighbor updates. Next, aiming to support various k-NN graph pruning strategies, we formulate a universal computing procedure termed CFS and devise two generalized GPU kernels for parallel processing complex dependencies in neighbor relationships. For large-scale datasets exceeding GPU memory capacity, we propose an asynchronous GPU-CPU-disk indexing framework with a cluster-aware caching mechanism to minimize the I/O pressure on the disk. Extensive experiments on 7 real-world datasets exhibit that Tagore achieves 1.32x-112.79x speedup while maintaining the index quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> An emerging paradigm in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is the use of history-aware multi-modal transformer models. Given a language instruction, these models process observation and navigation history to predict the most appropriate action for an agent. While they have significantly improved performance, the scale of these models can be a bottleneck in practical settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we propose a novel input-adaptive navigation method to enhance VLN model efficiency. We first show that existing input-adaptive mechanisms fail to reduce computations without substantial performance degradation. To address this, we introduce three adaptive algorithms, each deployed at a different level: (1) To improve spatial efficiency, we selectively process panoramic views at each observation of an agent. (2) To improve intra-model efficiency, we propose importance-based adaptive thresholding for the early-exit methods. (3) To improve temporal efficiency, we implement a caching mechanism that prevents reprocessing of views previously seen by the agent. In evaluations on seven VLN benchmarks, we demonstrate over a 2$\times$ reduction in computation across three off-the-shelf agents in both standard and continuous environments. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/secure-ai-systems-group/adaptive-vision-and-language-navigation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) generate tokens autoregressively, with each token depending on the preceding context. This sequential nature makes the inference process inherently difficult to accelerate, posing a significant challenge for efficient deployment. In recent years, various methods have been proposed to address this issue, with the most effective approaches often involving the training of additional draft models. In this paper, we introduce READER (Retrieval-Assisted Drafter for Efficient LLM Inference), a novel lossless speculative decoding method that enhances model-based approaches by leveraging self-repetitions in the text. Our algorithm expands the speculative decoding tree using tokens obtained through statistical search. This work focuses on large batch sizes (>= 8), an underexplored yet important area for industrial applications. We also analyze the key-value (KV) cache size during speculative decoding and propose an optimization to improve performance for large batches. As a result, READER outperforms existing speculative decoding methods. Notably, READER requires no additional training and can reuse pre-trained speculator models, increasing the speedup by over 40\%. Our method demonstrates particularly strong performance on search-based tasks, such as retrieval-augmented generation, where we achieve more than 10x speedup.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in long-context tasks such as reasoning, code generation, and multi-turn dialogue. However, inference over extended contexts is bottlenecked by the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose memory footprint grows linearly with sequence length and dominates latency at each decoding step. While recent KV cache compression methods identify and load important tokens, they focus predominantly on input contexts and fail to address the cumulative attention errors that arise during long decoding. In this paper, we introduce RetroAttention, a novel KV cache update technique that retrospectively revises past attention outputs using newly arrived KV entries from subsequent decoding steps. By maintaining a lightweight output cache, RetroAttention enables past queries to efficiently access more relevant context, while incurring minimal latency overhead. This breaks the fixed-attention-output paradigm and allows continual correction of prior approximations. Extensive experiments on long-generation benchmarks show that RetroAttention consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) KV compression methods, increasing effective KV exposure by up to 1.6$\times$ and accuracy by up to 21.9\%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Existing cache-based acceleration methods for video diffusion models primarily skip early or mid denoising steps, which often leads to structural discrepancies relative to full-timestep generation and can hinder instruction following and character consistency. We present TaoCache, a training-free, plug-and-play caching strategy that, instead of residual-based caching, adopts a fixed-point perspective to predict the model's noise output and is specifically effective in late denoising stages. By calibrating cosine similarities and norm ratios of consecutive noise deltas, TaoCache preserves high-resolution structure while enabling aggressive skipping. The approach is orthogonal to complementary accelerations such as Pyramid Attention Broadcast (PAB) and TeaCache, and it integrates seamlessly into DiT-based frameworks. Across Latte-1, OpenSora-Plan v110, and Wan2.1, TaoCache attains substantially higher visual quality (LPIPS, SSIM, PSNR) than prior caching methods under the same speedups.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> AI inference workflows are typically structured as a pipeline or graph of AI programs triggered by events. As events occur, the AIs perform inference or classification tasks under time pressure to respond or take some action. Standard techniques that reduce latency in other streaming settings (such as caching and optimization-driven scheduling) are of limited value because AI data access patterns (models, databases) change depending on the triggering event: a significant departure from traditional streaming. In this work, we propose a novel affinity grouping mechanism that makes it easier for developers to express application-specific data access correlations, enabling coordinated management of data objects in server clusters hosting streaming inference tasks. Our proposals are thus complementary to other approaches such as caching and scheduling. Experiments confirm the limitations of standard techniques, while showing that the proposed mechanism is able to maintain significantly lower latency as workload and scale-out increase, and yet requires only minor code changes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current video diffusion models achieve impressive generation quality but struggle in interactive applications due to bidirectional attention dependencies. The generation of a single frame requires the model to process the entire sequence, including the future. We address this limitation by adapting a pretrained bidirectional diffusion transformer to an autoregressive transformer that generates frames on-the-fly. To further reduce latency, we extend distribution matching distillation (DMD) to videos, distilling 50-step diffusion model into a 4-step generator. To enable stable and high-quality distillation, we introduce a student initialization scheme based on teacher's ODE trajectories, as well as an asymmetric distillation strategy that supervises a causal student model with a bidirectional teacher. This approach effectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive generation, allowing long-duration video synthesis despite training on short clips. Our model achieves a total score of 84.27 on the VBench-Long benchmark, surpassing all previous video generation models. It enables fast streaming generation of high-quality videos at 9.4 FPS on a single GPU thanks to KV caching. Our approach also enables streaming video-to-video translation, image-to-video, and dynamic prompting in a zero-shot manner.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present an efficient method for rigorous quantum calculations of cross sections for atom-molecule reactive scattering in the presence of a dc electric field. The wavefunction of the reaction complex is expanded in an overcomplete set of arrangement-dependent Fock-Delves hyperspherical basis functions and the interactions of the reactants and products with electric fields are accounted for in the total angular momentum representation. A significant computational challenge affecting our previously developed approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. $\mathbf{115}$, 023201 (2015)] is addressed by an efficient asymptotic frame transformation between the hyperspherical and Jacobi coordinates in the presence of an external field. Using accurate {\it ab initio} potential energy surfaces, we calculate total and state-resolved cross sections for the chemical reactions LiF$(v=1,j=0)$ + H $\to$ Li + HF($v'=0,j'$) and F + HD$(v=0,j=0)$ $\to$ HF + D, DF + H as functions of collision energy and electric field strength. The field dependence of the cross sections for the LiF + H chemical reaction exhibits resonance structure mediated by tunneling-driven interactions between reactants and products. No significant field effects are found for the F + HD $\to$ HF + D, DF + H chemical reaction at 1 Kelvin, even for state-resolved transitions and with field magnitudes reaching 200 kV/cm. Our calculations illustrate the essential role of basis set convergence for the proper interpretation of external field effects on chemical reaction dynamics. While reduced-basis calculations for the F + HD reaction indicate significant effects of electric fields on product state distributions, these effects vanish when the number of total angular momentum basis states is increased.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce InternVL 3.5, a new family of open-source multimodal models that significantly advances versatility, reasoning capability, and inference efficiency along the InternVL series. A key innovation is the Cascade Reinforcement Learning (Cascade RL) framework, which enhances reasoning through a two-stage process: offline RL for stable convergence and online RL for refined alignment. This coarse-to-fine training strategy leads to substantial improvements on downstream reasoning tasks, e.g., MMMU and MathVista. To optimize efficiency, we propose a Visual Resolution Router (ViR) that dynamically adjusts the resolution of visual tokens without compromising performance. Coupled with ViR, our Decoupled Vision-Language Deployment (DvD) strategy separates the vision encoder and language model across different GPUs, effectively balancing computational load. These contributions collectively enable InternVL3.5 to achieve up to a +16.0\% gain in overall reasoning performance and a 4.05$\times$ inference speedup compared to its predecessor, i.e., InternVL3. In addition, InternVL3.5 supports novel capabilities such as GUI interaction and embodied agency. Notably, our largest model, i.e., InternVL3.5-241B-A28B, attains state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs across general multimodal, reasoning, text, and agentic tasks -- narrowing the performance gap with leading commercial models like GPT-5. All models and code are publicly released.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive performance in understanding visual content with language instruction by converting visual input to vision tokens. However, redundancy in vision tokens results in the degenerated inference efficiency of VLMs. While many algorithms have been proposed to reduce the number of vision tokens, most of them apply only unimodal information (i.e., vision/text) for pruning and ignore the inherent multimodal property of vision-language tasks. Moreover, it lacks a generic criterion that can be applied to different modalities. To mitigate this limitation, in this work, we propose to leverage both vision and text tokens to select informative vision tokens by the criterion of coverage. We first formulate the subset selection problem as a maximum coverage problem. Afterward, a subset of vision tokens is optimized to cover the text tokens and the original set of vision tokens, simultaneously. Finally, a VLM agent can be adopted to further improve the quality of text tokens for guiding vision pruning. The proposed method MMTok is extensively evaluated on benchmark datasets with different VLMs. The comparison illustrates that vision and text information are complementary, and combining multimodal information can surpass the unimodal baseline with a clear margin. Moreover, under the maximum coverage criterion on the POPE dataset, our method achieves a 1.87x speedup while maintaining 98.7% of the original performance on LLaVA-NeXT-13B. Furthermore, with only four vision tokens, it still preserves 87.7% of the original performance on LLaVA-1.5-7B. These results highlight the effectiveness of coverage in token selection.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown significant progress in test-time scaling through chain-of-thought prompting. Current approaches like search-o1 integrate retrieval augmented generation (RAG) into multi-step reasoning processes but rely on a single, linear reasoning chain while incorporating unstructured textual information in a flat, context-agnostic manner. As a result, these approaches can lead to error accumulation throughout the reasoning chain, which significantly limits its effectiveness in medical question-answering (QA) tasks where both accuracy and traceability are critical requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MIRAGE (Multi-chain Inference with Retrieval-Augmented Graph Exploration), a novel test-time scalable reasoning framework that performs dynamic multi-chain inference over structured medical knowledge graphs. Specifically, MIRAGE 1) decomposes complex queries into entity-grounded sub-questions, 2) executes parallel inference chains, 3) retrieves evidence adaptively via neighbor expansion and multi-hop traversal, and 4) integrates answers using cross-chain verification to resolve contradictions. Experiments on three medical QA benchmarks (GenMedGPT-5k, CMCQA, and ExplainCPE) show that MIRAGE consistently outperforms GPT-4o, Tree-of-Thought variants, and other retrieval-augmented baselines in both automatic and human evaluations. Additionally, MIRAGE improves interpretability by generating explicit reasoning chains that trace each factual claim to concrete chains within the knowledge graph, making it well-suited for complex medical reasoning scenarios. The code will be available for further research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to provide helpful and harmless responses, yet they often exhibit sycophancy--conforming to user beliefs regardless of factual accuracy or ethical soundness. Prior research on sycophancy has primarily focused on single-turn factual correctness, overlooking the dynamics of real-world interactions. In this work, we introduce SYCON Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in multi-turn, free-form conversational settings. Our benchmark measures how quickly a model conforms to the user (Turn of Flip) and how frequently it shifts its stance under sustained user pressure (Number of Flip). Applying SYCON Bench to 17 LLMs across three real-world scenarios, we find that sycophancy remains a prevalent failure mode. Our analysis shows that alignment tuning amplifies sycophantic behavior, whereas model scaling and reasoning optimization strengthen the model's ability to resist undesirable user views. Reasoning models generally outperform instruction-tuned models but often fail when they over-index on logical exposition instead of directly addressing the user's underlying beliefs. Finally, we evaluate four additional prompting strategies and demonstrate that adopting a third-person perspective reduces sycophancy by up to 63.8% in debate scenario. We release our code and data at https://github.com/JiseungHong/SYCON-Bench.

Yet, whether the most popular Large Language Models (LLMs) possess proper knowledge the Chinese classifiers is an issue that has largely remain unexplored in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature.   To address such a question, we employ various masking strategies to evaluate the LLMs' intrinsic ability, the contribution of different sentence elements, and the working of the attention mechanisms during prediction. Besides, we explore fine-tuning for LLMs to enhance the classifier performance.   Our findings reveal that LLMs perform worse than BERT, even with fine-tuning. The prediction, as expected, greatly benefits from the information about the following noun, which also explains the advantage of models with a bidirectional attention mechanism such as BERT.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are approaching the sensitivity required to resolve gravitational waves (GWs) from individual supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. However, the large uncertainty in source localization will make the identification of its host environment challenging. We show how to convert the posterior probability function of binary parameters inferred by GW analyses into distributions of apparent magnitudes of the host galaxy. We do so for a scenario in which the host environment is a regular early-type galaxy, and one in which it is an active galactic nucleus. We estimate the reach of PTAs in the near and intermediate future, and estimate whether the binary hosts will be detectable in all-sky electromagnetic (EM) surveys. A PTA with a baseline of 20 yr and 116 pulsars, resembling the upcoming data release of the International Pulsar Timing Array, can detect binaries out to a luminosity distance of 2 Gpc (corresponding to a redshift of $z\sim0.36$), while a PTA with a baseline of 30 yr and 200 pulsars can reach out to distances slightly greater than 3 Gpc ($z\sim0.53$). We find that the host galaxies of all binaries detectable with a baseline of 20 yr are expected to be present in the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and SuperCOSMOS surveys, if they lie outside the plane of the Milky Way. The Two Micron All Sky Survey becomes incomplete for hosts of binaries more massive than $10^{9.8}{\rm M}_\odot$ at a luminosity distance greater than 1 Gpc. The EM surveys become slightly more incomplete when PTAs with longer baselines and therefore improved sensitivities are considered.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We analyse the ro-vibrational absorption bands of various molecular cations (HCO$^+$, HCNH$^+$, and N$_2$H$^+$) and neutral species (HCN, HNC, and HC$_3$N) detected in the \textit{James Webb Space Telescope}/Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer spectrum (4.9--27.9\,$\upmu$m) of the local ultra luminous infrared galaxy IRAS~07251$-$0248. We find that the molecular absorptions are blueshifted by 160\,km\,s$^{-1}$ relative to the systemic velocity of the target. Using local thermal equilibrium (LTE) excitation models, we derive rotational temperatures ($T_{\rm rot}$) from 42 to 185\,K for these absorption bands. This range of measured $T_{\rm rot}$ can be explained by infrared (IR) radiative pumping as a by--product of the strength, effective critical density, and opacity of each molecular band. Thus, these results suggest that these absorptions originate in a warm expanding gas shell ($\dot{M}$$\sim$90--330\,$M_\odot$\,yr$^{-1}$), which might be the base of the larger scale cold molecular outflow detected in this source. Finally, the elevated abundance of molecular cations can be explained by a high cosmic ray ionization rate, with log($\zeta_{\text{H}_2}$/n$_{\rm H}\, [\text{cm}^3\, \text{s}^{-1}])$ in the range of $-$18.2 (from H$_3^+$) to $-$19.1 (inferred from HCO$^+$ and N$_2$H$^+$, which are likely tracing denser gas), consistent with a cosmic ray dominated chemistry as predicted by chemical models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Boson Stars are macroscopic self-gravitating configurations made of complex scalar fields. These exotic compact objects would manifest as dark Boson stars and, in the absence of electromagnetic signatures, could mimic properties of compact stars in the gravitational wave spectrum. In a recent study, using the simplest potential for massive Boson stars, we demonstrated that fundamental non-radial oscillations ($f$-modes) obey scaling relations that allow them to be distinguished from neutron stars and black holes. In this work, we provide analytical fits for these scaling relations, valid for the dark matter parameter space compatible with current astrophysical and cosmological data that can be directly incorporated into future studies of massive Boson stars in the strong coupling regime, avoiding the need for numerical calculations. We also provide analytical fits for empirical and universal relations, for gravitational wave asteroseismology, which can be used to infer microscopic dark matter properties following a successful detection. Further, we investigate the possibility of the detection of $f$-modes and the dark matter parameter space that can be probed with current and future gravitational wave detectors across multiple frequency bands.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) has proven to be a tool that could help in the automatic detection of sexism. Previous studies have shown that these models contain biases that do not accurately reflect reality, especially for minority groups. Despite various efforts to improve the detection of sexist content, this task remains a significant challenge due to its subjective nature and the biases present in automated models. We explore the capabilities of different LLMs to detect sexism in social media text using the EXIST 2024 tweet dataset. It includes annotations from six distinct profiles for each tweet, allowing us to evaluate to what extent LLMs can mimic these groups' perceptions in sexism detection. Additionally, we analyze the demographic biases present in the models and conduct a statistical analysis to identify which demographic characteristics (age, gender) contribute most effectively to this task. Our results show that, while LLMs can to some extent detect sexism when considering the overall opinion of populations, they do not accurately replicate the diversity of perceptions among different demographic groups. This highlights the need for better-calibrated models that account for the diversity of perspectives across different populations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reliably composing Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex, multi-step workflows remains a significant challenge. The dominant paradigm-optimizing discrete prompts in a pipeline-is notoriously brittle and struggles to enforce the formal compliance required for structured tasks. We introduce Type-Compliant Adaptation Cascades (TACs), a framework that recasts workflow adaptation as learning typed probabilistic programs. TACs treats the entire workflow, which is composed of parameter-efficiently adapted LLMs and deterministic logic, as an unnormalized joint distribution. This enables principled, gradient-based training even with latent intermediate structures. We provide theoretical justification for our tractable optimization objective, proving that the optimization bias vanishes as the model learns type compliance. Empirically, TACs significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompt-optimization baselines. Gains are particularly pronounced on structured tasks, improving MGSM-SymPy from $57.1\%$ to $75.9\%$ for a 27B model, MGSM from $1.6\%$ to $27.3\%$ for a 7B model. TACs offers a robust and theoretically grounded paradigm for developing reliable, task-compliant LLM systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Building a generalized affordance grounding model to identify actionable regions on objects is vital for real-world applications. Existing methods to train the model can be divided into weakly and fully supervised ways. However, the former method requires a complex training framework design and can not infer new actions without an auxiliary prior. While the latter often struggle with limited annotated data and components trained from scratch despite being simpler. This study focuses on fully supervised affordance grounding and overcomes its limitations by proposing AffordanceSAM, which extends SAM's generalization capacity in segmentation to affordance grounding. Specifically, we design an affordance-adaption module and curate a coarse-to-fine annotated dataset called C2F-Aff to thoroughly transfer SAM's robust performance to affordance in a three-stage training manner. Experimental results confirm that AffordanceSAM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the AGD20K benchmark and exhibits strong generalized capacity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent progress in sparse attention mechanisms has demonstrated strong potential for reducing the computational cost of long-context training and inference in large language models (LLMs). Native Sparse Attention (NSA), a state-of-the-art approach, introduces natively trainable, hardware-aligned sparse attention that delivers substantial system-level performance gains while maintaining accuracy comparable to full attention. However, the kernel implementation of NSA relies on a query-grouping strategy that is efficient only with large Grouped Query Attention (GQA) sizes, whereas modern LLMs typically adopt much smaller GQA groups, which limits the applicability of this sparse algorithmic advance. In this work, we propose Flash Sparse Attention (FSA), which includes an alternative kernel design that enables efficient NSA computation across a wide range of popular LLMs with varied smaller GQA group sizes on modern GPUs. Compared to vanilla NSA kernel implementation, our empirical evaluation demonstrates that FSA achieves (i) up to 3.5$\times$ and on average 1.6$\times$ kernel-level latency reduction, (ii) up to 1.25$\times$ and 1.09$\times$ on average end-to-end training speedup on state-of-the-art LLMs, and (iii) up to 1.36$\times$ and 1.11$\times$ on average end-to-end prefill speedup on state-of-the-art LLMs. The source code is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/Relaxed-System-Lab/Flash-Sparse-Attention.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> High-quality mathematical and logical datasets with verifiable answers are essential for strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While recent data augmentation techniques have facilitated the creation of large-scale benchmarks, existing LLM-generated datasets often suffer from limited reliability, diversity, and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce PuzzleClone, a formal framework for synthesizing verifiable data at scale using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Our approach features three key innovations: (1) encoding seed puzzles into structured logical specifications, (2) generating scalable variants through systematic variable and constraint randomization, and (3) ensuring validity via a reproduction mechanism. Applying PuzzleClone, we construct a curated benchmark comprising over 83K diverse and programmatically validated puzzles. The generated puzzles span a wide spectrum of difficulty and formats, posing significant challenges to current state-of-the-art models. We conduct post training (SFT and RL) on PuzzleClone datasets. Experimental results show that training on PuzzleClone yields substantial improvements not only on PuzzleClone testset but also on logic and mathematical benchmarks. Post training raises PuzzleClone average from 14.4 to 56.2 and delivers consistent improvements across 7 logic and mathematical benchmarks up to 12.5 absolute percentage points (AMC2023 from 52.5 to 65.0).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for reconstructing 3D geometry of hand-held objects from monocular RGB images by leveraging hand-object interaction as geometric guidance. Our method conditions a latent diffusion model on an inpainted object appearance and uses inference-time guidance to optimize the object reconstruction, while simultaneously ensuring plausible hand-object interactions. Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive post-processing or produce low-quality reconstructions, our approach directly generates high-quality object geometry during the diffusion process by introducing guidance with an optimization-in-the-loop design. Specifically, we guide the diffusion model by applying supervision to the velocity field while simultaneously optimizing the transformations of both the hand and the object being reconstructed. This optimization is driven by multi-modal geometric cues, including normal and depth alignment, silhouette consistency, and 2D keypoint reprojection. We further incorporate signed distance field supervision and enforce contact and non-intersection constraints to ensure physical plausibility of hand-object interaction. Our method yields accurate, robust and coherent reconstructions under occlusion while generalizing well to in-the-wild scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The emergence of LM-based judging reward modeling, represented by generative reward models, has successfully made reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) efficient and scalable. To further advance this paradigm, we propose a core insight: this form of reward modeling shares fundamental formal consistency with natural language inference (NLI), a core task in natural language understanding. This reframed perspective points to a key path for building superior reward models: scaling the model's comprehension boundaries. Pursuing this path, exploratory experiments on NLI tasks demonstrate that the slot prediction masked language models (MLMs) incorporating contextual explanations achieve significantly better performance compared to mainstream autoregressive models. Based on this key finding, we propose ESFP-RM, a two-stage LM-based judging reward model that utilizes an explanation based slot framework for prediction to fully leverage the advantages of MLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that in both reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, the ESFP-RM framework delivers more stable and generalizable reward signals compared to generative reward models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing scientific research, they continue to struggle with core biological reasoning tasks essential for translational and biomedical discovery. To address this limitation, we created and curated eight comprehensive benchmark datasets comprising over 300,000 verifiable question-and-answer pairs, each targeting critical challenges in drug discovery including target druggability, modality suitability, and drug perturbation effects. Using this resource, we developed the OwkinZero models by post-training open-source LLMs through a Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards strategy. Our results demonstrate that specialized 8-32B OwkinZero models substantially outperform larger, state-of-the-art commercial LLMs on these biological benchmarks. Remarkably, we uncover evidence of a key aspect of generalization: specialist models trained on a single task consistently outperform their base models on previously unseen tasks. This generalization effect is further amplified in our comprehensive OwkinZero models, which were trained on a mixture of datasets and achieve even broader cross-task improvements. This study represents a significant step toward addressing the biological reasoning blind spot in current LLMs, demonstrating that targeted reinforcement learning on carefully curated data can unlock generalizable performance in specialized models, thereby accelerating AI-driven biological discovery.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to limited memory, lack of GPUs, and the complexity of existing runtimes. In this paper, we introduce TranSQL+, a template-based code generator that translates LLM computation graphs into pure SQL queries for execution in relational databases. Without relying on external libraries, TranSQL+, leverages mature database features, such as vectorized execution and out-of-core processing, for efficient inference. We further propose a row-to-column (ROW2COL) optimization that improves join efficiency in matrix operations. Evaluated on Llama3-8B and DeepSeekMoE models, TranSQL+ achieves up to 20x lower prefill latency and 4x higher decoding speed compared to DeepSpeed Inference and Llama.cpp in low-memory and CPU-only configurations. Our results highlight relational databases as a practical environment for LLMs on low-resource hardware.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In order to be widely applicable, speech-driven 3D head avatars must articulate their lips in accordance with speech, while also conveying the appropriate emotions with dynamically changing facial expressions. The key problem is that deterministic models produce high-quality lip-sync but without rich expressions, whereas stochastic models generate diverse expressions but with lower lip-sync quality. To get the best of both, we seek a stochastic model with accurate lip-sync. To that end, we develop a new approach based on the following observation: if a method generates realistic 3D lip motions, it should be possible to infer the spoken audio from the lip motion. The inferred speech should match the original input audio, and erroneous predictions create a novel supervision signal for training 3D talking head avatars with accurate lip-sync. To demonstrate this effect, we propose THUNDER (Talking Heads Under Neural Differentiable Elocution Reconstruction), a 3D talking head avatar framework that introduces a novel supervision mechanism via differentiable sound production. First, we train a novel mesh-to-speech model that regresses audio from facial animation. Then, we incorporate this model into a diffusion-based talking avatar framework. During training, the mesh-to-speech model takes the generated animation and produces a sound that is compared to the input speech, creating a differentiable analysis-by-audio-synthesis supervision loop. Our extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that THUNDER significantly improves the quality of the lip-sync of talking head avatars while still allowing for generation of diverse, high-quality, expressive facial animations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped our world with significant advancements in science, engineering, and society through applications ranging from scientific discoveries and medical diagnostics to Chatbots. Despite their ubiquity and utility, the underlying mechanisms of LLM remain concealed within billions of parameters and complex structures, making their inner architecture and cognitive processes challenging to comprehend. We address this gap by adopting approaches to understanding emerging cognition in biology and developing a network-based framework that links cognitive skills, LLM architectures, and datasets, ushering in a paradigm shift in foundation model analysis. The skill distribution in the module communities demonstrates that while LLMs do not strictly parallel the focalized specialization observed in specific biological systems, they exhibit unique communities of modules whose emergent skill patterns partially mirror the distributed yet interconnected cognitive organization seen in avian and small mammalian brains. Our numerical results highlight a key divergence from biological systems to LLMs, where skill acquisition benefits substantially from dynamic, cross-regional interactions and neural plasticity. By integrating cognitive science principles with machine learning, our framework provides new insights into LLM interpretability and suggests that effective fine-tuning strategies should leverage distributed learning dynamics rather than rigid modular interventions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> When large language model (LLM) systems interact with external data to perform complex tasks, a new attack, namely prompt injection, becomes a significant threat. By injecting instructions into the data accessed by the system, the attacker is able to override the initial user task with an arbitrary task directed by the attacker. To secure the system, test-time defenses, e.g., defensive prompting, have been proposed for system developers to attain security only when needed in a flexible manner. However, they are much less effective than training-time defenses that change the model parameters. Motivated by this, we propose DefensiveToken, a test-time defense with prompt injection robustness comparable to training-time alternatives. DefensiveTokens are newly inserted as special tokens, whose embeddings are optimized for security. In security-sensitive cases, system developers can append a few DefensiveTokens before the LLM input to achieve security with a minimal utility drop. In scenarios where security is less of a concern, developers can simply skip DefensiveTokens; the LLM system remains the same as there is no defense, generating high-quality responses. Thus, DefensiveTokens, if released alongside the model, allow a flexible switch between the state-of-the-art (SOTA) utility and almost-SOTA security at test time.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g., financial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve flexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells). These tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and answer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To automate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First, methods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured ones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like NL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of semi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To this end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured table question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the Hierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures complex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for constructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to guide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor decomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree operation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate pipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism: forward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward validation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from predicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of 764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables. Experiments show that ST-Raptor outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy. The code is available at https://github.com/weAIDB/ST-Raptor.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Prior work on large language model (LLM) hallucinations has associated them with model uncertainty or inaccurate knowledge. In this work, we define and investigate a distinct type of hallucination, where a model can consistently answer a question correctly, but a seemingly trivial perturbation, which can happen in real-world settings, causes it to produce a hallucinated response with high certainty. This phenomenon, which we dub CHOKE (Certain Hallucinations Overriding Known Evidence), is particularly concerning in high-stakes domains such as medicine or law, where model certainty is often used as a proxy for reliability. We show that CHOKE examples are consistent across prompts, occur in different models and datasets, and are fundamentally distinct from other hallucinations. This difference leads existing mitigation methods to perform worse on CHOKE examples than on general hallucinations. Finally, we introduce a probing-based mitigation that outperforms existing methods on CHOKE hallucinations. These findings reveal an overlooked aspect of hallucinations, emphasizing the need to understand their origins and improve mitigation strategies to enhance LLM safety.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Translating natural languages into sign languages is a highly complex and underexplored task. Despite growing interest in accessibility and inclusivity, the development of robust translation systems remains hindered by the limited availability of parallel corpora which align natural language with sign language data. Existing methods often struggle to generalize in these data-scarce environments, as the few datasets available are typically domain-specific, lack standardization, or fail to capture the full linguistic richness of sign languages. To address this limitation, we propose Advanced Use of LLMs for Sign Language Translation (AulSign), a novel method that leverages Large Language Models via dynamic prompting and in-context learning with sample selection and subsequent sign association. Despite their impressive abilities in processing text, LLMs lack intrinsic knowledge of sign languages; therefore, they are unable to natively perform this kind of translation. To overcome this limitation, we associate the signs with compact descriptions in natural language and instruct the model to use them. We evaluate our method on both English and Italian languages using SignBank+, a recognized benchmark in the field, as well as the Italian LaCAM CNR-ISTC dataset. We demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models in low-data scenario. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of AulSign, with the potential to enhance accessibility and inclusivity in communication technologies for underrepresented linguistic communities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scaling distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires not only algorithmic advances but also efficient utilization of heterogeneous hardware resources. While existing methods such as DiLoCo have demonstrated promising results, they often fail to fully exploit computational clusters under dynamic workloads. To address this limitation, we propose a three-stage method that combines Multi-Instance Training (MIT), Adaptive Batched DiLoCo, and switch mode mechanism. MIT allows individual nodes to run multiple lightweight training streams with different model instances in parallel and merge them to combine knowledge, increasing throughput and reducing idle time. Adaptive Batched DiLoCo dynamically adjusts local batch sizes to balance computation and communication, substantially lowering synchronization delays. Switch mode further stabilizes training by seamlessly introducing gradient accumulation once adaptive batch sizes grow beyond hardware-friendly limits. Together, these innovations improve both convergence speed and system efficiency. We also provide a theoretical estimate of the number of communications required for the full convergence of a model trained using our method.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficient equilibrium sampling of molecular conformations remains a core challenge in computational chemistry and statistical inference. Classical approaches such as molecular dynamics or Markov chain Monte Carlo inherently lack amortization; the computational cost of sampling must be paid in-full for each system of interest. The widespread success of generative models has inspired interest into overcoming this limitation through learning sampling algorithms. Despite performing on par with conventional methods when trained on a single system, learned samplers have so far demonstrated limited ability to transfer across systems. We prove that deep learning enables the design of scalable and transferable samplers by introducing Prose, a 280 million parameter all-atom transferable normalizing flow trained on a corpus of peptide molecular dynamics trajectories up to 8 residues in length. Prose draws zero-shot uncorrelated proposal samples for arbitrary peptide systems, achieving the previously intractable transferability across sequence length, whilst retaining the efficient likelihood evaluation of normalizing flows. Through extensive empirical evaluation we demonstrate the efficacy of Prose as a proposal for a variety of sampling algorithms, finding a simple importance sampling-based finetuning procedure to achieve superior performance to established methods such as sequential Monte Carlo on unseen tetrapeptides. We open-source the Prose codebase, model weights, and training dataset, to further stimulate research into amortized sampling methods and finetuning objectives.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Insights in tabular data capture valuable patterns that help analysts understand critical information. Organizing related insights into visual data stories is crucial for in-depth analysis. However, constructing such stories is challenging because of the complexity of the inherent relations between extracted insights. Users face difficulty sifting through a vast number of discrete insights to integrate specific ones into a unified narrative that meets their analytical goals. Existing methods either heavily rely on user expertise, making the process inefficient, or employ automated approaches that cannot fully capture their evolving goals. In this paper, we introduce InReAcTable, a framework that enhances visual data story construction by establishing both structural and semantic connections between data insights. Each user interaction triggers the Acting module, which utilizes an insight graph for structural filtering to narrow the search space, followed by the Reasoning module using the retrieval-augmented generation method based on large language models for semantic filtering, ultimately providing insight recommendations aligned with the user's analytical intent. Based on the InReAcTable framework, we develop an interactive prototype system that guides users to construct visual data stories aligned with their analytical requirements. We conducted a case study and a user experiment to demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of the InReAcTable framework and the prototype system for interactively building visual data stories.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reasoning and strategic behavior in social interactions is a hallmark of intelligence. This form of reasoning is significantly more sophisticated than isolated planning or reasoning tasks in static settings (e.g., math problem solving). In this paper, we present Strategic Planning, Interaction, and Negotiation (SPIN-Bench), a new multi-domain evaluation designed to measure the intelligence of strategic planning and social reasoning. While many existing benchmarks focus on narrow planning or single-agent reasoning, SPIN-Bench combines classical PDDL tasks, competitive board games, cooperative card games, and multi-agent negotiation scenarios in one unified framework. The framework includes both a benchmark as well as an arena to simulate and evaluate the variety of social settings to test reasoning and strategic behavior of AI agents. We formulate the benchmark SPIN-Bench by systematically varying action spaces, state complexity, and the number of interacting agents to simulate a variety of social settings where success depends on not only methodical and step-wise decision making, but also conceptual inference of other (adversarial or cooperative) participants. Our experiments reveal that while contemporary LLMs handle basic fact retrieval and short-range planning reasonably well, they encounter significant performance bottlenecks in tasks requiring deep multi-hop reasoning over large state spaces and socially adept coordination under uncertainty. We envision SPIN-Bench as a catalyst for future research on robust multi-agent planning, social reasoning, and human--AI teaming. Project Website: https://spinbench.github.io/

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video data, especially long-form video, is extremely dense and high-dimensional. Text-based summaries of video content offer a way to represent query-relevant content in a much more compact manner than raw video. In addition, textual representations are easily ingested by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), which enable reasoning over video content to answer complex natural language queries. To solve this issue, we rely on the progressive construction of a text-based memory by a video captioner operating on shorter chunks of the video, where spatio-temporal modeling is computationally feasible. We explore ways to improve the quality of the activity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video captions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to other information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene descriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding system relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer questions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the video into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more accurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we incorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA VLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the space of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we have successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action and scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning pipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks. Our model, controllable hybrid captioner, can alternate between different types of captions according to special input tokens that signals scene changes detected in the video.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text, yet they largely operate as reactive agents, responding only when directly prompted. This passivity creates an "awareness gap," limiting their potential as truly collaborative partners in dynamic human discussions. We introduce $\textit{DiscussLLM}$, a framework designed to bridge this gap by training models to proactively decide not just $\textit{what}$ to say, but critically, $\textit{when}$ to speak. Our primary contribution is a scalable two-stage data generation pipeline that synthesizes a large-scale dataset of realistic multi-turn human discussions. Each discussion is annotated with one of five intervention types (e.g., Factual Correction, Concept Definition) and contains an explicit conversational trigger where an AI intervention adds value. By training models to predict a special silent token when no intervention is needed, they learn to remain quiet until a helpful contribution can be made. We explore two architectural baselines: an integrated end-to-end model and a decoupled classifier-generator system optimized for low-latency inference. We evaluate these models on their ability to accurately time interventions and generate helpful responses, paving the way for more situationally aware and proactive conversational AI.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The combination of Transformer-based encoders with contrastive learning represents the current mainstream paradigm for sentence representation learning. This paradigm is typically based on the hidden states of the last Transformer block of the encoder. However, within Transformer-based encoders, different blocks exhibit varying degrees of semantic perception ability. From the perspective of interpretability, the semantic perception potential of knowledge neurons is modulated by stimuli, thus rational cross-block representation fusion is a direction worth optimizing. To balance the semantic redundancy and loss across block fusion, we propose a sentence representation selection mechanism S\textsuperscript{2}Sent, which integrates a parameterized nested selector downstream of the Transformer-based encoder. This selector performs spatial selection (SS) and nested frequency selection (FS) from a modular perspective. The SS innovatively employs a spatial squeeze based self-gating mechanism to obtain adaptive weights, which not only achieves fusion with low information redundancy but also captures the dependencies between embedding features. The nested FS replaces GAP with different DCT basis functions to achieve spatial squeeze with low semantic loss. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that S\textsuperscript{2}Sent achieves significant improvements over baseline methods with negligible additional parameters and inference latency, while highlighting high integrability and scalability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We use Magellan/MIKE echelle spectroscopy to conduct an in-depth chemodynamical analysis of the most luminous star-forming region within the metal-poor starburst dwarf galaxy CGCG 007-025. Leveraging the exceptional high resolution (R$\sim$50,000) and broad wavelength coverage, we apply Bayesian inference to simultaneously model the fluxes of 30 emission lines spanning the wavelength range 3400-9200\AA. Employing a two-region ionisation model, we characterise various gas properties including electron temperature, electron density, and chemical abundances across different elements. Our direct-method inferred metallicity yields $\rm 12+\log(O/H)=7.77\pm0.03$, placing the galaxy in the metal-poor regime. Furthermore, Metal-to-Oxygen ratios such as log(S/O), log(Ne/O) or log(Ar/O) are in full agreement with the values derived for the Milky Way, consistent with expectations from stellar evolutionary models. The brightest emission lines are kinematically complex, with modelling requiring up to four distinct components. The exceptional resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of the data unveil asymmetric and wide ($\sigma_{HeII} \approx$ 35km/s) HeII$\lambda$4686 emission. The flux ratio of this nebular line, together with the absence of other high ionisation species such as [NeV]$\lambda$3426, indicates the presence of fast radiative shocks. This dataset underscores the capability of echelle spectroscopy in delivering comprehensive chemodynamical analyses of starbursts in the Local Volume.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-augmented generation has achieved strong performance on knowledge-intensive tasks where query-document relevance can be identified through direct lexical or semantic matches. However, many real-world queries involve abstract reasoning, analogical thinking, or multi-step inference, which existing retrievers often struggle to capture. To address this challenge, we present DIVER, a retrieval pipeline designed for reasoning-intensive information retrieval. It consists of four components. The document preprocessing stage enhances readability and preserves content by cleaning noisy texts and segmenting long documents. The query expansion stage leverages large language models to iteratively refine user queries with explicit reasoning and evidence from retrieved documents. The retrieval stage employs a model fine-tuned on synthetic data spanning medical and mathematical domains, along with hard negatives, enabling effective handling of reasoning-intensive queries. Finally, the reranking stage combines pointwise and listwise strategies to produce both fine-grained and globally consistent rankings. On the BRIGHT benchmark, DIVER achieves state-of-the-art nDCG@10 scores of 45.8 overall and 28.9 on original queries, consistently outperforming competitive reasoning-aware models. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of reasoning-aware retrieval strategies in complex real-world tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work focuses on Hierarchical Inference (HI) in edge intelligence systems, where a compact Local-ML model on an end-device works in conjunction with a high-accuracy Remote-ML model on an edge-server. HI aims to reduce latency, improve accuracy, and lower bandwidth usage by first using the Local-ML model for inference and offloading to the Remote-ML only when the local inference is likely incorrect. A critical challenge in HI is estimating the likelihood of the local inference being incorrect, especially when data distributions and offloading costs change over time -- a problem we term Hierarchical Inference Learning (HIL). We introduce a novel approach to HIL by modeling the probability of correct inference by the Local-ML as an increasing function of the model's confidence measure, a structure motivated by empirical observations but previously unexploited. We propose two policies, HI-LCB and HI-LCB-lite, based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) framework. We demonstrate that both policies achieve order-optimal regret of $O(\log T)$, a significant improvement over existing HIL policies with $O(T^{2/3})$ regret guarantees. Notably, HI-LCB-lite has an $O(1)$ per-sample computational complexity, making it well-suited for deployment on devices with severe resource limitations. Simulations using real-world datasets confirm that our policies outperform existing state-of-the-art HIL methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a crucial role in network security defense. However, a significant challenge for IDS in training detection models is the shortage of adequately labeled malicious samples. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel semi-supervised framework \textbf{GANGRL-LLM}, which integrates Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance malicious code generation and SQL Injection (SQLi) detection capabilities in few-sample learning scenarios. Specifically, our framework adopts a collaborative training paradigm where: (1) the GAN-based discriminator improves malicious pattern recognition through adversarial learning with generated samples and limited real samples; and (2) the LLM-based generator refines the quality of malicious code synthesis using reward signals from the discriminator. The experimental results demonstrate that even with a limited number of labeled samples, our training framework is highly effective in enhancing both malicious code generation and detection capabilities. This dual enhancement capability offers a promising solution for developing adaptive defense systems capable of countering evolving cyber threats.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> User simulation is increasingly vital to develop and evaluate recommender systems (RSs). While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising avenues to simulate user behavior, they often struggle with the absence of specific domain alignment required for RSs and the efficiency demands of large-scale simulation. A vast yet underutilized resource for enhancing this alignment is the extensive user feedback inherent in RSs. However, directly leveraging such feedback presents two significant challenges. First, user feedback in RSs is often ambiguous and noisy, which negatively impacts effective preference alignment. Second, the massive volume of feedback largely hinders the efficiency of preference alignment, necessitating an efficient filtering mechanism to identify more informative samples. To overcome these hurdles, we introduce a novel data construction framework that leverages user feedback in RSs with advanced LLM capabilities to generate high-quality simulation data. Our framework unfolds in two key phases: (1) employing LLMs to generate cognitive decision-making processes on constructed simulation samples, reducing ambiguity in raw user feedback; (2) data distillation based on uncertainty estimation and behavior sampling to filter challenging yet denoised simulation samples. Accordingly, we fine-tune lightweight LLMs, as user simulators, using such high-quality dataset with corresponding decision-making processes. Extensive experiments verify that our framework significantly boosts the alignment with human preferences and in-domain reasoning capabilities of fine-tuned LLMs, and provides more insightful and interpretable signals when interacting with RSs. We believe our work will advance the RS community and offer valuable insights for broader human-centric AI research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces a vision of confidential prompting: securing user prompts from untrusted, cloud-hosted large language model (LLM) provider while preserving model confidentiality, output invariance, and compute efficiency. As a first step toward this vision, we present Obfuscated Secure Partitioned Decoding (OSPD), a system built on two key innovations. First, Secure Partitioned Decoding (SPD) isolates user prompts within per-user processes residing in a confidential virtual machine (CVM) on the cloud, which are inaccessible for the cloud LLM while allowing it to generate tokens efficiently. Second, Prompt Obfuscation (PO) introduces a novel cryptographic technique that enhances SPD resilience against advanced prompt reconstruction attacks. Together, these innovations ensure OSPD protects both prompt and model confidentiality while maintaining service functionality. OSPD enables practical, privacy-preserving cloud-hosted LLM inference for sensitive applications, such as processing personal data, clinical records, and financial documents.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are shown to be vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks where adversarial prompts are designed to elicit harmful responses. While existing defenses effectively mitigate single-turn attacks by detecting and filtering unsafe inputs, they fail against multi-turn jailbreaks that exploit contextual drift over multiple interactions, gradually leading LLMs away from safe behavior. To address this challenge, we propose a safety steering framework grounded in safe control theory, ensuring invariant safety in multi-turn dialogues. Our approach models the dialogue with LLMs using state-space representations and introduces a novel neural barrier function (NBF) to detect and filter harmful queries emerging from evolving contexts proactively. Our method achieves invariant safety at each turn of dialogue by learning a safety predictor that accounts for adversarial queries, preventing potential context drift toward jailbreaks. Extensive experiments under multiple LLMs show that our NBF-based safety steering outperforms safety alignment, prompt-based steering and lightweight LLM guardrails baselines, offering stronger defenses against multi-turn jailbreaks while maintaining a better trade-off among safety, helpfulness and over-refusal.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scaling-law has guided the language model designing for past years, however, it is worth noting that the scaling laws of NLP cannot be directly applied to RecSys due to the following reasons: (1) The amount of training samples and model parameters is typically not the bottleneck for the model. Our recommendation system can generate over 50 billion user samples daily, and such a massive amount of training data can easily allow our model parameters to exceed 200 billion, surpassing many LLMs (about 100B). (2) To ensure the stability and robustness of the recommendation system, it is essential to control computational complexity FLOPs carefully. Considering the above differences with LLM, we can draw a conclusion that: for a RecSys model, compared to model parameters, the computational complexity FLOPs is a more expensive factor that requires careful control. In this paper, we propose our milestone work, MARM (Memory Augmented Recommendation Model), which explores a new cache scaling-laws successfully.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Randomized trials are viewed as the benchmark for assessing causal effects of treatments on outcomes of interest. Nonetheless, challenges such as measurement error can undermine the standard causal assumptions for randomized trials. In ASPIRE, a cluster-randomized trial, pediatric primary care clinics were assigned to one of two treatments aimed at promoting clinician delivery of a secure firearm program to parents during well-child visits. A key outcome of interest is thus parent receipt of the program at each visit. Clinicians documented program delivery in patients' electronic health records for all visits, but their reporting is a proxy measure for the parent receipt outcome. Parents were also surveyed to report directly on program receipt after their child's visit; however, only a small subset of them completed the survey. Here, we develop a causal inference framework for a binary outcome that is subject to misclassification through silver-standard measures (clinician reports), but gold-standard measures (parent reports) are only available for a non-random internal validation subset. We propose a method for identifying the average treatment effect (ATE) that addresses the risk of bias due to misclassification and non-random validation selection, even when the outcome (parent receipt) may directly impact selection propensity (survey responsiveness). We show that ATE estimation relies on specifying the relationship between the gold- and silver-standard outcome measures in the validation subset, which may depend on treatment and covariates. Additionally, the clustered design is reflected in our causal assumptions and in our cluster-robust approach to estimation of the ATE. Simulation studies demonstrate acceptable finite-sample operating characteristics of our ATE estimator, supporting its application to ASPIRE.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid evolution of e-commerce has exposed the limitations of traditional product retrieval systems in managing complex, multi-turn user interactions. Recent advances in multimodal generative retrieval -- particularly those leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as retrievers -- have shown promise. However, most existing methods are tailored to single-turn scenarios and struggle to model the evolving intent and iterative nature of multi-turn dialogues when applied naively. Concurrently, test-time scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for improving large language model (LLM) performance through iterative inference-time refinement. Yet, its effectiveness typically relies on two conditions: (1) a well-defined problem space (e.g., mathematical reasoning), and (2) the model's ability to self-correct -- conditions that are rarely met in conversational product search. In this setting, user queries are often ambiguous and evolving, and MLLMs alone have difficulty grounding responses in a fixed product corpus. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel framework that introduces test-time scaling into conversational multimodal product retrieval. Our approach builds on a generative retriever, further augmented with a test-time reranking (TTR) mechanism that improves retrieval accuracy and better aligns results with evolving user intent throughout the dialogue. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent improvements, with average gains of 14.5 points in MRR and 10.6 points in nDCG@1.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformers are the de-facto choice for sequence modelling, yet their quadratic self-attention and weak temporal bias can make long-range forecasting both expensive and brittle. We introduce FreezeTST, a lightweight hybrid that interleaves frozen random-feature (reservoir) blocks with standard trainable Transformer layers. The frozen blocks endow the network with rich nonlinear memory at no optimisation cost; the trainable layers learn to query this memory through self-attention. The design cuts trainable parameters and also lowers wall-clock training time, while leaving inference complexity unchanged. On seven standard long-term forecasting benchmarks, FreezeTST consistently matches or surpasses specialised variants such as Informer, Autoformer, and PatchTST; with substantially lower compute. Our results show that embedding reservoir principles within Transformers offers a simple, principled route to efficient long-term time-series prediction.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in agentic applications highlights the need for robust safety guard models. While content safety in English is well-studied, non-English languages lack similar advancements due to the high cost of collecting culturally aligned labeled datasets. We present CultureGuard, a novel solution for curating culturally aligned, high-quality safety datasets across multiple languages. Our approach introduces a four-stage synthetic data generation and filtering pipeline: cultural data segregation, cultural data adaptation, machine translation, and quality filtering. This pipeline enables the conversion and expansion of the Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-V2 English safety dataset into eight distinct languages: Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Thai, and Chinese. The resulting dataset, Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-Multilingual-v1, comprises 386,661 samples in 9 languages and facilitates the training of Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Safety-Guard-Multilingual-8B-v1 via LoRA-based fine-tuning. The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several multilingual content safety benchmarks. We also benchmark the latest open LLMs on multilingual safety and observe that these LLMs are more prone to give unsafe responses when prompted in non-English languages. This work represents a significant step toward closing the safety gap in multilingual LLMs by enabling the development of culturally aware safety guard models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We test the impact of an evolving supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass scaling relation (Mbh-Mbulge) on the predictions for the gravitational wave background (GWB). The observed GWB amplitude is 2-3 times higher than predicted by astrophysically informed models which suggests the need to revise the assumptions in those models. We compare a semi-analytic model's ability to reproduce the observed GWB spectrum with a static versus evolving-amplitude Mbh-Mbulge relation. We additionally consider the influence of the choice of galaxy stellar mass function on the modeled GWB spectra. Our models are able to reproduce the GWB amplitude with either a large number density of massive galaxies or a positively evolving Mbh-Mbulge amplitude (i.e., the Mbh / Mbulge ratio was higher in the past). If we assume that the Mbh-Mbulge amplitude does not evolve, our models require a galaxy stellar mass function that implies an undetected population of massive galaxies (Mstellar > 10^11 Msun at z > 1). When the Mbh-Mbulge amplitude is allowed to evolve, we can model the GWB spectrum with all fiducial values and an Mbh-Mbulge amplitude that evolves as alpha(z) = alpha_0 (1 + z)^(1.04 +/- 0.5).

CMPhysBench is composed of more than 520 graduate-level meticulously curated questions covering both representative subfields and foundational theoretical frameworks of condensed matter physics, such as magnetism, superconductivity, strongly correlated systems, etc. To ensure a deep understanding of the problem-solving process,we focus exclusively on calculation problems, requiring LLMs to independently generate comprehensive solutions. Meanwhile, leveraging tree-based representations of expressions, we introduce the Scalable Expression Edit Distance (SEED) score, which provides fine-grained (non-binary) partial credit and yields a more accurate assessment of similarity between prediction and ground-truth. Our results show that even the best models, Grok-4, reach only 36 average SEED score and 28% accuracy on CMPhysBench, underscoring a significant capability gap, especially for this practical and frontier domain relative to traditional physics.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Judgmental forecasting employs human opinions to make predictions about future events, rather than exclusively historical data as in quantitative forecasting. When these opinions form an argumentative structure around forecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an argumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a property of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a forecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three evaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of enforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model (LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive with human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent predictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the practical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via crowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent intuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence property. This points to the need to integrate, within argumentation-based judgmental forecasting, mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions before obtaining group forecasting predictions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We study Bayesian inverse problems with mixed noise, modeled as a combination of additive and multiplicative Gaussian components. While traditional inference methods often assume fixed or known noise characteristics, real-world applications, particularly in physics and chemistry, frequently involve noise with unknown and heterogeneous structure. Motivated by recent advances in flow-based generative modeling, we propose a novel inference framework based on conditional flow matching embedded within an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to jointly estimate posterior samplers and noise parameters. To enable high-dimensional inference and improve scalability, we use simulation-free ODE-based flow matching as the generative model in the E-step of the EM algorithm. We prove that, under suitable assumptions, the EM updates converge to the true noise parameters in the population limit of infinite observations. Our numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of combining EM inference with flow matching for mixed-noise Bayesian inverse problems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> AI-generated content technologies are widely used in content creation. However, current AIGC systems rely heavily on creators' inspiration, rarely generating truly user-personalized content. In real-world applications such as online advertising, a single product may have multiple selling points, with different users focusing on different features. This underscores the significant value of personalized, user-centric creative generation. Effective personalized content generation faces two main challenges: (1) accurately modeling user interests and integrating them into the content generation process while adhering to factual constraints, and (2) ensuring high efficiency and scalability to handle the massive user base in industrial scenarios. Additionally, the scarcity of personalized creative data in practice complicates model training, making data construction another key hurdle. We propose HLLM-Creator, a hierarchical LLM framework for efficient user interest modeling and personalized content generation. During inference, a combination of user clustering and a user-ad-matching-prediction based pruning strategy is employed to significantly enhance generation efficiency and reduce computational overhead, making the approach suitable for large-scale deployment. Moreover, we design a data construction pipeline based on chain-of-thought reasoning, which generates high-quality, user-specific creative titles and ensures factual consistency despite limited personalized data. This pipeline serves as a critical foundation for the effectiveness of our model. Extensive experiments on personalized title generation for Douyin Search Ads show the effectiveness of HLLM-Creator. Online A/B test shows a 0.476% increase on Adss, paving the way for more effective and efficient personalized generation in industrial scenarios. Codes for academic dataset are available at https://github.com/bytedance/HLLM.

  Important Issues: A Comparative Study of Human and LLMs in the Context of AGI</h2>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As general-purpose artificial intelligence systems become increasingly integrated into society and are used for information seeking, content generation, problem solving, textual analysis, coding, and running processes, it is crucial to assess their long-term impact on humans. This research explores the sentiment of large language models (LLMs) and humans toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) using a Likert-scale survey. Seven LLMs, including GPT-4 and Bard, were analyzed and compared with sentiment data from three independent human sample populations. Temporal variations in sentiment were also evaluated over three consecutive days. The results show a diversity in sentiment scores among LLMs, ranging from 3.32 to 4.12 out of 5. GPT-4 recorded the most positive sentiment toward AGI, while Bard leaned toward a neutral sentiment. In contrast, the human samples showed a lower average sentiment of 2.97. The analysis outlines potential conflicts of interest and biases in the sentiment formation of LLMs, and indicates that LLMs could subtly influence societal perceptions. To address the need for regulatory oversight and culturally grounded assessments of AI systems, we introduce the Societal AI Alignment and Sentiment Benchmark (SAAS-AI), which leverages multidimensional prompts and empirically validated societal value frameworks to evaluate language model outputs across temporal, model, and multilingual axes. This benchmark is designed to guide policymakers and AI agencies, including within frameworks such as the EU AI Act, by providing robust, actionable insights into AI alignment with human values, public sentiment, and ethical norms at both national and international levels. Future research should further refine the operationalization of the SAAS-AI benchmark and systematically evaluate its effectiveness through comprehensive empirical testing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Concurrent separation logic with fractional permissions (CSLPerm) provides a promising reasoning system to verify most complex sequential and concurrent fine-grained programs. The logic with strong and weak separating conjunctions offers a solid foundation for producing concise and precise proofs. However, it lacks automation and compositionality support. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a compositional verification system for concurrent programs that manipulate regions of shared memory. The centre of our system is novel logical principles and an entailment procedure that can infer the residual heaps in the frame rule for a fragment of CSL-Perm with explicit arithmetical constraints for memory heaps' disjointness. This procedure enables the compositional reasoning for concurrent threads and function calls. We have implemented the proposal in a prototype tool called CoSl, tested it with 10 challenging concurrent programs, including those beyond the state-of-the-art, and confirmed the advantage of our approach.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Imagine decision-makers uploading data and, within minutes, receiving clear, actionable insights delivered straight to their fingertips. That is the promise of the AI Data Scientist, an autonomous Agent powered by large language models (LLMs) that closes the gap between evidence and action. Rather than simply writing code or responding to prompts, it reasons through questions, tests ideas, and delivers end-to-end insights at a pace far beyond traditional workflows. Guided by the scientific tenet of the hypothesis, this Agent uncovers explanatory patterns in data, evaluates their statistical significance, and uses them to inform predictive modeling. It then translates these results into recommendations that are both rigorous and accessible. At the core of the AI Data Scientist is a team of specialized LLM Subagents, each responsible for a distinct task such as data cleaning, statistical testing, validation, and plain-language communication. These Subagents write their own code, reason about causality, and identify when additional data is needed to support sound conclusions. Together, they achieve in minutes what might otherwise take days or weeks, enabling a new kind of interaction that makes deep data science both accessible and actionable.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in software engineering necessitates rigorous security evaluation of their generated code. However, existing benchmarks are inadequate, as they focus on isolated code snippets, employ unstable evaluation methods that lack reproducibility, and fail to connect the quality of input context with the security of the output. To address these gaps, we introduce A.S.E (AI Code Generation Security Evaluation), a benchmark for repository-level secure code generation. A.S.E constructs tasks from real-world repositories with documented CVEs, preserving full repository context like build systems and cross-file dependencies. Its reproducible, containerized evaluation framework uses expert-defined rules to provide stable, auditable assessments of security, build quality, and generation stability. Our evaluation of leading LLMs on A.S.E reveals three key findings: (1) Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieves the best overall performance. (2) The security gap between proprietary and open-source models is narrow; Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct attains the top security score. (3) Concise, ``fast-thinking'' decoding strategies consistently outperform complex, ``slow-thinking'' reasoning for security patching.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Model (LLM)-based passage expansion has shown promise for enhancing first-stage retrieval, but often underperforms with dense retrievers due to semantic drift and misalignment with their pretrained semantic space. Beyond this, only a portion of a passage is typically relevant to a query, while the rest introduces noise--an issue compounded by chunking techniques that break coreference continuity. We propose Coreference-Linked Augmentation for Passage Retrieval (CLAP), a lightweight LLM-based expansion framework that segments passages into coherent chunks, resolves coreference chains, and generates localized pseudo-queries aligned with dense retriever representations. A simple fusion of global topical signals and fine-grained subtopic signals achieves robust performance across domains. CLAP yields consistent gains even as retriever strength increases, enabling dense retrievers to match or surpass second-stage rankers such as BM25 + MonoT5-3B, with up to 20.68% absolute nDCG@10 improvement. These improvements are especially notable in out-of-domain settings, where conventional LLM-based expansion methods relying on domain knowledge often falter. CLAP instead adopts a logic-centric pipeline that enables robust, domain-agnostic generalization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of multi-step reasoning tasks. Recent work suggests that LLMs may perform planning - selecting a future target token in advance and generating intermediate tokens that lead towards it - rather than merely improvising one token at a time. However, existing studies assume fixed planning horizons and often focus on single prompts or narrow domains. To distinguish planning from improvisation across models and tasks, we present formal and causally grounded criteria for detecting planning and operationalize them as a semi-automated annotation pipeline. We apply this pipeline to both base and instruction-tuned Gemma-2-2B models on the MBPP code generation benchmark and a poem generation task where Claude 3.5 Haiku was previously shown to plan. Our findings show that planning is not universal: unlike Haiku, Gemma-2-2B solves the same poem generation task through improvisation, and on MBPP it switches between planning and improvisation across similar tasks and even successive token predictions. We further show that instruction tuning refines existing planning behaviors in the base model rather than creating them from scratch. Together, these studies provide a reproducible and scalable foundation for mechanistic studies of planning in LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We study the dust content of massive ($\log(M_*/M_{\odot})\geq10.8$) quiescent galaxies (QGs) at redshift $z=0.5-3$ to place constraints on the evolution of their cold interstellar medium (ISM), and thereby obtain insights on the processes of galaxy quenching throughout cosmic time. We use a robust sample of 458 colour-selected QGs covered by the A$^3$COSMOS+A$^3$GOODSS database to perform a stacking analysis in the $uv$-domain and measure their mean dust masses from their stacked submillimetre luminosities. We use the CIGALE SED-fitting code to obtain star formation histories and infer the time since quenching for all QGs in our sample. We use this information to gain insight on the time evolution of the dust content after quenching. Most QGs in our sample quenched around a redshift of $z\sim1.3$, following the peak of cosmic star formation. The majority of QGs observed at $z>1$ are recently quenched (i.e., quenched for no longer than $500\,$Myr), whereas the majority of QGs observed at $z<1$ have already been quenched for a significant amount of time ($\gtrsim1\,$Gyr). This implies that high-redshift galaxies ($z\gtrsim2$) are ideal for studying the mechanisms of quenching and its effects on the ISM, while lower-redshift galaxies are more suitable for studying the long-term effects of the QG environment on their ISM. We obtain upper limits on the dust mass fraction of the QG population, pointing towards lower dust content in high-redshift massive QGs than found by earlier stacking studies, and significantly lower (by a factor $\sim2-6$) than that of normal star forming galaxies. We also place constraints on the initial gas fraction right after quenching. We find that within the first $\sim600\,$Myr after quenching, QGs already lose on average $\gtrsim70\%$ of their cold ISM. Our findings support a gas consumption or removal scenario acting on short timescales.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose a direct optimization framework for learning reduced and sparse chemical reaction networks (CRNs) from time-series trajectory data. In contrast to widely used indirect methods-such as those based on sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy)-which infer reaction dynamics by fitting numerically estimated derivatives, our approach fits entire trajectories by solving a dynamically constrained optimization problem. This formulation enables the construction of reduced CRNs that are both low-dimensional and sparse, while preserving key dynamical behaviors of the original system. We develop an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm to efficiently solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem. Through illustrative examples, including a Drosophila circadian oscillator and a glycolytic oscillator, we demonstrate the ability of our method to recover accurate and interpretable reduced-order CRNs. Notably, the direct approach avoids the derivative estimation step and mitigates error accumulation issues inherent in indirect methods, making it a robust alternative for data-driven CRN realizations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Dermatological care via telemedicine often lacks the rich context of in-person visits. Clinicians must make diagnoses based on a handful of images and brief descriptions, without the benefit of physical exams, second opinions, or reference materials. While many medical AI systems attempt to bridge these gaps with domain-specific fine-tuning, this work hypothesized that mimicking clinical reasoning processes could offer a more effective path forward. This study tested seven vision-language models on medical visual question answering across six configurations: baseline models, fine-tuned variants, and both augmented with either reasoning layers that combine multiple model perspectives, analogous to peer consultation, or retrieval-augmented generation that incorporates medical literature at inference time, serving a role similar to reference-checking. While fine-tuning degraded performance in four of seven models with an average 30\% decrease, baseline models collapsed on test data. Clinical-inspired architectures, meanwhile, achieved up to 70\% accuracy, maintaining performance on unseen data while generating explainable, literature-grounded outputs critical for clinical adoption. These findings demonstrate that medical AI succeeds by reconstructing the collaborative and evidence-based practices fundamental to clinical diagnosis.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present a case study evaluating large language models (LLMs) with 128K-token context windows on a technical question answering (QA) task. Our benchmark is built on a user manual for an agricultural machine, available in English, French, and German. It simulates a cross-lingual information retrieval scenario where questions are posed in English against all three language versions of the manual. The evaluation focuses on realistic "needle-in-a-haystack" challenges and includes unanswerable questions to test for hallucinations. We compare nine long-context LLMs using direct prompting against three Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategies (keyword, semantic, hybrid), with an LLM-as-a-judge for evaluation. Our findings for this specific manual show that Hybrid RAG consistently outperforms direct long-context prompting. Models like Gemini 2.5 Flash and the smaller Qwen 2.5 7B achieve high accuracy (over 85%) across all languages with RAG. This paper contributes a detailed analysis of LLM performance in a specialized industrial domain and an open framework for similar evaluations, highlighting practical trade-offs and challenges.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper investigates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in formulating and solving decision-making problems using mathematical programming. We first conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of recent literature to assess how well LLMs understand, structure, and solve optimization problems across domains. The analysis is guided by critical review questions focusing on learning approaches, dataset designs, evaluation metrics, and prompting strategies. Our systematic evidence is complemented by targeted experiments designed to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in automatically generating optimization models for problems in computer networks. Using a newly constructed dataset, we apply three prompting strategies: Act-as-expert, chain-of-thought, and self-consistency, and evaluate the obtained outputs based on optimality gap, token-level F1 score, and compilation accuracy. Results show promising progress in LLMs' ability to parse natural language and represent symbolic formulations, but also reveal key limitations in accuracy, scalability, and interpretability. These empirical gaps motivate several future research directions, including structured datasets, domain-specific fine-tuning, hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches, modular multi-agent architectures, and dynamic retrieval via chain-of-RAGs. This paper contributes a structured roadmap for advancing LLM capabilities in mathematical programming.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models have demonstrated remarkable versatility across a wide range of natural language processing tasks and domains. One such task is Named Entity Recognition (NER), which involves identifying and classifying proper names in text, such as people, organizations, locations, dates, and other specific entities. NER plays a crucial role in extracting information from unstructured textual data, enabling downstream applications such as information retrieval from unstructured text.   Traditionally, NER is addressed using supervised machine learning approaches, which require large amounts of annotated training data. However, historical texts present a unique challenge, as the annotated datasets are often scarce or nonexistent, due to the high cost and expertise required for manual labeling. In addition, the variability and noise inherent in historical language, such as inconsistent spelling and archaic vocabulary, further complicate the development of reliable NER systems for these sources.   In this study, we explore the feasibility of applying LLMs to NER in historical documents using zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, which require little to no task-specific training data. Our experiments, conducted on the HIPE-2022 (Identifying Historical People, Places and other Entities) dataset, show that LLMs can achieve reasonably strong performance on NER tasks in this setting. While their performance falls short of fully supervised models trained on domain-specific annotations, the results are nevertheless promising. These findings suggest that LLMs offer a viable and efficient alternative for information extraction in low-resource or historically significant corpora, where traditional supervised methods are infeasible.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Genetic Improvement (GI) of software automatically creates alternative software versions that are improved according to certain properties of interests (e.g., running-time). Search-based GI excels at navigating large program spaces, but operates primarily at the syntactic level. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer semantic-aware edits, yet lack goal-directed feedback and control (which is instead a strength of GI). As such, we propose the investigation of a new research line on AI-powered GI aimed at incorporating semantic aware search. We take a first step at it by augmenting GI with the use of automated clustering of LLM edits. We provide initial empirical evidence that our proposal, dubbed PatchCat, allows us to automatically and effectively categorize LLM-suggested patches. PatchCat identified 18 different types of software patches and categorized newly suggested patches with high accuracy. It also enabled detecting NoOp edits in advance and, prospectively, to skip test suite execution to save resources in many cases. These results, coupled with the fact that PatchCat works with small, local LLMs, are a promising step toward interpretable, efficient, and green GI. We outline a rich agenda of future work and call for the community to join our vision of building a principled understanding of LLM-driven mutations, guiding the GI search process with semantic signals.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We detail the population properties of merging compact objects using 158 mergers from the cumulative Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 4.0, which includes three types of binary mergers: binary neutron star, neutron star--black hole binary, and binary black hole mergers. We resolve multiple over- and under-densities in the black hole mass distribution: features persist at primary masses of $10\,M_\odot$ and $35\,M_\odot$ with a possible third feature at $\sim 20\,M_\odot$. These are departures from an otherwise power-law-like continuum that steepens above $35\,M_\odot$. Binary black holes with primary masses near $10\,M_\odot$ are more likely to have less massive secondaries, with a mass ratio distribution peaking at $q = 0.74^{+0.13}_{-0.13}$, potentially a signature of stable mass transfer during binary evolution. Black hole spins are inferred to be non-extremal, with 90\% of black holes having $\chi < 0.57$, and preferentially aligned with binary orbits, implying many merging binaries form in isolation. However, we find a significant fraction, 0.24--0.42, of binaries have negative effective inspiral spins, suggesting many could be formed dynamically in gas-free environments. We find evidence for correlation between effective inspiral spin and mass ratio, though it is unclear if this is driven by variation in the mode of the distribution or the width. (Abridged)

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Version 4.0 of the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4.0) adds new candidates detected by the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA observatories through the first part of the fourth observing run (O4a: 2023 May 24 15:00:00 to 2024 January 16 16:00:00 UTC) and a preceding engineering run. In this new data, we find 128 new compact binary coalescence candidates that are identified by at least one of our search algorithms with a probability of astrophysical origin $p_{\rm astro} \geq 0.5$ and that are not vetoed during event validation. We also provide detailed source property measurements for 86 of these that have a false alarm rate $< 1 \rm{yr}^{-1}$. Based on the inferred component masses, these new candidates are consistent with signals from binary black holes and neutron star-black hole binaries (GW230518_125908 and GW230529_181500). Median inferred component masses of binary black holes in the catalog now range from $5.79\,M_\odot$ (GW230627_015337) to $137\,M_\odot$ (GW231123_135430), while GW231123_135430 was probably produced by the most massive binary observed in the catalog. For the first time we have discovered binary black hole signals with network signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 30, GW230814_230901 and GW231226_01520, enabling high-fidelity studies of the waveforms and astrophysical properties of these systems. Combined with the 90 candidates included in GWTC-3.0, the catalog now contains 218 candidates with $p_{\rm astro} \geq 0.5$ and not otherwise vetoed, doubling the size of the catalog and further opening our view of the gravitational-wave Universe.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC) is a collection of candidate gravitational-wave transient signals identified and characterized by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. Producing the contents of the GWTC from detector data requires complex analysis methods. These comprise techniques to model the signal; identify the transients in the data; evaluate the quality of the data and mitigate possible instrumental issues; infer the parameters of each transient; compare the data with the waveform models for compact binary coalescences; and handle the large amount of results associated with all these different analyses. In this paper, we describe the methods employed to produce the catalog's fourth release, GWTC-4.0, focusing on the analysis of the first part of the fourth observing run of Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo and KAGRA.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC) is a collection of short-duration (transient) gravitational wave signals identified by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration in gravitational-wave data produced by the eponymous detectors. The catalog provides information about the identified candidates, such as the arrival time and amplitude of the signal and properties of the signal's source as inferred from the observational data. GWTC is the data release of this dataset and version 4.0 extends the catalog to include observations made during the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run up until 2024 January 31. This paper marks an introduction to a collection of articles related to this version of the catalog, GWTC-4.0. The collection of articles accompanying the catalog provides documentation of the methods used to analyze the data, summaries of the catalog of events, observational measurements drawn from the population, and detailed discussions of selected candidates

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, stand out remarkable conversational abilities, enabling them to engage in dynamic and contextually relevant dialogues across a wide range of topics. However, given a long conversation, these chatbots fail to recall past information and tend to generate inconsistent responses. To address this, we propose to recursively generate summaries/ memory using large language models (LLMs) to enhance long-term memory ability. Specifically, our method first stimulates LLMs to memorize small dialogue contexts and then recursively produce new memory using previous memory and following contexts. Finally, the chatbot can easily generate a highly consistent response with the help of the latest memory. We evaluate our method on both open and closed LLMs, and the experiments on the widely-used public dataset show that our method can generate more consistent responses in a long-context conversation. Also, we show that our strategy could nicely complement both long-context (e.g., 8K and 16K) and retrieval-enhanced LLMs, bringing further long-term dialogue performance. Notably, our method is a potential solution to enable the LLM to model the extremely long context. The code and scripts are released.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems remains a core challenge of natural language processing (NLP), further complicated by the rise of large language models (LLMs) that aims to be general-purpose. Recently, large language models as judges (LLJs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional metrics, but their validity remains underexplored. This position paper argues that the current enthusiasm around LLJs may be premature, as their adoption has outpaced rigorous scrutiny of their reliability and validity as evaluators. Drawing on measurement theory from the social sciences, we identify and critically assess four core assumptions underlying the use of LLJs: their ability to act as proxies for human judgment, their capabilities as evaluators, their scalability, and their cost-effectiveness. We examine how each of these assumptions may be challenged by the inherent limitations of LLMs, LLJs, or current practices in NLG evaluation. To ground our analysis, we explore three applications of LLJs: text summarization, data annotation, and safety alignment. Finally, we highlight the need for more responsible evaluation practices in LLJs evaluation, to ensure that their growing role in the field supports, rather than undermines, progress in NLG.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Open-set few-shot hyperspectral image (HSI) classification aims to classify image pixels by using few labeled pixels per class, where the pixels to be classified may be not all from the classes that have been seen. To address the open-set HSI classification challenge, current methods focus mainly on distinguishing the unknown class samples from the known class samples and rejecting them to increase the accuracy of identifying known class samples. They fails to further identify or discovery the unknow classes among the samples. This paper proposes a prototype learning and clustering method for discoverying unknown classes in HSIs under the few-shot environment. Using few labeled samples, it strives to develop the ability of infering the prototypes of unknown classes while distinguishing unknown classes from known classes. Once the unknown class samples are rejected by the learned known class classifier, the proposed method can further cluster the unknown class samples into different classes according to their distance to the inferred unknown class prototypes. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, extensive experiments on four benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that our proposed method exhibits competitive performance in open-set few-shot HSI classification tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> User queries in real-world recommendation systems often combine structured constraints (e.g., category, attributes) with unstructured preferences (e.g., product descriptions or reviews). We introduce HyST (Hybrid retrieval over Semi-structured Tabular data), a hybrid retrieval framework that combines LLM-powered structured filtering with semantic embedding search to support complex information needs over semi-structured tabular data. HyST extracts attribute-level constraints from natural language using large language models (LLMs) and applies them as metadata filters, while processing the remaining unstructured query components via embedding-based retrieval. Experiments on a semi-structured benchmark show that HyST consistently outperforms tradtional baselines, highlighting the importance of structured filtering in improving retrieval precision, offering a scalable and accurate solution for real-world user queries.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large-scale models have exhibited remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, including automated medical services and intelligent customer support. However, as most large models are trained on single-modality corpora, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal signals remains a significant challenge. Current research often focuses on designing task-specific or scenario-specific tuning strategies, which limits the scalability and versatility. To address this limitation, we propose a unified framework that concurrently handles multiple tasks and modalities. In this framework, all modalities and tasks are represented as unified tokens and trained using a single, consistent approach. To enable efficient multitask processing, we introduce a novel tuning strategy termed neural tuning, inspired by the concept of sparse distributed representation in the human brain, where only specific subsets of neurons are activated for each task. Furthermore, to advance research in multimodal and multitask learning, we present a new benchmark, MMUD, which includes samples annotated with multiple task labels spanning reasoning segmentation, referring segmentation, image captioning, and text-to-image generation. By applying neural tuning to pretrained large models on the MMUD benchmark, we demonstrate the ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously in a streamlined and efficient manner. All models, code, and datasets will be released publicly upon publication, fostering further research and innovation in this field.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The proliferation of misinformation in digital platforms reveals the limitations of traditional detection methods, which mostly rely on static classification and fail to capture the intricate process of real-world fact-checking. Despite advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that enhance automated reasoning, their application to misinformation detection remains hindered by issues of logical inconsistency and superficial verification. In response, we introduce Debate-to-Detect (D2D), a novel Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework that reformulates misinformation detection as a structured adversarial debate. Inspired by fact-checking workflows, D2D assigns domain-specific profiles to each agent and orchestrates a five-stage debate process, including Opening Statement, Rebuttal, Free Debate, Closing Statement, and Judgment. To transcend traditional binary classification, D2D introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanism that assesses each claim across five distinct dimensions: Factuality, Source Reliability, Reasoning Quality, Clarity, and Ethics. Experiments with GPT-4o on two datasets demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods, and the case study highlight D2D's capability to iteratively refine evidence while improving decision transparency, representing a substantial advancement towards interpretable misinformation detection. The code will be released publicly after the official publication.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Real-world data, such as news articles, social media posts, and chatbot conversations, is inherently dynamic and non-stationary, presenting significant challenges for constructing real-time structured representations through knowledge graphs (KGs). Relation Extraction (RE), a fundamental component of KG creation, often struggles to adapt to evolving data when traditional models rely on static, outdated datasets. Continual Relation Extraction (CRE) methods tackle this issue by incrementally learning new relations while preserving previously acquired knowledge. This study investigates the application of pre-trained language models (PLMs), specifically large language models (LLMs), to CRE, with a focus on leveraging memory replay to address catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate decoder-only models (eg, Mistral-7B and Llama2-7B) and encoder-decoder models (eg, Flan-T5 Base) on the TACRED and FewRel datasets. Task-incremental fine-tuning of LLMs demonstrates superior performance over earlier approaches using encoder-only models like BERT on TACRED, excelling in seen-task accuracy and overall performance (measured by whole and average accuracy), particularly with the Mistral and Flan-T5 models. Results on FewRel are similarly promising, achieving second place in whole and average accuracy metrics. This work underscores critical factors in knowledge transfer, language model architecture, and KG completeness, advancing CRE with LLMs and memory replay for dynamic, real-time relation extraction.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Radio astronomy observations at frequencies below 10~MHz could provide valuable science, such as measuring the cosmic dark age signal in the redshifted 21~cm hydrogen absorption line, detecting exoplanetary auroral emissions which lead to inferences about magnetic fields and atmospheres, and characterizing the effects of solar wind and coronal mass ejections on the magnetospheres of solar system planets. Despite their value, few resolved measurements in the sub-10~MHz band have been made. At frequencies below 10~MHz, the Earth's ionosphere reflects, attenuates, and distorts radio waves, making radio astronomy in this band possible only from space. However, a space-borne array would need thousands of electrically-small antennas to reach the sensitivity required for detecting faint astronomical signals, and it would need to be positioned far from the Earth to reduce the impact of Earth-based radio interference. Using more efficient antennas would minimize the number needed, and using antennas that are more resilient to interference would reduce the required distance from Earth. To this end, we consider constructing a low frequency array out of vector sensor antennas. These advanced antennas consist of three orthogonal dipole and three orthogonal loop antennas with a common phase centre. Their benefits include direction-finding and polarimetric capabilities, but they have not been considered for this application previously. We show that vector sensors can provide four times more Fisher information during interferometry than tripoles, simpler antennas that are commonly considered for space applications. We also present an all-sky imaging simulation to demonstrate a spherical harmonic imaging technique.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Machine learning models for text classification are trained to predict a class for a given text. To do this, training and validation samples must be prepared: a set of texts is collected, and each text is assigned a class. These classes are usually assigned by human annotators with different expertise levels, depending on the specific classification task. Collecting such samples from scratch is labor-intensive because it requires finding specialists and compensating them for their work; moreover, the number of available specialists is limited, and their productivity is constrained by human factors. While it may not be too resource-intensive to collect samples once, the ongoing need to retrain models (especially in incremental learning pipelines) to address data drift (also called model drift) makes the data collection process crucial and costly over the model's entire lifecycle. This paper proposes several approaches to replace human annotators with Large Language Models (LLMs) to test classifier predictions for correctness, helping ensure model quality and support high-quality incremental learning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Code cloning is frequently observed in software development, often leading to a variety of maintenance and security issues. While substantial research has been conducted on code cloning in traditional software, to the best of my knowledge, there is a lack of studies on cloning in VR software that consider its unique nature, particularly the presence of numerous serialized files in conjunction with the source code. In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale quantitative empirical analysis of software clones in 345 open-source VR projects, using the NiCad detector for source code clone detection and large language models (LLMs) for identifying serialized file clones. Our study leads to a number of insights into cloning phenomena in VR software, guided by seven carefully formulated research questions. These findings, along with their implications, are anticipated to provide useful guidance for both researchers and software developers within the VR field.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision language model (VLM)-based mobile agents show great potential for assisting users in performing instruction-driven tasks. However, these agents typically struggle with personalized instructions -- those containing ambiguous, user-specific context -- a challenge that has been largely overlooked in previous research. In this paper, we define personalized instructions and introduce PerInstruct, a novel human-annotated dataset covering diverse personalized instructions across various mobile scenarios. Furthermore, given the limited personalization capabilities of existing mobile agents, we propose PerPilot, a plug-and-play framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that enables mobile agents to autonomously perceive, understand, and execute personalized user instructions. PerPilot identifies personalized elements and autonomously completes instructions via two complementary approaches: memory-based retrieval and reasoning-based exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that PerPilot effectively handles personalized tasks with minimal user intervention and progressively improves its performance with continued use, underscoring the importance of personalization-aware reasoning for next-generation mobile agents.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce a novel methodology for addressing systematic uncertainties in unbinned inclusive cross-section measurements and related collider-based inference problems. Our approach incorporates known analytic dependencies on parameters of interest, including signal strengths and nuisance parameters. When these dependencies are unknown, as is frequently the case for systematic uncertainties, dedicated neural network parametrizations provide an approximation that is trained on simulated data. The resulting machine-learned surrogate captures the complete parameter dependence of the likelihood ratio, providing a near-optimal test statistic. As a case study, we perform a first-principles inclusive cross-section measurement of $\textrm{H}\rightarrow\tau\tau$ in the single-lepton channel, utilizing simulated data from the FAIR Universe Higgs Uncertainty Challenge. Results in Asimov data, from large-scale toy studies, and using the Fisher information demonstrate significant improvements over traditional binned methods. Our computer code ``Guaranteed Optimal Log-Likelihood-based Unbinned Method'' (GOLLUM) for machine-learning and inference is publicly available.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Autonomous planetary exploration missions are critically dependent on real-time, accurate environmental perception for navigation and hazard avoidance. However, deploying deep learning models on the resource-constrained computational hardware of planetary exploration platforms remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces the Adaptive Quantized Planetary Crater Detection System (AQ-PCDSys), a novel framework specifically engineered for real-time, onboard deployment in the computationally constrained environments of space exploration missions. AQ-PCDSys synergistically integrates a Quantized Neural Network (QNN) architecture, trained using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), with an Adaptive Multi-Sensor Fusion (AMF) module. The QNN architecture significantly optimizes model size and inference latency suitable for real-time onboard deployment in space exploration missions, while preserving high accuracy. The AMF module intelligently fuses data from Optical Imagery (OI) and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) at the feature level, utilizing an Adaptive Weighting Mechanism (AWM) to dynamically prioritize the most relevant and reliable sensor modality based on planetary ambient conditions. This approach enhances detection robustness across diverse planetary landscapes. Paired with Multi-Scale Detection Heads specifically designed for robust and efficient detection of craters across a wide range of sizes, AQ-PCDSys provides a computationally efficient, reliable and accurate solution for planetary crater detection, a critical capability for enabling the next generation of autonomous planetary landing, navigation, and scientific exploration.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The ultimate goal of code agents is to solve complex tasks autonomously. Although large language models (LLMs) have made substantial progress in code generation, real-world tasks typically demand full-fledged code repositories rather than simple scripts. Building such repositories from scratch remains a major challenge. Fortunately, GitHub hosts a vast, evolving collection of open-source repositories, which developers frequently reuse as modular components for complex tasks. Yet, existing frameworks like OpenHands and SWE-Agent still struggle to effectively leverage these valuable resources. Relying solely on README files provides insufficient guidance, and deeper exploration reveals two core obstacles: overwhelming information and tangled dependencies of repositories, both constrained by the limited context windows of current LLMs. To tackle these issues, we propose RepoMaster, an autonomous agent framework designed to explore and reuse GitHub repositories for solving complex tasks. For efficient understanding, RepoMaster constructs function-call graphs, module-dependency graphs, and hierarchical code trees to identify essential components, providing only identified core elements to the LLMs rather than the entire repository. During autonomous execution, it progressively explores related components using our exploration tools and prunes information to optimize context usage. Evaluated on the adjusted MLE-bench, RepoMaster achieves a 110% relative boost in valid submissions over the strongest baseline OpenHands. On our newly released GitTaskBench, RepoMaster lifts the task-pass rate from 40.7% to 62.9% while reducing token usage by 95%. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available at https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/RepoMaster.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Through a series of experiments, we provide evidence that the GraphDOP model - trained solely on meteorological observations, using no prior knowledge - develops internal representations of the Earth System state, structure and dynamics as well as the characteristics of different observing systems. Firstly, we demonstrate that the network constructs a unified latent representation of the Earth System state which is common across different observation types. For example, cloud structures maintain physical consistency whether viewed in predictions for satellite radiances from different sensors, or for direct in-situ measurements of the cloud fraction. Secondly, we show examples that suggest that the network learns to emulate viewing effects - learned observation operators that map from the unified state representation to observed properties. Microwave sounder limb effects and geometric viewing effects, such as sunglint in visible imagery, are both well captured. Finally, we demonstrate that the model develops rich internal representations of the structure of meteorological systems and their dynamics. For instance, when the network is only provided with observations from a single infrared instrument, it is able to infer unobserved, non-local structures such as jet streams, surface pressure patterns and warm and cold air masses associated with synoptic systems. This work provides insights into how neural networks trained solely on observations of the Earth System spontaneously develop coherent internal representations of the physical world in order to meet the training objective - enhancing our understanding and guiding future development of these models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm for Adaptive Large Language Model (LLM) agents that eliminates the need for fine-tuning the underlying LLMs. Existing approaches are often either rigid, relying on static, handcrafted reflection workflows, or computationally intensive, requiring gradient updates of LLM model parameters. In contrast, our method enables low-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning. We formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP), equipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past experiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or non-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental feedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is achieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent model in the deep research setting, namely \emph{Memento}, which attains top-1 on GAIA validation ($87.88\%$ Pass@$3$) and $79.40\%$ on the test set. It reaches $66.6\%$ F1 and $80.4\%$ PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art training-based method, while case-based memory adds $4.7\%$ to $9.6\%$ absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks. Our approach offers a scalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of continuous, real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing machine learning towards open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite the advancements made in Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs), like text Large Language Models (LLMs), they have limitations in addressing questions that require real-time information or are knowledge-intensive. Indiscriminately adopting Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques is an effective yet expensive way to enable models to answer queries beyond their knowledge scopes. To mitigate the dependence on retrieval and simultaneously maintain, or even improve, the performance benefits provided by retrieval, we propose a method to detect the knowledge boundary of VLLMs, allowing for more efficient use of techniques like RAG. Specifically, we propose a method with two variants that fine-tune a VLLM on an automatically constructed dataset for boundary identification. Experimental results on various types of Visual Question Answering datasets show that our method successfully depicts a VLLM's knowledge boundary, based on which we are able to reduce indiscriminate retrieval while maintaining or improving the performance. In addition, we show that the knowledge boundary identified by our method for one VLLM can be used as a surrogate boundary for other VLLMs. Code will be released at https://github.com/Chord-Chen-30/VLLM-KnowledgeBoundary

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sample autocorrelograms typically come with significance bands (non-rejection regions) for the null hypothesis of no temporal correlation. These bands have two shortcomings. First, they build on pointwise intervals and suffer from joint undercoverage (overrejection) under the null hypothesis. Second, if this null is clearly violated one would rather prefer to see confidence bands to quantify estimation uncertainty. We propose and discuss both simultaneous significance bands and simultaneous confidence bands for time series and series of regression residuals. They are as easy to construct as their pointwise counterparts and at the same time provide an intuitive and visual quantification of sampling uncertainty as well as valid statistical inference. For regression residuals, we show that for static regressions the asymptotic variances underlying the construction of the bands are the same as those for observed time series, and for dynamic regressions (with lagged endogenous regressors) we show how they need to be adjusted. We study theoretical properties of simultaneous significance bands and two types of simultaneous confidence bands (sup-t and Bonferroni) and analyse their finite-sample performance in a simulation study. Finally, we illustrate the use of the bands in an application to monthly US inflation and residuals from Phillips curve regressions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Algorithmic discovery has traditionally relied on human ingenuity and extensive experimentation. Here we investigate whether a prominent scientific computing algorithm, the Kalman Filter, can be discovered through an automated, data-driven, evolutionary process that relies on Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) and Large Language Models (LLM). We evaluate the contributions of both modalities (CGP and LLM) in discovering the Kalman filter under varying conditions. Our results demonstrate that our framework of CGP and LLM-assisted evolution converges to near-optimal solutions when Kalman optimality assumptions hold. When these assumptions are violated, our framework evolves interpretable alternatives that outperform the Kalman filter. These results demonstrate that combining evolutionary algorithms and generative models for interpretable, data-driven synthesis of simple computational modules is a potent approach for algorithmic discovery in scientific computing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Handling outliers is a fundamental challenge in multivariate data analysis, as outliers may distort structures of correlation or conditional independence. Although robust Bayesian inference has been extensively studied for univariate settings, theoretical results ensuring posterior robustness in multivariate models are scarce. We propose a novel scale mixture of multivariate normals called correlation-intact sandwich mixture, where the scale parameters are real-valued and follow the unfolded log-Pareto distribution. Our theoretical results on posterior robustness in multivariate settings emphasizes that the use of a symmetric, super heavy-tailed distribution for the scale parameters is essential in achieving posterior robustness against element-wise contamination. Posterior inference for the proposed model is feasible by an efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm we developed. The superiority of the proposed method is illustrated further in simulation and empirical studies using graphical models and multivariate regression in the presence of complex outlier structures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> ACL configuration is essential for managing network flow reachability, yet its complexity grows significantly with topologies and pre-existing rules. To carry out ACL configuration, the operator needs to (1) understand the new configuration policies or intents and translate them into concrete ACL rules, (2) check and resolve any conflicts between the new and existing rules, and (3) deploy them across the network. Existing systems rely heavily on manual efforts for these tasks, especially for the first two, which are tedious, error-prone, and impractical to scale.   We propose Xumi to tackle this problem. Leveraging LLMs with domain knowledge of the target network, Xumi automatically and accurately translates the natural language intents into complete ACL rules to reduce operators' manual efforts. Xumi then detects all potential conflicts between new and existing rules and generates resolved intents for deployment with operators' guidance, and finally identifies the best deployment plan that minimizes the rule additions while satisfying all intents. Evaluation shows that Xumi accelerates the entire configuration pipeline by over 10x compared to current practices, addresses O(100) conflicting ACLs and reduces rule additions by ~40% in modern cloud network.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding how biomechanical reorganization governs key biological processes, such as morphogenesis and development, requires predictive insights into stress distributions and cellular behavior. While traditional approaches focused on cell motion as a response to stress, we demonstrate that Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) -- robust attractors and repellers in cellular flows -- precede and drive long-term intercellular stress reorganization, physically governed by the mechanical properties of intercellular junctions. We show that this hidden flow skeleton correlates strongly with biomechanical metrics, bridging microscopic cell motion with mesoscopic biomechanics. Specifically, attractors and repellers mark hotspots of compressive and tensile stress enrichment (exceeding tenfold), alongside heterogeneities in cell packing. Notably, these connections remain robust across varying strengths of cell-cell and cell-substrate force transmission. Finally, by linking the attracting regions in the flow skeleton to future cell extrusion spots, we establish a direct link between cell motion and biologically significant outcomes. Together, these findings establish a framework for using cell motion to independently infer biomechanical metrics and bridge the scale mismatch between cell motion and biomechanics, potentially offering a new route to interpret mechanosensitive biological processes directly from cell trajectories.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The development and application of large language models (LLM) have demonstrated that foundational models can be utilized to solve a wide array of tasks. However, their performance in multi-agent path finding (MAPF) tasks has been less than satisfactory, with only a few studies exploring this area. MAPF is a complex problem requiring both planning and multi-agent coordination. To improve the performance of LLM in MAPF tasks, we propose a novel framework, LLM-NAR, which leverages neural algorithmic reasoners (NAR) to inform LLM for MAPF. LLM-NAR consists of three key components: an LLM for MAPF, a pre-trained graph neural network-based NAR, and a cross-attention mechanism. This is the first work to propose using a neural algorithmic reasoner to integrate GNNs with the map information for MAPF, thereby guiding LLM to achieve superior performance. LLM-NAR can be easily adapted to various LLM models. Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing LLM-based approaches in solving MAPF problems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose a unified Transformer-based architecture for wireless signal processing tasks, offering a low-latency, task-adaptive alternative to conventional receiver pipelines. Unlike traditional modular designs, our model integrates channel estimation, interpolation, and demapping into a single, compact attention-driven architecture designed for real-time deployment. The model's structure allows dynamic adaptation to diverse output formats by simply modifying the final projection layer, enabling consistent reuse across receiver subsystems. Experimental results demonstrate strong generalization to varying user counts, modulation schemes, and pilot configurations, while satisfying latency constraints imposed by practical systems. The architecture is evaluated across three core use cases: (1) an End-to-End Receiver, which replaces the entire baseband processing pipeline from pilot symbols to bit-level decisions; (2) Channel Frequency Interpolation, implemented and tested within a 3GPP-compliant OAI+Aerial system; and (3) Channel Estimation, where the model infers full-band channel responses from sparse pilot observations. In all cases, our approach outperforms classical baselines in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. This work presents a deployable, data-driven alternative to hand-engineered PHY-layer blocks, and lays the foundation for intelligent, software-defined signal processing in next-generation wireless communication systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) excel in speed and adaptability across various reasoning tasks, but they often struggle when strict logic or constraint enforcement is required. In contrast, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are specifically designed for complex, step-by-step reasoning, although they come with significant computational costs and slower inference times. To address these trade-offs, we employ and generalize the SOFAI (Slow and Fast AI) cognitive architecture into SOFAI-LM, which coordinates a fast LLM with a slower but more powerful LRM through metacognition. The metacognitive module actively monitors the LLM's performance and provides targeted, iterative feedback with relevant examples. This enables the LLM to progressively refine its solutions without requiring the need for additional model fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on graph coloring and code debugging problems demonstrate that our feedback-driven approach significantly enhances the problem-solving capabilities of the LLM. In many instances, it achieves performance levels that match or even exceed those of standalone LRMs while requiring considerably less time. Additionally, when the LLM and feedback mechanism alone are insufficient, we engage the LRM by providing appropriate information collected during the LLM's feedback loop, tailored to the specific characteristics of the problem domain and leads to improved overall performance. Evaluations on two contrasting domains: graph coloring, requiring globally consistent solutions, and code debugging, demanding localized fixes, demonstrate that SOFAI-LM enables LLMs to match or outperform standalone LRMs in accuracy while maintaining significantly lower inference time.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) take sequences of subwords as input, requiring them to effective compose subword representations into meaningful word-level representations. In this paper, we present a comprehensive set of experiments to probe how LLMs compose subword information, focusing on three key aspects: structural similarity, semantic decomposability, and form retention. Our analysis of the experiments suggests that these five LLM families can be classified into three distinct groups, likely reflecting difference in their underlying composition strategies. Specifically, we observe (i) three distinct patterns in the evolution of structural similarity between subword compositions and whole-word representations across layers; (ii) great performance when probing layer by layer their sensitivity to semantic decompositionality; and (iii) three distinct patterns when probing sensitivity to formal features, e.g., character sequence length. These findings provide valuable insights into the compositional dynamics of LLMs and highlight different compositional pattens in how LLMs encode and integrate subword information.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Debiasing techniques such as SentDebias aim to reduce bias in large language models (LLMs). Previous studies have evaluated their cross-lingual transferability by directly applying these methods to LLM representations, revealing their limited effectiveness across languages. In this work, we therefore propose to perform debiasing in a joint latent space rather than directly on LLM representations. We construct a well-aligned cross-lingual latent space using an autoencoder trained on parallel TED talk scripts. Our experiments with Aya-expanse and two debiasing techniques across four languages (English, French, German, Dutch) demonstrate that a) autoencoders effectively construct a well-aligned cross-lingual latent space, and b) applying debiasing techniques in the learned cross-lingual latent space significantly improves both the overall debiasing performance and cross-lingual transferability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Theory of Mind (ToM)-the ability to reason about the mental states of oneself and others-is a cornerstone of human social intelligence. As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily life, understanding their ability to interpret and respond to human mental states is crucial for enabling effective interactions. In this paper, we review LLMs' ToM capabilities by analyzing both evaluation benchmarks and enhancement strategies. For evaluation, we focus on recently proposed and widely used story-based benchmarks. For enhancement, we provide an in-depth analysis of recent methods aimed at improving LLMs' ToM abilities. Furthermore, we outline promising directions for future research to further advance these capabilities and better adapt LLMs to more realistic and diverse scenarios. Our survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers interested in evaluating and advancing LLMs' ToM capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful method for optimizing black-box functions by combining prior knowledge with ongoing function evaluations. BO constructs a probabilistic surrogate model of the objective function given the covariates, which is in turn used to inform the selection of future evaluation points through an acquisition function. For smooth continuous search spaces, Gaussian Processes (GPs) are commonly used as the surrogate model as they offer analytical access to posterior predictive distributions, thus facilitating the computation and optimization of acquisition functions. However, in complex scenarios involving optimization over categorical or mixed covariate spaces, GPs may not be ideal. This paper introduces Simulation Based Bayesian Optimization (SBBO) as a novel approach to optimizing acquisition functions that only requires sampling-based access to posterior predictive distributions. SBBO allows the use of surrogate probabilistic models tailored for combinatorial spaces with discrete variables. Any Bayesian model in which posterior inference is carried out through Markov chain Monte Carlo can be selected as the surrogate model in SBBO. We demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of SBBO using various choices of surrogate models in applications involving combinatorial optimization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We live in a rich and varied acoustic world, which is experienced by individuals or communities as a soundscape. Computational auditory scene analysis, disentangling acoustic scenes by detecting and classifying events, focuses on objective attributes of sounds, such as their category and temporal characteristics, ignoring their effects on people, such as the emotions they evoke within a context. To fill this gap, we propose the affective soundscape captioning (ASSC) task, which enables automated soundscape analysis, thus avoiding labour-intensive subjective ratings and surveys in conventional methods. With soundscape captioning, context-aware descriptions are generated for soundscape by capturing the acoustic scenes (ASs), audio events (AEs) information, and the corresponding human affective qualities (AQs). To this end, we propose an automatic soundscape captioner (SoundSCaper) system composed of an acoustic model, i.e. SoundAQnet, and a large language model (LLM). SoundAQnet simultaneously models multi-scale information about ASs, AEs, and perceived AQs, while the LLM describes the soundscape with captions by parsing the information captured with SoundAQnet. SoundSCaper is assessed by two juries of 32 people. In expert evaluation, the average score of SoundSCaper-generated captions is slightly lower than that of two soundscape experts on the evaluation set D1 and the external mixed dataset D2, but not statistically significant. In layperson evaluation, SoundSCaper outperforms soundscape experts in several metrics. In addition to human evaluation, compared to other automated audio captioning systems with and without LLM, SoundSCaper performs better on the ASSC task in several NLP-based metrics. Overall, SoundSCaper performs well in human subjective evaluation and various objective captioning metrics, and the generated captions are comparable to those annotated by soundscape experts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The financial domain poses unique challenges for knowledge graph (KG) construction at scale due to the complexity and regulatory nature of financial documents. Despite the critical importance of structured financial knowledge, the field lacks large-scale, open-source datasets capturing rich semantic relationships from corporate disclosures. We introduce an open-source, large-scale financial knowledge graph dataset built from the latest annual SEC 10-K filings of all S and P 100 companies - a comprehensive resource designed to catalyze research in financial AI. We propose a robust and generalizable knowledge graph (KG) construction framework that integrates intelligent document parsing, table-aware chunking, and schema-guided iterative extraction with a reflection-driven feedback loop. Our system incorporates a comprehensive evaluation pipeline, combining rule-based checks, statistical validation, and LLM-as-a-Judge assessments to holistically measure extraction quality. We support three extraction modes - single-pass, multi-pass, and reflection-agent-based - allowing flexible trade-offs between efficiency, accuracy, and reliability based on user requirements. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the reflection-agent-based mode consistently achieves the best balance, attaining a 64.8 percent compliance score against all rule-based policies (CheckRules) and outperforming baseline methods (single-pass and multi-pass) across key metrics such as precision, comprehensiveness, and relevance in LLM-guided evaluations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Unified Structured Knowledge Reasoning (USKR) aims to answer natural language questions by using structured sources such as tables, databases, and knowledge graphs in a unified way. Existing USKR methods rely on task-specific strategies or bespoke representations, which hinder their ability to dismantle barriers between different SKR tasks, thereby constraining their overall performance in cross-task scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{Pandora}, a novel USKR framework that addresses the limitations of existing methods by leveraging two key innovations. First, we propose a code-based unified knowledge representation using \textsc{Python}'s \textsc{Pandas} API, which aligns seamlessly with the pre-training of LLMs. This representation facilitates a cohesive approach to handling different structured knowledge sources. Building on this foundation, we employ knowledge transfer to bolster the unified reasoning process of LLMs by automatically building cross-task memory. By adaptively correcting reasoning using feedback from code execution, \textsc{Pandora} showcases impressive unified reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on six widely used benchmarks across three SKR tasks demonstrate that \textsc{Pandora} outperforms existing unified reasoning frameworks and competes effectively with task-specific methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Question answering (QA) is an actively studied topic, being a core natural language processing (NLP) task that needs to be addressed before achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the lack of QA datasets in specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce MedQARo, the first large-scale medical QA benchmark in Romanian, alongside a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). We construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 102,646 QA pairs related to cancer patients. The questions regard medical case summaries of 1,011 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered correctly. MedQARo is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who spent a total of about 2,100 work hours to generate the QA pairs. We experiment with four LLMs from distinct families of models on MedQARo. Each model is employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one based on supervised fine-tuning. Our results show that fine-tuned models significantly outperform their zero-shot counterparts, clearly indicating that pretrained models fail to generalize on MedQARo. Our findings demonstrate the importance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for reliable clinical QA in Romanian. We publicly release our dataset and code at https://github.com/ana-rogoz/MedQARo.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While powerful, large language models (LLMs) present significant fine-tuning challenges due to their size. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA provide solutions, yet suffer from critical optimizer inefficiencies; notably basis redundancy in LoRA's $B$ matrix when using AdamW, which fundamentally limits performance. We address this by optimizing the $B$ matrix on the Stiefel manifold, imposing explicit orthogonality constraints that achieve near-perfect orthogonality and full effective rank. This geometric approach dramatically enhances parameter efficiency and representational capacity. Our Stiefel optimizer consistently outperforms AdamW across benchmarks with both LoRA and DoRA, demonstrating that geometric constraints are the key to unlocking LoRA's full potential for effective LLM fine-tuning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> 3D inpainting often relies on multi-view 2D image inpainting, where the inherent inconsistencies across different inpainted views can result in blurred textures, spatial discontinuities, and distracting visual artifacts. These inconsistencies pose significant challenges when striving for accurate and realistic 3D object completion, particularly in applications that demand high fidelity and structural coherence. To overcome these limitations, we propose ObjFiller-3D, a novel method designed for the completion and editing of high-quality and consistent 3D objects. Instead of employing a conventional 2D image inpainting model, our approach leverages a curated selection of state-of-the-art video editing model to fill in the masked regions of 3D objects. We analyze the representation gap between 3D and videos, and propose an adaptation of a video inpainting model for 3D scene inpainting. In addition, we introduce a reference-based 3D inpainting method to further enhance the quality of reconstruction. Experiments across diverse datasets show that compared to previous methods, ObjFiller-3D produces more faithful and fine-grained reconstructions (PSNR of 26.6 vs. NeRFiller (15.9) and LPIPS of 0.19 vs. Instant3dit (0.25)). Moreover, it demonstrates strong potential for practical deployment in real-world 3D editing applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce InternVL 3.5, a new family of open-source multimodal models that significantly advances versatility, reasoning capability, and inference efficiency along the InternVL series. A key innovation is the Cascade Reinforcement Learning (Cascade RL) framework, which enhances reasoning through a two-stage process: offline RL for stable convergence and online RL for refined alignment. This coarse-to-fine training strategy leads to substantial improvements on downstream reasoning tasks, e.g., MMMU and MathVista. To optimize efficiency, we propose a Visual Resolution Router (ViR) that dynamically adjusts the resolution of visual tokens without compromising performance. Coupled with ViR, our Decoupled Vision-Language Deployment (DvD) strategy separates the vision encoder and language model across different GPUs, effectively balancing computational load. These contributions collectively enable InternVL3.5 to achieve up to a +16.0\% gain in overall reasoning performance and a 4.05$\times$ inference speedup compared to its predecessor, i.e., InternVL3. In addition, InternVL3.5 supports novel capabilities such as GUI interaction and embodied agency. Notably, our largest model, i.e., InternVL3.5-241B-A28B, attains state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs across general multimodal, reasoning, text, and agentic tasks -- narrowing the performance gap with leading commercial models like GPT-5. All models and code are publicly released.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to provide helpful and harmless responses, yet they often exhibit sycophancy--conforming to user beliefs regardless of factual accuracy or ethical soundness. Prior research on sycophancy has primarily focused on single-turn factual correctness, overlooking the dynamics of real-world interactions. In this work, we introduce SYCON Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in multi-turn, free-form conversational settings. Our benchmark measures how quickly a model conforms to the user (Turn of Flip) and how frequently it shifts its stance under sustained user pressure (Number of Flip). Applying SYCON Bench to 17 LLMs across three real-world scenarios, we find that sycophancy remains a prevalent failure mode. Our analysis shows that alignment tuning amplifies sycophantic behavior, whereas model scaling and reasoning optimization strengthen the model's ability to resist undesirable user views. Reasoning models generally outperform instruction-tuned models but often fail when they over-index on logical exposition instead of directly addressing the user's underlying beliefs. Finally, we evaluate four additional prompting strategies and demonstrate that adopting a third-person perspective reduces sycophancy by up to 63.8% in debate scenario. We release our code and data at https://github.com/JiseungHong/SYCON-Bench.

Yet, whether the most popular Large Language Models (LLMs) possess proper knowledge the Chinese classifiers is an issue that has largely remain unexplored in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature.   To address such a question, we employ various masking strategies to evaluate the LLMs' intrinsic ability, the contribution of different sentence elements, and the working of the attention mechanisms during prediction. Besides, we explore fine-tuning for LLMs to enhance the classifier performance.   Our findings reveal that LLMs perform worse than BERT, even with fine-tuning. The prediction, as expected, greatly benefits from the information about the following noun, which also explains the advantage of models with a bidirectional attention mechanism such as BERT.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) has proven to be a tool that could help in the automatic detection of sexism. Previous studies have shown that these models contain biases that do not accurately reflect reality, especially for minority groups. Despite various efforts to improve the detection of sexist content, this task remains a significant challenge due to its subjective nature and the biases present in automated models. We explore the capabilities of different LLMs to detect sexism in social media text using the EXIST 2024 tweet dataset. It includes annotations from six distinct profiles for each tweet, allowing us to evaluate to what extent LLMs can mimic these groups' perceptions in sexism detection. Additionally, we analyze the demographic biases present in the models and conduct a statistical analysis to identify which demographic characteristics (age, gender) contribute most effectively to this task. Our results show that, while LLMs can to some extent detect sexism when considering the overall opinion of populations, they do not accurately replicate the diversity of perceptions among different demographic groups. This highlights the need for better-calibrated models that account for the diversity of perspectives across different populations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reliably composing Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex, multi-step workflows remains a significant challenge. The dominant paradigm-optimizing discrete prompts in a pipeline-is notoriously brittle and struggles to enforce the formal compliance required for structured tasks. We introduce Type-Compliant Adaptation Cascades (TACs), a framework that recasts workflow adaptation as learning typed probabilistic programs. TACs treats the entire workflow, which is composed of parameter-efficiently adapted LLMs and deterministic logic, as an unnormalized joint distribution. This enables principled, gradient-based training even with latent intermediate structures. We provide theoretical justification for our tractable optimization objective, proving that the optimization bias vanishes as the model learns type compliance. Empirically, TACs significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompt-optimization baselines. Gains are particularly pronounced on structured tasks, improving MGSM-SymPy from $57.1\%$ to $75.9\%$ for a 27B model, MGSM from $1.6\%$ to $27.3\%$ for a 7B model. TACs offers a robust and theoretically grounded paradigm for developing reliable, task-compliant LLM systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent progress in sparse attention mechanisms has demonstrated strong potential for reducing the computational cost of long-context training and inference in large language models (LLMs). Native Sparse Attention (NSA), a state-of-the-art approach, introduces natively trainable, hardware-aligned sparse attention that delivers substantial system-level performance gains while maintaining accuracy comparable to full attention. However, the kernel implementation of NSA relies on a query-grouping strategy that is efficient only with large Grouped Query Attention (GQA) sizes, whereas modern LLMs typically adopt much smaller GQA groups, which limits the applicability of this sparse algorithmic advance. In this work, we propose Flash Sparse Attention (FSA), which includes an alternative kernel design that enables efficient NSA computation across a wide range of popular LLMs with varied smaller GQA group sizes on modern GPUs. Compared to vanilla NSA kernel implementation, our empirical evaluation demonstrates that FSA achieves (i) up to 3.5$\times$ and on average 1.6$\times$ kernel-level latency reduction, (ii) up to 1.25$\times$ and 1.09$\times$ on average end-to-end training speedup on state-of-the-art LLMs, and (iii) up to 1.36$\times$ and 1.11$\times$ on average end-to-end prefill speedup on state-of-the-art LLMs. The source code is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/Relaxed-System-Lab/Flash-Sparse-Attention.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> High-quality mathematical and logical datasets with verifiable answers are essential for strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While recent data augmentation techniques have facilitated the creation of large-scale benchmarks, existing LLM-generated datasets often suffer from limited reliability, diversity, and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce PuzzleClone, a formal framework for synthesizing verifiable data at scale using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Our approach features three key innovations: (1) encoding seed puzzles into structured logical specifications, (2) generating scalable variants through systematic variable and constraint randomization, and (3) ensuring validity via a reproduction mechanism. Applying PuzzleClone, we construct a curated benchmark comprising over 83K diverse and programmatically validated puzzles. The generated puzzles span a wide spectrum of difficulty and formats, posing significant challenges to current state-of-the-art models. We conduct post training (SFT and RL) on PuzzleClone datasets. Experimental results show that training on PuzzleClone yields substantial improvements not only on PuzzleClone testset but also on logic and mathematical benchmarks. Post training raises PuzzleClone average from 14.4 to 56.2 and delivers consistent improvements across 7 logic and mathematical benchmarks up to 12.5 absolute percentage points (AMC2023 from 52.5 to 65.0). Our code and data are available at https://github.com/HiThink-Research/PuzzleClone.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The scalable computing revolution of the late '80s through mid- '00s forged a new technical and economic model for computing that delivered massive societal impact, but its economic benefit has driven scalability to sizes that are now exhausting the energy grid's capacity. Our time demands a new revolution in scalable energy, mirroring in key ways the scalable computing revolution; e.g., compelling economic forces, use of mass-market components, overcoming foibles of those components, judicious use of physical locality, and the the difficult integration into an effective system. The offgrid AI approach closely fits this mold, combining local mostly renewable generation and storage to power an AI data center, starting offgrid. Obstacles to delivering this approach are social, technical, and project, but the potential is massive. I argue that the offgrid-AI approach needs pioneers among both system developers and AI-data-center operators to move it quickly from concept to large-scale deployment.

  Dialogue Generation</h2>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Synthetic transcript generation is critical in contact center domains, where privacy and data scarcity limit model training and evaluation. Unlike prior synthetic dialogue generation work on open-domain or medical dialogues, contact center conversations are goal-oriented, role-asymmetric, and behaviorally complex, featuring disfluencies, ASR noise, and compliance-driven agent actions. In deployments where transcripts are unavailable, standard pipelines still yield derived call attributes such as Intent Summaries, Topic Flow, and QA Evaluation Forms. We leverage these as supervision signals to guide generation. To assess the quality of such outputs, we introduce a diagnostic framework of 18 linguistically and behaviorally grounded metrics for comparing real and synthetic transcripts. We benchmark four language-agnostic generation strategies, from simple prompting to characteristic-aware multi-stage approaches, alongside reference-free baselines. Results reveal persistent challenges: no method excels across all traits, with notable deficits in disfluency, sentiment, and behavioral realism. Our diagnostic tool exposes these gaps, enabling fine-grained evaluation and stress testing of synthetic dialogue across languages.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing scientific research, they continue to struggle with core biological reasoning tasks essential for translational and biomedical discovery. To address this limitation, we created and curated eight comprehensive benchmark datasets comprising over 300,000 verifiable question-and-answer pairs, each targeting critical challenges in drug discovery including target druggability, modality suitability, and drug perturbation effects. Using this resource, we developed the OwkinZero models by post-training open-source LLMs through a Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards strategy. Our results demonstrate that specialized 8-32B OwkinZero models substantially outperform larger, state-of-the-art commercial LLMs on these biological benchmarks. Remarkably, we uncover evidence of a key aspect of generalization: specialist models trained on a single task consistently outperform their base models on previously unseen tasks. This generalization effect is further amplified in our comprehensive OwkinZero models, which were trained on a mixture of datasets and achieve even broader cross-task improvements. This study represents a significant step toward addressing the biological reasoning blind spot in current LLMs, demonstrating that targeted reinforcement learning on carefully curated data can unlock generalizable performance in specialized models, thereby accelerating AI-driven biological discovery.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to limited memory, lack of GPUs, and the complexity of existing runtimes. In this paper, we introduce TranSQL+, a template-based code generator that translates LLM computation graphs into pure SQL queries for execution in relational databases. Without relying on external libraries, TranSQL+, leverages mature database features, such as vectorized execution and out-of-core processing, for efficient inference. We further propose a row-to-column (ROW2COL) optimization that improves join efficiency in matrix operations. Evaluated on Llama3-8B and DeepSeekMoE models, TranSQL+ achieves up to 20x lower prefill latency and 4x higher decoding speed compared to DeepSpeed Inference and Llama.cpp in low-memory and CPU-only configurations. Our results highlight relational databases as a practical environment for LLMs on low-resource hardware.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped our world with significant advancements in science, engineering, and society through applications ranging from scientific discoveries and medical diagnostics to Chatbots. Despite their ubiquity and utility, the underlying mechanisms of LLM remain concealed within billions of parameters and complex structures, making their inner architecture and cognitive processes challenging to comprehend. We address this gap by adopting approaches to understanding emerging cognition in biology and developing a network-based framework that links cognitive skills, LLM architectures, and datasets, ushering in a paradigm shift in foundation model analysis. The skill distribution in the module communities demonstrates that while LLMs do not strictly parallel the focalized specialization observed in specific biological systems, they exhibit unique communities of modules whose emergent skill patterns partially mirror the distributed yet interconnected cognitive organization seen in avian and small mammalian brains. Our numerical results highlight a key divergence from biological systems to LLMs, where skill acquisition benefits substantially from dynamic, cross-regional interactions and neural plasticity. By integrating cognitive science principles with machine learning, our framework provides new insights into LLM interpretability and suggests that effective fine-tuning strategies should leverage distributed learning dynamics rather than rigid modular interventions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> When large language model (LLM) systems interact with external data to perform complex tasks, a new attack, namely prompt injection, becomes a significant threat. By injecting instructions into the data accessed by the system, the attacker is able to override the initial user task with an arbitrary task directed by the attacker. To secure the system, test-time defenses, e.g., defensive prompting, have been proposed for system developers to attain security only when needed in a flexible manner. However, they are much less effective than training-time defenses that change the model parameters. Motivated by this, we propose DefensiveToken, a test-time defense with prompt injection robustness comparable to training-time alternatives. DefensiveTokens are newly inserted as special tokens, whose embeddings are optimized for security. In security-sensitive cases, system developers can append a few DefensiveTokens before the LLM input to achieve security with a minimal utility drop. In scenarios where security is less of a concern, developers can simply skip DefensiveTokens; the LLM system remains the same as there is no defense, generating high-quality responses. Thus, DefensiveTokens, if released alongside the model, allow a flexible switch between the state-of-the-art (SOTA) utility and almost-SOTA security at test time.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g., financial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve flexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells). These tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and answer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To automate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First, methods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured ones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like NL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of semi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To this end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured table question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the Hierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures complex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for constructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to guide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor decomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree operation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate pipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism: forward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward validation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from predicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of 764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables. Experiments show that ST-Raptor outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy. The code is available at https://github.com/weAIDB/ST-Raptor.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Prior work on large language model (LLM) hallucinations has associated them with model uncertainty or inaccurate knowledge. In this work, we define and investigate a distinct type of hallucination, where a model can consistently answer a question correctly, but a seemingly trivial perturbation, which can happen in real-world settings, causes it to produce a hallucinated response with high certainty. This phenomenon, which we dub CHOKE (Certain Hallucinations Overriding Known Evidence), is particularly concerning in high-stakes domains such as medicine or law, where model certainty is often used as a proxy for reliability. We show that CHOKE examples are consistent across prompts, occur in different models and datasets, and are fundamentally distinct from other hallucinations. This difference leads existing mitigation methods to perform worse on CHOKE examples than on general hallucinations. Finally, we introduce a probing-based mitigation that outperforms existing methods on CHOKE hallucinations. These findings reveal an overlooked aspect of hallucinations, emphasizing the need to understand their origins and improve mitigation strategies to enhance LLM safety.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep learning has transformed computer vision (CV), achieving outstanding performance in classification, segmentation, and related tasks. Such AI-based CV systems are becoming prevalent, with applications spanning from medical imaging to surveillance. State of the art models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) are often regarded as ``black boxes,'' offering limited transparency into their decision-making processes. Despite a recent advancement in explainable AI (XAI), explainability remains underutilized in practical CV deployments. A primary obstacle is the absence of integrated software solutions that connect XAI techniques with robust knowledge management and monitoring frameworks. To close this gap, we have developed Obz AI, a comprehensive software ecosystem designed to facilitate state-of-the-art explainability and observability for vision AI systems. Obz AI provides a seamless integration pipeline, from a Python client library to a full-stack analytics dashboard. With Obz AI, a machine learning engineer can easily incorporate advanced XAI methodologies, extract and analyze features for outlier detection, and continuously monitor AI models in real time. By making the decision-making mechanisms of deep models interpretable, Obz AI promotes observability and responsible deployment of computer vision systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Translating natural languages into sign languages is a highly complex and underexplored task. Despite growing interest in accessibility and inclusivity, the development of robust translation systems remains hindered by the limited availability of parallel corpora which align natural language with sign language data. Existing methods often struggle to generalize in these data-scarce environments, as the few datasets available are typically domain-specific, lack standardization, or fail to capture the full linguistic richness of sign languages. To address this limitation, we propose Advanced Use of LLMs for Sign Language Translation (AulSign), a novel method that leverages Large Language Models via dynamic prompting and in-context learning with sample selection and subsequent sign association. Despite their impressive abilities in processing text, LLMs lack intrinsic knowledge of sign languages; therefore, they are unable to natively perform this kind of translation. To overcome this limitation, we associate the signs with compact descriptions in natural language and instruct the model to use them. We evaluate our method on both English and Italian languages using SignBank+, a recognized benchmark in the field, as well as the Italian LaCAM CNR-ISTC dataset. We demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models in low-data scenario. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of AulSign, with the potential to enhance accessibility and inclusivity in communication technologies for underrepresented linguistic communities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scaling distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires not only algorithmic advances but also efficient utilization of heterogeneous hardware resources. While existing methods such as DiLoCo have demonstrated promising results, they often fail to fully exploit computational clusters under dynamic workloads. To address this limitation, we propose a three-stage method that combines Multi-Instance Training (MIT), Adaptive Batched DiLoCo, and switch mode mechanism. MIT allows individual nodes to run multiple lightweight training streams with different model instances in parallel and merge them to combine knowledge, increasing throughput and reducing idle time. Adaptive Batched DiLoCo dynamically adjusts local batch sizes to balance computation and communication, substantially lowering synchronization delays. Switch mode further stabilizes training by seamlessly introducing gradient accumulation once adaptive batch sizes grow beyond hardware-friendly limits. Together, these innovations improve both convergence speed and system efficiency. We also provide a theoretical estimate of the number of communications required for the full convergence of a model trained using our method.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While large pre-trained models have achieved impressive performance across AI tasks, their deployment in privacy-sensitive and distributed environments remains challenging. Federated learning (FL) offers a viable solution by enabling decentralized fine-tuning without data sharing, but real-world applications face significant obstacles due to heterogeneous client resources in compute and memory. To address this, we propose HeteroTune, a novel federated fine-tuning paradigm for large, heterogeneous models operating under limited communication and computation budgets. The core of our method lies in a novel architecture, DeMA (Dense Mixture of Adapters), which enables flexible and efficient aggregation of heterogeneous models by preserving their full representational capacity while facilitating seamless cross-model knowledge fusion. We further introduce CMGA (Cross-Model Gradient Alignment), a lightweight yet effective mechanism that enhances training stability by harmonizing gradient directions across heterogeneous client models during aggregation, mitigating update conflicts and promoting more consistent convergence in federated settings. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence showing that HeteroTune achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency across diverse tasks and model architectures. For example, on LLaMA models, it reduces communication overhead by 99.5%, cuts peak memory usage by ~50%, and improves performance by 4.61%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Insights in tabular data capture valuable patterns that help analysts understand critical information. Organizing related insights into visual data stories is crucial for in-depth analysis. However, constructing such stories is challenging because of the complexity of the inherent relations between extracted insights. Users face difficulty sifting through a vast number of discrete insights to integrate specific ones into a unified narrative that meets their analytical goals. Existing methods either heavily rely on user expertise, making the process inefficient, or employ automated approaches that cannot fully capture their evolving goals. In this paper, we introduce InReAcTable, a framework that enhances visual data story construction by establishing both structural and semantic connections between data insights. Each user interaction triggers the Acting module, which utilizes an insight graph for structural filtering to narrow the search space, followed by the Reasoning module using the retrieval-augmented generation method based on large language models for semantic filtering, ultimately providing insight recommendations aligned with the user's analytical intent. Based on the InReAcTable framework, we develop an interactive prototype system that guides users to construct visual data stories aligned with their analytical requirements. We conducted a case study and a user experiment to demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of the InReAcTable framework and the prototype system for interactively building visual data stories.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reasoning and strategic behavior in social interactions is a hallmark of intelligence. This form of reasoning is significantly more sophisticated than isolated planning or reasoning tasks in static settings (e.g., math problem solving). In this paper, we present Strategic Planning, Interaction, and Negotiation (SPIN-Bench), a new multi-domain evaluation designed to measure the intelligence of strategic planning and social reasoning. While many existing benchmarks focus on narrow planning or single-agent reasoning, SPIN-Bench combines classical PDDL tasks, competitive board games, cooperative card games, and multi-agent negotiation scenarios in one unified framework. The framework includes both a benchmark as well as an arena to simulate and evaluate the variety of social settings to test reasoning and strategic behavior of AI agents. We formulate the benchmark SPIN-Bench by systematically varying action spaces, state complexity, and the number of interacting agents to simulate a variety of social settings where success depends on not only methodical and step-wise decision making, but also conceptual inference of other (adversarial or cooperative) participants. Our experiments reveal that while contemporary LLMs handle basic fact retrieval and short-range planning reasonably well, they encounter significant performance bottlenecks in tasks requiring deep multi-hop reasoning over large state spaces and socially adept coordination under uncertainty. We envision SPIN-Bench as a catalyst for future research on robust multi-agent planning, social reasoning, and human--AI teaming. Project Website: https://spinbench.github.io/

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video data, especially long-form video, is extremely dense and high-dimensional. Text-based summaries of video content offer a way to represent query-relevant content in a much more compact manner than raw video. In addition, textual representations are easily ingested by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), which enable reasoning over video content to answer complex natural language queries. To solve this issue, we rely on the progressive construction of a text-based memory by a video captioner operating on shorter chunks of the video, where spatio-temporal modeling is computationally feasible. We explore ways to improve the quality of the activity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video captions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to other information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene descriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding system relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer questions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the video into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more accurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we incorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA VLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the space of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we have successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action and scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning pipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks. Our model, controllable hybrid captioner, can alternate between different types of captions according to special input tokens that signals scene changes detected in the video.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text, yet they largely operate as reactive agents, responding only when directly prompted. This passivity creates an "awareness gap," limiting their potential as truly collaborative partners in dynamic human discussions. We introduce $\textit{DiscussLLM}$, a framework designed to bridge this gap by training models to proactively decide not just $\textit{what}$ to say, but critically, $\textit{when}$ to speak. Our primary contribution is a scalable two-stage data generation pipeline that synthesizes a large-scale dataset of realistic multi-turn human discussions. Each discussion is annotated with one of five intervention types (e.g., Factual Correction, Concept Definition) and contains an explicit conversational trigger where an AI intervention adds value. By training models to predict a special silent token when no intervention is needed, they learn to remain quiet until a helpful contribution can be made. We explore two architectural baselines: an integrated end-to-end model and a decoupled classifier-generator system optimized for low-latency inference. We evaluate these models on their ability to accurately time interventions and generate helpful responses, paving the way for more situationally aware and proactive conversational AI.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern app store recommender systems struggle with multiple-category apps, as traditional taxonomies fail to capture overlapping semantics, leading to suboptimal personalization. We propose PCR-CA (Parallel Codebook Representations with Contrastive Alignment), an end-to-end framework for improved CTR prediction. PCR-CA first extracts compact multimodal embeddings from app text, then introduces a Parallel Codebook VQ-AE module that learns discrete semantic representations across multiple codebooks in parallel -- unlike hierarchical residual quantization (RQ-VAE). This design enables independent encoding of diverse aspects (e.g., gameplay, art style), better modeling multiple-category semantics. To bridge semantic and collaborative signals, we employ a contrastive alignment loss at both the user and item levels, enhancing representation learning for long-tail items. Additionally, a dual-attention fusion mechanism combines ID-based and semantic features to capture user interests, especially for long-tail apps. Experiments on a large-scale dataset show PCR-CA achieves a +0.76% AUC improvement over strong baselines, with +2.15% AUC gains for long-tail apps. Online A/B testing further validates our approach, showing a +10.52% lift in CTR and a +16.30% improvement in CVR, demonstrating PCR-CA's effectiveness in real-world deployment. The new framework has now been fully deployed on the Microsoft Store.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work focuses on Hierarchical Inference (HI) in edge intelligence systems, where a compact Local-ML model on an end-device works in conjunction with a high-accuracy Remote-ML model on an edge-server. HI aims to reduce latency, improve accuracy, and lower bandwidth usage by first using the Local-ML model for inference and offloading to the Remote-ML only when the local inference is likely incorrect. A critical challenge in HI is estimating the likelihood of the local inference being incorrect, especially when data distributions and offloading costs change over time -- a problem we term Hierarchical Inference Learning (HIL). We introduce a novel approach to HIL by modeling the probability of correct inference by the Local-ML as an increasing function of the model's confidence measure, a structure motivated by empirical observations but previously unexploited. We propose two policies, HI-LCB and HI-LCB-lite, based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) framework. We demonstrate that both policies achieve order-optimal regret of $O(\log T)$, a significant improvement over existing HIL policies with $O(T^{2/3})$ regret guarantees. Notably, HI-LCB-lite has an $O(1)$ per-sample computational complexity, making it well-suited for deployment on devices with severe resource limitations. Simulations using real-world datasets confirm that our policies outperform existing state-of-the-art HIL methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a crucial role in network security defense. However, a significant challenge for IDS in training detection models is the shortage of adequately labeled malicious samples. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel semi-supervised framework \textbf{GANGRL-LLM}, which integrates Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance malicious code generation and SQL Injection (SQLi) detection capabilities in few-sample learning scenarios. Specifically, our framework adopts a collaborative training paradigm where: (1) the GAN-based discriminator improves malicious pattern recognition through adversarial learning with generated samples and limited real samples; and (2) the LLM-based generator refines the quality of malicious code synthesis using reward signals from the discriminator. The experimental results demonstrate that even with a limited number of labeled samples, our training framework is highly effective in enhancing both malicious code generation and detection capabilities. This dual enhancement capability offers a promising solution for developing adaptive defense systems capable of countering evolving cyber threats.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> User simulation is increasingly vital to develop and evaluate recommender systems (RSs). While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising avenues to simulate user behavior, they often struggle with the absence of specific domain alignment required for RSs and the efficiency demands of large-scale simulation. A vast yet underutilized resource for enhancing this alignment is the extensive user feedback inherent in RSs. However, directly leveraging such feedback presents two significant challenges. First, user feedback in RSs is often ambiguous and noisy, which negatively impacts effective preference alignment. Second, the massive volume of feedback largely hinders the efficiency of preference alignment, necessitating an efficient filtering mechanism to identify more informative samples. To overcome these hurdles, we introduce a novel data construction framework that leverages user feedback in RSs with advanced LLM capabilities to generate high-quality simulation data. Our framework unfolds in two key phases: (1) employing LLMs to generate cognitive decision-making processes on constructed simulation samples, reducing ambiguity in raw user feedback; (2) data distillation based on uncertainty estimation and behavior sampling to filter challenging yet denoised simulation samples. Accordingly, we fine-tune lightweight LLMs, as user simulators, using such high-quality dataset with corresponding decision-making processes. Extensive experiments verify that our framework significantly boosts the alignment with human preferences and in-domain reasoning capabilities of fine-tuned LLMs, and provides more insightful and interpretable signals when interacting with RSs. We believe our work will advance the RS community and offer valuable insights for broader human-centric AI research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces a vision of confidential prompting: securing user prompts from untrusted, cloud-hosted large language model (LLM) provider while preserving model confidentiality, output invariance, and compute efficiency. As a first step toward this vision, we present Obfuscated Secure Partitioned Decoding (OSPD), a system built on two key innovations. First, Secure Partitioned Decoding (SPD) isolates user prompts within per-user processes residing in a confidential virtual machine (CVM) on the cloud, which are inaccessible for the cloud LLM while allowing it to generate tokens efficiently. Second, Prompt Obfuscation (PO) introduces a novel cryptographic technique that enhances SPD resilience against advanced prompt reconstruction attacks. Together, these innovations ensure OSPD protects both prompt and model confidentiality while maintaining service functionality. OSPD enables practical, privacy-preserving cloud-hosted LLM inference for sensitive applications, such as processing personal data, clinical records, and financial documents.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are shown to be vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks where adversarial prompts are designed to elicit harmful responses. While existing defenses effectively mitigate single-turn attacks by detecting and filtering unsafe inputs, they fail against multi-turn jailbreaks that exploit contextual drift over multiple interactions, gradually leading LLMs away from safe behavior. To address this challenge, we propose a safety steering framework grounded in safe control theory, ensuring invariant safety in multi-turn dialogues. Our approach models the dialogue with LLMs using state-space representations and introduces a novel neural barrier function (NBF) to detect and filter harmful queries emerging from evolving contexts proactively. Our method achieves invariant safety at each turn of dialogue by learning a safety predictor that accounts for adversarial queries, preventing potential context drift toward jailbreaks. Extensive experiments under multiple LLMs show that our NBF-based safety steering outperforms safety alignment, prompt-based steering and lightweight LLM guardrails baselines, offering stronger defenses against multi-turn jailbreaks while maintaining a better trade-off among safety, helpfulness and over-refusal.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scaling-law has guided the language model designing for past years, however, it is worth noting that the scaling laws of NLP cannot be directly applied to RecSys due to the following reasons: (1) The amount of training samples and model parameters is typically not the bottleneck for the model. Our recommendation system can generate over 50 billion user samples daily, and such a massive amount of training data can easily allow our model parameters to exceed 200 billion, surpassing many LLMs (about 100B). (2) To ensure the stability and robustness of the recommendation system, it is essential to control computational complexity FLOPs carefully. Considering the above differences with LLM, we can draw a conclusion that: for a RecSys model, compared to model parameters, the computational complexity FLOPs is a more expensive factor that requires careful control. In this paper, we propose our milestone work, MARM (Memory Augmented Recommendation Model), which explores a new cache scaling-laws successfully.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid evolution of e-commerce has exposed the limitations of traditional product retrieval systems in managing complex, multi-turn user interactions. Recent advances in multimodal generative retrieval -- particularly those leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as retrievers -- have shown promise. However, most existing methods are tailored to single-turn scenarios and struggle to model the evolving intent and iterative nature of multi-turn dialogues when applied naively. Concurrently, test-time scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for improving large language model (LLM) performance through iterative inference-time refinement. Yet, its effectiveness typically relies on two conditions: (1) a well-defined problem space (e.g., mathematical reasoning), and (2) the model's ability to self-correct -- conditions that are rarely met in conversational product search. In this setting, user queries are often ambiguous and evolving, and MLLMs alone have difficulty grounding responses in a fixed product corpus. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel framework that introduces test-time scaling into conversational multimodal product retrieval. Our approach builds on a generative retriever, further augmented with a test-time reranking (TTR) mechanism that improves retrieval accuracy and better aligns results with evolving user intent throughout the dialogue. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent improvements, with average gains of 14.5 points in MRR and 10.6 points in nDCG@1.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Fairness through Unawareness (FtU) describes the idea that discrimination against demographic groups can be avoided by not considering group membership in the decisions or predictions. This idea has long been criticized in the machine learning literature as not being sufficient to ensure fairness. In addition, the use of additional features is typically thought to increase the accuracy of the predictions for all groups, so that FtU is sometimes thought to be detrimental to all groups. In this paper, we show both theoretically and empirically that FtU can reduce algorithmic discrimination without necessarily reducing accuracy. We connect this insight with the literature on Model Multiplicity, to which we contribute with novel theoretical and empirical results. Furthermore, we illustrate how, in a real-life application, FtU can contribute to the deployment of more equitable policies without losing efficacy. Our findings suggest that FtU is worth considering in practical applications, particularly in high-risk scenarios, and that the use of protected attributes such as gender in predictive models should be accompanied by a clear and well-founded justification.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in agentic applications highlights the need for robust safety guard models. While content safety in English is well-studied, non-English languages lack similar advancements due to the high cost of collecting culturally aligned labeled datasets. We present CultureGuard, a novel solution for curating culturally aligned, high-quality safety datasets across multiple languages. Our approach introduces a four-stage synthetic data generation and filtering pipeline: cultural data segregation, cultural data adaptation, machine translation, and quality filtering. This pipeline enables the conversion and expansion of the Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-V2 English safety dataset into eight distinct languages: Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Thai, and Chinese. The resulting dataset, Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-Multilingual-v1, comprises 386,661 samples in 9 languages and facilitates the training of Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Safety-Guard-Multilingual-8B-v1 via LoRA-based fine-tuning. The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several multilingual content safety benchmarks. We also benchmark the latest open LLMs on multilingual safety and observe that these LLMs are more prone to give unsafe responses when prompted in non-English languages. This work represents a significant step toward closing the safety gap in multilingual LLMs by enabling the development of culturally aware safety guard models.

CMPhysBench is composed of more than 520 graduate-level meticulously curated questions covering both representative subfields and foundational theoretical frameworks of condensed matter physics, such as magnetism, superconductivity, strongly correlated systems, etc. To ensure a deep understanding of the problem-solving process,we focus exclusively on calculation problems, requiring LLMs to independently generate comprehensive solutions. Meanwhile, leveraging tree-based representations of expressions, we introduce the Scalable Expression Edit Distance (SEED) score, which provides fine-grained (non-binary) partial credit and yields a more accurate assessment of similarity between prediction and ground-truth. Our results show that even the best models, Grok-4, reach only 36 average SEED score and 28% accuracy on CMPhysBench, underscoring a significant capability gap, especially for this practical and frontier domain relative to traditional physics.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Judgmental forecasting employs human opinions to make predictions about future events, rather than exclusively historical data as in quantitative forecasting. When these opinions form an argumentative structure around forecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an argumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a property of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a forecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three evaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of enforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model (LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive with human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent predictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the practical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via crowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent intuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence property. This points to the need to integrate, within argumentation-based judgmental forecasting, mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions before obtaining group forecasting predictions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> AI-generated content technologies are widely used in content creation. However, current AIGC systems rely heavily on creators' inspiration, rarely generating truly user-personalized content. In real-world applications such as online advertising, a single product may have multiple selling points, with different users focusing on different features. This underscores the significant value of personalized, user-centric creative generation. Effective personalized content generation faces two main challenges: (1) accurately modeling user interests and integrating them into the content generation process while adhering to factual constraints, and (2) ensuring high efficiency and scalability to handle the massive user base in industrial scenarios. Additionally, the scarcity of personalized creative data in practice complicates model training, making data construction another key hurdle. We propose HLLM-Creator, a hierarchical LLM framework for efficient user interest modeling and personalized content generation. During inference, a combination of user clustering and a user-ad-matching-prediction based pruning strategy is employed to significantly enhance generation efficiency and reduce computational overhead, making the approach suitable for large-scale deployment. Moreover, we design a data construction pipeline based on chain-of-thought reasoning, which generates high-quality, user-specific creative titles and ensures factual consistency despite limited personalized data. This pipeline serves as a critical foundation for the effectiveness of our model. Extensive experiments on personalized title generation for Douyin Search Ads show the effectiveness of HLLM-Creator. Online A/B test shows a 0.476% increase on Adss, paving the way for more effective and efficient personalized generation in industrial scenarios.

  Important Issues: A Comparative Study of Human and LLMs in the Context of AGI</h2>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As general-purpose artificial intelligence systems become increasingly integrated into society and are used for information seeking, content generation, problem solving, textual analysis, coding, and running processes, it is crucial to assess their long-term impact on humans. This research explores the sentiment of large language models (LLMs) and humans toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) using a Likert-scale survey. Seven LLMs, including GPT-4 and Bard, were analyzed and compared with sentiment data from three independent human sample populations. Temporal variations in sentiment were also evaluated over three consecutive days. The results show a diversity in sentiment scores among LLMs, ranging from 3.32 to 4.12 out of 5. GPT-4 recorded the most positive sentiment toward AGI, while Bard leaned toward a neutral sentiment. In contrast, the human samples showed a lower average sentiment of 2.97. The analysis outlines potential conflicts of interest and biases in the sentiment formation of LLMs, and indicates that LLMs could subtly influence societal perceptions. To address the need for regulatory oversight and culturally grounded assessments of AI systems, we introduce the Societal AI Alignment and Sentiment Benchmark (SAAS-AI), which leverages multidimensional prompts and empirically validated societal value frameworks to evaluate language model outputs across temporal, model, and multilingual axes. This benchmark is designed to guide policymakers and AI agencies, including within frameworks such as the EU AI Act, by providing robust, actionable insights into AI alignment with human values, public sentiment, and ethical norms at both national and international levels. Future research should further refine the operationalization of the SAAS-AI benchmark and systematically evaluate its effectiveness through comprehensive empirical testing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Imagine decision-makers uploading data and, within minutes, receiving clear, actionable insights delivered straight to their fingertips. That is the promise of the AI Data Scientist, an autonomous Agent powered by large language models (LLMs) that closes the gap between evidence and action. Rather than simply writing code or responding to prompts, it reasons through questions, tests ideas, and delivers end-to-end insights at a pace far beyond traditional workflows. Guided by the scientific tenet of the hypothesis, this Agent uncovers explanatory patterns in data, evaluates their statistical significance, and uses them to inform predictive modeling. It then translates these results into recommendations that are both rigorous and accessible. At the core of the AI Data Scientist is a team of specialized LLM Subagents, each responsible for a distinct task such as data cleaning, statistical testing, validation, and plain-language communication. These Subagents write their own code, reason about causality, and identify when additional data is needed to support sound conclusions. Together, they achieve in minutes what might otherwise take days or weeks, enabling a new kind of interaction that makes deep data science both accessible and actionable.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in software engineering necessitates rigorous security evaluation of their generated code. However, existing benchmarks are inadequate, as they focus on isolated code snippets, employ unstable evaluation methods that lack reproducibility, and fail to connect the quality of input context with the security of the output. To address these gaps, we introduce A.S.E (AI Code Generation Security Evaluation), a benchmark for repository-level secure code generation. A.S.E constructs tasks from real-world repositories with documented CVEs, preserving full repository context like build systems and cross-file dependencies. Its reproducible, containerized evaluation framework uses expert-defined rules to provide stable, auditable assessments of security, build quality, and generation stability. Our evaluation of leading LLMs on A.S.E reveals three key findings: (1) Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieves the best overall performance. (2) The security gap between proprietary and open-source models is narrow; Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct attains the top security score. (3) Concise, ``fast-thinking'' decoding strategies consistently outperform complex, ``slow-thinking'' reasoning for security patching.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Model (LLM)-based passage expansion has shown promise for enhancing first-stage retrieval, but often underperforms with dense retrievers due to semantic drift and misalignment with their pretrained semantic space. Beyond this, only a portion of a passage is typically relevant to a query, while the rest introduces noise--an issue compounded by chunking techniques that break coreference continuity. We propose Coreference-Linked Augmentation for Passage Retrieval (CLAP), a lightweight LLM-based expansion framework that segments passages into coherent chunks, resolves coreference chains, and generates localized pseudo-queries aligned with dense retriever representations. A simple fusion of global topical signals and fine-grained subtopic signals achieves robust performance across domains. CLAP yields consistent gains even as retriever strength increases, enabling dense retrievers to match or surpass second-stage rankers such as BM25 + MonoT5-3B, with up to 20.68% absolute nDCG@10 improvement. These improvements are especially notable in out-of-domain settings, where conventional LLM-based expansion methods relying on domain knowledge often falter. CLAP instead adopts a logic-centric pipeline that enables robust, domain-agnostic generalization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of multi-step reasoning tasks. Recent work suggests that LLMs may perform planning - selecting a future target token in advance and generating intermediate tokens that lead towards it - rather than merely improvising one token at a time. However, existing studies assume fixed planning horizons and often focus on single prompts or narrow domains. To distinguish planning from improvisation across models and tasks, we present formal and causally grounded criteria for detecting planning and operationalize them as a semi-automated annotation pipeline. We apply this pipeline to both base and instruction-tuned Gemma-2-2B models on the MBPP code generation benchmark and a poem generation task where Claude 3.5 Haiku was previously shown to plan. Our findings show that planning is not universal: unlike Haiku, Gemma-2-2B solves the same poem generation task through improvisation, and on MBPP it switches between planning and improvisation across similar tasks and even successive token predictions. We further show that instruction tuning refines existing planning behaviors in the base model rather than creating them from scratch. Together, these studies provide a reproducible and scalable foundation for mechanistic studies of planning in LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present a case study evaluating large language models (LLMs) with 128K-token context windows on a technical question answering (QA) task. Our benchmark is built on a user manual for an agricultural machine, available in English, French, and German. It simulates a cross-lingual information retrieval scenario where questions are posed in English against all three language versions of the manual. The evaluation focuses on realistic "needle-in-a-haystack" challenges and includes unanswerable questions to test for hallucinations. We compare nine long-context LLMs using direct prompting against three Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategies (keyword, semantic, hybrid), with an LLM-as-a-judge for evaluation. Our findings for this specific manual show that Hybrid RAG consistently outperforms direct long-context prompting. Models like Gemini 2.5 Flash and the smaller Qwen 2.5 7B achieve high accuracy (over 85%) across all languages with RAG. This paper contributes a detailed analysis of LLM performance in a specialized industrial domain and an open framework for similar evaluations, highlighting practical trade-offs and challenges.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper investigates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in formulating and solving decision-making problems using mathematical programming. We first conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of recent literature to assess how well LLMs understand, structure, and solve optimization problems across domains. The analysis is guided by critical review questions focusing on learning approaches, dataset designs, evaluation metrics, and prompting strategies. Our systematic evidence is complemented by targeted experiments designed to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in automatically generating optimization models for problems in computer networks. Using a newly constructed dataset, we apply three prompting strategies: Act-as-expert, chain-of-thought, and self-consistency, and evaluate the obtained outputs based on optimality gap, token-level F1 score, and compilation accuracy. Results show promising progress in LLMs' ability to parse natural language and represent symbolic formulations, but also reveal key limitations in accuracy, scalability, and interpretability. These empirical gaps motivate several future research directions, including structured datasets, domain-specific fine-tuning, hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches, modular multi-agent architectures, and dynamic retrieval via chain-of-RAGs. This paper contributes a structured roadmap for advancing LLM capabilities in mathematical programming.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models have demonstrated remarkable versatility across a wide range of natural language processing tasks and domains. One such task is Named Entity Recognition (NER), which involves identifying and classifying proper names in text, such as people, organizations, locations, dates, and other specific entities. NER plays a crucial role in extracting information from unstructured textual data, enabling downstream applications such as information retrieval from unstructured text.   Traditionally, NER is addressed using supervised machine learning approaches, which require large amounts of annotated training data. However, historical texts present a unique challenge, as the annotated datasets are often scarce or nonexistent, due to the high cost and expertise required for manual labeling. In addition, the variability and noise inherent in historical language, such as inconsistent spelling and archaic vocabulary, further complicate the development of reliable NER systems for these sources.   In this study, we explore the feasibility of applying LLMs to NER in historical documents using zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, which require little to no task-specific training data. Our experiments, conducted on the HIPE-2022 (Identifying Historical People, Places and other Entities) dataset, show that LLMs can achieve reasonably strong performance on NER tasks in this setting. While their performance falls short of fully supervised models trained on domain-specific annotations, the results are nevertheless promising. These findings suggest that LLMs offer a viable and efficient alternative for information extraction in low-resource or historically significant corpora, where traditional supervised methods are infeasible.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Genetic Improvement (GI) of software automatically creates alternative software versions that are improved according to certain properties of interests (e.g., running-time). Search-based GI excels at navigating large program spaces, but operates primarily at the syntactic level. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer semantic-aware edits, yet lack goal-directed feedback and control (which is instead a strength of GI). As such, we propose the investigation of a new research line on AI-powered GI aimed at incorporating semantic aware search. We take a first step at it by augmenting GI with the use of automated clustering of LLM edits. We provide initial empirical evidence that our proposal, dubbed PatchCat, allows us to automatically and effectively categorize LLM-suggested patches. PatchCat identified 18 different types of software patches and categorized newly suggested patches with high accuracy. It also enabled detecting NoOp edits in advance and, prospectively, to skip test suite execution to save resources in many cases. These results, coupled with the fact that PatchCat works with small, local LLMs, are a promising step toward interpretable, efficient, and green GI. We outline a rich agenda of future work and call for the community to join our vision of building a principled understanding of LLM-driven mutations, guiding the GI search process with semantic signals.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As the global shift toward transportation electrification has accelerated, capacity planning for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure has become a critical challenge in the development of low-carbon urban energy systems. This study proposes the first demand-driven, multi-objective planning model for optimizing city-scale capacity allocation of EV charging infrastructure. The model employs a bottom-up approach to estimate charging demand differentiated by vehicle type-battery electric vehicles (BEVs), extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs), and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Chongqing, a rapidly expanding EV hub in China with a strong industrial base, supportive policies, and diverse urban morphologies, is selected as the case study. The results show that (1) monthly EV electricity consumption in Chongqing rose from 18.9 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in June 2022 to 57.5 GWh in December 2024, with associated carbon emissions increasing from 9.9 kilotons of carbon dioxide (ktCO2) to 30 ktCO2, driven primarily by BEVs; (2) 181,622 additional charging piles were installed between 2022 and 2024, concentrated in densely populated areas, reflecting a demand-responsive strategy that prioritizes population density over geographic coverage; and (3) between 2025 and 2030, EV electricity demand is projected to reach 1940 GWh, with the number of charging piles exceeding 1.4 million, and charging demand from EREVs and PHEVs expected to overtake BEVs later in the period. While Chongqing serves as the pilot area, the proposed planning platform is adaptable for application in cities worldwide, enabling cross-regional comparisons under diverse socio-economic, geographic, and policy conditions. Overall, this work offers policymakers a versatile tool to support sustainable, cost-effective EV infrastructure deployment aligned with low-carbon electrification targets in the transportation sector.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, stand out remarkable conversational abilities, enabling them to engage in dynamic and contextually relevant dialogues across a wide range of topics. However, given a long conversation, these chatbots fail to recall past information and tend to generate inconsistent responses. To address this, we propose to recursively generate summaries/ memory using large language models (LLMs) to enhance long-term memory ability. Specifically, our method first stimulates LLMs to memorize small dialogue contexts and then recursively produce new memory using previous memory and following contexts. Finally, the chatbot can easily generate a highly consistent response with the help of the latest memory. We evaluate our method on both open and closed LLMs, and the experiments on the widely-used public dataset show that our method can generate more consistent responses in a long-context conversation. Also, we show that our strategy could nicely complement both long-context (e.g., 8K and 16K) and retrieval-enhanced LLMs, bringing further long-term dialogue performance. Notably, our method is a potential solution to enable the LLM to model the extremely long context. The code and scripts are released.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems remains a core challenge of natural language processing (NLP), further complicated by the rise of large language models (LLMs) that aims to be general-purpose. Recently, large language models as judges (LLJs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional metrics, but their validity remains underexplored. This position paper argues that the current enthusiasm around LLJs may be premature, as their adoption has outpaced rigorous scrutiny of their reliability and validity as evaluators. Drawing on measurement theory from the social sciences, we identify and critically assess four core assumptions underlying the use of LLJs: their ability to act as proxies for human judgment, their capabilities as evaluators, their scalability, and their cost-effectiveness. We examine how each of these assumptions may be challenged by the inherent limitations of LLMs, LLJs, or current practices in NLG evaluation. To ground our analysis, we explore three applications of LLJs: text summarization, data annotation, and safety alignment. Finally, we highlight the need for more responsible evaluation practices in LLJs evaluation, to ensure that their growing role in the field supports, rather than undermines, progress in NLG.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple clients while preserving data privacy by keeping local datasets on-device. In this work, we address FL settings where clients may behave adversarially, exhibiting Byzantine attacks, while the central server is trusted and equipped with a reference dataset. We propose FedGreed, a resilient aggregation strategy for federated learning that does not require any assumptions about the fraction of adversarial participants. FedGreed orders clients' local model updates based on their loss metrics evaluated against a trusted dataset on the server and greedily selects a subset of clients whose models exhibit the minimal evaluation loss. Unlike many existing approaches, our method is designed to operate reliably under heterogeneous (non-IID) data distributions, which are prevalent in real-world deployments. FedGreed exhibits convergence guarantees and bounded optimality gaps under strong adversarial behavior. Experimental evaluations on MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms standard and robust federated learning baselines, such as Mean, Trimmed Mean, Median, Krum, and Multi-Krum, in the majority of adversarial scenarios considered, including label flipping and Gaussian noise injection attacks. All experiments were conducted using the Flower federated learning framework.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> User queries in real-world recommendation systems often combine structured constraints (e.g., category, attributes) with unstructured preferences (e.g., product descriptions or reviews). We introduce HyST (Hybrid retrieval over Semi-structured Tabular data), a hybrid retrieval framework that combines LLM-powered structured filtering with semantic embedding search to support complex information needs over semi-structured tabular data. HyST extracts attribute-level constraints from natural language using large language models (LLMs) and applies them as metadata filters, while processing the remaining unstructured query components via embedding-based retrieval. Experiments on a semi-structured benchmark show that HyST consistently outperforms tradtional baselines, highlighting the importance of structured filtering in improving retrieval precision, offering a scalable and accurate solution for real-world user queries.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large-scale models have exhibited remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, including automated medical services and intelligent customer support. However, as most large models are trained on single-modality corpora, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal signals remains a significant challenge. Current research often focuses on designing task-specific or scenario-specific tuning strategies, which limits the scalability and versatility. To address this limitation, we propose a unified framework that concurrently handles multiple tasks and modalities. In this framework, all modalities and tasks are represented as unified tokens and trained using a single, consistent approach. To enable efficient multitask processing, we introduce a novel tuning strategy termed neural tuning, inspired by the concept of sparse distributed representation in the human brain, where only specific subsets of neurons are activated for each task. Furthermore, to advance research in multimodal and multitask learning, we present a new benchmark, MMUD, which includes samples annotated with multiple task labels spanning reasoning segmentation, referring segmentation, image captioning, and text-to-image generation. By applying neural tuning to pretrained large models on the MMUD benchmark, we demonstrate the ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously in a streamlined and efficient manner. All models, code, and datasets will be released publicly upon publication, fostering further research and innovation in this field.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The proliferation of misinformation in digital platforms reveals the limitations of traditional detection methods, which mostly rely on static classification and fail to capture the intricate process of real-world fact-checking. Despite advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that enhance automated reasoning, their application to misinformation detection remains hindered by issues of logical inconsistency and superficial verification. In response, we introduce Debate-to-Detect (D2D), a novel Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework that reformulates misinformation detection as a structured adversarial debate. Inspired by fact-checking workflows, D2D assigns domain-specific profiles to each agent and orchestrates a five-stage debate process, including Opening Statement, Rebuttal, Free Debate, Closing Statement, and Judgment. To transcend traditional binary classification, D2D introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanism that assesses each claim across five distinct dimensions: Factuality, Source Reliability, Reasoning Quality, Clarity, and Ethics. Experiments with GPT-4o on two datasets demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods, and the case study highlight D2D's capability to iteratively refine evidence while improving decision transparency, representing a substantial advancement towards interpretable misinformation detection. The code will be released publicly after the official publication.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Real-world data, such as news articles, social media posts, and chatbot conversations, is inherently dynamic and non-stationary, presenting significant challenges for constructing real-time structured representations through knowledge graphs (KGs). Relation Extraction (RE), a fundamental component of KG creation, often struggles to adapt to evolving data when traditional models rely on static, outdated datasets. Continual Relation Extraction (CRE) methods tackle this issue by incrementally learning new relations while preserving previously acquired knowledge. This study investigates the application of pre-trained language models (PLMs), specifically large language models (LLMs), to CRE, with a focus on leveraging memory replay to address catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate decoder-only models (eg, Mistral-7B and Llama2-7B) and encoder-decoder models (eg, Flan-T5 Base) on the TACRED and FewRel datasets. Task-incremental fine-tuning of LLMs demonstrates superior performance over earlier approaches using encoder-only models like BERT on TACRED, excelling in seen-task accuracy and overall performance (measured by whole and average accuracy), particularly with the Mistral and Flan-T5 models. Results on FewRel are similarly promising, achieving second place in whole and average accuracy metrics. This work underscores critical factors in knowledge transfer, language model architecture, and KG completeness, advancing CRE with LLMs and memory replay for dynamic, real-time relation extraction.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Machine learning models for text classification are trained to predict a class for a given text. To do this, training and validation samples must be prepared: a set of texts is collected, and each text is assigned a class. These classes are usually assigned by human annotators with different expertise levels, depending on the specific classification task. Collecting such samples from scratch is labor-intensive because it requires finding specialists and compensating them for their work; moreover, the number of available specialists is limited, and their productivity is constrained by human factors. While it may not be too resource-intensive to collect samples once, the ongoing need to retrain models (especially in incremental learning pipelines) to address data drift (also called model drift) makes the data collection process crucial and costly over the model's entire lifecycle. This paper proposes several approaches to replace human annotators with Large Language Models (LLMs) to test classifier predictions for correctness, helping ensure model quality and support high-quality incremental learning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Code cloning is frequently observed in software development, often leading to a variety of maintenance and security issues. While substantial research has been conducted on code cloning in traditional software, to the best of my knowledge, there is a lack of studies on cloning in VR software that consider its unique nature, particularly the presence of numerous serialized files in conjunction with the source code. In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale quantitative empirical analysis of software clones in 345 open-source VR projects, using the NiCad detector for source code clone detection and large language models (LLMs) for identifying serialized file clones. Our study leads to a number of insights into cloning phenomena in VR software, guided by seven carefully formulated research questions. These findings, along with their implications, are anticipated to provide useful guidance for both researchers and software developers within the VR field.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision language model (VLM)-based mobile agents show great potential for assisting users in performing instruction-driven tasks. However, these agents typically struggle with personalized instructions -- those containing ambiguous, user-specific context -- a challenge that has been largely overlooked in previous research. In this paper, we define personalized instructions and introduce PerInstruct, a novel human-annotated dataset covering diverse personalized instructions across various mobile scenarios. Furthermore, given the limited personalization capabilities of existing mobile agents, we propose PerPilot, a plug-and-play framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that enables mobile agents to autonomously perceive, understand, and execute personalized user instructions. PerPilot identifies personalized elements and autonomously completes instructions via two complementary approaches: memory-based retrieval and reasoning-based exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that PerPilot effectively handles personalized tasks with minimal user intervention and progressively improves its performance with continued use, underscoring the importance of personalization-aware reasoning for next-generation mobile agents.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Autonomous planetary exploration missions are critically dependent on real-time, accurate environmental perception for navigation and hazard avoidance. However, deploying deep learning models on the resource-constrained computational hardware of planetary exploration platforms remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces the Adaptive Quantized Planetary Crater Detection System (AQ-PCDSys), a novel framework specifically engineered for real-time, onboard deployment in the computationally constrained environments of space exploration missions. AQ-PCDSys synergistically integrates a Quantized Neural Network (QNN) architecture, trained using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), with an Adaptive Multi-Sensor Fusion (AMF) module. The QNN architecture significantly optimizes model size and inference latency suitable for real-time onboard deployment in space exploration missions, while preserving high accuracy. The AMF module intelligently fuses data from Optical Imagery (OI) and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) at the feature level, utilizing an Adaptive Weighting Mechanism (AWM) to dynamically prioritize the most relevant and reliable sensor modality based on planetary ambient conditions. This approach enhances detection robustness across diverse planetary landscapes. Paired with Multi-Scale Detection Heads specifically designed for robust and efficient detection of craters across a wide range of sizes, AQ-PCDSys provides a computationally efficient, reliable and accurate solution for planetary crater detection, a critical capability for enabling the next generation of autonomous planetary landing, navigation, and scientific exploration.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The ultimate goal of code agents is to solve complex tasks autonomously. Although large language models (LLMs) have made substantial progress in code generation, real-world tasks typically demand full-fledged code repositories rather than simple scripts. Building such repositories from scratch remains a major challenge. Fortunately, GitHub hosts a vast, evolving collection of open-source repositories, which developers frequently reuse as modular components for complex tasks. Yet, existing frameworks like OpenHands and SWE-Agent still struggle to effectively leverage these valuable resources. Relying solely on README files provides insufficient guidance, and deeper exploration reveals two core obstacles: overwhelming information and tangled dependencies of repositories, both constrained by the limited context windows of current LLMs. To tackle these issues, we propose RepoMaster, an autonomous agent framework designed to explore and reuse GitHub repositories for solving complex tasks. For efficient understanding, RepoMaster constructs function-call graphs, module-dependency graphs, and hierarchical code trees to identify essential components, providing only identified core elements to the LLMs rather than the entire repository. During autonomous execution, it progressively explores related components using our exploration tools and prunes information to optimize context usage. Evaluated on the adjusted MLE-bench, RepoMaster achieves a 110% relative boost in valid submissions over the strongest baseline OpenHands. On our newly released GitTaskBench, RepoMaster lifts the task-pass rate from 40.7% to 62.9% while reducing token usage by 95%. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available at https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/RepoMaster.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present the design and initial testing of a low-frequency radio telescope prototype developed for the CANTAR (Colombian Antarctic Telescope for 21-cm Absorption during Reionization) experiment. Operating from 100 to 200 MHz, the system integrates a blade dipole antenna inspired by the EDGES high-band design with a software-defined radio (SDR) receiver. We report simulations of antenna impedance and beam chromaticity, along with SDR performance tests (Limenet Mini, Ettus E310, USRP2920). A dual-stage low-noise amplifier reduces system temperature, enabling foreground-sensitive observations. Radiometric estimates suggest sub-mK sensitivity is achievable with 1000 h of integration. This prototype forms part of Colombia's emerging infrastructure for 21-cm cosmology, with deployments planned in low-RFI sites in the Colombian Andes and Antarctica.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm for Adaptive Large Language Model (LLM) agents that eliminates the need for fine-tuning the underlying LLMs. Existing approaches are often either rigid, relying on static, handcrafted reflection workflows, or computationally intensive, requiring gradient updates of LLM model parameters. In contrast, our method enables low-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning. We formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP), equipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past experiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or non-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental feedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is achieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent model in the deep research setting, namely \emph{Memento}, which attains top-1 on GAIA validation ($87.88\%$ Pass@$3$) and $79.40\%$ on the test set. It reaches $66.6\%$ F1 and $80.4\%$ PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art training-based method, while case-based memory adds $4.7\%$ to $9.6\%$ absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks. Our approach offers a scalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of continuous, real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing machine learning towards open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite the advancements made in Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs), like text Large Language Models (LLMs), they have limitations in addressing questions that require real-time information or are knowledge-intensive. Indiscriminately adopting Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques is an effective yet expensive way to enable models to answer queries beyond their knowledge scopes. To mitigate the dependence on retrieval and simultaneously maintain, or even improve, the performance benefits provided by retrieval, we propose a method to detect the knowledge boundary of VLLMs, allowing for more efficient use of techniques like RAG. Specifically, we propose a method with two variants that fine-tune a VLLM on an automatically constructed dataset for boundary identification. Experimental results on various types of Visual Question Answering datasets show that our method successfully depicts a VLLM's knowledge boundary, based on which we are able to reduce indiscriminate retrieval while maintaining or improving the performance. In addition, we show that the knowledge boundary identified by our method for one VLLM can be used as a surrogate boundary for other VLLMs. Code will be released at https://github.com/Chord-Chen-30/VLLM-KnowledgeBoundary

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Algorithmic discovery has traditionally relied on human ingenuity and extensive experimentation. Here we investigate whether a prominent scientific computing algorithm, the Kalman Filter, can be discovered through an automated, data-driven, evolutionary process that relies on Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) and Large Language Models (LLM). We evaluate the contributions of both modalities (CGP and LLM) in discovering the Kalman filter under varying conditions. Our results demonstrate that our framework of CGP and LLM-assisted evolution converges to near-optimal solutions when Kalman optimality assumptions hold. When these assumptions are violated, our framework evolves interpretable alternatives that outperform the Kalman filter. These results demonstrate that combining evolutionary algorithms and generative models for interpretable, data-driven synthesis of simple computational modules is a potent approach for algorithmic discovery in scientific computing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> ACL configuration is essential for managing network flow reachability, yet its complexity grows significantly with topologies and pre-existing rules. To carry out ACL configuration, the operator needs to (1) understand the new configuration policies or intents and translate them into concrete ACL rules, (2) check and resolve any conflicts between the new and existing rules, and (3) deploy them across the network. Existing systems rely heavily on manual efforts for these tasks, especially for the first two, which are tedious, error-prone, and impractical to scale.   We propose Xumi to tackle this problem. Leveraging LLMs with domain knowledge of the target network, Xumi automatically and accurately translates the natural language intents into complete ACL rules to reduce operators' manual efforts. Xumi then detects all potential conflicts between new and existing rules and generates resolved intents for deployment with operators' guidance, and finally identifies the best deployment plan that minimizes the rule additions while satisfying all intents. Evaluation shows that Xumi accelerates the entire configuration pipeline by over 10x compared to current practices, addresses O(100) conflicting ACLs and reduces rule additions by ~40% in modern cloud network.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The development and application of large language models (LLM) have demonstrated that foundational models can be utilized to solve a wide array of tasks. However, their performance in multi-agent path finding (MAPF) tasks has been less than satisfactory, with only a few studies exploring this area. MAPF is a complex problem requiring both planning and multi-agent coordination. To improve the performance of LLM in MAPF tasks, we propose a novel framework, LLM-NAR, which leverages neural algorithmic reasoners (NAR) to inform LLM for MAPF. LLM-NAR consists of three key components: an LLM for MAPF, a pre-trained graph neural network-based NAR, and a cross-attention mechanism. This is the first work to propose using a neural algorithmic reasoner to integrate GNNs with the map information for MAPF, thereby guiding LLM to achieve superior performance. LLM-NAR can be easily adapted to various LLM models. Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing LLM-based approaches in solving MAPF problems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose a unified Transformer-based architecture for wireless signal processing tasks, offering a low-latency, task-adaptive alternative to conventional receiver pipelines. Unlike traditional modular designs, our model integrates channel estimation, interpolation, and demapping into a single, compact attention-driven architecture designed for real-time deployment. The model's structure allows dynamic adaptation to diverse output formats by simply modifying the final projection layer, enabling consistent reuse across receiver subsystems. Experimental results demonstrate strong generalization to varying user counts, modulation schemes, and pilot configurations, while satisfying latency constraints imposed by practical systems. The architecture is evaluated across three core use cases: (1) an End-to-End Receiver, which replaces the entire baseband processing pipeline from pilot symbols to bit-level decisions; (2) Channel Frequency Interpolation, implemented and tested within a 3GPP-compliant OAI+Aerial system; and (3) Channel Estimation, where the model infers full-band channel responses from sparse pilot observations. In all cases, our approach outperforms classical baselines in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. This work presents a deployable, data-driven alternative to hand-engineered PHY-layer blocks, and lays the foundation for intelligent, software-defined signal processing in next-generation wireless communication systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) excel in speed and adaptability across various reasoning tasks, but they often struggle when strict logic or constraint enforcement is required. In contrast, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are specifically designed for complex, step-by-step reasoning, although they come with significant computational costs and slower inference times. To address these trade-offs, we employ and generalize the SOFAI (Slow and Fast AI) cognitive architecture into SOFAI-LM, which coordinates a fast LLM with a slower but more powerful LRM through metacognition. The metacognitive module actively monitors the LLM's performance and provides targeted, iterative feedback with relevant examples. This enables the LLM to progressively refine its solutions without requiring the need for additional model fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on graph coloring and code debugging problems demonstrate that our feedback-driven approach significantly enhances the problem-solving capabilities of the LLM. In many instances, it achieves performance levels that match or even exceed those of standalone LRMs while requiring considerably less time. Additionally, when the LLM and feedback mechanism alone are insufficient, we engage the LRM by providing appropriate information collected during the LLM's feedback loop, tailored to the specific characteristics of the problem domain and leads to improved overall performance. Evaluations on two contrasting domains: graph coloring, requiring globally consistent solutions, and code debugging, demanding localized fixes, demonstrate that SOFAI-LM enables LLMs to match or outperform standalone LRMs in accuracy while maintaining significantly lower inference time.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) take sequences of subwords as input, requiring them to effective compose subword representations into meaningful word-level representations. In this paper, we present a comprehensive set of experiments to probe how LLMs compose subword information, focusing on three key aspects: structural similarity, semantic decomposability, and form retention. Our analysis of the experiments suggests that these five LLM families can be classified into three distinct groups, likely reflecting difference in their underlying composition strategies. Specifically, we observe (i) three distinct patterns in the evolution of structural similarity between subword compositions and whole-word representations across layers; (ii) great performance when probing layer by layer their sensitivity to semantic decompositionality; and (iii) three distinct patterns when probing sensitivity to formal features, e.g., character sequence length. These findings provide valuable insights into the compositional dynamics of LLMs and highlight different compositional pattens in how LLMs encode and integrate subword information.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Debiasing techniques such as SentDebias aim to reduce bias in large language models (LLMs). Previous studies have evaluated their cross-lingual transferability by directly applying these methods to LLM representations, revealing their limited effectiveness across languages. In this work, we therefore propose to perform debiasing in a joint latent space rather than directly on LLM representations. We construct a well-aligned cross-lingual latent space using an autoencoder trained on parallel TED talk scripts. Our experiments with Aya-expanse and two debiasing techniques across four languages (English, French, German, Dutch) demonstrate that a) autoencoders effectively construct a well-aligned cross-lingual latent space, and b) applying debiasing techniques in the learned cross-lingual latent space significantly improves both the overall debiasing performance and cross-lingual transferability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Intersectionality has profoundly influenced research and political action by revealing how interconnected systems of privilege and oppression influence lived experiences, yet its integration into algorithmic fairness research remains limited. Existing approaches often rely on single-axis or formal subgroup frameworks that risk oversimplifying social realities and neglecting structural inequalities. We propose Substantive Intersectional Algorithmic Fairness, extending Green's (2022) notion of substantive algorithmic fairness with insights from intersectional feminist theory. Building on this foundation, we introduce ten desiderata within the ROOF methodology to guide the design, assessment, and deployment of algorithmic systems in ways that address systemic inequities while mitigating harms to intersectionally marginalized communities. Rather than prescribing fixed operationalizations, these desiderata encourage reflection on assumptions of neutrality, the use of protected attributes, the inclusion of multiply marginalized groups, and enhancing algorithmic systems' potential. Our approach emphasizes that fairness cannot be separated from social context, and that in some cases, principled non-deployment may be necessary. By bridging computational and social science perspectives, we provide actionable guidance for more equitable, inclusive, and context-sensitive intersectional algorithmic practices.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Theory of Mind (ToM)-the ability to reason about the mental states of oneself and others-is a cornerstone of human social intelligence. As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily life, understanding their ability to interpret and respond to human mental states is crucial for enabling effective interactions. In this paper, we review LLMs' ToM capabilities by analyzing both evaluation benchmarks and enhancement strategies. For evaluation, we focus on recently proposed and widely used story-based benchmarks. For enhancement, we provide an in-depth analysis of recent methods aimed at improving LLMs' ToM abilities. Furthermore, we outline promising directions for future research to further advance these capabilities and better adapt LLMs to more realistic and diverse scenarios. Our survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers interested in evaluating and advancing LLMs' ToM capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Digital twin (DT) technology is rapidly becoming essential for smart city ecosystems, enabling real-time synchronisation and autonomous decision-making across physical and digital domains. However, as DTs take active roles in control loops, securely binding them to their physical counterparts in dynamic and adversarial environments remains a significant challenge. Existing authentication solutions either rely on static trust models, require centralised authorities, or fail to provide live and verifiable physical-digital binding, making them unsuitable for latency-sensitive and distributed deployments. To address this gap, we introduce PRZK-Bind, a lightweight and decentralised authentication protocol that combines Schnorr-based zero-knowledge proofs with elliptic curve cryptography to establish secure, real-time correspondence between physical entities and DTs without relying on pre-shared secrets. Simulation results show that PRZK-Bind significantly improves performance, offering up to 4.5 times lower latency and 4 times reduced energy consumption compared to cryptography-heavy baselines, while maintaining false acceptance rates more than 10 times lower. These findings highlight its suitability for future smart city deployments requiring efficient, resilient, and trustworthy DT authentication.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We live in a rich and varied acoustic world, which is experienced by individuals or communities as a soundscape. Computational auditory scene analysis, disentangling acoustic scenes by detecting and classifying events, focuses on objective attributes of sounds, such as their category and temporal characteristics, ignoring their effects on people, such as the emotions they evoke within a context. To fill this gap, we propose the affective soundscape captioning (ASSC) task, which enables automated soundscape analysis, thus avoiding labour-intensive subjective ratings and surveys in conventional methods. With soundscape captioning, context-aware descriptions are generated for soundscape by capturing the acoustic scenes (ASs), audio events (AEs) information, and the corresponding human affective qualities (AQs). To this end, we propose an automatic soundscape captioner (SoundSCaper) system composed of an acoustic model, i.e. SoundAQnet, and a large language model (LLM). SoundAQnet simultaneously models multi-scale information about ASs, AEs, and perceived AQs, while the LLM describes the soundscape with captions by parsing the information captured with SoundAQnet. SoundSCaper is assessed by two juries of 32 people. In expert evaluation, the average score of SoundSCaper-generated captions is slightly lower than that of two soundscape experts on the evaluation set D1 and the external mixed dataset D2, but not statistically significant. In layperson evaluation, SoundSCaper outperforms soundscape experts in several metrics. In addition to human evaluation, compared to other automated audio captioning systems with and without LLM, SoundSCaper performs better on the ASSC task in several NLP-based metrics. Overall, SoundSCaper performs well in human subjective evaluation and various objective captioning metrics, and the generated captions are comparable to those annotated by soundscape experts.

Academic literature on the deployment of AI has mostly focused on the risks and harms that result from the use of AI. We introduce Fabric, a publicly available repository of deployed AI use cases to outline their governance mechanisms. Through semi-structured interviews with practitioners, we collect an initial set of 20 AI use cases. In addition, we co-design diagrams of the AI workflow with the practitioners. We discuss the oversight mechanisms and guardrails used in practice to safeguard AI use. The Fabric repository includes visual diagrams of AI use cases and descriptions of the deployed systems. Using the repository, we surface gaps in governance and find common patterns in human oversight of deployed AI systems. We intend for Fabric to serve as an extendable, evolving tool for researchers to study the effectiveness of AI governance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The financial domain poses unique challenges for knowledge graph (KG) construction at scale due to the complexity and regulatory nature of financial documents. Despite the critical importance of structured financial knowledge, the field lacks large-scale, open-source datasets capturing rich semantic relationships from corporate disclosures. We introduce an open-source, large-scale financial knowledge graph dataset built from the latest annual SEC 10-K filings of all S and P 100 companies - a comprehensive resource designed to catalyze research in financial AI. We propose a robust and generalizable knowledge graph (KG) construction framework that integrates intelligent document parsing, table-aware chunking, and schema-guided iterative extraction with a reflection-driven feedback loop. Our system incorporates a comprehensive evaluation pipeline, combining rule-based checks, statistical validation, and LLM-as-a-Judge assessments to holistically measure extraction quality. We support three extraction modes - single-pass, multi-pass, and reflection-agent-based - allowing flexible trade-offs between efficiency, accuracy, and reliability based on user requirements. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the reflection-agent-based mode consistently achieves the best balance, attaining a 64.8 percent compliance score against all rule-based policies (CheckRules) and outperforming baseline methods (single-pass and multi-pass) across key metrics such as precision, comprehensiveness, and relevance in LLM-guided evaluations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Unified Structured Knowledge Reasoning (USKR) aims to answer natural language questions by using structured sources such as tables, databases, and knowledge graphs in a unified way. Existing USKR methods rely on task-specific strategies or bespoke representations, which hinder their ability to dismantle barriers between different SKR tasks, thereby constraining their overall performance in cross-task scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{Pandora}, a novel USKR framework that addresses the limitations of existing methods by leveraging two key innovations. First, we propose a code-based unified knowledge representation using \textsc{Python}'s \textsc{Pandas} API, which aligns seamlessly with the pre-training of LLMs. This representation facilitates a cohesive approach to handling different structured knowledge sources. Building on this foundation, we employ knowledge transfer to bolster the unified reasoning process of LLMs by automatically building cross-task memory. By adaptively correcting reasoning using feedback from code execution, \textsc{Pandora} showcases impressive unified reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on six widely used benchmarks across three SKR tasks demonstrate that \textsc{Pandora} outperforms existing unified reasoning frameworks and competes effectively with task-specific methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Question answering (QA) is an actively studied topic, being a core natural language processing (NLP) task that needs to be addressed before achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the lack of QA datasets in specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce MedQARo, the first large-scale medical QA benchmark in Romanian, alongside a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). We construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 102,646 QA pairs related to cancer patients. The questions regard medical case summaries of 1,011 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered correctly. MedQARo is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who spent a total of about 2,100 work hours to generate the QA pairs. We experiment with four LLMs from distinct families of models on MedQARo. Each model is employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one based on supervised fine-tuning. Our results show that fine-tuned models significantly outperform their zero-shot counterparts, clearly indicating that pretrained models fail to generalize on MedQARo. Our findings demonstrate the importance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for reliable clinical QA in Romanian. We publicly release our dataset and code at https://github.com/ana-rogoz/MedQARo.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While powerful, large language models (LLMs) present significant fine-tuning challenges due to their size. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA provide solutions, yet suffer from critical optimizer inefficiencies; notably basis redundancy in LoRA's $B$ matrix when using AdamW, which fundamentally limits performance. We address this by optimizing the $B$ matrix on the Stiefel manifold, imposing explicit orthogonality constraints that achieve near-perfect orthogonality and full effective rank. This geometric approach dramatically enhances parameter efficiency and representational capacity. Our Stiefel optimizer consistently outperforms AdamW across benchmarks with both LoRA and DoRA, demonstrating that geometric constraints are the key to unlocking LoRA's full potential for effective LLM fine-tuning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Visual speech recognition (VSR) systems decode spoken words from an input sequence using only the video data. Practical applications of such systems include medical assistance as well as human-machine interactions. A VSR system is typically employed in a complementary role in cases where the audio is corrupt or not available. In order to accurately predict the spoken words, these architectures often rely on deep neural networks in order to extract meaningful representations from the input sequence. While deep architectures achieve impressive recognition performance, relying on such models incurs significant computation costs which translates into increased resource demands in terms of hardware requirements and results in limited applicability in real-world scenarios where resources might be constrained. This factor prevents wider adoption and deployment of speech recognition systems in more practical applications. In this work, we aim to alleviate this issue by developing architectures for VSR that have low hardware costs. Following the standard two-network design paradigm, where one network handles visual feature extraction and another one utilizes the extracted features to classify the entire sequence, we develop lightweight end-to-end architectures by first benchmarking efficient models from the image classification literature, and then adopting lightweight block designs in a temporal convolution network backbone. We create several unified models with low resource requirements but strong recognition performance. Experiments on the largest public database for English words demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our developed models. Code and trained models will be made publicly available.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated success across many benchmarks. However, they still exhibit limitations in long-context scenarios, primarily due to their short effective context length, quadratic computational complexity, and high memory overhead when processing lengthy inputs. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a novel context compression pipeline, called Intermediate Layer Retrieval (ILRe), which determines one intermediate decoder layer offline, encodes context by streaming chunked prefill only up to that layer, and recalls tokens by the attention scores between the input query and full key cache in that specified layer. In particular, we propose a multi-pooling kernels allocating strategy in the token recalling process to maintain the completeness of semantics. Our approach not only reduces the prefilling complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L)$, but also achieves performance comparable to or better than the full context in the long context scenarios. Without additional post training or operator development, ILRe can process a single $1M$ tokens request in less than half a minute (speedup $\approx 180\times$) and scores RULER-$1M$ benchmark of $\approx 79.8$ with model Llama-3.1-UltraLong-8B-1M-Instruct on a Huawei Ascend 910B NPU.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Hidden LLM prompts have appeared in online documents with increasing frequency. Their goal is to trigger indirect prompt injection attacks while remaining undetected from human oversight, to manipulate LLM-powered automated document processing systems, against applications as diverse as r\'esum\'e screeners through to academic peer review processes. Detecting hidden LLM prompts is therefore important for ensuring trust in AI-assisted human decision making.   This paper presents the first principled approach to hidden LLM prompt detection in structured documents. We implement our approach in a prototype tool called PhantomLint. We evaluate PhantomLint against a corpus of 3,402 documents, including both PDF and HTML documents, and covering academic paper preprints, CVs, theses and more. We find that our approach is generally applicable against a wide range of methods for hiding LLM prompts from visual inspection, has a very low false positive rate (approx. 0.092%), is practically useful for detecting hidden LLM prompts in real documents, while achieving acceptable performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rise of Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs), two dominant approaches have emerged for speech processing: discrete tokens and continuous features. Each approach has demonstrated strong capabilities in audio-related processing tasks. However, the performance gap between these two paradigms has not been thoroughly explored. To address this gap, we present a fair comparison of self-supervised learning (SSL)-based discrete and continuous features under the same experimental settings. We evaluate their performance across six spoken language understanding-related tasks using both small and large-scale LLMs (Qwen1.5-0.5B and Llama3.1-8B). We further conduct in-depth analyses, including efficient comparison, SSL layer analysis, LLM layer analysis, and robustness comparison. Our findings reveal that continuous features generally outperform discrete tokens in various tasks. Each speech processing method exhibits distinct characteristics and patterns in how it learns and processes speech information. We hope our results will provide valuable insights to advance spoken language understanding in SpeechLLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, yet they face inherent limitations such as constrained parametric knowledge and high retraining costs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) augments the generation process by retrieving externally stored knowledge absent from the models internal parameters. However, RAG methods face challenges such as information loss and redundant retrievals during multi-round queries, accompanying the difficulties in precisely characterizing knowledge gaps for complex tasks. To address these problems, we propose Retrieval Feedback and Memory Retrieval Augmented Generation(RFM-RAG), which transforms the stateless retrieval of previous methods into stateful continuous knowledge management by constructing a dynamic evidence pool. Specifically, our method generates refined queries describing the models knowledge gaps using relational triples from questions and evidence from the dynamic evidence pool; Retrieves critical external knowledge to iteratively update this evidence pool; Employs a R-Feedback Model to evaluate evidence completeness until convergence. Compared to traditional RAG methods, our approach enables persistent storage of retrieved passages and effectively distills key information from passages to construct clearly new queries. Experiments on three public QA benchmarks demonstrate that RFM-RAG outperforms previous methods and improves overall system accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As queries in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines powered by large language models (LLMs) become increasingly complex and diverse, dense retrieval models have demonstrated strong performance in semantic matching. Nevertheless, they often struggle with fine-grained retrieval tasks, where precise keyword alignment and span-level localization are required, even in cases with high lexical overlap that would intuitively suggest easier retrieval. To systematically evaluate this limitation, we introduce two targeted tasks, keyword retrieval and part-of-passage retrieval, designed to simulate practical fine-grained scenarios. Motivated by these observations, we propose LexSemBridge, a unified framework that enhances dense query representations through fine-grained, input-aware vector modulation. LexSemBridge constructs latent enhancement vectors from input tokens using three paradigms: Statistical (SLR), Learned (LLR), and Contextual (CLR), and integrates them with dense embeddings via element-wise interaction. Theoretically, we show that this modulation preserves the semantic direction while selectively amplifying discriminative dimensions. LexSemBridge operates as a plug-in without modifying the backbone encoder and naturally extends to both text and vision modalities. Extensive experiments across semantic and fine-grained retrieval tasks validate the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid evolution of Android malware poses significant challenges to the maintenance and security of mobile applications (apps). Traditional detection techniques often struggle to keep pace with emerging malware variants that employ advanced tactics such as code obfuscation and dynamic behavior triggering. One major limitation of these approaches is their inability to localize malicious payloads at a fine-grained level, hindering precise understanding of malicious behavior. This gap in understanding makes the design of effective and targeted mitigation strategies difficult, leaving mobile apps vulnerable to continuously evolving threats.   To address this gap, we propose MalLoc, a novel approach that leverages the code understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to localize malicious payloads at a fine-grained level within Android malware. Our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using LLMs for this task, highlighting the potential of MalLoc to enhance precision and interpretability in malware analysis. This work advances beyond traditional detection and classification by enabling deeper insights into behavior-level malicious logic and opens new directions for research, including dynamic modeling of localized threats and targeted countermeasure development.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Two-stage Learning-to-Defer (L2D) enables optimal task delegation by assigning each input to either a fixed main model or one of several offline experts, supporting reliable decision-making in complex, multi-agent environments. However, existing L2D frameworks assume clean inputs and are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that can manipulate query allocation--causing costly misrouting or expert overload. We present the first comprehensive study of adversarial robustness in two-stage L2D systems. We introduce two novel attack strategie--untargeted and targeted--which respectively disrupt optimal allocations or force queries to specific agents. To defend against such threats, we propose SARD, a convex learning algorithm built on a family of surrogate losses that are provably Bayes-consistent and $(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{G})$-consistent. These guarantees hold across classification, regression, and multi-task settings. Empirical results demonstrate that SARD significantly improves robustness under adversarial attacks while maintaining strong clean performance, marking a critical step toward secure and trustworthy L2D deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with energy harvesting (EH) are expected to play a vital role in intelligent 6G systems, especially in industrial sensing and control, where continuous operation and sustainable energy use are critical. Given limited energy resources, WSNs must operate efficiently to ensure long-term performance. Their deployment, however, is challenged by dynamic environments where EH conditions, network scale, and traffic rates change over time. In this work, we address system dynamics that yield different learning tasks, where decision variables remain fixed but strategies vary, as well as learning domains, where both decision space and strategies evolve. To handle such scenarios, we propose a cross-domain lifelong reinforcement learning (CD-L2RL) framework for energy-efficient WSN design. Our CD-L2RL algorithm leverages prior experience to accelerate adaptation across tasks and domains. Unlike conventional approaches based on Markov decision processes or Lyapunov optimization, which assume relatively stable environments, our solution achieves rapid policy adaptation by reusing knowledge from past tasks and domains to ensure continuous operations. We validate the approach through extensive simulations under diverse conditions. Results show that our method improves adaptation speed by up to 35% over standard reinforcement learning and up to 70% over Lyapunov-based optimization, while also increasing total harvested energy. These findings highlight the strong potential of CD-L2RL for deployment in dynamic 6G WSNs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As single-center computing approaches power constraints, decentralized training is becoming essential. Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) but faces challenges in heterogeneous distributed environments due to its tightly-coupled sampling-learning alternation. We propose HeteroRL, an asynchronous RL architecture that decouples rollout sampling from parameter learning, enabling robust deployment across geographically distributed nodes under network delays. We identify that latency-induced KL divergence causes importance sampling failure due to high variance. To address this, we propose Group Expectation Policy Optimization (GEPO), which reduces importance weight variance through a refined sampling mechanism. Theoretically, GEPO achieves exponential variance reduction. Experiments show it maintains superior stability over methods like GRPO, with less than 3% performance degradation under 1800-second delays, demonstrating strong potential for decentralized RL in heterogeneous networks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Industrial and medical anomaly detection faces critical challenges from data scarcity and prohibitive annotation costs, particularly in evolving manufacturing and healthcare settings. To address this, we propose CoZAD, a novel zero-shot anomaly detection framework that integrates soft confident learning with meta-learning and contrastive feature representation. Unlike traditional confident learning that discards uncertain samples, our method assigns confidence-based weights to all training data, preserving boundary information while emphasizing prototypical normal patterns. The framework quantifies data uncertainty through IQR-based thresholding and model uncertainty via covariance based regularization within a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning. Contrastive learning creates discriminative feature spaces where normal patterns form compact clusters, enabling rapid domain adaptation. Comprehensive evaluation across 10 datasets spanning industrial and medical domains demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods on 6 out of 7 industrial benchmarks with notable improvements on texture-rich datasets (99.2% I-AUROC on DTD-Synthetic, 97.2% on BTAD) and pixellevel localization (96.3% P-AUROC on MVTec-AD). The framework eliminates dependence on vision-language alignments or model ensembles, making it valuable for resourceconstrained environments requiring rapid deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurate and fast performance prediction for dataflow-based accelerators is vital for efficient hardware design and design space exploration, yet existing methods struggle to generalize across architectures, applications, and input-dependent control flows. We present LLMulator, a progressive numeric modeling framework leveraging the program semantic knowledge of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for robust, hardware- and application-aware prediction. Our numeric model treats performance values as categorical token sequences, enabling range-agnostic estimates and confidence-aware predictions for unseen applications. To handle input-dependent control flows, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based dynamic calibration method, reducing cycle prediction error by 9.7% over static models and converging to 11.2% error after a few iterations. For cross-hardware generalization, we develop a progressive data augmentation strategy that generates diverse datasets covering multi-level dataflow structures, memory parameters, and loop mapping primitives, significantly boosting prediction accuracy across architectures and configurations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Leveraging their advanced capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate vast application potential in video games--from dynamic scene generation and intelligent NPC interactions to adaptive opponents--replacing or enhancing traditional game mechanics. However, LLMs' trustworthiness in this application has not been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we reveal that the models' inherent social biases can directly damage game balance in real-world gaming environments. To this end, we present FairGamer, the first bias evaluation Benchmark for LLMs in video game scenarios, featuring six tasks and a novel metrics ${D_lstd}$. It covers three key scenarios in games where LLMs' social biases are particularly likely to manifest: Serving as Non-Player Characters, Interacting as Competitive Opponents, and Generating Game Scenes. FairGamer utilizes both reality-grounded and fully fictional game content, covering a variety of video game genres. Experiments reveal: (1) Decision biases directly cause game balance degradation, with Grok-3 (average ${D_lstd}$ score=0.431) exhibiting the most severe degradation; (2) LLMs demonstrate isomorphic social/cultural biases toward both real and virtual world content, suggesting their biases nature may stem from inherent model characteristics. These findings expose critical reliability gaps in LLMs' gaming applications. Our code and data are available at anonymous GitHub https://github.com/Anonymous999-xxx/FairGamer .

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantum random access memory (QRAM) is a critical primitive for quantum algorithms that require data lookup in superposition, but its lack of fault tolerance poses a major obstacle to practical deployment. Error filtration (EF) has been proposed as a hardware-efficient alternative to error correction, capable of suppressing incoherent noise without encoding overhead. However, its performance in realistic QRAM systems with moderate fidelity has remained unclear, as existing analyses rely on asymptotic approximations and numerical simulations have been limited to small sizes. We address this gap using a new simulator for bucket-brigade (BB) QRAM that combines sparse state encoding with a noise-aware pruning algorithm. This framework provides full quantum state access and scales efficiently, enabling us to probe EF performance in size and noise regimes far beyond previous studies. Our simulations reveal suppression anomalies at high noise levels or large address sizes, where post-selection probability fundamentally constrains EF scaling. Incorporating this effect, we refine EF theory into near-deterministic criteria linking base infidelity to achievable suppression, thereby delineating the regime in which EF yields progressive improvement. Beyond refining EF, we quantitatively characterize the runtime and memory costs of our noisy BB QRAM simulator, achieving simulations of systems with 20 layers using less than 1 GB of memory. This efficiency is what enables us to probe parameter regimes beyond previous work and to establish the simulator as a practical, ``fine-print'' analysis tool for assessing QRAM as a quantum resource.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Backdoor-based fingerprinting has emerged as an effective technique for tracing the ownership of large language models. However, in real-world deployment scenarios, developers often instantiate multiple downstream models from a shared base model, and applying fingerprinting to each variant individually incurs prohibitive computational overhead. While inheritance-based approaches -- where fingerprints are embedded into the base model and expected to persist through fine-tuning -- appear attractive, they suffer from three key limitations: late-stage fingerprinting, fingerprint instability, and interference with downstream adaptation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel mechanism called the Fingerprint Vector. Our method first embeds a fingerprint into the base model via backdoor-based fine-tuning, then extracts a task-specific parameter delta as a fingerprint vector by computing the difference between the fingerprinted and clean models. This vector can be directly added to any structurally compatible downstream model, allowing the fingerprint to be transferred post hoc without additional fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that Fingerprint Vector achieves comparable or superior performance to direct injection across key desiderata. It maintains strong effectiveness across diverse model architectures as well as mainstream downstream variants within the same family. It also preserves harmlessness and robustness in most cases. Even when slight robustness degradation is observed, the impact remains within acceptable bounds and is outweighed by the scalability benefits of our approach.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work elaborates on a High performance computing (HPC) architecture based on Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) [1] for deploying heterogeneous Large Language Models (LLMs) into a scalable inference engine. Dynamic resource scheduling and seamless integration of containerized microservices have been leveraged herein to manage CPU, GPU, and memory allocations efficiently in multi-node clusters. Extensive experiments, using Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B parameters) [2] and Llama 3.1 (8B and 70B) [3], probe throughput, latency, and concurrency and show that small models can handle up to 128 concurrent requests at sub-50 ms latency, while for larger models, saturation happens with as few as two concurrent users, with a latency of more than 2 seconds. This architecture includes Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interfaces (REST APIs) [4] endpoints for single and bulk inferences, as well as advanced workflows such as multi-step "tribunal" refinement. Experimental results confirm minimal overhead from container and scheduling activities and show that the approach scales reliably both for batch and interactive settings. We further illustrate real-world scenarios, including the deployment of chatbots with retrievalaugmented generation, which helps to demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of the architecture. The obtained results pave ways for significantly more efficient, responsive, and fault-tolerant LLM inference on large-scale HPC infrastructures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The widespread adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has significantly advanced environmental monitoring (EM) by enabling cost-effective and scalable sensing solutions. Concurrently, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are introducing powerful tools for the efficient and accurate analysis of complex environmental data. However, current IoT platforms for environmental sensing are typically limited to a narrow set of sensors, preventing a comprehensive assessment of environmental conditions and lacking sufficient computational capabilities to support the deployment of advanced ML and AI algorithms on the edge. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a compact (17x38 mm2), multi-modal, MCU-based environmental IoT node integrating 11 sensors, including CO2 concentration, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), light intensity, UV radiation, pressure, temperature, humidity, visual sensing via an RGB camera, and precise geolocation through a GNSS module. It features GAP9, a parallel ultra-low-power system-on-chip, enabling real-time, energy-efficient edge processing of advanced ML models directly on-device. We implemented a YOLOv5-based occupancy detection pipeline (0.3 M parameters, 42 MOP per inference), demonstrating 42% energy savings over raw data streaming. Additionally, we present a smart indoor air quality (IAQ) monitoring setup that combines occupancy detection with adaptive sample rates, achieving operational times of up to 143 h on a single compact 600 mAh, 3.7 V battery. Our platform lays the groundwork for innovative applications such as predictive indoor IAQ, enabling efficient AI-driven on-edge forecasting for energy-efficient and autonomous, proactive pollution-mitigation control strategies

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large-scale models (LSMs) can be an effective framework for semantic representation and understanding, thereby providing a suitable tool for designing semantic communication (SC) systems. However, their direct deployment is often hindered by high computational complexity and resource requirements. In this paper, a novel robust knowledge distillation based semantic communication (RKD-SC) framework is proposed to enable efficient and \textcolor{black}{channel-noise-robust} LSM-powered SC. The framework addresses two key challenges: determining optimal compact model architectures and effectively transferring knowledge while maintaining robustness against channel noise. First, a knowledge distillation-based lightweight differentiable architecture search (KDL-DARTS) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm integrates knowledge distillation loss and a complexity penalty into the neural architecture search process to identify high-performance, lightweight semantic encoder architectures. Second, a novel two-stage robust knowledge distillation (RKD) algorithm is developed to transfer semantic capabilities from an LSM (teacher) to a compact encoder (student) and subsequently enhance system robustness. To further improve resilience to channel impairments, a channel-aware transformer (CAT) block is introduced as the channel codec, trained under diverse channel conditions with variable-length outputs. Extensive simulations on image classification tasks demonstrate that the RKD-SC framework significantly reduces model parameters while preserving a high degree of the teacher model's performance and exhibiting superior robustness compared to existing methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reasoning large language models (RLLMs), such as OpenAI-O3 and DeepSeek-R1, have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities by performing structured and multi-step reasoning. However, recent studies reveal that RLLMs often suffer from overthinking, i.e., producing unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains even for simple questions, leading to excessive token consumption and computational inefficiency. Interestingly, we observe that when processing multiple questions in batch mode, RLLMs exhibit more resource-efficient behavior by dynamically compressing reasoning steps for easier problems, due to implicit resource competition. Inspired by this, we propose Dynamic Reasoning Quota Allocation (DRQA), a novel method that transfers the benefits of resource competition from batch processing to single-question inference. Specifically, DRQA leverages batch-generated preference data and reinforcement learning to train the model to allocate reasoning resources adaptively. By encouraging the model to internalize a preference for responses that are both accurate and concise, DRQA enables it to generate concise answers for simple questions while retaining sufficient reasoning depth for more challenging ones. Extensive experiments on a wide range of mathematical and scientific reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DRQA significantly reduces token usage while maintaining, and in many cases improving, answer accuracy. By effectively mitigating the overthinking problem, DRQA offers a promising direction for more efficient and scalable deployment of RLLMs, and we hope it inspires further exploration into fine-grained control of reasoning behaviors.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to achieve impressive results for many reasoning-based NLP tasks, suggesting a degree of deductive reasoning capability. However, it remains unclear to which extent LLMs, in both informal and autoformalisation methods, are robust on logical deduction tasks. Moreover, while many LLM-based deduction methods have been proposed, a systematic study that analyses the impact of their design components is lacking. Addressing these two challenges, we propose the first study of the robustness of formal and informal LLM-based deductive reasoning methods. We devise a framework with two families of perturbations: adversarial noise and counterfactual statements, which jointly generate seven perturbed datasets. We organize the landscape of LLM reasoners according to their reasoning format, formalisation syntax, and feedback for error recovery. The results show that adversarial noise affects autoformalisation, while counterfactual statements influence all approaches. Detailed feedback does not improve overall accuracy despite reducing syntax errors, pointing to the challenge of LLM-based methods to self-correct effectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Robust alignment guardrails for large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly important with their widespread application. In contrast to previous studies, we demonstrate that inference-time activation interventions can bypass safety alignments and effectively steer model generations towards harmful AI coordination. Our method applies fine-grained interventions at specific attention heads, which we identify by probing each head in a simple binary choice task. We then show that interventions on these heads generalise to the open-ended generation setting, effectively circumventing safety guardrails. We demonstrate that intervening on a few attention heads is more effective than intervening on full layers or supervised fine-tuning. We further show that only a few example completions are needed to compute effective steering directions, which is an advantage over classical fine-tuning. We also demonstrate that applying interventions in the negative direction can prevent a common jailbreak attack. Our results suggest that, at the attention head level, activations encode fine-grained linearly separable behaviours. Practically, the approach offers a straightforward methodology to steer large language model behaviour, which could be extended to diverse domains beyond safety, requiring fine-grained control over the model output.
